Start right out with the sales. Sales for the quarter were pretty much on plan. We had a very good November, it was a little weaker in December, but you average it out, and look at the numbers from where we thought we would be starting the quarter. We really came right on plan and we stayed on our sequential trend pattern that we really started back in July.
So we’re pretty optimistic about numbers. Looking at our January numbers month-to-date at this point it appears when we report numbers in January, we will report a positive number, not a lot of growth, but right now it appears that we will have growth and any amount would be a real positive for our team here at Fastenal.
Jumping to the margin, we are a little disappointed with the margin where it came in at 49.9. Not really surprised because we did make a decision on the rebates to pullback. We understand where we are with that and that will be coming back in the first quarter, or starting to come back in the first quarter in throughout 2010.
There’s really three pieces to margin. The first one as I mentioned the rebates understood what happened there we just made a conscious decision to reduce our purchasing, and just basically work towards 2010 and growth in 2010. We’re comfortable that will come back.
Second one that hit was in 2010 was the deflation in the steel products, primarily the Fastenal products. We have seen the steel price is pretty much flat and down in summer and they’ve actually started rising through the last four months of the year. We anticipate continue in a little bit of inflation in steel is really hard to tell it has a lot to do with what happens with the economy and the world or mainly China right now, but right now we’re anticipating some inflation in steel and inflation or pricing as a year ago, but that won’t kick in until probably the second or third quarter as the product sells through, but that’s a positive for our margin.
In the third part of our margin is the POS, what the customers or what the storage use to charge and price their customers, that bottomed out in August we have seen positive trends in the POS margin every month since August we’re very optimistic. When you look at the margin, rebates, deflation positive in POS positive, we’re still very optimistic we’ll see improvement in each of the next three quarters.
From an expense standpoint, I think we did a really nice job. Our expenses were down 13.2% somewhat of a kick in the health insurance. Our health insurance jumped and the problem with health insurance expense, it’s one of the expenses you can’t manage short term. You set a program up for your employees and we set up a good reprogram for our employees and then you basically just wait for the claims to come in or the experience rating in the claims.
In the last half of the year, we saw our claims go up, but we have also been reading that there are other companies seeing the same thing. We’re not sure if it’s people rushing to get things done before changes in health insurance we’re analyzing it as we speak and helpfully will better information, but we don’t foresee this problem going forward into the new year, so we’re very confident we can lower that a little bit as we go into the New Year, but otherwise our expenses, I think our team did a very good job managing at the point they are.
Earnings, a little disappointing, we came off one point, but or $0.01, but that’s completely explain by the health insurance, that’s almost dollar for dollar there. A couple of other areas I want to touch on accounts receivable down 12.6% right where sales were. That’s one area and I said that in the last conference call, that I was worried going into the year with bankruptcies up and everything going on in the economy, but we did a nice job actually hanging on to our number, holding the days out flat to down a little bit in a difficult time and then the other one is inventory.
Our inventory is down 10% from the beginning of the year. If you take out the acquisition that we made in December, we’d actually be down almost exactly where sales were, so we did bring some inventory in with that acquisition and so they did a nice job on inventory. So overall that’s good.
So when I step back and I look at where we are as a company, starting out the New Year, starting out a new decade, how I feel about our positioning. I feel very good about sales. We’re going to start out with a positive trend and the comps get a little easier as we go on, so I’m very comfortable that we’re going to have good sales trends, not only year-over-year, but also sequentially.
Our margin is lower than we want it to be, but we understand the pieces, and there’s a lot of positive in that. Our headcount is right inline, if you look at where our FTE came in we’re basically from a relative related to sales, we’re almost where we started the year out, so we’re positioned very well. The expense structure, the accounts receivable and the inventory are all in great shape.
So when we look at the business, I say, what do we need to work on? We need to work on margin. We need to continue to work hard on growth and we need to make sure the other things that I just mentioned stay inline. So, I think we near a very good position to move forward as a company and get back on to our strategic plan of pathway to profit, that’s why I’m looking at the year, that’s why I’m communicating to our people internally and that should be in a good position.
With that, I’m going to turn it over to Dan. Dan has more information and I kept my brief today. Thank you.

I’m going to touch on a few items highlighted in our earnings release and then will turn over to Q-and-A after that. One item I want to tough is centered on page one discussion, about our end market, end full.
As we talked about our last call in the May timeframe, our manufacturing business appears to bottomed out and it has been improving sequentially every month since May, except for July and December, which we would expect a little bit of a drop off because of the holiday impact, but generally speaking the business has been improving mode since bottoming out in the May 2009 timeframe, manufacturing as you recall represents almost 50% of our sales.
On the construction piece, which is decide 25% of our sales that business has continued to weaken as we go through the year. Fortunately the manufacturing has been able to overshadow it through the second half of 2009. If I look at the remaining components of our end market, and I called them out individually on our press release this quarter, generally speaking those trends are all positive as we look through the second half of 2009 and I believe will remain positive as we go in to 2010.
A new piece that I added to the release this quarter, and hopefully for those of you who have had a chance to read it, it create more answers, a better understanding of our business, rather than a bunch of questions, but I’ll try to elaborate on what I’m really trying why I’m highlighting these point.
It really starts from the bottom of page one and continues on to page two, and what I laid out on page two is something that I have been looking at the entire year, as I try to understand really what was happening as we were going along through the year, because historically, when we talk internally at Fastenal, we always talk about kind of where we are in September, October timeframe, because the daily average in October, really sets us up in our mind for how the New Year is going to start, because historically, our daily average has been at or slightly positive to in January to the previous October,
So internally, we are setting our goals once we have the October numbers, because we really think we have the benchmark identified and as you can see in the table I laid out, in 1998 to 2003 and I choose this timeframe is a benchmark, because I believe it’s a timeframe and extended period was an industrial recessionary environment and provides a good basis for comparison and in that timeframe we would see January was again slightly positive in the previous October and then we would start claiming stair way in the New Year.
What you saw in 2009 is our January number wasn’t inline with the previous October. It dropped about 18.5% and what you saw was our sales when from positive to contraction in that timeframe as well. In February, March and April timeframe the erosion continue that a pretty steep clip and we were missing that sequential pattern that we enjoyed historically and then was the April timeframe.
This really started to change in our business in that while the sequential growth was in a strong as we would like, it was starting to get closure to that historical pattern and really since July we have been in position what we have been consistently beating the historical trend and are slowly claiming out of the whole that the economy put us in if you will during the first part of this year.
I think its important trend to understand, because it really servers to guide us as we look into the New Year and being a Midwest and in the account mix me a truly conservative person and so for me to come out and say something positive into the future is a pretty rare event, but when I look at the trends, as of last October, the trends would tell me and again, I’m looking in to 2010, based on where we are in October and I’m doing it based on these trend lines that I have laid out in our press release.
If I were to just plunk it down on a spreadsheet and say, okay if we’re 9-10 of a percent ahead of October. In January 2010, I would expect us to see positive growth and it would quantify to about 0.5% of positive growth and as Will mentioned earlier, we believe in the month of January we’ll see positive growth. So again we tend to be on that pattern which we really started on last July where our sequential numbers not only make sense but are making us more positive in our outlook to our future look in our business.
If I were to extend this out and look into 2010 and again, I’m merely taking the trend line based on our history, extending in to the future, I don’t know our visibility into the future is extremely limited due to the nature of our business, but I can look at history as a guide post. It would tell me, when we get in to the March, April timeframe. We are looking at double digit sales growth and if I were to truly anniversary the numbers, because of easing comps, as we get in deeper to the year.
When I look at out to July, if we were able to follow this past trend line, our sales growth in July, would just tip over would just eclipse 20%, 20.3% is wake up little to. I don’t honestly know if this will happen when I look at 2010, but it does makes me optimistic and bullish when I look at the years as far as our ability to continue to grow out of the pattern to grow out of the place we have been in when I look at 2009 and I believe for the year, this would provide us the ability to see growth that gets into the teens and only time will tell if these trends prove to be a good guide post to our future, or if they just prove to be just wrong, but I believe it gives us a positive by as we enter the New Year.
Will touched on earlier our active account growth and there is something that I think is important also to understand when we you look at our active accounts. Our active account growth was weaker in 2009 than we would like to see. Historically, we like to see our active account growth in the low double digits. So in that 11%, 12%, maybe 13% neighborhood and this year we have been in the single digits, but when I look at the data from history and I look at, what we would expect for frequency of account base.
One thing I do see that’s very distinct in our 2009 numbers is our frequency of existing customers. In other words, what percentages of our customers buy in any given month, because we have some customers that buy daily or weekly? We have some customers that buy monthly. We have some customers that might buy sporadically maybe they are buying every second, every third month.
We measure a lot of those statistics internally and provide that information to our store personnel, but when I look at the frequency factor of our customers, I see that in 2009, our frequency is off about 7%, so that damp things our active account number by about 7%, and, really serves to diminish what I believe is our true active account growth when I look at 2009, and again, what that does, it provides one more component to what gives me confidence when I look at our 2010 top line numbers.
Will touched earlier on gross margin, and I would eco his comment was tough for us to report 49.9% gross margin, because it was a barrier we really did not want to cross. That’s the negative news. The positive news is this, when you look at the decline, it was really when we looked at where we thought our vendor allowance and rebate programs would come in earlier in the year, they did come in weaker than we expected and track a little bit from the fourth quarter, when I look at gross margin, I really think of it in three distinct components.
One is structural, what is going on in the environment, internal and external, but primarily external that influences our number. The second one would be freight side, and the third would be just our transactional activity, in other words what’s happening at the point of sale level, what is happening from an importing level, or a direct purchase level. 
On the structural side, I see two things that are generally speaking have a positive by as going in to 2010 versus 2009, one would be the vendor allowance program which tend to be linked to the calendar year, so the program reset, and starting in January, I would expect the rebate we’re earning would improve relative to where it was in 2009, that won’t necessarily flow in to the P&L in the first quarter, because that better purchasing activity will be sitting in ending inventory at the end of the first quarter.
I would expect us to start seeing that improvement in the second quarter, and that’s one of the components to improvement in gross margin when I look at 2010. The second is what the point Will touched on in the last several months of the Europe, about the last four months, we have seen some inflationary trends, and having a slight inflation trend versus a marked deflation trend as a significant impact on our gross margin, because of the nature of how fact our inventory trends.
The second category I talked about on freight when I look at where we are at the start of 2010 versus 2009 and 2008 and I’ll go back two years, I believe the momentum we had in both of those previous two years we have still today and we continue to identify opportunities to improve our freight margin and so I see that is the positive by as going to New Year.
The final piece the transactional as Will mentioned that the margin we measure at our point to sale level, that margin bottomed out August ‘09 and we have been above that number since and we believe our day to day activities, our transactional activities we’ve been improve the pattern and since that low point August.
That the second component of our transactional is really our direct sourcing margin that we measure and that really is the fact that we’re able to source in volume and that had a negative by as to it in 2009 because of deflation, and again, I believe will have a positive by as to it in 2010 if the inflation patterns that we have seen in the last four months continue.
Finally on the next couple of points, on cash flow, as you see in our cash flow statement, our cash flow for the year was quite strong. The big drivers of the cash flow were the changes in working capital and accounts receivable and inventory that Will alluded to earlier, as a percentage of earnings, for every dollar of earnings we through off $1.66 of operating cash.
Last year that number was $0.93 on the dollar. Our long term number that we really laid out when we started to past way to profit, we feel we could be in a position to be at or slightly exceed $0.85 on the dollar. So, we feel very good about our performance on that in the last several years, since that profit started. When I look at free cash flow again, a very strong number, our capital expenditures came in quite a bit less than they were a year ago, as we expected.
As I mentioned in the conference call, I would expect the capital expenditures to drop again in 2010, because we are complete with our projects in Denton, Texas, and Indianapolis, Indiana and now are in a position to read the benefit of that hard work over the last several years. What this did is provided funding for two items that we did in the current year.
As in prior years, we were able to increase our regular dividend and our buyback, we did buyback some stock late in the year, we bought back about $41 million worth at $37 a share, so feel good about that at this point in time, and we’ll continue to look at buybacks in the future, and we’ll see how that plays out.
Finally, just to touch on a few things on the working capital identified on page nine of the release. As Will mentioned, accounts receivable we were down 12.5% inline with our sales, actually slightly better than our sales pattern and really what we did is identify a structural improvement and that structural improvement is, we have a lot of customers, and a lot of customers that buy relatively small amount and what happens, a lot of times with billing processes, is a lot of stuff gets caught in the chatter, and invoices.
We have most, generally speaking our customers are really fair with us on paying their bills, and what happens is the stuff that usually falls through the cracks, that stuff is inadvertent and we made some structural changes to our billing in 2010. I see that a great job of automating a lot of process emailing more invoices, faxing more invoices, and we just improved the structural collection patterns in our business.
Despite the fact that we had some negatives from the standpoint of some customer bankruptcies during the year, that continue to hangover a little bit from the standpoint of increasing our days out, but the other stuff more than offset it.
On the inventory, as Will mentioned, were pleased with what we were able to accomplish in the year and it’s really an effort of everybody being on the same page and working to be smart about when we’re buying and constantly rebalancing our inventory, and really thinking about the components and challenging everybody, so very pleased with the team and what they were able to accomplish in 2009.
One last item I’ll touch on and then turn it over to the Q-and-A and that is as we disclosed we did a small acquisition late in the year. We acquired a business called Holo-Krome, we are very excited about this acquisition we think it fits in really well with our business, and quite frankly with our customers needs and we look forward to that business being a contributed to us in the future and we welcome the 92 employees in West Hartford, Connecticut to the Fastenal family.
With that I’ll turn it back over to the moderator for the Q-and-A.

Even when I look out to the summer and I look at, what I believe will be a good year for Fastenal and our ability to move back in to the pathway to profit mode, our sales in the summer will still be down 7% or 8%, and that’s, if those trend lines play out from where they were in 2008 and for us to get back on the pathway to profit, we need to get the top line moving.

The second piece, most of our employees in the company are paid on some type of bonus compensation and it’s really linked to our ability overtime to continually grow our earnings, and grow our return and so our compensation, our incentive compensation was off dramatically from what was year ago.
In the third piece, and quite frankly a smaller piece of the three I’m talking about, in, 2008 and really, 2006, 2007, 2008, nice increases to the amount of dollars that we contributed to our employee’s retirement plan, 401(k), and it’s a set formula that we do and spaced on a level of profitability.
We did not achieve that profitability in 2009, that target profitability, therefore, the payout on that was essentially eliminated and so when you look at 2010, that component of our cost structure will act in a very variable fashion. The other components of our cost structure want the fact that our sales growth, whether it strengthens or weakens, doesn’t influence things like occupancy. What influence these things like occupancy are, how many stores we open, what types of stores we open, what we agree to for rent and how do we manage that in the future for other expenses.

However, when I look at the inventory we need to add in 2010, I’m a firm believer that we’ve identified in excess of that amount of still surplus inventory that we can continue to rebalance out of our inventory as I look at 2010.
So I feel for the year, there’s a reasonable chance we can operate the year with very modest growth, and my goal is to hold it flat, and to me the only wild card in it is depending on how the inflation plays our and what that influence of the steel component, but if there’s a little bit of inflation and influences feel component, we’ll take that issue, as long as it’s mandible for us and our customers.

I believe that helped our fastener business, because we went from being I think, a really, really good fastener distributor to a great fastener distributor from the standpoint, we had great availability of product, a wide range of products at the local site, and we got better at it as the percentage of sales picked up a little bit.

Keep in mind that the store openings in a given year represent a relatively small piece of our sales in that year, and we have 2300 stores that have business that’s down. So we want to turn back on the energy of the Fastenal profit. We want to turn back on the ability for our folks to have a good 2010, a great 2011 and ‘12, and we believe these are the pieces and we believe in that scenario our shareholders will do quite well.

And thank you, everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2009 conference call. I'll start right out with the sales. Sales for the quarter were pretty much on plan. We had a very good November. It was a little weaker in December,",1060,"Thanks, Darin. And thank you, everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2009 conference call. I'll start right out with the sales. Sales for the quarter were pretty much on plan. We had a very good November. It was a little weaker in December, but we averaged it out and looked at the numbers from where we thought we would be starting the quarter. We really came right on plan. And we state in our sequential trend pattern that we've really started back in July. So we're pretty optimistic with our numbers. Looking at our January numbers, month-to-date, it appears that when we report numbers at this point, it appears when we report numbers in January, we will report a positive number. Not a lot of growth, but right now, it appears that we will have growth and any amount would be a real positive for our team here in Fastenal.Jumping to the margin, we were a little disappointed with the margin, where it came in at 49.9. Not really surprised, because we did make a decision on the rebates to pull back. We understand where we are with that, and that will be coming back in the first quarter, or starting to come back in the first quarter and throughout 2010. There's really three pieces to margin.  The first one, as i mentioned, the rebates. Understood what happened there, we just made a conscious decision to reduce our purchasing and just basically work towards 2010 and growth in 2010.  We're comfortable that will come back. Second one that hit us and 2010 was the deflation in the steel products, primarily the Fastenal products. We've seen the steel price is pretty much flattened out in the summer and they've actually started rising through the last four months of the year. We anticipate continual and a little bit of inflation in steel. It's really hard to tell. It has a lot to do with what happened with the economy in the world, or mainly, China right now. But right now, we're anticipating some inflation in steel and some inflation on our pricing as the year goes on. But that won't kick in until probably the second and third quarter, as the product sells through. But that's a positive for our margin.And the third part of our margin is the POS, what the customers or what the stores use to charge and price their customers. That bottomed out in August. We've seen positive trends in the POS margin every month since August. We're very optimistic. When you look at the margin, rebates positive, deflation positive and POS positive. We're still very optimistic we'll see improvement in each of the next three quarters.From an expense standpoint, I think we did a really nice job. Our expenses were down 13.2%. And in that, we had somewhat of a kick in the health insurance. Our health insurance jumped. And the problem with health insurance expense, it's one of the expenses you can't manage short-term. You set a program up for your employees, and we set up a good reprogram for our employees, then you basically just wait for the claims that are come in or the experience rating in the claims. In the last half of the year, we saw our claims go up. But we've also been reading that there are other companies seeing the same thing. We're not sure if it's people rushing to get things done before changes in health insurance. We're analyzing it as we speak. And hopefully, we'll have better information. But we don't perceive this problem going forward into the new year. So we're very confident we can lower that a little bit, as we go into the new year.  But otherwise, our expenses, I think our team did a good job managing with the point they are.  Earnings, little disappointing, we came off $0.01, but that's completely explained by the health-insurance that's almost dollar-per-dollar there. A couple of other areas I want to touch on, accounts receivable down 12.6%,  right were sales were. That's one area. And I said this in the last conference call, that I was worried going into the year with bankruptcies up and everything going on in the economy. But we did a nice job actually hanging onto our number, holding the days out flat to down a little bit in a difficult time. And then the other one is inventory. Our inventory is down 10% from the beginning of the year. If you take out the acquisition that we made in December, we actually be down almost exactly where sales were. We did bring some inventory in with that acquisition. And so they did a nice job on inventory. So overall, that's good. So when I step back, and I look at where we are as a company, starting out the new year, starting out a new decade, how do I feel about our positioning? I feel very good about sales. We are going to start it out with a positive trend, and the comps get a little easier as we go on. So I'm very comfortable that were going to have good sales trends, not only year-over-year but also sequentially. Our margin is lower than we want it to be, but we understand the pieces, and there's a lot of positive in that.Our headcount is right in line. If you look at where our FTE came in, we're basically from a relative related to sales, we're almost where we started the year out. So we're positioned very well.  The expense structure, the accounts receivable and the inventory are all in great shape. So when we look in the business, I say, ""What do we need to work on?"" We need to work on margin. We need to continue to work hard on growth. And we need to make sure that the other things that I just mentioned stay in line.So I think we're in a very good position to move forward as a company and get back on to our strategic plan and pathway to profit. That's why I'm looking at the year. That's why I'm communicating to our people internally. And that should be in a good position. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan has more information. I'll cut mine brief today. Thank you."

I'm going to touch on a few items highlighted on our earnings release. And then, we'll turn it over to Q&A after that. One item I want to touch on is centered on Page 1, discussion about our end market info. As we talked about our last call, in the May timeframe, our Manufacturing business appears to have bottomed out. And it's been improving sequentially every month since May except for July and December, which we would expect a little bit of a drop off because of the holiday impact. But generally speaking, the business has been in improving mode since bottoming out in the May 2009 timeframe.  Manufacturing, as we call, represents almost 50% of our sales. On the construction piece, which is just shy at 25% of our sales, that business has continued to weaken as we go through the year. Fortunately, the Manufacturing has been able to overshadow it through the second half of 2009. If I look at the remaining components of our end market, and I call them out individually on our press release this quarter, generally speaking those trends are all positive. As we look through the second half of 2009, I believe we'll remain positive as we go into 2010.A new piece that I added to the release this quarter, and hopefully, for those of you that have had a chance to read it, it created more answer -- a better understanding of our business rather than a bunch of questions. But I'll try to elaborate on what I'm really trying -- why I'm highlighting these points. And it really starts from the bottom of Page 1 and continues onto Page 2. And what I laid out on Page 2 is something that I've been looking at the entire year. As I try to understand, really what happened, what was happening as we were going along through the year. Because historically, when we talk internally at Fastenal, we always talk about kind of where we are in September, October timeframe. Because the daily average on October, really sets us up in our mind for how the new year is going to start. Because historically, our daily average has been at or slightly positive in January to the previous October. And so internally, we are setting our goals once we have the October numbers, because we really think we have the benchmark identified. And as you can see in the table I laid out, in 1998 to 2003 -- and I chose this timeframe as a benchmark, because I believe that it's a timeframe and extended period within an industrial recessionary environment and provides a good basis for a comparison. And in that timeframe, we would see January was again slightly positive than the previous October. And then we would start climbing the stairway in the new year. What you saw in 2009 is our January number wasn't in line with the previous October. It dropped about 18 1/2%. And what you saw was our sales went from positive to contraction in that timeframe as well.In the February, March and April timeframe, the erosion continued at a pretty steep cliff. And we were missing that sequential pattern that we've enjoyed historically. And then about the April timeframe, things really started to change in our business. And that while the sequential growth wasn't as strong as we would like, it was starting to get closer to that historical pattern. And really, since July, we've been in a position where we've been consistently beating the historical trend and are slowly climbing out of the hole that the economy put us in, if you will, during the first part of this year.And I think it's important trend to understand because it really serves to guide us, as we look into the new year. And being a Midwesterner and an accountant makes me a truly conservative person. And so for me to come out and say something positive into the future is a pretty rare event. But when I look at the trends as of last October, the trends would tell me we should be about and again, I'm looking into 2010, based on where are in October. And I'm doing it based on these trend lines that I've laid out in our pressure release. If I were to just punk it down on a spreadsheet, and say ""Okay, if we're nine-tenths of a percent ahead of October, in January of 2010, I would expect us to see positive growth, and it would quantify to about a half a percent of positive growth."" And as Will mentioned earlier, we believe in the month of January, we'll see positive growth. So again we tend to beyond that pattern we started on last July, where our sequential numbers not only makes sense but are making us more positive in our outlook towards future of our business.If I were to extend this out and look into 2010, and again, I'm nearly taking the trend line based on our history, extending into the future, I don't know what -- our visibility into the future extremely limited due to the nature of our business. But I can look at history as a guidepost. It would tell me when we get into the March, April timeframe, we are looking at double-digit sales growth. And if I were to truly anniversary the numbers, because of the easing comps as we get in deeper into the year, when I look out to July, if we were able to follow this past trend line, our sales growth in July would just tip over, would just eclipse 20.3% is like what I tell to [ph]. I don't honestly know if this will happen when I look at 2010, but it does make me optimistic and bullish when I look at the year as far as our ability to continue to grow out of the pattern, to grow out of the place we've been in when I look at 2009. And I believe for the year, this would provide us the ability to see growth that gets into the teens. And only time will tell if these trends prove to be a good guidepost to our future, or if they just prove to be just wrong. But I believe it gives us a positive bias as we enter the new year.Will touched on earlier our active account growth. And there's something I think is important also to understand when if you look at our active accounts. Our active account growth was weaker in 2009 than we would like to see.  Historically, we like to see our active account growth in the low-double digits. So in that 11%, 12% maybe 13% neighborhood. And in this year, we've been in the single digits. But when I look at the data from history, and I look at what we would expect for frequency of our account base, one thing I do see that's very distinct in our 2009 numbers is our frequency of existing customers. In other words, how many customers? What percentage of our customers buy in any given month? Because we have some customers that buy daily or weekly. We have some customers that buy monthly. We have some customers that might buy sporadically. Maybe they buy every second or every third month. We measure a lot of those statistics internally and provide that information to our store personnel. But when I look at the frequency factor of our customers, I see that in 2009, our frequency is off about 7%.  So that dampens our active account number by about 7% and really serves to diminish what I believe is our true active account growth when I look at 2009. And again, what that does, it provides one more component to what gives me confidence when I look at our 2010 comp line numbers. Will touched earlier on gross margin, and I would echo his comment. It was tough for us to have to report 49.9% gross margin because it was a barrier we really did not want to cross. That's the negative news. The positive news is this. When you look at the decline, it was really -- when we looked at where we thought our vendor allowances and rebate programs would come in earlier in the year, they like, did come in a lot weaker than we expected, and that trampled a little bit from the fourth quarter. When I look at gross margin, I really think of it in three distinct components.  One is structural, what's going on in the environment, internal and external, but primarily external that influences our number. The second one would be at freight side. And then the third would be just our transactional activity. Other words, what's happening at the point-of-sale level. What's happening from our ability to -- from the importing level or direct-purchase level. On the structural side, I see two things that are, generally speaking, have a positive bias going in 2010 versus 2009. One would be the vendor allowance program, which tend to be linked to the calendar year. So the programs reset, and starting in January, I would expect that the rebate we're earning would improve relative to where it was in 2009. That won't necessarily flow in the P&L in the first quarter, because that better purchasing activity will be sitting in any inventory at the end of the first quarter. But I would expect us to start seeing that improvement in the second quarter, and that's one of the components to improvement in gross margin when I look at 2010.The second is what the point Will touched on in the last several months of the year. About the last four months, we've seen some inflationary trends. And having a slight inflation trend versus a marked deflation trend has a significant impact on our gross margin, because of the nature of how fast our inventory turns.The second category I talked about on freight. When I look at where we are at the start of 2010 versus 2009 and 2008, I'll go back even two years. I believe the momentum we had in both of those previous two years, we have still today and we continue to identify opportunities to improve our freight margin. And so I see that as a positive bias going to the new year. The final piece, the transactional, as Will mentioned, the margin we measure at our point-of-sale level, that margin bottomed out in August '09, and we've been above that number since. And we believe our day-to-day activities, our transactional activities, we've improved the pattern since that low point August.The second component of our transactional is really our direct sourcing margin that we measured. And that really is -- the fact that we are able to source in volume. And that had a negative bias to it in 2009 because of deflation. And again, I believe we'll have a positive bias to it in 2010, if the inflation patterns that we've seen in the last several month, last four months continue. Finally, the next couple of points on cash flow. As you see in our cash flow statement, our cash flow for the year was quite strong. The big drivers of the cash flow were the changes in working capital, accounts receivable and inventory that Will alluded to earlier. As a percentage of earnings, for every dollar of earnings, we threw off $1.66 of operating cash. Last year, that number was $0.93 on the dollar. Our long-term numbers that we really laid out when we started the pathway profit, we felt we could be in a position to be at or slightly exceed $0.85 on the dollar. And so we feel very good about our performance from that in the last several years since the type of that [ph] profit started.When I look at free cash flow, again, a very strong number. Our capital expenditures came in quite a bit less than they were a year ago, as we expected. And as I mentioned in the conference call, I would expect the capital expenditures to drop again in 2010, because we are complete with our projects in Denton, Texas and Indianapolis, Indiana, and now are in the position to reap the benefit of that hard work over the last several years.What this did is that private funding for two items that we did in the current year. As in prior years, we were able to increase our regular dividend. And our buyback, we did buy back some stock late in the year. We bought back about $41 million worth at $37 a share. So feel good about that at this point in time. And then we'll continue to look at buybacks in the future. And we'll see how that plays out.Finally, just to touch on a few things on the working capital, identified on Page 9 of the release. As Will mentioned, accounts receivable, we're down 12.5%,  in line with our sales. Actually, slightly better than our sales pattern. And really what we did is identified a structural improvement. And that structural improvement is we have a lot of customers, and a lot of customers that buy relatively small amount. And what happens lot of times with billing processes is lot of stuff just caught in the chatter. And invoices -- generally speaking, our customers are really fair with us on paying their bills. And what happens is the stuff that you see falls to the cracks, these stuff is inadvertent.  And we made some structural changes to our billing in 2010. Our team did a great job of automating a lot of processes, e-mailing more invoices, faxing more invoices. And we just improved the structural collection patterns in our business despite the fact that we had some negatives from the standpoint of some customer bankruptcies during the year that continued to hang over a little bit from the standpoint of increasing our days out, but the other stuff more than offset it.On the inventory, as Will mentioned, very pleased with what we're able to accomplish in the year. And it's really an effort of everybody being on the same page and working to be smart about what we're buying, be smart about when we're buying and constantly rebalancing our inventory and really thinking about the components and challenging everybody. So very pleased with the team in what they were able to accomplish in 2009. One last item I'll touch on, then I'll turn over to the Q&A. And that is, as we disclosed, we did a small acquisition late in the year. We acquired a business called Holo-Krome. We're very excited about this acquisition. We think it fits in really well with our business and quite frankly, with our customers needs. And we look forward to that business being and contribute to us in the future. And we welcome the 92 employees in West Hartford, Connecticut to the Fastenal family. With that, I will turn it back over to the moderator for the Q&A."

But even when I look out to the summer, and I look at what I believe will be a good year for Fastenal and our ability to move back into the pathway to profit mode. Our sales in the summer will still be down 7% or 8%,  and that's when if those trend lines play out for where they were in 2008.

And the real thing that drives that is if I look at 2009 versus 2008, what changed? Our commissions that went to our sales personnel fell off quite dramatically because our sales fell off quite dramatically. And that drop off was leveraged from the fact that our gross margin fell off, so it was kind of a double whammy [ph].  The second piece, most of our employees in the company are paid on some type of a bonus compensation. And it's really linked to our ability overtime to continually grow our earnings and grow our return. And so our compensation, our incentive compensation, was off dramatically from where it was a year ago. And the third piece, and quite frankly a smaller piece of the three I'm talking about, in 2008, we had -- and really, 2006, 2007, 2008, nice increases to the amount of dollars that we contributed to our employees' retirement plans, 401(k). And it's a set formula that we do, and it's based on a level of profitability. We did not achieve that profitability in 2009, that target profitability. Therefore, the payout on that was essentially eliminated. And so when you look at 2010, that component of our cost structure will act in a very variable fashion. The other components of our cost structure won't. The fact that our sales growth, whether it strengthens or weakens, doesn't influence things like occupancy. What influences things like occupancy is how many stores we open, what type of stores we open, what do we agree to for rent, and how do we manage that in the future for other expenses."

And we have better at it and as a percent of sales it picked up a little bit. And it was also a bit of inflation that helped it because we measure it at a dollar level. And so those two things influenced it but you have to go back as I mentioned quite a few years into the history to see fasteners as a percentage in the 60s. I'll let Will touch on..."

So I think that's a big thing that a lot of people don't understand, they think we're only importing fasteners. We've developed lots of other products. And one thing that everybody has to understand that's a huge motivator for our troops is we had a tough year in 2009 from a bonus standpoint, district managers, store managers, regional vice presidents. And we made it very clear to everybody because I've met with all of our districts, all of our regionals and a lot of managers, if you want to get your payback in 2010 it's going to require that we improve our margin and living in the environment we live in, motivation like that really does work. We've been doing it for a long time, when we have about 3,000 people out there saying, ""hey, I need to do this."" And it's not about just going out and raising prices on everybody, it's about making a lot of transactional decisions a little bit smarter. I can make an extra dollar here, I can pay and renegotiate a deal with a supplier here. And it all works together where you have a large team of people trying to make an extra dollar or two or three on every transaction. With a number of transactions, it adds up very quickly. So I think probably the biggest thing is the motivated team with trained people. They had a pretty tough year in 2009 and we'll guess we soon have a good year in 2010 from a margin standpoint."

That kind of throws them like the 20 to 30 per month range. Just thinking if non-risk construction starts to get better, wouldn't it be to your advantage to maybe add more now when those costs would be lower rentals and real estate costs would be lower now.

And thank you, everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2009 conference call. I'll start right out with the sales. Sales for the quarter were pretty much on plan. We had a very good November. It was a little weaker in December,",1060,"Thanks, Darin. And thank you, everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2009 conference call. I'll start right out with the sales. Sales for the quarter were pretty much on plan. We had a very good November. It was a little weaker in December, but we averaged it out and looked at the numbers from where we thought we would be starting the quarter. We really came right on plan. And we state in our sequential trend pattern that we've really started back in July. So we're pretty optimistic with our numbers. Looking at our January numbers, month-to-date, it appears that when we report numbers at this point, it appears when we report numbers in January, we will report a positive number. Not a lot of growth, but right now, it appears that we will have growth and any amount would be a real positive for our team here in Fastenal.Jumping to the margin, we were a little disappointed with the margin, where it came in at 49.9. Not really surprised, because we did make a decision on the rebates to pull back. We understand where we are with that, and that will be coming back in the first quarter, or starting to come back in the first quarter and throughout 2010. There's really three pieces to margin.  The first one, as I mentioned, the rebates. Understood what happened there, we just made a conscious decision to reduce our purchasing and just basically work towards 2010 and growth in 2010.  We're comfortable that will come back. Second one that hit us and 2010 was the deflation in the steel products, primarily the Fastenal products. We've seen the steel price is pretty much flattened out in the summer and they've actually started rising through the last four months of the year. We anticipate continual and a little bit of inflation in steel. It's really hard to tell. It has a lot to do with what happened with the economy in the world, or mainly, China right now. But right now, we're anticipating some inflation in steel and some inflation on our pricing as the year goes on. But that won't kick in until probably the second and third quarter, as the product sells through. But that's a positive for our margin.And the third part of our margin is the POS, what the customers or what the stores use to charge and price their customers. That bottomed out in August. We've seen positive trends in the POS margin every month since August. We're very optimistic. When you look at the margin, rebates positive, deflation positive and POS positive. We're still very optimistic we'll see improvement in each of the next three quarters.From an expense standpoint, I think we did a really nice job. Our expenses were down 13.2%. And in that, we had somewhat of a kick in the health insurance. Our health insurance jumped. And the problem with health insurance expense, it's one of the expenses you can't manage short-term. You set a program up for your employees, and we set up a good reprogram for our employees, then you basically just wait for the claims that are come in or the experience rating in the claims. In the last half of the year, we saw our claims go up. But we've also been reading that there are other companies seeing the same thing. We're not sure if it's people rushing to get things done before changes in health insurance. We're analyzing it as we speak. And hopefully, we'll have better information. But we don't perceive this problem going forward into the new year. So we're very confident we can lower that a little bit, as we go into the new year.  But otherwise, our expenses, I think our team did a good job managing with the point they are.  Earnings, little disappointing, we came off $0.01, but that's completely explained by the health-insurance that's almost dollar-per-dollar there. A couple of other areas I want to touch on, accounts receivable down 12.6%,  right were sales were. That's one area. And I said this in the last conference call, that I was worried going into the year with bankruptcies up and everything going on in the economy. But we did a nice job actually hanging onto our number, holding the days out flat to down a little bit in a difficult time. And then the other one is inventory. Our inventory is down 10% from the beginning of the year. If you take out the acquisition that we made in December, we actually be down almost exactly where sales were. We did bring some inventory in with that acquisition. And so they did a nice job on inventory. So overall, that's good. So when I step back, and I look at where we are as a company, starting out the new year, starting out a new decade, how do I feel about our positioning? I feel very good about sales. We are going to start it out with a positive trend, and the comps get a little easier as we go on. So I'm very comfortable that were going to have good sales trends, not only year-over-year but also sequentially. Our margin is lower than we want it to be, but we understand the pieces, and there's a lot of positive in that.Our headcount is right in line. If you look at where our FTE came in, we're basically from a relative related to sales, we're almost where we started the year out. So we're positioned very well.  The expense structure, the accounts receivable and the inventory are all in great shape. So when we look in the business, I say, ""What do we need to work on?"" We need to work on margin. We need to continue to work hard on growth. And we need to make sure that the other things that I just mentioned stay in line.So I think we're in a very good position to move forward as a company and get back on to our strategic plan and pathway to profit. That's why I'm looking at the year. That's why I'm communicating to our people internally. And that should be in a good position. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan has more information. I'll cut mine brief today. Thank you."

I'm going to touch on a few items highlighted on our earnings release. And then, we'll turn it over to Q&A after that. One item I want to touch on is centered on Page 1, discussion about our end market info. As we talked about our last call, in the May timeframe, our Manufacturing business appears to have bottomed out. And it's been improving sequentially every month since May except for July and December, which we would expect a little bit of a drop off because of the holiday impact. But generally speaking, the business has been in improving mode since bottoming out in the May 2009 timeframe.  Manufacturing, as we call, represents almost 50% of our sales. On the construction piece, which is just shy at 25% of our sales, that business has continued to weaken as we go through the year. Fortunately, the Manufacturing has been able to overshadow it through the second half of 2009. If I look at the remaining components of our end market, and I call them out individually on our press release this quarter, generally speaking those trends are all positive. As we look through the second half of 2009, I believe we'll remain positive as we go into 2010.A new piece that I added to the release this quarter, and hopefully, for those of you that have had a chance to read it, it created more answer -- a better understanding of our business rather than a bunch of questions. But I'll try to elaborate on what I'm really trying -- why I'm highlighting these points. And it really starts from the bottom of Page 1 and continues onto Page 2. And what I laid out on Page 2 is something that I've been looking at the entire year. As I try to understand, really what happened, what was happening as we were going along through the year. Because historically, when we talk internally at Fastenal, we always talk about kind of where we are in September, October timeframe. Because the daily average on October, really sets us up in our mind for how the new year is going to start. Because historically, our daily average has been at or slightly positive in January to the previous October. And so internally, we are setting our goals once we have the October numbers, because we really think we have the benchmark identified. And as you can see in the table I laid out, in 1998 to 2003 -- and I chose this timeframe as a benchmark, because I believe that it's a timeframe and extended period within an industrial recessionary environment and provides a good basis for a comparison. And in that timeframe, we would see January was again slightly positive than the previous October. And then we would start climbing the stairway in the new year. What you saw in 2009 is our January number wasn't in line with the previous October. It dropped about 18 1/2%. And what you saw was our sales went from positive to contraction in that timeframe as well.In the February, March and April timeframe, the erosion continued at a pretty steep cliff. And we were missing that sequential pattern that we've enjoyed historically. And then about the April timeframe, things really started to change in our business. And that while the sequential growth wasn't as strong as we would like, it was starting to get closer to that historical pattern. And really, since July, we've been in a position where we've been consistently beating the historical trend and are slowly climbing out of the hole that the economy put us in, if you will, during the first part of this year.And I think it's important trend to understand because it really serves to guide us, as we look into the new year. And being a Mid-westerner and an accountant makes me a truly conservative person. And so for me to come out and say something positive into the future is a pretty rare event. But when I look at the trends as of last October, the trends would tell me we should be about and again, I'm looking into 2010, based on where are in October. And I'm doing it based on these trend lines that I've laid out in our pressure release. If I were to just punk it down on a spreadsheet, and say ""Okay, if we're nine-tenths of a percent ahead of October, in January of 2010, I would expect us to see positive growth, and it would quantify to about a half a percent of positive growth."" And as Will mentioned earlier, we believe in the month of January, we'll see positive growth. So again we tend to beyond that pattern we started on last July, where our sequential numbers not only makes sense but are making us more positive in our outlook towards future of our business.If I were to extend this out and look into 2010, and again, I'm nearly taking the trend line based on our history, extending into the future, I don't know what -- our visibility into the future extremely limited due to the nature of our business. But I can look at history as a guidepost. It would tell me when we get into the March, April timeframe, we are looking at double-digit sales growth. And if I were to truly anniversary the numbers, because of the easing comps as we get in deeper into the year, when I look out to July, if we were able to follow this past trend line, our sales growth in July would just tip over, would just eclipse 20.3% is like what I talked to. I don't honestly know if this will happen when I look at 2010, but it does make me optimistic and bullish when I look at the year as far as our ability to continue to grow out of the pattern, to grow out of the place we've been in when I look at 2009. And I believe for the year, this would provide us the ability to see growth that gets into the teens. And only time will tell if these trends prove to be a good guidepost to our future, or if they just prove to be just wrong. But I believe it gives us a positive bias as we enter the new year.Will touched on earlier our active account growth. And there's something I think is important also to understand when if you look at our active accounts. Our active account growth was weaker in 2009 than we would like to see.  Historically, we like to see our active account growth in the low-double digits. So in that 11%, 12% maybe 13% neighborhood. And in this year, we've been in the single digits. But when I look at the data from history, and I look at what we would expect for frequency of our account base, one thing I do see that's very distinct in our 2009 numbers is our frequency of existing customers. In other words, how many customers? What percentage of our customers buy in any given month? Because we have some customers that buy daily or weekly. We have some customers that buy monthly. We have some customers that might buy sporadically. Maybe they buy every second or every third month. We measure a lot of those statistics internally and provide that information to our store personnel. But when I look at the frequency factor of our customers, I see that in 2009, our frequency is off about 7%.  So that dampens our active account number by about 7% and really serves to diminish what I believe is our true active account growth when I look at 2009. And again, what that does, it provides one more component to what gives me confidence when I look at our 2010 comp line numbers. Will touched earlier on gross margin, and I would echo his comment. It was tough for us to have to report 49.9% gross margin because it was a barrier we really did not want to cross. That's the negative news. The positive news is this. When you look at the decline, it was really -- when we looked at where we thought our vendor allowances and rebate programs would come in earlier in the year, they like, did come in a lot weaker than we expected, and that trampled a little bit from the fourth quarter. When I look at gross margin, I really think of it in three distinct components.  One is structural, what's going on in the environment, internal and external, but primarily external that influences our number. The second one would be at freight side. And then the third would be just our transactional activity. Other words, what's happening at the point-of-sale level. What's happening from our ability to -- from the importing level or direct-purchase level. On the structural side, I see two things that are, generally speaking, have a positive bias going in 2010 versus 2009. One would be the vendor allowance program, which tend to be linked to the calendar year. So the program's reset and starting in January. I would expect that the rebate we're earning would improve relative to where it was in 2009. That won't necessarily flow into the P&L in the first quarter because that better purchasing activity will be sitting in any inventory at the end of the first quarter. But I would expect us to start seeing that improvement in the second quarter, and that's one of the components to improvement in gross margin when I look at 2010.The second is what the point Will touched on in the last several months of the year. About the last four months, we've seen some inflationary trends. And having a slight inflation trend versus a marked deflation trend has a significant impact on our gross margin because of the nature of how fast our inventory turns.The second category I talked about on freight. When I look at where we are at the start of 2010 versus 2009 and 2008, I'll go back even two years. I believe the momentum we've had in both of those previous two years, we have still today and we continue to identify opportunities to improve our freight margin. And so I see that as a positive bias going to the new year. The final piece, the transactional, as Will mentioned, the margin we measure at our point-of-sale level, that margin bottomed out in August '09, and we've been above that number since. And we believe our day-to-day activities, our transactional activities, we've improved the pattern since that low point in August.The second component of our transactional is really our direct sourcing margin that we measured. And that really is the fact that we are able to source in volume. And that had a negative bias to it in 2009 because of deflation. And again, I believe we'll have a positive bias to it in 2010 if the inflation patterns that we've seen in the last several months, last four months continue. Finally, the next couple of points, on cash flow. As you see in our cash flow statement, our cash flow for the year was quite strong. The big drivers of the cash flow were the changes in working capital, accounts receivable and inventory that Will alluded to earlier. As a percentage of earnings, for every dollar of earnings, we threw off $1.66 of operating cash. Last year, that number was $0.93 on the dollar. Our long-term numbers that we really laid out when we started the pathway to profit, we felt we could be in a position to be at or slightly exceed $0.85 on the dollar. And so we feel very good about our performance from that in the last several years since the pathway to profit started.When I look at free cash flow, again, a very strong number. Our capital expenditures came in quite a bit less than they were a year ago, as we expected. And as I mentioned in the conference call, I would expect the capital expenditures to drop again in 2010 because we are complete with our projects in Denton, Texas and Indianapolis, Indiana, and now are in the position to reap the benefit of that hard work over the last several years.What this did is that private funding for two items that we did in the current year. As in prior years, we were able to increase our regular dividend. And our buyback, we did buy back some stock late in the year. We bought back about $41 million worth at $37 a share. So feel good about that at this point in time. And then we'll continue to look at buybacks in the future, and we'll see how that plays out.Finally, just to touch on a few things on the working capital, identified on Page 9 of the release. As Will mentioned, accounts receivable, we're down 12.5%, in line with our sales. Actually, slightly better than our sales pattern. And really what we did is identified a structural improvement. And that structural improvement is we have a lot of customers, and a lot of customers that buy relatively small amount. And what happens lot of times with billing processes is lot of stuff gets caught in the chatter. And invoices -- generally speaking, our customers are really fair with us on paying their bills. And what happens is the stuff that usually falls to the cracks, that stuff is inadvertent.  And we made some structural changes to our billing in 2010. Our team did a great job of automating a lot of processes, e-mailing more invoices, faxing more invoices. And we just improved the structural collection patterns in our business despite the fact that we had some negatives from the standpoint of some customer bankruptcies during the year that continued to hang over a little bit from the standpoint of increasing our days out, but the other stuff more than offset it.On the inventory, as Will mentioned, very pleased with what we're able to accomplish in the year. And it's really an effort of everybody being on the same page and working to be smart about what we're buying, be smart about when we're buying and constantly rebalancing our inventory and really thinking about the components and challenging everybody. So very pleased with the team and what they were able to accomplish in 2009. One last item I'll touch on, then I'll turn it over to the Q&A. And that is, as we disclosed, we did a small acquisition late in the year. We acquired a business called Holo-Krome. We're very excited about this acquisition. We think it fits in really well with our business and quite frankly, with our customers needs. And we look forward to that business being a contributor to us in the future. And we welcome the 92 employees in West Hartford, Connecticut to the Fastenal family. With that, I will turn it back over to the moderator for the Q&A."

And the real thing that drives that is if I look at 2009 versus 2008, what changed? Our commissions that went to our sales personnel fell off quite dramatically because our sales fell off quite dramatically. And that drop off was leveraged from the fact that our gross margin fell off, so it was kind of a double whammy. The second piece, most of our employees in the company are paid on some type of bonus compensation. And it's really linked to our ability overtime to continually grow our earnings and grow our return. And so our compensation, our incentive compensation, was off dramatically from where it was a year ago. And the third piece, and quite frankly a smaller piece of the three I'm talking about, in 2008, we had -- and really, 2006, 2007, 2008, nice increases to the amount of dollars that we contributed to our employees' retirement plans, 401(k). And it's a set formula that we do, and it's based on a level of profitability. We did not achieve that profitability in 2009, that target profitability. Therefore, the payout on that was essentially eliminated. And so when you look at 2010, that component of our cost structure will act in a very variable fashion. The other components of our cost structure won't. The fact that our sales growth, whether it strengthens or weakens, doesn't influence things like occupancy. What influences things like occupancy is how many stores we open, what type of stores we open, what do we agree to for rent, and how do we manage that in the future for other expenses."

In fact, it picked up a little bit in the mid part of this decade from a couple of things. One, I think our what we referred to as time as our CSP [Customer Service Project] initiative where we put more products in our stores. I think that I believe that helped our Fastener business because we went from being I think a really, really good fastener distributor to a great fastener distributor and from a standpoint we had great availability of product, a wide range of products at the local site. And we got better at it and as a percent of sales, it picked up a little bit. And it was also a bit of inflation that helped it because we measure it at a dollar level.

So I think that's a big thing that a lot of people don't understand, they think we're only importing fasteners. We've developed lots of other products. And one thing that everybody has to understand that's a huge motivator for our troops is we had a tough year in 2009 from a bonus standpoint, district managers, store managers, regional vice presidents. And we made it very clear to everybody because I've met with all of our districts, all of our regionals and a lot of managers, if you want to get your payback in 2010, it's going to require that we improve our margin. And living in the environment we live in, motivation like that really does work. We've been doing it for a long time. When we have about 3,000 people out there saying, ""Hey, I need to do this."" And it's not about just going out and raising prices on everybody, it's about making a lot of transactional decisions a little bit smarter. I can make an extra dollar here, I can pay and renegotiate a deal with a supplier here. And it all works together where you have a large team of people trying to make an extra dollar or two or three on every transaction. With a number of transactions, it adds up very quickly. So I think probably the biggest thing is the motivated team of trained people. They had a pretty tough year in 2009 and we guess soon have a good year in 2010 from a margin standpoint."

Good morning, everybody. I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call. I want to thank all the Fastenal people because we were able to produce good numbers this quarter due to a lot of hard work by all the people on the team.As you can see, our sales grew faster than we had thought, or than were estimated coming in at 6.4% growth. But very close to the pattern that Dan and I had talked about on the fourth quarter call, very similar to the pattern. What we've seen is geographically, it's spread wide. We've seen improvement in every geographic area of the country, and internationally, we've seen nice improvement month to month. So, it's not coming back from this one area or one group of customers. It's very widespread. It seems like somewhat of an economic rebound, not fast, coming back slow but it is more positive. And I've been out with a lot of customers in different companies recently. And I'm hearing more of that, that people are becoming slightly more optimistic about the future.From an end-market standpoint, our manufacturing customers grew at 16% year-over-year, so very nice growth there. But our construction, our Non-Residential Construction customers actually dropped 15% year-over-year. And so that's very much a concern. And right now, we don't foresee that coming back much in 2010, if at all. And so we're really looking beyond 2010 for some good growth, meaningful improvement in the Non-Residential Construction customers. Fortunately, they only make up less than 25% of our business. But it's still, it's a meaningful hit. And I believe that's why we're not breaking out of the improvement pattern that we talked about. I thought we would actually go above the pattern but the construction is holding us back somewhat. But all in all, I think we're making nice improvements sequentially from a sales standpoint. And it's also encouraging that it's widespread geographically. From a gross margin standpoint, we talked about three different areas: inflation; rebates and incentives; and then our regular point of sale or sales margin over the counter.For this first quarter, inflation was pretty much neutral. We've kind of reached the point where we're kind of annualizing over last year where it was. Going forward though, steel prices are going up. And we see that will be coming into our selling prices in the – somewhat in the second quarter but more in the second half of this year. We're watching steel very closely, trying to determine how much we should be buying and how long we think this will – if it will continue to go up and right now, it appears that it probably will for awhile. There's a lot of Asian demand for steel.On the rebate side, we picked up about 35 points of the – 120 basis points, excuse me, our margins came in at 51.1, of 120 basis points improvement quarter-to-quarter, 35 basis points came from our rebates. And that will continue to improve as we go into the year, as that inventory makes up more of our – or those purchases make up more of our overall inventory. So that's a tailwind that we have going right now. And we expect about a 70 basis point improvement for the year, so that kind of plays out into the second, third and fourth quarters. But the most positive thing on the gross margin is what we call our point of sale margin, POS margin, was up 85 basis points for the quarter. And that's about transactions at the counter, that's about passing price increases or just getting better at how we transact our business. And so that's a very positive sign going forward. And we're very optimistic that we'll continue to see improvement in our margin.From an expense standpoint, I have to applaud the team, I think most people have done a nice job of controlling the expenses, looking at the little things; the big stuff is easy to find. It's the little, everyday transactions and setting a few dollars here and a few dollars there that really make the difference, especially a year into it because we found a lot of the big stuff early. We were able to grow our business at almost 6.5% and reduce our SG&A at 2.5%. So that's really the difference in the growth in our profitability. Against the difficult margin comparisons, we gave up some on the gross margin, but we picked it all back up, plus some on the expense. Our labor was down 4% year-over-year, and that's a positive. But the real positive in that is that the bonuses grew substantially. Our district managers, which are the group of people that oversee the stores, there's about 200 of those, that group, 208 people I believe -- their bonuses more than doubled from the fourth quarter. So that's very positive. We're also in a position to start contributing to our 401(k) match again with a formula where we don't contribute unless our pretax earnings is greater than 16%. And because we have that, we were able to contribute $800,000 to our 401(k) match. So labor was down 4%, but bonuses are up and the 401(k) matches is back in place. So the morale should be good and we're very, very positive; a good sign of what we're doing and good sign of the work that's being done in the field. Another positive was we were able to hold our inventory flat for the quarter, actually reduce it about $1 million from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, we're down 9% or just over $40 million, again good work by the team. We're going to see a little pressure if steel prices, or as steel prices go up in the second half of the year. But even with that pressure, we think that we can manage our inventory without much increase at all throughout the 2010 calendar year.New store openings. We opened 29 stores in the first quarter. About what we had said, that we're going to be conservative in the first half of the year and then if business trends continue to be strong, we'll open it up in the second half. We see the second quarter with similar store openings somewhere in that high 20s, maybe low 30s. The quarter will start out very slow. April we only – if any, we'll have one or two stores, I'm not sure. We have a big customer show in Indianapolis this week. We started late with Easter and then we have a big customer event, which really takes the time of almost all of our people, so April will be very slow. But for the quarter we're looking at about somewhere around the same number as the first quarter, around 30 openings, which we're comfortable with. At that pace, if we kept it all year, it would give us 5% openings, but if things pick up, we'd turn that up a little bit in the second half of the year.We also see that we'll be doing some hiring in the second half. And that will only be in the store locations. We don't foresee any additional support staff, even in distribution. We're working very, very hard -- our distribution people are -- to find new and better ways to run their distribution centers, providing a high level of service without adding a lot of additional expense. There's a lot of motivation out there because these people get paid off the way they manage their expenses, and right now they'd like to increase their bonuses. And the best way to do that is productivity. There's no better way in distribution to improve their pay than becoming more productive. So that's a real positive.So in summarizing, what we see for the second quarter and going forward into the year, we see improved sales growth. We think our daily numbers will improve throughout the second quarter. Basically what we had talked about in the first quarter, staying right on pattern, the historical pattern. We see our margin improving again in the second quarter, up from where we ended the first quarter, or reported in the first quarter. We see holding our inventory flat for the second quarter. And depending on what steel does, we think we can hold it flat for the entire calendar year or very close. We won't see much build in inventory this year because we're doing a lot of things to try and become more efficient with the use and still provide very good customer service. We'll open, as I said, a similar number of stores. And we will do -- be doing some hiring. So if you look at your models and you look at where Fastenal is going to be at the end of the second quarter, those are some things that you can consider while you're doing your work. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan is going to give you more in-depth information on what we saw in the quarter. Thank you very much."

And thank you for participating in our call. As Will touched on, the two important factors in the quarter, our sales trends continue to improve and the gross margin percentage improved from what we saw in the fourth quarter. As Will mentioned, our end-market information, our manufacturing business is coming back nicely as we expected. Non-Residential is going to continue to be a headwind for us as we go through 2010; at least we believe it is.On Page Two of the release, we talk about some of the mechanical pieces of the business, the growth of stores over a certain age. Very pleased to see the progress we made in the March month especially, as it relates to our five-plus-year-old stores. Those stores historically are much more economically sensitive because [ph] market share they have in their local market. And that group of stores grew 7.5% in April. And so – and we hadn't seen growth out of that store, group of stores, since late in 2008. So it's nice to see that group on the positive side of the ledger again. And because of the sales buy into that group, they meaningfully moved our two-plus year-old stores, so our same-store comps, which were positive in each month of the first quarter, moved almost 10% growth in the month of March.The sales trends, the stairway analogy we started talking about last year as we were really looking at not – sometimes the year-over-year numbers become a little bit confusing when you're in a period of dramatic change in our top line. And so sometimes looking at it from the standpoint of where am I today, where will I be tomorrow and the next day and the next day, is a better frame of reference. On the January call, we talked a lot about the sales trends. And when you lay out where we were at the end of the year, we really felt that based on historical patterns that we laid out, that our growth in March, our daily average growth, will be somewhere in the 11%, 11.5% neighborhood. The Holo-Krome acquisition added about 60 basis points to that number. And essentially got us to the 12.1%, where we're at. We've slightly beat the trends that we had laid out starting in January.If you follow that progression, in the press release they also introduce not only the mechanical view of the plus-percent or minus-percent month to month but a graph that starts out, and you can see on that, that our 2010 to-date numbers are trending very closely to that past pattern that we've talked about. We believe our sales growth will, based on that trend, will hit the high watermark as we're going through the second quarter and into July. And then as history would say, our daily average number, we believe, will peak out in the September, October timeframe, which will set us up then for 2011, but very pleased thus far, with the trends in the pattern relative to the historical pattern. And as Will mentioned, if construction were helping us out at all, we'd be in a position to be beating that trend line and beating it nicely.The pathway to profit, I'm happy to say we're back on the path. And I tried to incorporate a few more details of headcount numbers and store locations so you can get a good view from our business in first quarter of 2007, the quarter immediately before we started the 'pathway to profit' in April of '07 and where we are today. If you look at some of the pieces since Q1 of '07, our store count is up about 15.5%. Our store FTE headcount is up about 10%. And our remaining FTE, including distribution, manufacturing and support is down about 7%. And that plays into what we had talked about when we started the 'pathway to profit,' that it was really a top line growth model that we believe would allow us to leverage our infrastructure, leverage our support costs and drive our operating margin up over time as our average store size grew. 2009 put quite a damper into our ability to grow our average store size, in fact, it contracted in 2009. But the 'pathway to profit' and what we laid out in 2007, we feel as committed to and as strongly about today as we did then with the benefit of a few – now three years of history under the pathway.Gross profit margin as Will mentioned, we improved 120 basis points from where we were in Q4 of '09. Largely by our transactional margin, our point-of-sale margin improvement. And in a piece also from vendor volume allowances, rebate programs, et cetera. As Will mentioned, we would anticipate that portion continuing to improve mechanically, whereas as the transactional margin, we believe will continue to improve because of execution. And I believe we've positioned ourselves well as we go into Q2 and Q3 to continue to improve that, because we still are about 180 basis points below where we were first quarter of '09. And we want that back.Looking at the operating and administrative expenses, we did, I believe, a nice job with that. The payroll, total payroll cost, as Will mentioned, down from a year ago despite the fact that our bonus – that payouts were nicely increased from what we saw in most of 2009, as well as the 401(k) contribution. Occupancy improved year-over-year. That's one we still need some work on; we still need work on the base-front side of it. Our improvement was largely centered on the fact that our store personnel and our district personal did a nice job of getting green. And when I talk about getting green, I'm talking about the money-kind of green and the fact that they're just being smarter with how we manage our heating and cooling costs. They're being smarter with how we manage that when we're not at the locations and we lowered our utility costs year-over-year despite the fact that a few prices are moving upward. And so I believe that's something that's a sustainable item. We've done nice progress on lowering our base trends but we still need to push hard on that because our goal under the 'pathway to profit' was to lower, over time as our average store size grew, our occupancy costs as a percentage of sales from just over 600, 650 basis points down to about 400 basis points as our average store size grows. And so we still have some work to do there but we've made nice progress over the last 12 months.Working capital again, came in very much in line with what we were thinking. The accounts receivable on a year-over-year basis grew actually nominally better than our sales growth. So we obtained a little improvement in our days out. And our inventory, we continued to manage that very closely and we'll anticipate that as Will mentioned, continuing through for the balance of the year. Because of the improvement in earnings and the working capital management, did a nice job with our operating cash flow. We produced 141% of sales in operating cash. If you take out our capital expenditures, we produced 128% of earnings in free cash flow, operating cash minus capital expenditures. With that, I will turn it back over to moderator for the question and answer. And as we've done in the past, we would ask that folks ask one question and we'll try to cycle back through. It allows as many people that have questions to jump into queue and have those questions answered. Thank you."

And the transaction frequency is low enough, and it's a new inventory item that isn't a problem solver. The one thing we're always very cautious of, or very conscience of when we're looking at what we want in our stores is the inventory that, at the end of the day, solves problems for customers because that's the stuff you need right then and there. And having a base of inventory in the store that would service -- that would get the customer started, if they needed it right now. So maybe they need 2,000 of something; we have 800 in the store but we can get the other 1,200 in by 6:30 tomorrow morning off our distribution center. So being very conscious of balancing that over time. Because the inventory reduction of 2009 – really what we did is we eliminated the inventory growth that occurred in 2008 when the economy shut off."

But anecdotally, you listen to people, you talk to people and there's not as much crazy price -- we're not hearing the stories that we heard a year ago about this guy’s giving it away or these prices are ridiculous. That has toned down a lot. So there's something to that, but it’s, like I say, almost impossible to measure.The initiatives have been about -- we've done a much better job of dissecting our business and thinking at a transactional level -- not looking at a district with 10 stores and saying, hey, your margin’s up a point or down a point. We’re breaking it down to the transaction and saying why did we do discount at this level for this type of customer? And about nine months ago, Dan tapped a couple of young guys that worked for us, worked for us for several years; two bright guys and said would you like to work for me and do nothing but break this data down and tell us where do a good job and where we aren't? And as you can guess, we’ve discovered a lot of areas that -- and we're very decentralized. You have to understand that our people make prices in the field; some are really good at it and some aren't. And so part of this improvement is coming from their hard work; just identifying opportunities, identifying prices or stores that are selling the same product to the same type of customer for five or 10 or 15 points less. And that's where a lot of the improvement is coming from. So it's the combination of a little less pressure from the guy next door, the competitor, and more good information to drive our middle manager, our district managers to make better decisions or train better decision-making."

The 'pathway to profit', we had put in more investment in some of these small trucks -- or small stores, extra trucks, extra people. And in the downturn, we didn't seem to be getting much benefit. So in July of last year, I went to some of my director parts, Dan included, and we divided up the regions. We each took two or three of them and just started working with the regionals on identifying opportunities in these small stores. Kind of a game – not that I, it was fun because we had – project, not a game. And we really focused on. As you can see, we reduced our losses from basically 20 -- by about 10 percentage points. So we did a really nice job there, and we think that's sustainable. Actually, we think we’ll improve from there; because the first quarter is a little difficult to give you higher occupancy and lower revenues. So what it really was is purely attention.On the larger stores, it was reduction in gross margin. If you look at our growth, a lot of it’s coming from manufacturing. A lot of the manufacturing is large customers. Typically, you run into slightly lower margin and a lot of that business runs through those bigger stores. So the bigger stores have given up some margin. But when you can report 25%, 26% operating profit, I'm not as concerned if I give up a half or point of gross margin when you can still get those kinds of returns.As Bob Kierlin, our founder has always beat into my head for 30 years, Will, it's not about the gross margins it's about where it comes out on the return, and -- or even the operating or pretax -- it's about what we get on return on that business.

My thought right now is the gut feeling that I have is that there's not going to be a lot of restocking soon because there’s still uncertainty in our economy. Most of the people I talk to are going to be very slow to rehire people unless it’s for production. That’s what they’re telling me; we’re not going to add a lot of support. And they’re not going to spend any money they don't have to. And I think I said this in the third quarter conference call, it was one of the earlier ones, I don't foresee a lot of restocking at any point because people learn that they can live with less. And that's actually very good for our business if they don't restock, because -- if you have local inventory, like a Fastenal store, and you can depend on that, then you don't need inventory. The less they have, the more our value proposition plays well for us and plays well for them. But I really would be surprised to see a lot of manufacturers coming back and putting in big inventories of things that they maybe could live without at this point.The one thing we are seeing a nice improvement on is a lot more interest in our vending systems because we can control spend and they know exactly what they have. I'm very bullish on vending. It’s a very small part of our business. But it just makes complete sense to me where you put a small store, essentially a store of 10 or 20 or 100 items into a plant, a warehouse, a site, and then they have complete control and it reduces what they need."

Good morning, everybody, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call. I want to thank all the Fastenal people because we were able to produce good numbers this quarter due to a lot of hard work by all the people on the team.As you can see, our sales grew faster than we had thought, or than were estimated coming in at 6.4% growth. But very close to the pattern that Dan and I had talked about on the fourth quarter call, very similar to the pattern. What we've seen is geographically, it's spread wide, we've seen improvement in every geographic area of the country, and internationally, we've seen nice improvement month-to-month. So it's not coming back from this one area or one group of customers. It's very widespread. It seems like somewhat of an economic rebound, not fast, coming back slow but it is more positive. And I've been out with the lot of customers in different companies recently. And I'm hearing more of that, that people are becoming slightly more optimistic about the future.From an end-market standpoint, our manufacturing customers grew at 16% year-over-year, so very nice growth there. But our construction, our Non-Residential Construction customers actually dropped 15% year-over-year. And so that's very much a concern. And right now, we don't foresee that coming back much in 2010, if at all. And so we're really looking beyond 2010 for some good growth, meaningful improvement in the Non-Residential Construction customers. Fortunately, they only make up less than 25% of our business. But it's still, it's a meaningful hit. And I believe that's why we're not breaking out of the improvement pattern that we talked about. I thought we would actually go above the pattern but the construction is holding us back somewhat.But all in all, I think we're making nice improvements sequentially from a sales standpoint. And it's also encouraging that it's widespread geographically. From a gross margin standpoint, we talked about three different areas, inflation, rebates and incentives and then our regular point of sale or sales margin over-the-counter.For this first quarter, inflation was pretty much neutral. We've kind of reached the point where we're kind of annualizing over the last year where it was. Going forward though, steel prices are going up. And we see that will be coming into our selling prices in the – somewhat in the second quarter but more in the second half of this year. We're watching steel very closely, trying to determine how much we should be buying and how long we think this will continue to go up and right now, it appears that it probably will for a while. There's a lot of Asian demand for steel.On the rebate side, we picked up about 35 points of the – 120 basis points, excuse me, our margins came in at 51.1, about 120 basis points improvement quarter-to-quarter, 35 basis points came from our rebates. And that will continue to improve as we go into the year, as that inventory makes up more of our – or those purchases make up more of our overall inventory. So that's a tailwind that we have going right now. And we expect about a 70 basis point improvement for the year, so that kind of plays out into the second, third and fourth quarters. But the most positive thing on the gross margin is what we call our point of sale margin, POS margin, was up 85 basis points for the quarter. And that's about transactions at the counter, that's about passing price increases or just getting better at how we transact our business. And so that's a very positive sign going forward. And we're very optimistic that we'll continue to see improvement in our margin.From an expense standpoint, I have to applaud the team, I think most people have done a nice job of controlling the expenses, looking at the little things; the big stuff is easy to find. It's the little, everyday transactions and setting a few dollars here, a few dollars there that really make the difference, especially a year into it because we found a lot of the big stuff early. We were able to grow our business at almost 6.5% and reduce our SG&A at 2.5%. So that's really the difference in the growth in our profitability. Against the difficult margin comparisons, we gave up some on the gross margin. We picked it all back up, plus some on the expense. Our labor was down 4% year-over-year, and that's a positive. But the real positive in that is that the bonuses grew substantially. Our district managers, which are the group of people that oversee the stores, there's about 200 of those, that group, 208 people I believe. Their bonuses more than doubled from the fourth quarter. So that's very positive. We're also in a position to start contributing to our 401(k) match again with a formula where we don't contribute unless our pretax earnings is greater than 16%. And because we have that, we were able to contribute $800,000 to our 401(k) match. So labor was down 4%, but bonuses are up in the 401(k) matches is back in place. So the morale should be good and we're very, very positive, a good sign of what we're doing and good sign of the work that's being done in the field. Another positive was we were able to hold our inventory flat for the quarter, actually reduce it about $1 million from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, we're down 9% or just over $40 million, again good work by the team. We're going to see a little pressure if steel prices, or as steel prices go up in the second half of the year. But even with that pressure, we think that we can manage our inventory without much increase at all throughout the 2010 calendar year.New store openings. We opened 29 stores in the first quarter. About what we had said, that we're going to be conservative in the first half of the year and then if business trends continue to be strong we'll open it up in the second half. We see the second quarter with similar store openings somewhere in that high 20s, maybe low 30s. The quarter will start out very slow. April we only – if any, we'll have one or two stores, I'm not sure. We have a big customer show in Indianapolis this week. We started late with Easter and then we have a big customer event, which really takes the time of almost all of our people, so April will be very slow. But for the quarter we're looking at about somewhere around the same number as the first quarter, around 30 openings, which we're comfortable with. At that pace, if we kept it all year it would give us 5% openings, but if things pick up, we'd turn that up a little bit in the second half of the year.We also see that we'll be doing some hiring in the second half. And that will only be in the store locations. We don't foresee any additional support staff, even in distribution. We're working very, very hard, our distribution people are to find new and better ways to run their distribution centers, providing a high level of service without adding a lot of additional expense. There's a lot of motivation out there because these people get paid off, the way they manage their expenses, and right now they'd like to increase their bonuses. And the best way to do that is productivity. There's no better way in distribution to improve their pay than becoming more productive. So that's a real positive.So in summarizing, what we see for the second quarter and going forward into the year, we see improved sales growth. We think our daily numbers will improve throughout the second quarter. Basically what we had talked about in the first quarter, staying right on pattern, the historical pattern. We see our margin improving again in the second quarter, up from where we ended the first quarter, or reported in the first quarter. We see holding our inventory flat for the second quarter. And depending on what steel does, we think we can hold it flat for the entire calendar year or very close. We won't see much build in inventory this year because we're doing a lot of things to try and become more efficient with the use and still provide very good customer service. We'll open, as I said, a similar number of stores. And we will do be doing some hiring. So, if you look at your models and you look at where Fastenal is going to be at the end of the second quarter, those are some things that you can consider while you're doing your work. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan is going to give you more in-depth information on what we saw in the quarter. Thank you very much."

And thank you for participating in our call. As Will touched on, the two important factors in the quarter, our sales trends continue to improve and the gross margin percentage improved from what we saw in the fourth quarter. As Will mentioned, our end-market information, our Manufacturing business is coming back nicely as we expected. Non-Residential is going to continue to be a headwind for us as we go through 2010. At least we believe it is.On Page 2, of the release, we talk about some of the mechanical pieces of the business, the growth of stores over a certain age. Very pleased to see the progress we made in the March month especially, as it relates to our five-plus-year-old stores. Those stores historically are much more economically sensitive because of the market share [ph] they have in their local market. And that group of stores grew 7.5% in April. And so – and we hadn't seen growth out of that store, group of stores, since late in 2008. So it's nice to see that group on the positive side of the ledger again. And because of the sales buy into [ph] that group, they meaningfully moved our two-plus year-old stores for our same-store comps, which were positive in each month of the first quarter, moved almost 10% growth in the month of March.The sales trends, the stairway analogy we started talking about last year as we were really looking at not – sometimes the year-over-year numbers become a little bit confusing when you're in a period of dramatic change in our top line. And so sometimes looking at it from the standpoint of where am I today, where will I be tomorrow and the next day and the next day, is a better frame of reference. On the January call, we talked a lot about the sales trends. And when you lay out where we were at the end of the year, we really felt that based on historical patterns that we laid out, that our growth in March, our daily average growth, will be somewhere in the 11%, 11.5% neighborhood. The Holo-Krome acquisition added about 60 basis points to that number. And essentially got us to the 12.1%, where we're at. We've slightly beat the trends that we had laid out starting in January.If you follow that progression, in the press release they also introduce not only the mechanical view of the plus-percent or minus-percent month to month but a graph that starts out, and you can see on that, that our 2010 to-date numbers are trending very closely to that past pattern that we've talked about. We believe our sales growth will, based on that trend, will hit the high watermark as we're going through the second quarter and into July. And then as history would say, our daily average number, we believe, will peak out in the September, October timeframe, which will set us up then for 2011, but very pleased thus far, with the trends in the pattern relative to the historical pattern. And as Will mentioned, if construction were helping us out at all, we'd be in a position to be beating that trend line and beating it nicely.The pathway to profit, I'm happy to say we're back on the path. And I tried to incorporate a few more details of headcount numbers and store locations so you can get a good view from our business in first quarter of 2007, the quarter immediately before we started the 'pathway to profit' in April of '07 and where we are today. If you look at some of the pieces since Q1 of '07, our store count is up about 15.5%. Our store FTE headcount is up about 10%. And our remaining FTE, including distribution, manufacturing and support is down about 7%. And that plays into what we had talked about when we started the 'pathway to profit' that it was really a top line growth model that we believe would allow us to leverage our infrastructure, leverage our support costs and drive our operating margin up over time as our average store size grew. 2009 put quite a damper into our ability to grow our average store size, in fact, it contracted in 2009. But the 'pathway to profit' and what we laid out in 2007, we feel is committed to and as strongly about today as we did then with the benefit of a few – now three years of history under the pathway.Gross profit margin as Will mentioned, we improved 120 basis points from where we were in Q4 of '09. Largely by our transactional margin, our point-of-sale margin improvement. And in a piece also from vendor volume allowances, rebate programs, et cetera. As Will mentioned, we would anticipate that portion continuing to improve mechanically, whereas as the transactional margin, we believe will continue to improve because of execution. And I believe we've positioned ourselves well as we go into Q2 and Q3 to continue to improve that, because we still are about 180 basis points below where we were first quarter of '09. And we want that back.Looking at the operating and administrative expenses, we did, I believe, a nice job with that. The payroll, total payroll cost, as Will mentioned, down from a year ago despite the fact that our bonus – that payouts were nicely increased from what we saw in most of 2009, as well as the 401(k) contribution. Occupancy improved year-over-year. That's one we still need some work on; we still need work on the base-front side of it. Our improvement was largely centered on the fact that our store personnel and our district personal did a nice job of getting green. And when I talk about getting green, I'm talking about the money-kind of green and the fact that they're just being smarter with how we manage our heating and cooling costs. They're being smarter with how we manage that when we're not at the locations and we lowered our utility costs year-over-year despite the fact that a few prices are moving upward. And so I believe that's something that's a sustainable item. We've done nice progress on lowering our base trends but we still need to push hard on that because our goal under the 'pathway to profit' was to lower, over time as our average store size grew, our occupancy costs as a percentage of sales from just over 600, 650 basis points down to about 400 basis points as our average store size grows. And so we still have some work to do there but we've made nice progress over the last 12 months.Working capital again, came in very much in line with what we were thinking. The accounts receivable on a year-over-year basis grew actually nominally better than our sales growth. So we obtained a little improvement in our days out. And our inventory, we continued to manage that very closely and we'll anticipate that as Will mentioned, continuing through for the balance of the year. Because of the improvement in earnings and the working capital management, did a nice job with our operating cash flow. We produced 141% of sales in operating cash. If you take out our capital expenditures, we produced 128% of earnings in free cash flow, operating cash minus capital expenditures. With that, I will turn it back over to moderator for the question and answer. And as we've done in the past, we would ask that folks ask one question and we'll try to cycle back through. It allows as many people that have questions to jump into queue and have those questions answered. Thank you."

But as our Fastener business, most – a high percentage of that is imported, so it's a slower process that takes us eight to 12 weeks and bring it into inventory, it's slow turning inventory. So if you look at the entire year, the first half, very little inflation and the second half, we'll probably see some positive price increases. And historically, we've done a good job, or been able to pass that through to the customer in the last couple of times and it's gone up to so we're comfortable we can do that again."

And the transaction frequency is low enough, and it's an inventory item that isn't a problem solver. The one thing we're always very cautious of, or very conscience of when we're looking at what we want in our stores is the inventory that, at the end of the day, solves problems for customers because that's the stuff you need right then and there. And having a base of inventory in the store that would service -- that would get the customer started, if they needed it right now. So maybe they need 2,000 of something; we have 800 in the store but we can get the other 1,200 in by 6:30 tomorrow morning off our distribution center. So being very conscious of balancing that over time. Because the inventory reduction of 2009 – really what we did is we eliminated the inventory growth that occurred in 2008 when the economy shut off."

But anecdotally, you listen to people, you talk to people and there's not as much crazy price -- we're not hearing the stories that we heard a year ago about this guy’s giving it away or these prices are ridiculous. That has toned down a lot. So there's something to that, but it’s, like I say, almost impossible to measure. The initiatives have been about -- we've done a much better job of dissecting our business and thinking at the transactional level -- not looking at a district with 10 stores and saying, hey, your margin’s up a point or down a point. We’re breaking it down to the transaction and saying why did we do discount at this level for this type of customer? And about nine months ago, Dan tapped a couple of young guys that worked for us, worked for us for several years; two bright guys and said would you like to work for me and do nothing but break this data down and tell us where we're doing a good job and where we aren't? And as you can guess, we’ve discovered a lot of areas that -- and we're very decentralized. You have to understand that our people make prices in the field; some are really good at it and some aren't.  And so part of this improvement is coming from their hard work; just identifying opportunities, identifying prices or stores that are selling the same product to the same type of customer for five or 10 or 15 points less. And that's where a lot of the improvement is coming from. So it's the combination of a little less pressure from the guy next door, the competitor, and more good information to drive our middle manager and our district managers to make better decisions or train better decision-making."

The 'pathway to profit', we had put in more investment in some of these small trucks -- or small stores, extra trucks, extra people. And in the downturn, we didn't seem to be getting much benefit. So in July of last year, I went to some of my director parts, Dan included, and we divided up the regions. We each took two or three of them and just started working with the regionals on identifying opportunities in these small stores. Kind of a game – not that I, it was fun because we had – project, not a game. And we really focused on. As you can see, we reduced our losses from basically 20 -- by about 10 percentage points. So we did a really nice job there, and we think that's sustainable. Actually, we think we’ll improve from there; because the first quarter is a little difficult to give you higher occupancy and lower revenues. So what it really was is purely attention.On the larger stores, it was a reduction in gross margin. If you look at our growth, a lot of it’s coming from manufacturing. A lot of the manufacturing is large customers. Typically, you run into slightly lower margin and a lot of that business runs through those bigger stores. So the bigger stores have given up some margin. But when you can report 25%, 26% operating profit, I'm not as concerned if I give up a half or point of gross margin when you can still get those kinds of returns. As Bob Kierlin, our founder has always beat into my head for 30 years, Will, it's not about the gross margins it's about where it comes out on the return, and -- or even the operating or pretax -- it's about what we get on return on that business. And those businesses are highly profitable and great businesses to own."

There's a tremendous amount of spend there and we have openly admitted that we're behind in that to some of our competitors. So what we've done is we’ve restructured that internally. We tapped one of our regional vice presidents that actually has a – he was the guy that got us into it, 10 or 15 years ago, as a District Manager, he opened our first government store. His name is John Soderberg, he was running our Seattle region. He is going to be moving back to Winona, has already taken the role, he’ll be moving back to Winona and really increasing our efforts, increasing our sales force.  What we've determined is that we need specialists to really get -- especially the state level more than anything -- to get involved in those and understand the pricing, understand the programs. And so we're going to renew our efforts. We're going to work hard. But the opportunity is tremendous when you look at the percentage of the GDP that's controlled by some type of government spending. We're just not getting our share at this point. But we believe we're really well positioned to do that because we have the model where we can ship direct from a warehouse if that's what the customer or the state wants. Or we can ship from a local store and a lot of the smaller entities really prefer the local service. So we have kind of a one-two punch that some of our competitors don't have."

The only construction that we're seeing outside of big energy right now is either healthcare or government. We see hospitals and clinics getting built, and that's a very good business for us. We see government; like here in Winona there's a big new health complex at the University getting built, which is good for us, but we're not seeing the Targets and the Wal-Marts and all these other strip malls that were being built a few years ago.

And they’re not going to spend any money they don't have to. And I think I said this in the third quarter conference call, it was one of the earlier ones, I don't foresee a lot of restocking at any point because people learn that they can live with less. And that's actually very good for our business if they don't restock, because -- if you have local inventory, like a Fastenal store, and you can depend on that, then you don't need inventory. The less they have, the more our value proposition plays well for us and plays well for them. But I really would be surprised to see a lot of manufacturers coming back and putting in big inventories of things that they maybe could live without at this point. The one thing we are seeing a nice improvement on is a lot more interest in our vending systems because we can control spend and they know exactly what they have. I'm very bullish on vending. It’s a very small part of our business. But it just makes complete sense to me where you put a small store, essentially a store of 10 or 20 or 100 items into a plant, a warehouse, a site, and then they have complete control and it reduces what they need."

Good morning, everybody, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call. I want to thank all the Fastenal people because we were able to produce good numbers this quarter due to a lot of hard work by all the people on the team.As you can see, our sales grew faster than we had thought, or than were estimated coming in at 6.4% growth. But very close to the pattern that Dan and I had talked about on the fourth quarter call, very similar to the pattern. What we've seen is geographically, it's spread wide. We've seen improvement in every geographic area of the country, and internationally, we've seen nice improvement month-to-month. So it's not coming back from this one area or one group of customers. It's very widespread. It seems like somewhat of an economic rebound, not fast, coming back slow but it is more positive. And I've been out with a lot of customers in different companies recently. And I'm hearing more of that, that people are becoming slightly more optimistic about the future.From an end-market standpoint, our manufacturing customers grew at 16% year-over-year, so very nice growth there. But our construction, our Non-Residential Construction customers actually dropped 15% year-over-year. And so that's very much a concern. And right now, we don't foresee that coming back much in 2010, if at all. And so we're really looking beyond 2010 for some good growth, meaningful improvement in the Non-Residential Construction customers. Fortunately, they only make up less than 25% of our business. But it's still, it's a meaningful hit. And I believe that's why we're not breaking out of the improvement pattern that we talked about. I thought we would actually go above the pattern but the construction is holding us back somewhat.But all in all, I think we're making nice improvement sequentially from a sales standpoint. And it's also encouraging that it's widespread geographically. From a gross margin standpoint, we talked about three different areas, inflation, rebates and incentives and then our regular point of sale or sales margin over-the-counter.For this first quarter, inflation was pretty much neutral. We've kind of reached the point where we're kind of annualizing over the last year where it was. Going forward though, steel prices are going up. And we see that will be coming into our selling prices in the – somewhat in the second quarter but more in the second half of this year. We're watching steel very closely, trying to determine how much we should be buying and how long we think this will – it will continue to go up and right now, it appears that it probably will for a while. There's a lot of Asian demand for steel.On the rebate side, we picked up about 35 points of the – 120 basis points, excuse me, our margins came in at 51.1, of the 120 basis points improvement quarter-to-quarter, 35 basis points came from our rebates. And that will continue to improve as we go into the year, as that inventory makes up more of our – or those purchases make up more of our overall inventory. So that's a tailwind that we have going right now. And we expect about a 70 basis point improvement for the year, so that kind of plays out into the second, third and fourth quarters. But the most positive thing on the gross margin is what we call our point of sale margin, POS margin, was up 85 basis points for the quarter. And that's about transactions at the counter, that's about passing price increases or just getting better at how we transact our business. And so that's a very positive sign going forward. And we're very optimistic that we'll continue to see improvement in our margin.From an expense standpoint, I have to applaud the team. I think most people have done a nice job of controlling the expenses, looking at the little things; the big stuff’s easy to find. It's the little, everyday transactions and saving a few dollars here, a few dollars there that really make the difference, especially a year into it because we found a lot of the big stuff early. We were able to grow our business at almost 6.5% and reduce our SG&A at 2.5%. So that's really the difference in the growth in our profitability, against the difficult margin comparisons. We gave up some on the gross margin but we picked it all back up, plus some on the expense. Our labor was down 4% year-over-year, and that's a positive. But the real positive in that is that the bonuses grew substantially. Our district managers, which are the group of people that oversee the stores, there's about 200 of those, that group, 208 people I believe. Their bonuses more than doubled from the fourth quarter. So that's very positive. We're also in a position to start contributing to our 401(k) match again with a formula where we don't contribute unless our pretax earnings is greater than 16%. And because we have that, we were able to contribute $800,000 to our 401(k) match. So labor was down 4%, but bonuses are up in the 401(k) matches is back in place. So the morale should be good and we're very, very positive, a good sign of what we're doing and good sign of the work that's being done in the field. Another positive was we were able to hold our inventory flat for the quarter, actually reduce it about $1 million from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, we're down 9% or just over $40 million, again good work by the team. We're going to see a little pressure if steel prices, or as steel prices go up in the second half of the year. But even with that pressure, we think that we can manage our inventory without much increase at all throughout the 2010 calendar year.New store openings. We opened 29 stores in the first quarter. About what we had said, that we're going to be conservative in the first half of the year and then if business trends continue to be strong we'll open it up in the second half. We see the second quarter with similar store openings somewhere in that high 20s, maybe low 30s. The quarter will start out very slow. April we only – if any, we'll have one or two stores, I'm not sure. We have a big customer show in Indianapolis this week. We started late with Easter and then we have a big customer event, which really takes the time of almost all of our people, so April will be very slow. But for the quarter we're looking at about somewhere around the same number as the first quarter, around 30 openings, which we're comfortable with. At that pace, if we kept it all year it would give us 5% openings, but if things pick up, we'd turn that up a little bit in the second half of the year.We also see that we'll be doing some hiring in the second half. And that will only be in the store locations. We don't foresee any additional support staff, even in distribution. We're working very, very hard, our distribution people are to find new and better ways to run their distribution centers, providing a high level of service without adding a lot of additional expense. There's a lot of motivation out there because these people get paid off, the way they manage their expenses, and right now they'd like to increase their bonuses. And the best way to do that is productivity. There's no better way in distribution to improve their pay than becoming more productive. So that's a real positive.So in summarizing, what we see for the second quarter and going forward into the year, we see improved sales growth. We think our daily numbers will improve throughout the second quarter. Basically what we had talked about in the first quarter, staying right on pattern, the historical pattern. We see our margin improving again in the second quarter, up from where we ended the first quarter, or reported in the first quarter. We see holding our inventory flat for the second quarter. And depending on what steel does, we think we can hold it flat for the entire calendar year or very close. We won't see much build in inventory this year because we're doing a lot of things to try and become more efficient with the use and still provide very good customer service. We'll open, as I said, a similar number of stores. And we will do -- be doing some hiring. So if you look at your models and you look at where Fastenal’s going to be at the end of the second quarter, those are some things that you can consider while you're doing your work. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan is going to give you more in-depth information on what we saw in the quarter. Thank you very much."

And thank you for participating in our call. As Will touched on, the two important factors in the quarter, our sales trends continue to improve and the gross margin percentage improved from what we saw in the",1283,"Thank you, Will, and good morning, everybody. And thank you for participating in our call. As Will touched on, the two important factors in the quarter, our sales trends continue to improve and the gross margin percentage improved from what we saw in the fourth quarter. As Will mentioned, our end-market information, our Manufacturing business is coming back nicely as we expected. Non-Residential is going to continue to be a headwind for us as we go through 2010. At least we believe it is.On Page 2, of the release, we talk about some of the mechanical pieces of the business, the growth of stores over a certain age. Very pleased to see the progress we made in the March month especially, as it relates to our five-plus-year-old stores. Those stores historically are much more economically sensitive because of the market share they have in their local market. And that group of stores grew 7.5% in April. And so – and we hadn't seen growth out of that store, group of stores, since late in 2008. So it's nice to see that group on the positive side of the ledger again. And because of the sales buy into that group, they meaningfully moved our two-plus year-old stores for our same-store comps, which were positive in each month of the first quarter, moved almost 10% growth in the month of March.The sales trends, the stairway analogy we started talking about last year as we were really looking at not – sometimes the year-over-year numbers become a little bit confusing when you're in a period of dramatic change in our top line. And so sometimes looking at it from the standpoint of where am I today, where will I be tomorrow and the next day and the next day, is a better frame of reference. On the January call, we talked a lot about the sales trends. And when you lay out where we were at the end of the year, we really felt that based on historical patterns that we laid out, that our growth in March, our daily average growth, will be somewhere in the 11%, 11.5% neighborhood. The Holo-Krome acquisition added about 60 basis points to that number. And essentially got us to the 12.1%, where we're at. We've slightly beat the trends that we had laid out starting in January.If you follow that progression, in the press release they also introduce not only the mechanical view of the plus-percent or minus-percent month to month but a graph that starts it out, and you can see on that, that our 2010 to-date numbers are trending very closely to that past pattern that we've talked about. We believe our sales growth will, based on that trend, will hit the high watermark as we're going through the second quarter and into July. And then as history would say, our daily average number, we believe, will peak out in the September/October timeframe, which will set us up then for 2011, but very pleased thus far, with the trends in the pattern relative to the historical pattern. And as Will mentioned, if construction were helping us out at all, we'd be in a position to be beating that trend line and beating it nicely.The pathway to profit, I'm happy to say we're back on the path. And I tried to incorporate a few more details of headcount numbers and store locations so you can get a good view from our business in first quarter of 2007, the quarter immediately before we started the 'pathway to profit' in April of '07 and where we are today. If you look at some of the pieces since Q1 of '07, our store count is up about 15.5%. Our store FTE headcount is up about 10%. And our remaining FTE, including distribution, manufacturing and support is down about 7%. And that plays into what we had talked about when we started the 'pathway to profit' that it was really a top line growth model that we believe would allow us to leverage our infrastructure, leverage our support costs and drive our operating margin up over time as our average store size grew. 2009 put quite a damper into our ability to grow our average store size, in fact, it contracted in 2009. But the 'pathway to profit' and what we laid out in 2007, we feel is committed to and as strongly about today as we did then with the benefit of a few – now three years of history under the pathway.Gross profit margin as Will mentioned, we improved 120 basis points from where we were in Q4 of '09. Largely by our transactional margin, our point-of-sale margin improvement. And in a piece also from vendor volume allowances, rebate programs, et cetera. As Will mentioned, we would anticipate that portion continuing to improve mechanically, whereas as the transactional margin, we believe will continue to improve because of execution. And I believe we've positioned ourselves well as we go into Q2 and Q3 to continue to improve that, because we still are about 180 basis points below where we were first quarter of '09. And we want that back.Looking at the operating and administrative expenses, we did, I believe, a nice job with that. The payroll, total payroll cost, as Will mentioned, down from a year ago despite the fact that our bonus – that payouts were nicely increased from what we saw in most of 2009, as well as the 401(k) contribution. Occupancy improved year-over-year. That's one we still need some work on; we still need work on the base-front side of it. Our improvement was largely centered on the fact that our store personnel and our district personal did a nice job of getting green. And when I talk about getting green, I'm talking about the money-kind of green and the fact that they're just being smarter with how we manage our heating and cooling costs. They're being smarter with how we manage that when we're not at the locations and we lowered our utility costs year-over-year despite the fact that a few prices are moving upward. And so I believe that's something that's a sustainable item. We've done nice progress on lowering our base trends but we still need to push hard on that because our goal under the 'pathway to profit' was to lower, over time as our average store size grew, our occupancy costs as a percentage of sales from just over 600, 650 basis points down to about 400 basis points as our average store size grows. And so we still have some work to do there but we've made nice progress over the last 12 months.Working capital again, came in very much in line with what we were thinking. The accounts receivable on a year-over-year basis grew actually nominally better than our sales growth. So we obtained a little improvement in our days out. And our inventory, we continued to manage that very closely and we'll anticipate that as Will mentioned, continuing through for the balance of the year. Because of the improvement in earnings and the working capital management, did a nice job with our operating cash flow. We produced 141% of sales in operating cash. If you take out our capital expenditures, we produced 128% of earnings in free cash flow, operating cash minus capital expenditures. With that, I will turn it back over to moderator for the question and answer. And as we've done in the past, we would ask that folks ask one question and we'll try to cycle back through. It allows as many people that have questions to jump into queue and have those questions answered. Thank you."

And the transaction frequency is low enough, and it's an inventory item that isn't a problem solver. The one thing we're always very cautious of, or very conscience of when we're looking at what we want in our stores is the inventory that, at the end of the day, solves problems for customers because that's the stuff you need right then and there. And having a base of inventory in the store that would service -- that would get the customer started, if they needed it right now. So maybe they need 2,000 of something; we have 800 in the store but we can get the other 1,200 in by 6:30 tomorrow morning off a distribution center so being very conscious of balancing that over time.

But anecdotally, you listen to people, you talk to people and there's not as much crazy price -- we're not hearing the stories that we heard a year ago about this guy’s giving it away or these prices are ridiculous. That has toned down a lot. So there's something to that, but it’s, like I say, almost impossible to measure. The initiatives have been about -- we've done a much better job of dissecting our business and thinking at the transactional level. Not looking at a district with 10 stores and saying, hey, your margin’s up a point or down a point. We’re breaking it down to the transaction and saying why did we do discount at this level for this type of customer? And about nine months ago, Dan tapped a couple of young guys that worked for us, worked for us for several years; two bright guys and said would you like to work for me and do nothing but break this data down and tell us where we're doing a good job and where we aren't? And as you can guess, we’ve discovered a lot of areas that -- and we're very decentralized. You have to understand that our people make prices in the field; some are really good at it and some aren't.  And so part of this improvement is coming from their hard work; just identifying opportunities, identifying prices or stores that are selling the same product to the same type of customer for five or 10 or 15 points less. And that's where a lot of the improvement is coming from. So it's the combination of a little less pressure from the guy next door, the competitor, and more good information to drive our middle manager, our district managers to make better decisions or train better decision-making."

The 'pathway to profit', we had put in more investment in some of these small trucks -- or small stores, extra trucks, extra people. And in the downturn, we didn't seem to be getting much benefit. So in July of last year, I went to some of my director parts, Dan included, and we divided up the regions. We each took two or three of them and just started working with the regionals on identifying opportunities in these small stores. Kind of a game – not that I, it was fun because we had – project, not a game. And we really focused on. As you can see, we reduced our losses from basically 20 -- by about 10 percentage points. So we did a really nice job there, and we think that's sustainable. Actually, we think we’ll improve from there; because the first quarter is a little difficult to give you higher occupancy and lower revenues. So what it really was is purely attention.On the larger stores, it was a reduction in gross margin. If you look at our growth, a lot of it’s coming from manufacturing. A lot of the manufacturing is large customers. Typically, you run into slightly lower margin and a lot of that business runs through those bigger stores. So the bigger stores have given up some margin. But when you can report 25%, 26% operating profit, I'm not as concerned if I give up a half or point of gross margin when you can still get those kinds of returns. As Bob Kierlin, our founder has always beat into my head for 30 years, Will, it's not about the gross margins it's about where it comes out on the return, and -- or even the operating or pretax -- it's about what we get on return on that business. And those businesses are highly profitable and great businesses to own."

We think there's a tremendous opportunity, not only federal and state but also the local level; the schools, all the cities and things like that. There's a tremendous amount of spend there and we have openly admitted that we're behind in that to some of our competitors. So what we've done is we’ve restructured that internally. We tapped one of our regional vice presidents that actually has a – he was the guy that got us into it 10 or 15 years ago, as a District Manager, he opened our first government store. His name’s John Soderberg. He was running our Seattle region. He’s going to be moving back to Winona -- has already taken the role; will be moving back to Winona and really increasing our efforts, increasing our sales force.  What we've determined is that we need specialists to really get -- especially the state level more than anything -- to get involved in those and understand the pricing, understand the programs. And so we're going to renew our efforts. We're going to work hard. But the opportunity is tremendous when you look at the percentage of the GDP that's controlled by some type of government spending. We're just not getting our share at this point. But we believe we're really well positioned to do that because we have the model where we can ship direct from a warehouse if that's what the customer or the state wants. Or we can ship from a local store and a lot of the smaller entities really prefer the local service. So we have kind of a one-two punch that some of our competitors don't have."

We can see it flattening out, but our concern is there aren’t a lot of starts and there's a lot of concern in the commercial real estate business, which is really the start of our commercial development. Where we do see some positives are there's a lot of talk about energy. There's still a lot of money – with a little higher oil price, there’s a lot of money going into refineries and things like that. But to really get the bump that we need from construction, we need small-to-medium jobs starting up in communities like Winona and all over the country. The only construction that we're seeing outside of big energy right now is either healthcare or government. We see hospitals and clinics getting built, and that's a very good business for us. We see government; like here in Winona there's a big new health complex at the university getting built, which is good for us, but we're not seeing the Targets and the Wal-Marts and all these other strip malls that were being built a few years ago. It might flatten out.

My thought right now is the gut feeling that I have is that there's not going to be a lot of restocking soon because there’s still uncertainty in our economy.

And they’re not going to spend any money they don't have to. And I think I said this in the third quarter conference call, it was one of the earlier ones, I don't foresee a lot of restocking at any point because people learn that they can live with less. And that's actually very good for our business if they don't restock, because -- if you have local inventory, like a Fastenal store, and you can depend on that, then you don't need inventory. The less they have, the more our value proposition plays well for us and plays well for them. But I really would be surprised to see a lot of manufacturers coming back and putting in big inventories of things that they maybe could live without at this point. The one thing we are seeing a nice improvement on is a lot more interest in our vending systems because we can control spend and they know exactly what they have. I'm very bullish on vending. It’s a very small part of our business. But it just makes complete sense to me where you put a small store, essentially a store of 10 or 20 or 100 items into a plant, a warehouse, a site, and then they have complete control and it reduces what they need."

Good morning, everybody, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call. I want to thank all the Fastenal people because we were able to produce good numbers this quarter due to a lot of hard work by all the people on the team.As you can see, our sales grew faster than we had thought, or than were estimated coming in at 6.4% growth. But very close to the pattern that Dan and I had talked about on the fourth quarter call, very similar to the pattern. What we've seen is geographically, it's spread wide. We've seen improvement in every geographic area of the country, and internationally, we've seen nice improvement month-to-month. So it's not coming back from this one area or one group of customers. It's very widespread. It seems like somewhat of an economic rebound, not fast, coming back slow but it is more positive. And I've been out with a lot of customers in different companies recently. And I'm hearing more of that, that people are becoming slightly more optimistic about the future.From an end-market standpoint, our manufacturing customers grew at 16% year-over-year, so very nice growth there. But our construction, our Non-Residential Construction customers actually dropped 15% year-over-year. And so that's very much a concern. And right now, we don't foresee that coming back much in 2010, if at all. And so we're really looking beyond 2010 for some good growth, meaningful improvement in the Non-Residential Construction customers. Fortunately, they only make up less than 25% of our business. But it's still, it's a meaningful hit. And I believe that's why we're not breaking out of the improvement pattern that we talked about. I thought we would actually go above the pattern but the construction is holding us back somewhat.But all in all, I think we're making nice improvement sequentially from a sales standpoint. And it's also encouraging that it's widespread geographically. From a gross margin standpoint, we talked about three different areas, inflation, rebates and incentives and then our regular point of sale or sales margin over-the-counter.For this first quarter, inflation was pretty much neutral. We've kind of reached the point where we're kind of annualizing over the last year where it was. Going forward though, steel prices are going up. And we see that will be coming into our selling prices in the – somewhat in the second quarter but more in the second half of this year. We're watching steel very closely, trying to determine how much we should be buying and how long we think this will – it will continue to go up and right now, it appears that it probably will for a while. There's a lot of Asian demand for steel.On the rebate side, we picked up about 35 points of the – 120 basis points, excuse me, our margins came in at 51.1, of the 120 basis points improvement quarter-to-quarter, 35 basis points came from our rebates. And that will continue to improve as we go into the year, as that inventory makes up more of our – or those purchases make up more of our overall inventory. So that's a tailwind that we have going right now. And we expect about a 70 basis point improvement for the year, so that kind of plays out into the second, third and fourth quarters. But the most positive thing on the gross margin is what we call our point of sale margin, POS margin, was up 85 basis points for the quarter. And that's about transactions at the counter, that's about passing price increases or just getting better at how we transact our business. And so that's a very positive sign going forward. And we're very optimistic that we'll continue to see improvement in our margin.From an expense standpoint, I have to applaud the team. I think most people have done a nice job of controlling the expenses, looking at the little things; the big stuff’s easy to find. It's the little, everyday transactions and saving a few dollars here, a few dollars there that really make the difference, especially a year into it because we found a lot of the big stuff early. We were able to grow our business at almost 6.5% and reduce our SG&A at 2.5%. So that's really the difference in the growth in our profitability, against the difficult margin comparisons. We gave up some on the gross margin but we picked it all back up, plus some on the expense. Our labor was down 4% year-over-year, and that's a positive. But the real positive in that is that the bonuses grew substantially. Our district managers, which are the group of people that oversee the stores, there's about 200 of those, that group, 208 people I believe. Their bonuses more than doubled from the fourth quarter. So that's very positive. We're also in a position to start contributing to our 401(k) match again with a formula where we don't contribute unless our pretax earnings is greater than 16%. And because we have that, we were able to contribute $800,000 to our 401(k) match. So labor was down 4%, but bonuses are up in the 401(k) matches is back in place. So the morale should be good and we're very, very positive, a good sign of what we're doing and good sign of the work that's being done in the field. Another positive was we were able to hold our inventory flat for the quarter, actually reduce it about $1 million from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, we're down 9% or just over $40 million, again good work by the team. We're going to see a little pressure if steel prices, or as steel prices go up in the second half of the year. But even with that pressure, we think that we can manage our inventory without much increase at all throughout the 2010 calendar year.New store openings. We opened 29 stores in the first quarter. About what we had said, that we're going to be conservative in the first half of the year and then if business trends continue to be strong we'll open it up in the second half. We see the second quarter with similar store openings somewhere in that high 20s, maybe low 30s. The quarter will start out very slow. April we only – if any, we'll have one or two stores, I'm not sure. We have a big customer show in Indianapolis this week. We started late with Easter and then we have a big customer event, which really takes the time of almost all of our people, so April will be very slow. But for the quarter we're looking at about somewhere around the same number as the first quarter, around 30 openings, which we're comfortable with. At that pace, if we kept it all year it would give us 5% openings, but if things pick up, we'd turn that up a little bit in the second half of the year.We also see that we'll be doing some hiring in the second half. And that will only be in the store locations. We don't foresee any additional support staff, even in distribution. We're working very, very hard, our distribution people are to find new and better ways to run their distribution centers, providing a high level of service without adding a lot of additional expense. There's a lot of motivation out there because these people get paid off, the way they manage their expenses, and right now they'd like to increase their bonuses. And the best way to do that is productivity. There's no better way in distribution to improve their pay than becoming more productive. So that's a real positive.So in summarizing, what we see for the second quarter and going forward into the year, we see improved sales growth. We think our daily numbers will improve throughout the second quarter. Basically what we had talked about in the first quarter, staying right on pattern, the historical pattern. We see our margin improving again in the second quarter, up from where we ended the first quarter, or reported in the first quarter. We see holding our inventory flat for the second quarter. And depending on what steel does, we think we can hold it flat for the entire calendar year or very close. We won't see much build in inventory this year because we're doing a lot of things to try and become more efficient with the use and still provide very good customer service. We'll open, as I said, a similar number of stores. And we will do -- be doing some hiring. So if you look at your models and you look at where Fastenal’s going to be at the end of the second quarter, those are some things that you can consider while you're doing your work. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan is going to give you more in-depth information on what we saw in the quarter. Thank you very much."

And thank you for participating in our call. As Will touched on, the two important factors in the quarter, our sales trends continue to improve and the gross margin percentage improved from what we saw in the",1283,"Thank you, Will, and good morning, everybody. And thank you for participating in our call. As Will touched on, the two important factors in the quarter, our sales trends continue to improve and the gross margin percentage improved from what we saw in the fourth quarter. As Will mentioned, our end-market information, our Manufacturing business is coming back nicely as we expected. Non-Residential is going to continue to be a headwind for us as we go through 2010. At least we believe it is.On Page 2, of the release, we talk about some of the mechanical pieces of the business, the growth of stores over a certain age. Very pleased to see the progress we made in the March month especially, as it relates to our five-plus-year-old stores. Those stores historically are much more economically sensitive because of the market share they have in their local market. And that group of stores grew 7.5% in April. And so – and we hadn't seen growth out of that store, group of stores, since late in 2008. So it's nice to see that group on the positive side of the ledger again. And because of the sales buy into that group, they meaningfully moved our two-plus year-old stores for our same-store comps, which were positive in each month of the first quarter, moved almost 10% growth in the month of March.The sales trends, the stairway analogy we started talking about last year as we were really looking at not – sometimes the year-over-year numbers become a little bit confusing when you're in a period of dramatic change in our top line. And so sometimes looking at it from the standpoint of where am I today, where will I be tomorrow and the next day and the next day, is a better frame of reference. On the January call, we talked a lot about the sales trends. And when you lay out where we were at the end of the year, we really felt that based on historical patterns that we laid out, that our growth in March, our daily average growth, will be somewhere in the 11%, 11.5% neighborhood. The Holo-Krome acquisition added about 60 basis points to that number. And essentially got us to the 12.1%, where we're at. We've slightly beat the trends that we had laid out starting in January.If you follow that progression, in the press release they also introduce not only the mechanical view of the plus-percent or minus-percent month to month but a graph that starts it out, and you can see on that, that our 2010 to-date numbers are trending very closely to that past pattern that we've talked about. We believe our sales growth will, based on that trend, will hit the high watermark as we're going through the second quarter and into July. And then as history would say, our daily average number, we believe, will peak out in the September/October timeframe, which will set us up then for 2011, but very pleased thus far, with the trends in the pattern relative to the historical pattern. And as Will mentioned, if construction were helping us out at all, we'd be in a position to be beating that trend line and beating it nicely.The pathway to profit, I'm happy to say we're back on the path. And I tried to incorporate a few more details of headcount numbers and store locations so you can get a good view from our business in first quarter of 2007, the quarter immediately before we started the 'pathway to profit' in April of '07 and where we are today. If you look at some of the pieces since Q1 of '07, our store count is up about 15.5%. Our store FTE headcount is up about 10%. And our remaining FTE, including distribution, manufacturing and support is down about 7%. And that plays into what we had talked about when we started the 'pathway to profit' that it was really a top line growth model that we believe would allow us to leverage our infrastructure, leverage our support costs and drive our operating margin up over time as our average store size grew. 2009 put quite a damper into our ability to grow our average store size, in fact, it contracted in 2009. But the 'pathway to profit' and what we laid out in 2007, we feel is committed to and as strongly about today as we did then with the benefit of a few – now three years of history under the pathway.Gross profit margin as Will mentioned, we improved 120 basis points from where we were in Q4 of '09. Largely by our transactional margin, our point-of-sale margin improvement. And in a piece also from vendor volume allowances, rebate programs, et cetera. As Will mentioned, we would anticipate that portion continuing to improve mechanically, whereas as the transactional margin, we believe will continue to improve because of execution. And I believe we've positioned ourselves well as we go into Q2 and Q3 to continue to improve that, because we still are about 180 basis points below where we were first quarter of '09. And we want that back.Looking at the operating and administrative expenses, we did, I believe, a nice job with that. The payroll, total payroll cost, as Will mentioned, down from a year ago despite the fact that our bonus – that payouts were nicely increased from what we saw in most of 2009, as well as the 401(k) contribution. Occupancy improved year-over-year. That's one we still need some work on; we still need work on the base-front side of it. Our improvement was largely centered on the fact that our store personnel and our district personal did a nice job of getting green. And when I talk about getting green, I'm talking about the money-kind of green and the fact that they're just being smarter with how we manage our heating and cooling costs. They're being smarter with how we manage that when we're not at the locations and we lowered our utility costs year-over-year despite the fact that a few prices are moving upward. And so I believe that's something that's a sustainable item. We've done nice progress on lowering our base trends but we still need to push hard on that because our goal under the 'pathway to profit' was to lower, over time as our average store size grew, our occupancy costs as a percentage of sales from just over 600, 650 basis points down to about 400 basis points as our average store size grows. And so we still have some work to do there but we've made nice progress over the last 12 months.Working capital again, came in very much in line with what we were thinking. The accounts receivable on a year-over-year basis grew actually nominally better than our sales growth. So we obtained a little improvement in our days out. And our inventory, we continued to manage that very closely and we'll anticipate that as Will mentioned, continuing through for the balance of the year. Because of the improvement in earnings and the working capital management, did a nice job with our operating cash flow. We produced 141% of sales in operating cash. If you take out our capital expenditures, we produced 128% of earnings in free cash flow, operating cash minus capital expenditures. With that, I will turn it back over to moderator for the question and answer. And as we've done in the past, we would ask that folks ask one question and we'll try to cycle back through. It allows as many people that have questions to jump into queue and have those questions answered. Thank you."

But as our Fastener business, most – a high percentage of that is imported, so it's a slower process that takes us eight to 12 weeks and bring it into inventory, it's slow turning inventory. So if you look at the entire year, the first half, very little inflation and the second half, we'll probably see some positive price increases. And historically, we've done a good job, or been able to pass that through to the customer in the last couple of times and it's gone up to so we're comfortable we can do that again."

And the transaction frequency is low enough, and it's an inventory item that isn't a problem solver. The one thing we're always very cautious of, or very conscience of when we're looking at what we want in our stores is the inventory that, at the end of the day, solves problems for customers because that's the stuff you need right then and there. And having a base of inventory in the store that would service -- that would get the customer started, if they needed it right now. So maybe they need 2,000 of something; we have 800 in the store but we can get the other 1,200 in by 6:30 tomorrow morning off a distribution center so being very conscious of balancing that over time. Because the inventory reduction of 2009, really what we did is we eliminated the inventory growth that occurred in 2008 when the economy shut off."

But anecdotally, you listen to people, you talk to people and there's not as much crazy price -- we're not hearing the stories that we heard a year ago about this guy’s giving it away or these prices are ridiculous. That has toned down a lot. So there's something to that, but it’s, like I say, almost impossible to measure. The initiatives have been about -- we've done a much better job of dissecting our business and thinking at the transactional level. Not looking at a district with 10 stores and saying, hey, your margin’s up a point or down a point. We’re breaking it down to the transaction and saying why did we do discount at this level for this type of customer? And about nine months ago, Dan tapped a couple of young guys that worked for us, worked for us for several years; two bright guys and said would you like to work for me and do nothing but break this data down and tell us where we're doing a good job and where we aren't? And as you can guess, we’ve discovered a lot of areas that -- and we're very decentralized. You have to understand that our people make prices in the field; some are really good at it and some aren't.  And so part of this improvement is coming from their hard work; just identifying opportunities, identifying prices or stores that are selling the same product to the same type of customer for five or 10 or 15 points less. And that's where a lot of the improvement is coming from. So it's the combination of a little less pressure from the guy next door, the competitor, and more good information to drive our middle manager, our district managers to make better decisions or train better decision-making."

The 'pathway to profit', we had put in more investment in some of these small trucks -- or small stores, extra trucks, extra people. And in the downturn, we didn't seem to be getting much benefit. So in July of last year, I went to some of my director parts, Dan included, and we divided up the regions. We each took two or three of them and just started working with the regionals on identifying opportunities in these small stores. Kind of a game – not that I, it was fun because we had – project, not a game. And we really focused on. As you can see, we reduced our losses from basically 20 -- by about 10 percentage points. So we did a really nice job there, and we think that's sustainable. Actually, we think we’ll improve from there; because the first quarter is a little difficult to give you higher occupancy and lower revenues. So what it really was is purely attention.On the larger stores, it was a reduction in gross margin. If you look at our growth, a lot of it’s coming from manufacturing. A lot of the manufacturing is large customers. Typically, you run into slightly lower margin and a lot of that business runs through those bigger stores. So the bigger stores have given up some margin. But when you can report 25%, 26% operating profit, I'm not as concerned if I give up a half or point of gross margin when you can still get those kinds of returns. As Bob Kierlin, our founder has always beat into my head for 30 years, Will, it's not about the gross margins it's about where it comes out on the return, and -- or even the operating or pretax -- it's about what we get on return on that business.

There's a tremendous amount of spend there and we have openly admitted that we're behind in that to some of our competitors. So what we've done is we’ve restructured that internally. We tapped one of our regional vice presidents that actually has a – he was the guy that got us into it 10 or 15 years ago, as a District Manager, he opened our first government store. His name’s John Soderberg. He was running our Seattle region. He’s going to be moving back to Winona -- has already taken the role; will be moving back to Winona and really increasing our efforts, increasing our sales force.  What we've determined is that we need specialists to really get -- especially the state level more than anything -- to get involved in those and understand the pricing, understand the programs. And so we're going to renew our efforts. We're going to work hard. But the opportunity is tremendous when you look at the percentage of the GDP that's controlled by some type of government spending. We're just not getting our share at this point. But we believe we're really well positioned to do that because we have the model where we can ship direct from a warehouse if that's what the customer or the state wants. Or we can ship from a local store and a lot of the smaller entities really prefer the local service. So we have kind of a one-two punch that some of our competitors don't have."

Where we do see some positives are there's a lot of talk about energy. There's still a lot of money – with a little higher oil price, there’s a lot of money going into refineries and things like that. But to really get the bump that we need from construction, we need small-to-medium jobs starting up in communities like Winona and all over the country. The only construction that we're seeing outside of big energy right now is either healthcare or government. We see hospitals and clinics getting built, and that's a very good business for us. We see government; like here in Winona there's a big new health complex at the university getting built, which is good for us, but we're not seeing the Targets and the Wal-Marts and all these other strip malls that were being built a few years ago. It might flatten out.

My thought right now is the gut feeling that I have is that there's not going to be a lot of restocking soon because there’s still uncertainty in our economy.

And they’re not going to spend any money they don't have to. And I think I said this in the third quarter conference call, it was one of the earlier ones, I don't foresee a lot of restocking at any point because people learn that they can live with less. And that's actually very good for our business if they don't restock, because -- if you have local inventory, like a Fastenal store, and you can depend on that, then you don't need inventory. The less they have, the more our value proposition plays well for us and plays well for them. But I really would be surprised to see a lot of manufacturers coming back and putting in big inventories of things that they maybe could live without at this point. The one thing we are seeing a nice improvement on is a lot more interest in our vending systems because we can control spend and they know exactly what they have. I'm very bullish on vending. It’s a very small part of our business. But it just makes complete sense to me where you put a small store, essentially a store of 10 or 20 or 100 items into a plant, a warehouse, a site, and then they have complete control and it reduces what they need."

Also, I thank everybody for the support you have given us over the last several quarters because things have been a little tougher and we are starting to bring it back. I’m very proud to report",1571,"Thank you, Ellen. And thank everybody for joining us today. Also, I thank everybody for the support you have given us over the last several quarters because things have been a little tougher and we are starting to bring it back. I’m very proud to report that we had a nice quarter. The second quarter turned out very well for Fastenal. Our sales are really on track with where we thought they would be.
If you recall back to our January conference call, Dan and I talked about the sequential trends and where we thought they would come out. And after the call, we got some people who were cautioning us on being a little bit optimistic, but fortunately they have played out exactly where we thought they would be.
If you look at the trend line, I believe five out of six months have been at or above the sequential pattern - historical sequential pattern. June came in right at 21.1%. At the end of May, we thought maybe June would do a little bit better, but actually it turned out that May was just a blockbuster month. We had a lot of things lined up for us. And so we are not at all disappointed with June. May was just a spectacular month.
The sales really were driven by our manufacturing customers, which were up 29.8% for the company - for the quarter, excuse me. Very, very good pattern. Construction customers did come back just a little bit. They were way down in the first quarter, came back to flat to plus 0.5%. So that’s actually a very positive sign. We don’t see a lot of activity there, but in some of the areas like oil and gas and some of the other more mechanical areas of construction we are seeing some life coming into that business.
Our active accounts have not been growing the way that we would like them to. They were up 3% for the quarter. We have done a lot of research trying to understand that better, and what we found, it’s really being driven by the lack of actives as being caused by two things. One is that our construction customers, a lot of the residential, which isn’t a big piece of our business, but it’s a big piece of our actives, and the small commercial contractors are just not showing up with the frequency they did at one time. Many of them are just very - not a lot of business.
The other thing that’s hurting our active accounts is that we have opened fewer stores, and new stores have always been one of the greatest drivers of active accounts. So all of the actives were only up 3%. We are pretty comfortable with where we are after we have looked at the data. In the manufacturing side, we had very nice growth in actives and that’s driving that 29.8% growth in manufacturing business.
Gross margins came in at 52.1%, right on track with where we thought they would be. And Dan is going to give a little more color later in the call telling you where the breakdown is, but we are improving in all areas of our business with the gross margin. And we are comfortable that that trend will continue going forward based on everything that we are seeing.
I’m very happy with the progress or the results that we are able to show on expense control. Our expenses were up 7.9% against the 20% sales growth. And if you take out the labor, we did a great job and pretty much every area of expense control. And the reason I see take out the labor is the two components of labor are base salary or standard pay was in great shape, but our commissions and bonuses were way up. And that’s a great problem.
It’s great for our employees to come back and make good bonuses and good connections. And that’s a problem that we would take every day. So overall expense is up less than 8%. I think everybody in the field, everybody on the Fastenal team has done a really nice job of hold the line when things are picking up. And it’s not easy at this time because we’ve been really tight for about 18 months, but it seems like everyone is rallying to make that happen.
At the beginning of the year, we talked - Dan and I and all the regional and senior people talked to people all year long and we said we really have - if things go well, our expenses are going to go up for one of two reasons; either we get a little bit loose and just spend the money on miscellaneous things or we stay real tight when we spend the money on bonuses. And I’m happy to report to you and to the Fastenal employees that we are able to spend it on bonuses, not the other things, so that people get their jobs.
Headcount standpoint, our headcount was up a little bit. I actually had hoped that our store headcount would have grown a little more. We will see headcount growth throughout the year, not much in support. We are going to hold very tight in support and distribution. We may see a little bit in the distribution as volume picks up. But through the rest of the year, I can see between 300 and 500 FTE at the store site spread throughout the year. And that’s really just to deal with the volume and make sure that we continue on the (inaudible) calling on customers.
Most of that at the store would be part-time employees and a handful of full-time sales people. Another group of sales specialists are people that we are going to be adding, and these people will come out of our stores and be replaced by newer employees, as we are adding between 80 and 95 sales specialists. And some of those came into the second quarter and the rest would be added mainly in the third and the fourth quarter.
These people will be sales specialists in various areas, from government sales, vending sales, manufacturing sales, product specialists, that would be out working with our customers, driving business through our stores to help drive up the average store size. We have had some very good results with people we’ve put in earlier in the year, and so we are going to continue to add that again to drive people - drive revenue through our existing store sites.
Another area that I’m very happy with our progress is our pathway to profit or our pretax profit goal. If you look on page six of our earnings release, we have the chart that shows the profitability per store or per store size. And the one area that is probably the best progress that we’ve made is in the small stores.
And we have talked about that in both the first and the second quarter conference calls that we have been working very hard and that in probably the calls last year, working very hard in those small stores to reduce the expenses and get them to grow faster. So we have really made progress in two areas. One is we have greatly reduced the number of stores in that category and the other half is we have cut the losses by half in that group of stores. But in every category, our profitability has moved up nicely.
The 30 to 60, 60 to 100, 100, as you go down that list, every one is up I think a minimum of 2 percentage points over the previous year. And that’s due to hard work, good expense control, improvement in margin, and everybody that’s focusing on their business and taking it - looking at one store at a time to improve the profitability. So I’m not ready to say that we are right back on track to pathway profit, but we are getting really close, and I think we are going to start marching forward assuming that the economy holds out for us. And so far, so good in that regard.
The last thing I want to touch on is store openings. We were very cautious in the second quarter, opening stores. And in June, we thought we would open a few more stores. One thing that’s happening there is we have to break the district managers lose a little bit. We have been really tight on it with adding people and controlling their expenses.
And so when things started to pick up, they were holding on to the rope pretty tight, didn’t want to let go. And so we have to nudge them to open the stores. We are doing that. We believe that we will open between 80 and 95 stores in the back half of the year, and we would really be right back on track with our pathway to profit. That would give us 6% to 7% store openings on a second half of the year basis. And we are comfortable that we can get that done.
With that, I’m going to turn it over to Dan. Dan is going to give you a lot more color on the financials and then when he is done, we will open it up for questions. Again, thank you very much for your support.

I’ll try to give a little more color without doing too much, but just some highlights. As Will mentioned and I refer everybody to that table we have on the bottom of page three, and again we started talking about this back in January.
We looked at a period in history, a period we chose as ’98 to 2003. We felt the characteristics of that timeframe have many similarities with this timeframe. We had a prolonged period of industrial slowdown that started with the Asian flu in ’98, really continued until the 2003 timeframe when it started ticking up. We pulled back our store openings in that timeframe, so a lot of similar dynamics in play.
And as you can see on the pattern, five out of six months were at or above it. February was below because of weather impacts. May jumped out a little bit. Again, that was just a blockbuster month. And so, very pleased with the progress we have seen. And based on what we have seen thus far in July, we anticipate that trend line to continue. And let’s see how that plays out.
From a gross margin standpoint, and this is a sequential comparison, we’ve picked up 100 basis points of additional margin - gross margin. And if I split that apart, about half of that improvement came at what I’d consider - excuse me, 30% of that improvement came at the transactional level. And that was our day-to-day activity at our stores, people pricing product, challenging themselves to raise our margin. About 20% of it came at the organizational level, what we’ve called the profit of our buying programs. About half of the improvement those two pieces combined.
We talked earlier in the year rebates continuing in our vendor programs, which are really volume-centric programs, which were mauled pretty severely. And as we went through 2009, we made nice progress there. From Q4 to Q1, we continued to make progress there from Q1 to Q2 that came up about 25 basis points of our improvement. So that’s 75% of the improvement. The last 25 is all the other stuff.
We continue to make great progress in this timeframe with what we are doing with our freight programs. We continue to make - eek out 5 basis points, 8 basis points there in additional improvements. If you lump them all together, it adds up to about 25 basis points. So there is our 100 basis points of improvement.
As I look at that going forward, I think we have nice momentum on the transactional side and the organizational side. The rebate piece, we still have some incremental means, but they are becoming more marginal because we have really recouped back to historical patterns. As Will mentioned in the end market arena, our manufacturing business, when I compare Q1 to Q2 on a year-over-year basis, our improvement almost doubled.
On the non-residential piece, beginning in May, that looked positive. It’s not helping our growth, but it’s not going backwards. And we don’t see anything in the near term that would cause that to change. But again when I get back to that trend pattern, we talked about the sequential patterns, that’s really inherent in what we are looking at is continued weakness in the construction.
I won’t touch on any more other than, as Will mentioned, our store statistics, meaningful improvement in all categories. Particularly proud of that first group because that’s not a case of business coming back, manufacturing business picking up that we saw the improvement. When you look at those stores doing less than 30,000 and the fact that our losses in that group dropped in half from a year-ago’s percentage of sales, that’s just hard work by our district managers and focused effort to say I’m going to break these stores, I want to break them even faster. And they are making really nice progress in that area.
The pathway of profit information, one item I’ll give a little color to, FTE headcount. If we look at since we began the pathway to profit and break out that information in the middle of the page, our store FTE is up about 11.5%. So during that timeframe, we’ve continued to invest heavily in store personnel as we moved on the pathway of profit. Obviously, took a bit of a step-back in the last 12 months because of the economy, but continued to invest in our selling capabilities at the store. The remaining headcount is about 4.8% down.
If you look at the last two groups combined from where it was in Q1 2007 and that really plays into the fact that a lot of our support headcount are predicated on store locations, not sales, and getting very nice leverage there. One item I’d point out, if you look at the distribution and manufacturing numbers on a year-over-year basis, you would see they are up. That up has caused that increase has caused entirely from the Holo-Krome acquisition. If you strip that out, that headcount would be down normally from last year as well.
As Will mentioned, operating and administrative expenses saw really nice leverage. And I’ll share a few pieces of information. As everybody knows, our earnings are up roughly 60% on a year-over-year basis. If we look at all the incentive compensation we pay out, store commissions, profitability bonus, project area bonuses et cetera and lump all those together, our incentive comp was up almost 80% on a year-over-year basis.
And our profit was up 60, which is nice - when I think about our support areas, when I think about our store personnel, in 2009, a lot of conversations, talking folks through about what was going to happen as that year played out and a lot of that was believed in where we can go as an organization and where to get through 2009 together.
And I think second quarter of 2010 is a nice exclamation point to being through with 2009 and that we were able to reward our personnel for a job well done as we went through the year and I believe lot of legs to that. Also I’m happy to say our profit-sharing bonus, which disappeared in 2009, was up nicely when I look at 2010 year-to-date and the second quarter.
One other item I’d touch on, in the non-payroll operating expenses, our occupancy improved sequentially, as we would expect with we are out of the heating season. We still have a lot of opportunity there and a lot of work to do, and we would expect to see continued improvements in our occupancy expense.
Interest statistic as looking at our fuel consumption over the weekend, and since 2008, our fuel expense - and a piece of it is in operating expenses, a piece of it is in margin because the diesel fuel in our semi fleet in margin, that is down 38.3% from the second quarter of 2003. If I average out the drop in fuel prices, both diesel and gasoline combined, they are down about 26%. So we did a nice job of picking up a whole bunch of efficiencies in that two-year period above and beyond just the unit cost expenses.
Working capital, accounts receivable were up 23% on a June-to-June basis, essentially in line with the sales growth. We were at about 21.1 the last two months, so a little bit added. A lot of that was driven by the fact that our industrial business is growing faster, our large account business is growing faster, as well as some of our international business growing faster. And some of those customer bases have terms that goes slightly longer and then pulls up our days, a fraction of a day, but very nice job on accounts receivable side. And our bad debt expense essentially dropped in half from where it was running in the timeframe of last year.
Inventory, that’s one item on the quarter I’m frankly disappointed in. If I look at our store inventory, the store component, year-to-date that’s down about $2 million. That should be down around 10. And so when I look at what we’ve done year-to-date overall with our inventory being up about $14 million, I’m disappointed that it’s at high. We still have very nice momentum. The $2 million that we have taken out occurred in the last several months. And so we have nice momentum, but we need to push hard in Q3 and Q4 to continue to manage that inventory number as we move forward.
Cash flow standpoint, a nice job year-to-date, 96% of our earnings have - is our operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings. And free cash flow is just north of 70%. And if you recall from previous calls, our target number is 80% to 90% for operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings and free cash flow of 50% to 60% and for well above those numbers six months into the year.
With that, I will turn it over to the Q&A.

As far as the construction, we don’t have all the fine detail on that, but geographically we’ve actually seen a nice pickup across the country. There is no area that’s weak. We are particularly strong in Eastern Canada. Western Canada is doing about at the same level as the other part of the business. The one area - I guess that there was one area that we are seeing a little bit of weakness is basically the Rocky Mountains, basically from Montana to New Mexico. That strip is a little bit soft for us. But some of that is that we get real - we were doing better last year. It didn’t taper off as fast and so it’s not coming back as fast. The brighter spot that we have is our international business. Asia is doing very well for us. Singapore, Malaysia, China are growing well above 50%. And we are seeing there is a lot of good things going on there. In the US, it’s really pretty even coming back other than that Rocky Mountain area.
And then as far as the construction, most of the large jobs that we are seeing are energy related, either coal-fired power plants that are going on. There is a lot of oil and gas in North Dakota, some construction up there putting in wells and infrastructure. We are hearing a lot of business with that. We’re seeing rebuilding down in the Houston area with a lot of the refineries. We are doing some really nice business there. Most of the business that we are seeing was coming from existing mechanical contractors that are doing well. The part of commercial construction that’s missing is you just don’t see a crane up and down in the cities.
Another area that we’ve really seen it basically completely gone is where they have put big boxes throughout the first half of 2000 to 2006. There was a Target, a Wal-Mart, a Home Depot going up in about 100 or 200 of our cities at any given time. And that is really nice business for us that’s usually local regional contractors and they are locking in the store. If there is a Home Depot going up to pick up $3,000 to $5,000 a month in miscellaneous business until the project is done. That business is just non-existent today.

One, when I think of our - I'm going to exclude Canada when I say this because Canada is far enough along developed that these two pieces don’t really come into play. It operates very much like our US-centric store-based business.
But when I think of international, I would think of the two limiting factors. One is always the development of people and the ability to open stores. And that’s a limitation that we’ve always had in our organization. The second one is, when you look at particularly our Asian business, our model there is a little bit different. It’s more of an OEM-centric faster model where we have fewer locations with larger business per location. So the dynamics of peer store openings are a little bit different, but we will continue to invest heavily in people into those international locations.

Last year, unfortunately, because if you think about the business model, when you think about the components of operating expense, that is the most variable expense we have. Occupancy in the short-term much less variable because you have your locations and your expense is your expense. You can change the thermostat. You could renegotiate leases. But those are - that's about it. You still have a base of locations.
And so that dropped last year because that variable expense dropped dramatically. When you look at on a year-over-year basis, that is sequential basis for that matter. Earlier I mentioned that our profitability, our commissions and profit bonuses combined were up almost 80% on a year-over-year basis. That combined with our FTE stabilizing and growing on a sequential basis is causing that expense as a percentage to grow faster than everything else until it’s getting - it's moved back to where its norm is.

So I’m going to talk a bit from the hip [ph]. As Will mentioned earlier, when we have improving trends in sales growth, what happens is stores graduate out of that group and they move to the group and then to the third group to fourth to fifth et cetera. So when I look at that group, could the average store in there be 5% or 10% higher than it would have been a year ago? Maybe. But that won’t really change that number because the piece that would be getting paid out and then added commissions and maybe adding people because that store is growing, or adding hours to the part-timer.
It really changed because we lowered - essentially we took couple of grand worth of monthly expenses out of those stores because the district manager decided it wasn’t bringing value to my question and I’m going to do without it. Now the fact that we might have given the DM a nudge to do that, that’s irrelevant. The DM took dollars out of that store, because if the store is growing faster and it’s getting to higher level, that’s what drives us to graduate from that group.

When we talk about September and October, that’s really a comment not unique to 2010. That’s every year in our business. Those are our peak sales months on an absolute dollar basis for the year because our business - our business is always running forward and growing.
What happens in November and December is there just aren’t enough business days and you have so many holiday impacts with businesses that are shut down for part of the Thanksgiving week, that are shut down for the Christmas-New Year timeframe. So the quality of the business days in November and December plus construction business slowing because the seasonality fall off. And historically, we look at our business and once we get through October, we now are developing our plan for the next year on our sales trends because January and October - really September-October, the daily average in that timeframe tends to mirror over historically what we’re going to see the following January. So it was an absolute dollar peak, not a sales growth peak.

The second half was about sell-through versus inventory. This is a belief. I don’t know this to be a fact. But I know - businesses that I talk to, people that I talk to, nobody is too excited about putting their neck out too far right now on two fronts. I don’t think people are adding - are willing to put their neck out adding people too fast right now because there are not - there is enough uncertainty still about the future. And so you are not seeing a lot of headcount added by any company.
The second one is inventory. I think a lot of people have a very good memory of 2009. A lot of business that squeezed really hard where they have a certain inventory level to support their business, the business fell through the floor and all of a sudden, the stuff coming in the one door is greater than the stuff that’s going out the other door. And a lot of companies built up inventory. And that’s what amplified what happened in 2009. And we were no different.
Late in ’08, our inventory grew dramatically. And the inventory we dropped in the first half of ’09 was really working off the bubble that built in the last three months of ’08. And so I don’t believe people are adding to their inventory other than to meet their shipping needs of the next few weeks or the next month depending on their business cycle and their supply chain. And so I believe the business we are seeing is real and it’s not being lifted by inventory build.

Coming out of that companies started just in time inventory and a whole bunch of trends throughout our industry to lower what they had. Then in the early 2000 slowdown, it became much greater. CFOs were getting involved in their businesses. Call it Class-C items. We don’t need that tool crib worth $600, $800 and millions of dollars. Let’s get rid of that and let the distributors do it for us. That has been good for our business for 20 years.
We believe this trend is even stronger because the hit was even worse with the economy. And what I’m hearing and I’ve been talking to lots of customers, what can you do to close down my tool crib and you guys just take care of it? That is a very positive trend for Fastenal because we have more inventory closer to more customers and almost - probably than anyone else there. So we are very optimistic that no one will ever rebuild their inventory and they will depend on Fastenal to be their supply store for their factory. So it’s very positive.

Also, thank everybody for the support you've given us over the last several quarters because things have been a little tougher, and we're starting to bring it back. I'm very proud to report that we had a nice quarter. The second quarter turned out very well for Fastenal. Our sales were really on track with where we thought they would be.
If you recall back to our January conference call, Dan and I talked about the sequential trends and where we thought they would come out. And after the call, we got some people that were cautioning us on being a little bit optimistic, but fortunately, they played out exactly where we thought they would be. 
If you look at the trend line, I believe, five out of six months have been at or above the sequential pattern, historical sequential pattern. June came in right at 21.1%. At the end of May, we thought maybe June would do a little bit better, but actually, as it turns out, I think May was just a blockbuster month. We had a lot of things lined up for us, and so we're not at all disappointed with June. May was just a spectacular month. 
The sales really were driven by our Manufacturing customers, which were up 29.8% for the quarter; very, very good pattern. Construction customers did come back just a little bit. They were way down in the first quarter, came back to flat to plus 0.5%. So that's actually a very positive sign. We don't see a lot of activity there, but in some of the areas, like oil and gas and some of the other more mechanical areas of Construction, we are seeing some life coming into that business.
Our active accounts have not been growing the way that we would like them to. They were up 3% for the quarter, and we've done a lot of research trying to understand that better. And what we've found, it's really being driven by -- the lack of actives is being caused by two things. One is, that our Construction customers, a lot of the Residential, which isn't a big piece of our business, but it's a big piece of our actives, and the small Commercial contractors are just not showing up with the frequency they did at one time. Many of them are just very -- not a lot of business. The other thing that's hurting our active accounts is, that we've opened fewer stores and new stores have always been one of the greatest drivers of active accounts. 
So all of our actives are only up 3%. We're pretty comfortable with where we are after we've looked at the data. And on the Manufacturing side, we have very nice growth in actives, and that's driving that 29.8% growth in Manufacturing business.
Gross margins came in at 52.1%, right on track before we thought they would be. And Dan's going to give a little more color later on the call, telling you where the breakdown is. But we're improving in all areas of our business with the gross margin, and we're comfortable that, that trend will continue going forward based on everything that we're seeing.
I'm very happy with the progress or the results that we're able to show on expense control. Our expenses were up 7.9% against the 20% sales growth. And if you take out the labor, we did a great job in pretty much every area of expense control. And the reason I say take out the labor is, the two components of labor, our base salary, our standard pay was in great shape. But our commissions and bonuses were way up, and that's a great problem. It's great for our employees to come back and make good bonuses and good commissions, and that's a problem that we would take every day. 
So overall, expense was up less than 8%. I think everybody in the field, everybody on the Fastenal team, has done a really nice job of holding the line when things are picking up. And it's not easy at this time because we've been really tight for about 18 months, but it seems like everyone's rallying to make that happen.
At the beginning of the year, we talked, Dan and I and all the regionals and senior people, talked to people all year long and we said, we really have -- if things go well, our expenses are going to go up for one of two reasons; either we get a little bit loose and just spend the money on miscellaneous things or we stay real tight and we spend the money on bonuses. And I'm happy to report to you and to the Fastenal employees that we're able to spend it on bonuses, not the other things, to the people good at their job.
Headcount standpoint, our headcount was up a little bit. I actually had hoped that our store headcount would've grown a little more. We will see headcount growth throughout the year. Not much in support, we're going to hold very tight in support and distribution. We may see a little bit in the distribution as volume picks up. But through the rest of the year, I could see between 300 and 500 FTE at the store site spread throughout the year. And that's really just to deal with the volume and make sure that we continue on the offense, calling on customers.
Most of that at the store will be part-time employees and a handful of full-time salespeople. Another group of sales specialists are people that we're going to be adding, and these people will come out of our stores and be replaced by newer employees is we're adding between 80 and 85 sales specialists, and some of those came in through the second quarter and the rest will be added mainly in the third and the fourth quarter. And these people will be sales specialists in various areas, from Government sales, Vending sales, Manufacturing sales, product specialists that will be out working with our customers, driving business through our stores to help drive up the average store size. We've had some very good results with people we've put in earlier in the year, and so we're going to continue to add that again to drive and drive revenue to our existing store sites.
Another area that I'm very happy with our progress is our 'pathway to profit' or our pretax profit goal. If you look on Page 6 of our earnings release, we have the chart that shows the profitability per store size, and the one area that is probably the best progress that we've made is in the small stores. And we had talked about that in both the first and the second quarter conference calls. That we've been working very hard, and that in probably the calls last year, working very hard on those small stores to reduce the expenses and get them to grow faster. 
So we've really made progress in two areas: One is, we've greatly reduced the number of stores in that category; and the other half is, we've cut the losses by half in that group of stores. But in every category, our profitability has moved up nicely: The 30 to 60, 60 to 100, the 100 as you go down that list. Every one is up in, I think, a minimum of two percentage points over the previous year. And that's due to hard work, good expense control, improvement in margin and everybody just focusing on their business and taking it -- looking at one store at a time to improve the profitability. So I'm not ready to say that we're right back on track to 'pathway to profit', but we're getting really close, and I think we're going to start marching forward assuming that the economy holds out for us and so far, so good in that regard.
The last thing I want to touch on is store openings. We were very cautious in the second quarter, opening stores. And in June, we thought we would open a few more stores. One thing that's happening there is, we have to break the district managers' noose a little bit. We've been really tight on them with adding people and controlling their expenses. And so when things started to pick up, they were holding on to the rope pretty tight, didn't want to let go and so we have to nudge them to open the stores. They're doing that. We believe that we'll open between 80 and 95 stores in the back half of the year. And we really would be right back on track with our 'pathway to profit', that would give us 6% to 7% store openings for the second half of the year basis. And we're comfortable that we can get that done.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan's going to give you a lot more color on the financials. And when he's done, we'll open it up for questions. Again, thank you very much for your support."

I'll try to give a little more color without doing too much. 
But just some highlights, as Will mentioned, and I'd refer everybody to that table we have on the bottom of Page 3, and again, we started talking about this back in January. We looked at a period in history, our period we chose of '98 to 2003. We felt the characteristics of that timeframe had many similarities to this timeframe. We had prolonged period of industrial slowdown that started with the Asian flu in '98, really continues until the 2003 timeframe when it started picking up. We pulled back our store openings in that timeframe, so a lot of similar dynamics in play. 
And as you can see on the pattern, five of the six months were at or above it. February was below because of the weather impacts. May jumped out a little bit; again, that was just a blockbuster month. And so we're very pleased with the progress we've seen and based on what we've seen thus far in July, anticipate that trend lines will continue, and so that plays out.
From a gross margin standpoint, and this is the sequential comparison, we picked up 100 basis points of additional margin, gross margin. And if I split that apart, about half that improvement came at what I'd consider the -- 30% of that improvement came at the transactional level and that was our day-to-day activity at our stores, people pricing product, challenging themselves to raise our margin. About 20% of it came in at the organizational level, what we'd call the profit of our buying programs. So it's about half the improvement, those two pieces combined. 
We talked earlier in the year about rebates continuing in our vendor programs, which are really volume-centric programs, which were mauled pretty severely as we went through 2009. We made nice progress there from Q4 to Q1. We continued to make progress there from Q1 to Q2, picking up about 25 basis points of our improvement. So that's 75% of the improvement. The last 25% is all the other stuff. We continue to make great progress in this timeframe with what we're doing with our freight programs. We continue to make, eke out five basis points here, eight basis points there with additional improvements. And if you lump them all together, it adds up to about 25 basis points, so there's 100 basis points of improvement.
As I look at that going forward, I think we have nice momentum on the transactional side and the organizational side. The rebate piece, we still have some incremental gains, but they're becoming more marginal because we've really recouped back to historical patterns. 
As Will mentioned, in the end market arena, our Manufacturing business, when I compare Q1 to Q2 on a year-over-year basis, our improvement almost doubled. The Non-Residential piece, beginning in May, that flipped positive. It's not helping our growth, but it's not going backwards. And we don't see anything in the near term that would cause that to change, but that's, again, when I get back to that trend pattern, we talked about the sequential patterns, that's really inherent in what we're looking at, is continued weakness in the Construction.
I won't touch on anymore other than, as Will mentioned, our store statistics, meaningful improvement in all categories. Particularly proud of that first group because that's not a case of business coming back or our Manufacturing business picking up that we saw the improvement. When you look at those stores doing less than $30,000 and the fact that our losses in that group dropped in half from a year ago as a percentage of sales, that's just hard work by our district managers and focused effort to say, ""I'm going to break these stores, I'm going to break them even faster."" And they're making really nice progress in that area.
The 'pathway to profit' information, one item I'll give a little color to, FTE headcount. If we look at since we began the 'pathway to profit 'and I'll break out that information in the middle of the page, our store FTE is up about 11.5%. So during that time frame, we'd continued to invest heavily in store personnel as we moved on the 'pathway to profit'. Obviously, took a bit of a step back in the last 12 months because of the economy, but continued to invest in our selling capabilities at the store. The remaining headcount is about 4.8% down if you look at the last two groups combined from where it was in Q1 2007. And that really plays into the fact that a lot of our support headcount are predicated on store locations, not sales, and getting very nice leverage there.
One item I'd point out, if you look at the Distribution and Manufacturing numbers on a year-over-year basis, you would see they're up. That increase is caused entirely from the Holo-Krome acquisition. If you strip that out, that headcount would be down nominally from last year as well.
As Will mentioned, operating and administrative expenses saw really nice leverage. And I'll share a few pieces of information. As everybody knows, our earnings are up roughly 60% on a year-over-year basis. If we look at all the incentive compensation we pay out, store commissions, profitability bonus, project area bonuses, et cetera, and you lump all those together, our incentive comp was up almost 80% on a year-over-year basis, and our profit was up 60%. So we did a nice job. 
When I think about our support areas, when I think about our store personnel, in 2009, a lot of conversations, talking folks through about what was going to happen as that year played out. And a lot of it was believe in where we can go as an organization, and we're going to get through 2009 together. And I think second quarter of 2010 is a nice exclamation point to being through with 2009 in that we were able to reward our personnel for a job well done as we went through the year. And I believe a lot of legs to that. We're also happy to say our profit sharing bonus, which disappeared in 2009, was up nicely when I look at 2010 year-to-date and the second quarter.
One other item I'd touch on in the non-payroll operating expenses, our occupancy improved sequentially, as we would expect, because we're on to the heating season. We still have a lot of opportunity there and a lot of work to do, and would expect to see continued improvements in our occupancy expense. 
Interesting statistic. I was looking at our fuel consumption over the weekend, and since 2008, our fuel expense, and a piece of this is in operating expenses, a piece of this is in margin because the diesel fuel in our semi-fleets in margin, that is down 38.3% from the second quarter of 2003. If I average out the drop in fuel prices, both diesel and gasoline combined, they're down about 26%. So we did a nice job of picking up a whole bunch of efficiencies in that two-year period above and beyond just the unit cost differences.
Working capital, accounts receivable up 23% on a June to June basis, essentially in line with sales growth. We were at about 21.1% the last two months. So a little bit of added, a lot of that is really driven by the fact that our Industrial business is growing faster, our Large Account business is growing faster, as well as some of our International business is growing faster. And some of those customer bases have terms that go slightly longer and then pulls up our days a fraction of a day, but very nice job on the accounts receivable side. And our bad debt expense essentially dropped in half from where it was running in the timeframe of last year.
Inventory, one item on the quarter I'm frankly disappointed in. If I look at our store inventory, the store component, year-to-date, that's down about $2 million. That should be down around $10 million. And so when I look at what we've done year-to-date, overall, with our inventory being up about $14 million, I'm disappointed that it's that high. We still have very nice momentum. The $2 million that we have taken out occurred in the last several months. And so we have some nice momentum, but we need to push hard in Q3 and Q4 to continue to manage that inventory number as we move forward.
Cash flow standpoint, done a nice job year-to-date. 96% of our earnings is our operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings, and free cash flow is just north of 70%. And if you recall from previous calls, our target number is 80% to 90% for operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings, and free cash flow of 50% to 60%. Hence, we're well above those numbers six months into the year.
With that, I will turn it over to the Q&A."

But geographically, we've actually seen a nice pickup across the country. There's no area that's weak. We're particularly strong in Eastern Canada. Western Canada is growing about, it's the same level as the other part of the business. The one area, I guess, if there was a one area that we're seeing a little bit of weakness is basically the Rocky Mountains, basically from Montana to New Mexico. That strip is a little bit soft for us. But some of that is, that we're doing better last year. It didn't taper off as fast, and so it's not coming back as fast. The brighter spot that we have is our International business. Asia's doing very well for us. Singapore, Malaysia, China is growing well above 50%, and we're seeing just a lot of good things going on there. In the U.S., it's really pretty even coming back other than that Rocky Mountain area. And as far as the construction, most of the large jobs that we're seeing are energy-related, either coal-fired power plants are going on. There's a lot of oil and gas in North Dakota, some construction up there putting in wells and infrastructure. We're doing a lot of business with that. We're seeing rebuilding down in the Houston area with a lot of those refineries. We're doing some really nice business there. Most of the business that we're seeing, though, is coming from existing mechanical contractors that are doing well. The part of Commercial construction that's missing is, you just don't see a crane up and down in the cities. Another area that we've really seen basically completely gone is where they're putting up big boxes. Throughout the first half of 2000 to 2006, there was a Target, a Wal-Mart, a Home Depot going up in about 100 or 200 of our cities at any given time. And that is really nice business for us because it's usually local, regional contractors and they're walking in the store. If there's a Home Depot going up, you'll pick up $3000 to $5000 a month in miscellaneous business until the project's done. That business is just not existent today."

One, when I think of our -- I'm going to exclude Canada when I say this because Canada's far enough along developed that these two pieces don't really come into play. It operates very much like our U.S.-centric store base business. But when I think of International, I always think of the two limiting factors. One is always the development of people and the ability to open stores, and that's the limitation that we've always had in this organization. The second one is, when you look at, particularly our Asian business, the model there is a little bit different. It's more of an OEM-centric faster model, where we have fewer locations with larger business per location. So the dynamics of the pure store openings are a little bit different, but we will continue to invest heavily in people into those International locations."

Occupancy, in the short term, is much less variable because you're in your locations and your expense is your expense. You can change the thermostat, you can renegotiate leases, but that's about it. You still have a base of locations. And so that drop last year because that variable expense dropped dramatically. When you look at, on a year-over-year basis and a sequential basis for that matter, earlier, I mentioned that our profitability, our commissions and profit bonuses combined were up almost 80% on a year-over-year basis.

As Will mentioned earlier, when we have improving trends in sales growth, what happens is, stores graduate out of that group and they move to the second group and then to the third group, the fourth group, the fifth group, etc. So when I look at that group, could the average store in there be 5% or 10% higher than it would've been a year ago? Maybe, but that one really changed that number because a piece of that would be getting paid out and then added commissions, and maybe adding people because that store is growing, or adding hours to the part-timer. It really changed because we lower -- we, essentially, we took a couple of grand worth of monthly expenses out of those stores because the district manager decided it wasn't bringing value to my business and I'm going to deal without it. Now the fact that we might have given the DM a nudge to do that, that's irrelevant. But DM took dollars out of that store because if the stores is growing faster and it's getting, hitting to a higher level, that's what drives us to graduate from that group."

When we talk about September and October, that's really a comment not unique to 2010. That's every year in our business. Those are our peak sales months on an absolute dollar basis for the year because our business is always running forward and growing. What happens in November and December is, there just aren't enough business days. And you have so many holiday impacts to those businesses that are shutdown for part of the Thanksgiving week. They're shut down for the Christmas, New Year timeframe. So the quality of the business days in November and December, plus Construction business slowing because of seasonality, fall off. And historically, we look at our business and once we get through October, we now are developing our plan for the next year on our sales trends because January and October, really, September, October, the daily average in that timeframe tends to mirror over historically what we're going to see the following January.

I don't think people are willing to put their neck out adding people too fast right now because there's enough uncertainty still about the future. And so you're not seeing a lot of headcount added by any company. The second one is inventory. I think a lot of people have a very good memory of 2009. A lot of businesses got squeezed really hard where they have a certain enough inventory level to support their business. The business falls through the floor and all of a sudden, the stuff that's coming in the one door is greater than the stuff that's going out the other door. And a lot of companies build up inventory, and that's what amplified what happened in 2009. And we were no different late in '08. Our inventory grew dramatically, and the inventory we dropped in the first half of '09 was really working off the bubble that built in the last three months of '08. And so I don't believe people are adding to their inventory other than to meet their shipping needs of the next few weeks or the next month depending on their business cycle and their supply chain. And so I believe the business we're seeing is real, and it's not being lifted by inventory build."

Coming out of that, companies started just-in-time inventory and a whole bunch of trends throughout our industry to lower what they had. Then in the early 2000 slowdown, it became much greater. CFOs are getting involved in their businesses, calling it Class C items, saying, ""We don't need that tool crib of $600,000, $800,000, millions of dollars. Let's get rid of' that and let the distributors do it for us. That has been good to our business for 20 years. We believe this trend is even stronger because the hit was even worse with the economy. And what I'm hearing and I've been out talking to lots of customers, what can you do to close down my tool crib and you guys just take care of it? That is a very positive trend for Fastenal because we have more inventory closer to more customers and almost probably than anyone out there. So we're very optimistic that no one will ever rebuild their inventory, and they will depend on Fastenal to be their supply store for their factory. So it's very positive."

Also, thank everybody for the support you've given us over the last several quarters because things have been a little tougher, and we're starting to bring it back. I'm very proud to report that we had a nice quarter. The second quarter turned out very well for Fastenal. Our sales were really on track with where we thought they would be.
If you recall back to our January conference call, Dan and I talked about the sequential trends and where we thought they would come out. And after the call, we got some people that were cautioning us on being a little bit optimistic, but fortunately, they played out exactly where we thought they would be. 
If you look at the trend line, I believe, five out of six months have been at or above the sequential pattern, historical sequential pattern. June came in right at 21.1%. At the end of May, we thought maybe June would do a little bit better, but actually, as it turns out, I think May was just a blockbuster month. We had a lot of things lined up for us, and so we're not at all disappointed with June. May was just a spectacular month. 
The sales really were driven by our Manufacturing customers, which were up 29.8% for the quarter; very, very good pattern. Construction customers did come back just a little bit. They were way down in the first quarter, came back to flat to plus 0.5%. So that's actually a very positive sign. We don't see a lot of activity there, but in some of the areas, like oil and gas and some of the other more mechanical areas of Construction, we are seeing some life coming into that business.
Our active accounts have not been growing the way that we would like them to. They were up 3% for the quarter, and we've done a lot of research trying to understand that better. And what we've found, it's really being driven by -- the lack of actives is being caused by two things. One is, that our Construction customers, a lot of the Residential, which isn't a big piece of our business, but it's a big piece of our actives, and the small Commercial contractors are just not showing up with the frequency they did at one time. Many of them are just very -- not a lot of business. The other thing that's hurting our active accounts is, that we've opened fewer stores and new stores have always been one of the greatest drivers of active accounts. 
So all of our actives are only up 3%. We're pretty comfortable with where we are after we've looked at the data. And on the Manufacturing side, we have very nice growth in actives, and that's driving that 29.8% growth in Manufacturing business.
Gross margins came in at 52.1%, right on track before we thought they would be. And Dan's going to give a little more color later on the call, telling you where the breakdown is. But we're improving in all areas of our business with the gross margin, and we're comfortable that, that trend will continue going forward based on everything that we're seeing.
I'm very happy with the progress or the results that we're able to show on expense control. Our expenses were up 7.9% against the 20% sales growth. And if you take out the labor, we did a great job in pretty much every area of expense control. And the reason I say take out the labor is, the two components of labor, our base salary, our standard pay was in great shape. But our commissions and bonuses were way up, and that's a great problem. It's great for our employees to come back and make good bonuses and good commissions, and that's a problem that we would take every day. 
So overall, expense was up less than 8%. I think everybody in the field, everybody on the Fastenal team, has done a really nice job of holding the line when things are picking up. And it's not easy at this time because we've been really tight for about 18 months, but it seems like everyone's rallying to make that happen.
At the beginning of the year, we talked, Dan and I and all the regionals and senior people, talked to people all year long and we said, we really have -- if things go well, our expenses are going to go up for one of two reasons; either we get a little bit loose and just spend the money on miscellaneous things or we stay real tight and we spend the money on bonuses. And I'm happy to report to you and to the Fastenal employees that we're able to spend it on bonuses, not the other things, to the people good at their job.
Headcount standpoint, our headcount was up a little bit. I actually had hoped that our store headcount would've grown a little more. We will see headcount growth throughout the year. Not much in support, we're going to hold very tight in support and distribution. We may see a little bit in the distribution as volume picks up. But through the rest of the year, I could see between 300 and 500 FTE at the store site spread throughout the year. And that's really just to deal with the volume and make sure that we continue on the offense, calling on customers.
Most of that at the store will be part-time employees and a handful of full-time salespeople. Another group of sales specialists are people that we're going to be adding, and these people will come out of our stores and be replaced by newer employees is we're adding between 80 and 85 sales specialists, and some of those came in through the second quarter and the rest will be added mainly in the third and the fourth quarter. And these people will be sales specialists in various areas, from Government sales, Vending sales, Manufacturing sales, product specialists that will be out working with our customers, driving business through our stores to help drive up the average store size. We've had some very good results with people we've put in earlier in the year, and so we're going to continue to add that again to drive and drive revenue to our existing store sites.
Another area that I'm very happy with our progress is our 'pathway to profit' or our pretax profit goal. If you look on Page 6 of our earnings release, we have the chart that shows the profitability per store size, and the one area that is probably the best progress that we've made is in the small stores. And we had talked about that in both the first and the second quarter conference calls. That we've been working very hard, and that in probably the calls last year, working very hard on those small stores to reduce the expenses and get them to grow faster. 
So we've really made progress in two areas: One is, we've greatly reduced the number of stores in that category; and the other half is, we've cut the losses by half in that group of stores. But in every category, our profitability has moved up nicely: The 30 to 60, 60 to 100, the 100 as you go down that list. Every one is up in, I think, a minimum of two percentage points over the previous year. And that's due to hard work, good expense control, improvement in margin and everybody just focusing on their business and taking it -- looking at one store at a time to improve the profitability. So I'm not ready to say that we're right back on track to 'pathway to profit', but we're getting really close, and I think we're going to start marching forward assuming that the economy holds out for us and so far, so good in that regard.
The last thing I want to touch on is store openings. We were very cautious in the second quarter, opening stores. And in June, we thought we would open a few more stores. One thing that's happening there is, we have to break the district managers' noose a little bit. We've been really tight on them with adding people and controlling their expenses. And so when things started to pick up, they were holding on to the rope pretty tight, didn't want to let go and so we have to nudge them to open the stores. They're doing that. We believe that we'll open between 80 and 95 stores in the back half of the year. And we really would be right back on track with our 'pathway to profit', that would give us 6% to 7% store openings for the second half of the year basis. And we're comfortable that we can get that done.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan's going to give you a lot more color on the financials. And when he's done, we'll open it up for questions. Again, thank you very much for your support."

I'll try to give a little more color without doing too much. 
But just some highlights, as Will mentioned, and I'd refer everybody to that table we have on the bottom of Page 3, and again, we started talking about this back in January. We looked at a period in history, our period we chose of '98 to 2003. We felt the characteristics of that timeframe had many similarities to this timeframe. We had prolonged period of industrial slowdown that started with the Asian flu in '98, really continues until the 2003 timeframe when it started picking up. We pulled back our store openings in that timeframe, so a lot of similar dynamics in play. 
And as you can see on the pattern, five of the six months were at or above it. February was below because of the weather impacts. May jumped out a little bit; again, that was just a blockbuster month. And so we're very pleased with the progress we've seen and based on what we've seen thus far in July, anticipate that trend lines will continue, and so that plays out.
From a gross margin standpoint, and this is the sequential comparison, we picked up 100 basis points of additional margin, gross margin. And if I split that apart, about half that improvement came at what I'd consider the -- 30% of that improvement came at the transactional level and that was our day-to-day activity at our stores, people pricing product, challenging themselves to raise our margin. About 20% of it came in at the organizational level, what we'd call the profit of our buying programs. So it's about half the improvement, those two pieces combined. 
We talked earlier in the year about rebates continuing in our vendor programs, which are really volume-centric programs, which were mauled pretty severely as we went through 2009. We made nice progress there from Q4 to Q1. We continued to make progress there from Q1 to Q2, picking up about 25 basis points of our improvement. So that's 75% of the improvement. The last 25% is all the other stuff. We continue to make great progress in this timeframe with what we're doing with our freight programs. We continue to make, eke out five basis points here, eight basis points there with additional improvements. And if you lump them all together, it adds up to about 25 basis points, so there's 100 basis points of improvement.
As I look at that going forward, I think we have nice momentum on the transactional side and the organizational side. The rebate piece, we still have some incremental gains, but they're becoming more marginal because we've really recouped back to historical patterns. 
As Will mentioned, in the end market arena, our Manufacturing business, when I compare Q1 to Q2 on a year-over-year basis, our improvement almost doubled. The Non-Residential piece, beginning in May, that flipped positive. It's not helping our growth, but it's not going backwards. And we don't see anything in the near term that would cause that to change, but that's, again, when I get back to that trend pattern, we talked about the sequential patterns, that's really inherent in what we're looking at, is continued weakness in the Construction.
I won't touch on anymore other than, as Will mentioned, our store statistics, meaningful improvement in all categories. Particularly proud of that first group because that's not a case of business coming back or our Manufacturing business picking up that we saw the improvement. When you look at those stores doing less than $30,000 and the fact that our losses in that group dropped in half from a year ago as a percentage of sales, that's just hard work by our district managers and focused effort to say, ""I'm going to break these stores, I'm going to break them even faster."" And they're making really nice progress in that area.
The 'pathway to profit' information, one item I'll give a little color to, FTE headcount. If we look at since we began the 'pathway to profit' and I'll break out that information in the middle of the page, our store FTE is up about 11.5%. So during that time frame, we'd continued to invest heavily in store personnel as we moved on the 'pathway to profit'. Obviously, took a bit of a step back in the last 12 months because of the economy, but continued to invest in our selling capabilities at the store. The remaining headcount is about 4.8% down if you look at the last two groups combined from where it was in Q1 2007. And that really plays into the fact that a lot of our support headcount are predicated on store locations, not sales, and getting very nice leverage there.
One item I'd point out, if you look at the Distribution and Manufacturing numbers on a year-over-year basis, you would see they're up. That increase is caused entirely from the Holo-Krome acquisition. If you strip that out, that headcount would be down nominally from last year as well.
As Will mentioned, operating and administrative expenses saw really nice leverage. And I'll share a few pieces of information. As everybody knows, our earnings are up roughly 60% on a year-over-year basis. If we look at all the incentive compensation we pay out, store commissions, profitability bonus, project area bonuses, et cetera, and you lump all those together, our incentive comp was up almost 80% on a year-over-year basis, and our profit was up 60%. So we did a nice job. 
When I think about our support areas, when I think about our store personnel, in 2009, a lot of conversations, talking folks through about what was going to happen as that year played out. And a lot of it was believe in where we can go as an organization, and we're going to get through 2009 together. And I think second quarter of 2010 is a nice exclamation point to being through with 2009 in that we were able to reward our personnel for a job well done as we went through the year. And I believe a lot of legs to that. We're also happy to say our profit sharing bonus, which disappeared in 2009, was up nicely when I look at 2010 year-to-date and the second quarter.
One other item I'd touch on in the non-payroll operating expenses, our occupancy improved sequentially, as we would expect, because we're on to the heating season. We still have a lot of opportunity there and a lot of work to do, and would expect to see continued improvements in our occupancy expense. 
Interesting statistic. I was looking at our fuel consumption over the weekend, and since 2008, our fuel expense, and a piece of this is in operating expenses, a piece of this is in margin because the diesel fuel in our semi-fleets in margin, that is down 38.3% from the second quarter of 2003. If I average out the drop in fuel prices, both diesel and gasoline combined, they're down about 26%. So we did a nice job of picking up a whole bunch of efficiencies in that two-year period above and beyond just the unit cost differences.
Working capital, accounts receivable up 23% on a June-to-June basis, essentially in line with sales growth. We were at about 21.1% the last two months. So a little bit of added, a lot of that is really driven by the fact that our Industrial business is growing faster, our Large Account business is growing faster, as well as some of our International business is growing faster. And some of those customer bases have terms that go slightly longer and then pulls up our days a fraction of a day, but very nice job on the accounts receivable side. And our bad debt expense essentially dropped in half from where it was running in the time frame of last year.
Inventory, one item on the quarter I'm frankly disappointed in. If I look at our store inventory, the store component, year-to-date, that's down about $2 million. That should be down around $10 million. And so when I look at what we've done year-to-date, overall, with our inventory being up about $14 million, I'm disappointed that it's that high. We still have very nice momentum. The $2 million that we have taken out occurred in the last several months. And so we have some nice momentum, but we need to push hard in Q3 and Q4 to continue to manage that inventory number as we move forward.
Cash flow standpoint, done a nice job year-to-date. 96% of our earnings is our operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings, and free cash flow is just north of 70%. And if you recall from previous calls, our target number is 80% to 90% for operating cash flow as a percentage of earnings, and free cash flow of 50% to 60%. Hence, we're well above those numbers six months into the year.
With that, I will turn it over to the Q&A."

But geographically, we've actually seen a nice pickup across the country. There's no area that's weak. We're particularly strong in Eastern Canada. Western Canada is growing about, it's the same level as the other part of the business. The one area, I guess, if there was a one area that we're seeing a little bit of weakness is basically the Rocky Mountains, basically from Montana to New Mexico. That strip is a little bit soft for us. But some of that is, that we're doing better last year. It didn't taper off as fast, and so it's not coming back as fast. The brighter spot that we have is our International business. Asia is doing very well for us. Singapore, Malaysia, China is growing well above 50%, and we're seeing just a lot of good things going on there. In the U.S., it's really pretty even coming back other than that Rocky Mountain area. And as far as the construction, most of the large jobs that we're seeing are energy-related, either coal-fired power plants are going on. There's a lot of oil and gas in North Dakota, some construction up there putting in wells and infrastructure. We're doing a lot of business with that. We're seeing rebuilding down in the Houston area with a lot of those refineries. We're doing some really nice business there. Most of the business that we're seeing, though, is coming from existing mechanical contractors that are doing well. The part of Commercial construction that's missing is, you just don't see a crane up and down in the cities. Another area that we've really seen basically completely gone is where they're putting up big boxes. Throughout the first half of 2000 to 2006, there was a Target, a Walmart, a Home Depot going up in about 100 or 200 of our cities at any given time. And that is really nice business for us because it's usually local, regional contractors and they're walking in the store. If there's a Home Depot going up, you'll pick up $3000 to $5000 a month in miscellaneous business until the project's done. That business is just not existent today."

And so you look at that from a percentage standpoint, that's meaningfully above where they are as a percentage of our business, and that trends going to continue to broaden.

One, when I think of our -- I'm going to exclude Canada when I say this because Canada's far enough along developed that these two pieces don't really come into play. It operates very much like our U.S.-centric store base business. But when I think of International, I always think of the two limiting factors. One is always the development of people and the ability to open stores, and that's the limitation that we've always had in this organization. The second one is, when you look at, particularly our Asian business, the model there is a little bit different. It's more of an OEM-centric faster model, where we have fewer locations with larger business per location. So the dynamics of the pure store openings are a little bit different, but we will continue to invest heavily in people into those International locations."

Last year, unfortunately, because if you think about the business model and you think about the components of operating expense, that is the most variable expense we have. Occupancy, in the short term, is much less variable because you're in your locations and your expense is your expense. You can change the thermostat, you can renegotiate leases, but that's about it. You still have a base of locations. And so that drop last year because that variable expense dropped dramatically. When you look at, on a year-over-year basis and a sequential basis for that matter, earlier, I mentioned that our profitability, our commissions and profit bonuses combined were up almost 80% on a year-over-year basis. That, combined with our FTE stabilizing and growing on a sequential basis is causing that expense as a percentage to grow faster than everything else. And so it's moved back to where its norm is.

It really changed because we lower -- we, essentially, we took a couple of grand worth of monthly expenses out of those stores because the district manager decided it wasn't bringing value to my business and I'm going to deal without it. Now the fact that we might have given the DM a nudge to do that, that's irrelevant. But DM took dollars out of that store because if the store is growing faster and it's getting, hitting to a higher level, that's what drives us to graduate from that group."

When we talk about September and October, that's really a comment not unique to 2010. That's every year in our business. Those are our peak sales months on an absolute dollar basis for the year because our business is always running forward and growing. What happens in November and December is, there just aren't enough business days. And you have so many holiday impacts to those businesses that are shutdown for part of the Thanksgiving week. They're shut down for the Christmas, New Year time frame. So the quality of the business days in November and December, plus Construction business slowing because of seasonality fall off. And historically, we look at our business and once we get through October, we now are developing our plan for the next year on our sales trends because January and October, really, September, October, the daily average in that time frame tends to mirror over historically what we're going to see the following January. So it was an absolute dollar peak, not a sales growth peak."

I don't think people are willing to put their neck out adding people too fast right now because there's enough uncertainty still about the future. And so you're not seeing a lot of headcount added by any company. The second one is inventory. I think a lot of people have a very good memory of 2009. A lot of businesses got squeezed really hard where they have a certain amount of inventory level to support their business. The business falls through the floor and all of a sudden, the stuff that's coming in the one door is greater than the stuff that's going out the other door. And a lot of companies build up inventory, and that's what amplified what happened in 2009. And we were no different late in '08. Our inventory grew dramatically, and the inventory we dropped in the first half of '09 was really working off the bubble that built in the last three months of '08. And so I don't believe people are adding to their inventory other than to meet their shipping needs of the next few weeks or the next month depending on their business cycle and their supply chain. And so I believe the business we're seeing is real, and it's not being lifted by inventory build."

Coming out of that, companies started just-in-time inventory and a whole bunch of trends throughout our industry to lower what they had. Then in the early 2000 slowdown, it became much greater. CFOs are getting involved in their businesses, calling it Class C items, saying, ""We don't need that tool crib of $600,000, $800,000, millions of dollars. Let's get rid of' that and let the distributors do it for us. That has been good to our business for 20 years. We believe this trend is even stronger because the hit was even worse with the economy. And what I'm hearing and I've been out talking to lots of customers, what can you do to close down my tool crib and you guys just take care of it? That is a very positive trend for Fastenal because we have more inventory closer to more customers and almost probably than anyone out there. So we're very optimistic that no one will ever rebuild their inventory, and they will depend on Fastenal to be their supply store for their factory. So it's very positive."

I am very proud of the results that we produced in the third quarter of 2010. Overall, I think we did a very good job. We continue to see strength in our top line revenue in all areas of our business. Geographically in the United States, we really don't see any weak spots at this time, we only have stores in small areas that maybe be not be doing as well. But overall we are seeing strength in all parts of the country which is very encouraging.
It's been a long time since we've seen that. Even back in 2008 when we were doing well, there were certain areas that were very slow. We had a particularly strong September and when you look at September year-over-year the number was good at 23.5%. But the good numbers from September show a sequential growth, because September is really the most difficult comp that we had from last year, because we had a very good September, August-September last year and we improved upon that in 2010. So we are very happy with those results.
Both our Canadian and Mexican businesses are growing above the company average and they are both becoming larger and actually meaningful part of our growth number at this point. The other international businesses mainly Asia and Europe are both doing very well and are also growing above the company average. So outside of the United States our business is very strong, and the profitability of those businesses continues to improve as we become better at running the businesses and have greater sales revenue.
At this time, the real strength in our business is being driven by our manufacturing customers. And if you broke down the manufacturing customers, it's mainly the large ones. We are doing well with all sections and sizes and types of manufacturing businesses. But the large customers are driving our business; we're seeing the best growth out of that group of customers. But because of this we're also seeing pressure on our margin.
Traditionally the large manufacturing customers are also our lowest margin customers. So although our margin did go backwards in the second quarter we're pretty comfortable with where we are, and we're still very comfortable with that 52% margin range that we stated over the last year or two. We're going to have to work hard for it, but we also believe that over time our smaller customers and our construction business will pick back up, and the mix will change more positively for our growth going forward. 
The entire Fastenal team did a really nice job in expense control, not only in the third quarter but throughout the entire year. The only area of expenses that really outgrew or was disproportionate to our sales growth was the commission and bonuses which as we say a very good problem. 
But even that will normalize in 2011 because in 2009, the commission and bonuses were at basically all time low levels as a percentage of revenue. 2010 is almost at all time high levels. So in 2011, that will normalize, and they should be able to show very good growth over those numbers from an earnings standpoint. We continued to add new stores in the third quarter. We added 45 new stores. We plan to end the year at somewhere between 125 and 130 new stores for the year which would give us about 35 to 40 stores for the rest of the year and we're comfortable that we can get that done mainly in the next two months, in the beginning of December.
From a headcount standpoint, we continue to add people in our stores. We're not really aggressive with that. We do continue to add people in our stores mainly to support our existing and growing business but also some additional sales people. On the support side we've been really pretty tight. We've added if you do a comparison we're looking back at the numbers, if you look back to the start of our pathway to profit which was in the first quarter of 2007, we actually, if you take out the 90 people we added to the Holo-Krome acquisition, we have fewer people in support today than we did in the first quarter of 2007 and I don't think we are squeezing it too hard. I think we are just working really hard at becoming more efficient with how we run our business and finding things that we maybe didn't have to do or we can't do in the future.
But overall the business seems to be running well. We are seeing very low turnover with our support help side. I don't think we are driving them out the door by driving them too hard. So we are very comfortable with where we are on the support help and we believe we can continue to see that trend going forward. We will have to add some additional people but the trend is becoming more efficient, should stay with us for a long time. Just changing to a more of an overview or some thoughts on the business, I got a Fastenal Board meeting yesterday and I was talking to our board members and the one thing that I pointed out at the end of the meeting that I think is helping us to do as well as we are and it's really the strength of our team.
If you look at everywhere from starting with the store managers, district managers, warehouse managers, RVPs and all the way to the top, our turnover has continued to go down and especially at the district regional and hub manager levels, really the core people running our business and we continue to get stronger in those positions and I believe that trend and the work that the people are doing there should bode well for the company and the shareholders for a long time going forward there. 
I really pounded that point yesterday with the Board and I want to make that point with our shareholders because it really is important because all the numbers don't mean anything if you don't have the team on the field that really wants to win and it wants to work here and is happy. Part of our business I think we are doing very well.
With that I am going to turn it over to Dan. Dan will give you a lot more color and granularity to the numbers. Thank you.

And again thank you for participating in our call today. As you saw, our sales trends continued to improve. If I look at the information that we break out on page 2 of our earnings release, we talk about the sequential patterns. In the first quarter, if you look at what our sequential patterns are doing relative to our benchmark period, we were beating those numbers on a sequential basis on average about 1%. So our sequential change, the delta was about 1% above and the second quarter that moderated slightly down to about four-tenths of a percent. We are still beating it but it moderated slightly.
And in the third quarter, to be honest with you I was surprised by this, we continued to see, we saw that turnaround and we were beating that sequential pattern by about 1.4% and as Will mentioned a lot of that could be attributed to strength in our large account business which is growing quite well right now, our largest account business, our key comp business is growing closer to low 30% neighborhood versus the overall business and giving us a nice surge in top line and gross profit dollars. And while that business as Will mentioned might carry a lower gross margin, the operating margin in that business is very attractive because overtime there is no volume going there that you can manage in your operating expenses quiet effectively and garner a very attractive operating margin on the business. 
In addition to the sequential patterns if you look at the chart here on page three, you can see that we now for the year every month except for February, I mean February was really hurt a little bit because of weather. Every other month of the year has been at or above our trend line so we feel some comfort and sustainability of these trends. Therefore I touch on a little later, we allowed our inventory dollar to grow a little bit to support that business. I will touch on that in a few minutes. 
From an end market perspective and we added a couple of new graphs to our earnings release manufacturing business continue the positive trends and we continue to see some up-ticks in our non-res construction business that we started to see in June-July timeframe.
If I look at where our daily average was in January and I fast forward that to September, our manufacturing business year-to-date is up 17% fairly average, our construction business is actually up 24.4% from what was in January to September. Now most of that is normal seasonality, obviously especially in the Northern State, January is not exactly the best month to be doing outside construction work, September is a much better month but that is a stronger number than we've seen in recent years.
When I look a the active account growth, active accounts up 2.8% in the month of September, that's the weaker number we'd like to see, whenever you do get to look at it. If you look at our business and look under the hood of our business, we actually have more non-residential customers than we do manufacturing customers. 
We have a lot of small non-residential customers that do nominal amounts with us. The non-res construction segment, the active account sales is actually down year-over-year. There is a lot of 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10% firms that have kind of disappearance that would work over the last 18 months and probably 18 months and that's really hurting that number. And but overall, our manufacturing business is active account growth is in the mid-single digits.
As Will mentioned on the pathway to profit, our store headcount has been stabilized since last fall, we are starting to grow that number and I think we continue to do a nice job of managing the remaining piece of our headcounts, both the distribution and manufacturing group as well as the administrative support.
Our gross profit margin as we've touched on did slip a bit from Q2 to Q3, dropped about 35 basis points and again when you look again under the hood, really driven by the end market mix change where we slipped our transactional margins a bit about 25 basis points and our organizational profit is second for that slipped about 10 but its really driven by the end market change largely on customers, fewer non-res construction customers, smaller customers in the mix.
Operating and administrative expenses overall managed it well, the growth there is all centered on incentive compensation, store, commission, profitability balances throughout the organization, profit sharing contributions throughout the organization and if I look at that year-over-year, that number is up. Those three things combined are up over 100% for where they were a year ago. Sequentially though, they're up about 6.5%, which is much more in line with the 7.6% sequential growth in pre-tax. 
From a working capital standpoint, we continue to manage our working capital, I believe well. Accounts receivable grew normally more than sales and that's really attributed to the fact that again, similar to our gross margin discussion large accounts, large customers drove a lot of our sales growth. And they often times have the ability to negotiate terms that maybe are slightly better than our overall average business.
Inventory, while we did, our goal was to hold it flat. We did allow it to grow, to support the added business because what we provide to our customers, we are their source of supply. They essentially outsource procurement of all these products to us, we will not betray their trust, we will stand ready to support their needs throughout their business cycle and therefore we allow the inventory to grow somewhat. 
From a cash flow standpoint, when we started the pathway to profit, our stated goal consisted of really three numbers; an operating cash flow that would run somewhere between 80% and 90% of our net earnings. We would expand this somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% of that number, over time we felt on capital expenditures which I believe 55% to 65% of our net earnings available in the form of free cash. 
Year-to-date, we generated 83.1% of earnings in operating cash flow. We spent about 20% of that in CapEx, infrastructure to support future growth, free cash flow which in our definition is operating cash flow less CapEx came in at 63.4%. 
With that, I will turn it over to the narrator for Q&A and I will take your calls, thank you.

And sometimes what happens is when companies are busy, sometimes they are less inclined to make changes to things because you're too busy to do it because changing a supplier or making changes to your business requires a tremendous amount of energy, and sometimes you just don't have that energy left over at the end of the day to make those changes.

With that said when I look at it on a customer by customer basis, that business was mauled a year ago. That business was off dramatically. It wasn't uncommon to see a customer down 35%, 40%, 45%.

When you look at the dramatic fluctuations you've had over the last 18, 24 months. Sometime it's the only sanity you can get or clarity you can get to your business as looking at the sequential patterns because again when your comparisons are changing so wildly that become less meaningful.
So it is really about us, when we look out to historically September, October is our high watermark of the year as far as daily sales average. From October to January you pick up maybe 90 basis points in additional daily sales and then you start that stairway for the next year of where do we get to by September-October. You know providing we continue to see things we are seeing today which are positive to that historical trend line, that's what really builds confidence in your business and which is where we are today.
And the only wildcard that comes into play in my mind is when you look at things that are going on, for example lot of the investments we are making internationally that we touched on earlier, doesn't necessarily translate into always so many stores because we are going into new markets and sometimes the footprints of that market give you to manifest differently. But generally speaking we were fairly optimistic to look up 2011. And we are Midwestern conservative almost on the verge of being boring.

Absolutely, but you could say that about virtually every company that was out there. 
And everybody looked at it at the time and we continue take this way and look at it and say that the cash that is sitting on our balance sheet belongs to shareholder that hold 150 million shares of Fastenal stock and try to understand what's the best way to utilize that cash for them. In 2008 we saw it as additional dividend, we increased our dividend meaningfully in each of the last two years. However, we in 2010 have chosen not to be in the market because we still waiver between what is the best value, what is the best return for our shareholders. 
And we are also consciously paying attention to what's going on in the marketplace as far as tax rates on different types of activities and where that might go in the future, and not to get too far ahead of myself, but long way of saying we don't have a definitive plan on where do we step in and buy, where do we not. But we continue to make the problem worse for ourselves by throwing off one heck of a lot of cash for their business. That's a big problem. 
But for a company our size to have a couple of hundred million dollars in cash is not an unusually high number. We're pretty comfortable with that going forward.

It was largely an operating expense discussion. About 60% of that was going to come from labor efficiencies over time because we didn't need to add as much support infrastructure to support that sales growth, so about 300 basis points of labor efficiency and about 200 basis points of occupancy efficiency 
And that efficiency and occupancy was all about growing our average store size because the occupancy expense on a per store basis doesn't change when you go from 50 to 100,000 appreciably. And when I look at the third quarter number as an example of that 200 basis points of operating margin expansion that we are getting from occupancy alone, 160 is still on the table, but what needs to happen to get that is our average store size needs to continue to grow and run away from if you will that occupancy, that fixed occupancy expense.

The group that shows 60 to 100,000 in monthly revenue was at 22.7% pre-tax which is only 30 basis points off our pathway to profit goal, but these stores are about only 60% the size. So we've really done a nice job that our release tells me is that we don't need to get to the $125,000 because of all the things we are doing. And so the goal of pathway to profit 23% is not as far away as we once thought it was.
So those are very encouraging numbers and we still have a lot of opportunity. One other thing that is interesting is we also have opportunity in distribution for next year because we don't plan to open any large distribution centers.
In the last couple of years, we have invested very heavily in Indianapolis and some of our other distribution centers, Dallas. To mention the other one. That's pretty much behind us. So we are going to start leveraging that fixed cost as we go forward with higher revenue base.

We see e-commerce a little different than others because we have the brick and mortar out there. So our plan for ecommerce and it seems to be working well although its small, it's small is to get our customers in a local market to place orders off the web, using it as an order, our search method and an order placing mechanism through our local place of business. If they want to buy just like people from Amazon and have it shipped in, we're happy to do that. But most customers would rather have the product delivered locally if they can. 
So what we need to do as an organization, we need to go out to our existing customers and all the customers in the area, introduce them to fastenal.com which is a very good website, has a very good search engine. Show them what we're capable of doing and change their habits from picking up the telephone and calling us to turning around their keyboard and placing an order with us electronically. 
The benefit to us, one is, they see a lot broader product offering; two is, we can download their customized pricing to them so we don't have to look it up every time they call and three is, if the order comes in electronically, it does save us time and energy in processing the order because it's already in the system. They entered it instead of one of our people entering it. So we recognize the benefits of it. We have a very strong initiative internally. Nevertheless, well, basically throughout 2010 we've seen a tremendous increase in the activity. But we have a long ways to go. The first one to admit; that's one area where Fastenal is probably not the leader in industrial distribution. We plan to catch up and pass people as time goes on and we're going to do it fast.

I'm very proud of the results that we produced in the third quarter of 2010. Overall, I think we did a very good job. We have seen -- we continue to see strength in our top line revenue in all areas of our business. Geographically, in the United States, we really don't see any weak spots at this time, we have stores and small areas that may not be doing as well. But overall, we're seeing strength in all parts of the country, which is very encouraging. It's been a long time since we've seen that. Even back in 2008, we were doing well there are certain areas that were very slow.
We had a particularly strong September and when you look at September, year-over-year, the number was good at 23.5% but really the strength -- the good numbers from September was the sequential growth in September is really the most difficult comp that we had from last year because we had a very good September, august, September last year when we improved upon that in 2010, so we're very happy with those results.
Both our Canadian and Mexican businesses are growing above the company average, and they're both becoming larger and actually a meaningful part of our growth number at this point. The other international businesses, mainly Asia and Europe, are both doing very well and also growing above the company averages. While outside of the United States, our business is very strong and the profitability of those businesses continues to improve as we become better at running the businesses and have greater sales revenue.
At this time, the real strength in our business is being driven by our manufacturing customers and if you broke down the manufacturing customers, it's mainly the large ones. We're doing well with all sections and sizes and types of manufacturing businesses, but the large customers are driving our business, we're seeing the best growth out of that group of customers. But because of this, we're also seeing pressure on our margin. Traditionally, the large manufacturing customers are also our lowest margin customers. So although our margin did go backwards from the second quarter, we're pretty comfortable with where we are and we're still very comfortable with that 52% margin rate that we stated over the last year to -- we're going to have to work hard for it but we also believe that over time, our smaller customers in our Construction business will pick back up and the mix will change more positively for our growth going forward.
The entire Fastenal team did a really nice job on expense control not only in the third quarter, but throughout the entire year. The only area of expenses that really outgrew or was disproportionate to our sales growth was the commission and bonuses, which is as we say, a very good problem. But even that will normalize in 2011 because in 2009, the commission and bonuses were basically all-time low levels as a percentage of revenue. 2010 almost all-time high level. So 2011, that will normalize and should be able to show really good growth over those numbers from an earnings standpoint.
We continue to add new stores in the third quarter. We added 45 new stores. We're pulling again the year at somewhere between 125 and 130 new stores for the year, which would give us about 35 to 40 stores for the rest of the year. And we're comfortable that we can get that done in the next two, mainly in the next two months in the beginning of December.
From a headcount standpoint, we continue to add people in our stores. We're not really aggressive with that, we do continue to add people in our stores mainly to support our existing and growing business, but also some additional sales people. On the support side, we've been really pretty tight. We've added, if you do a comparison, we're looking back at the numbers, if you look back to the start of our 'pathway to profit,' which is the first quarter of 2007, we actually -- if you take out the 90 people we added for the Holo-Krome acquisition, we have fewer people in support today than we did in the first quarter of 2007, and I don't think we're squeezing it too hard. I think we're just working really hard at becoming more efficient with how we run our business and finding things that we maybe didn't have to do or can't do in the future but overall, the business seems to be running well. We're seeing very low turnover with our support help, so I don't think we're driving them up the door by driving them too hard. So we're very comfortable with where we are on the support help, and we believe we can continue to see that trend going forward. We'll have to add some additional people, but the trend of becoming more efficient should stay with us for a long time.
Just changing to a more of an overview or some thoughts on the business. I had a Fastenal board meeting yesterday on site with our board members, and the one thing that I pointed out at the end of the meeting that I think is helping us to do as well as we are, it's really the strength of our team. 
If you look at everyone from the starting at the store managers, district managers, warehouse managers, our VPs and all the way to the top, our turnover has continued to go down and especially at the district, regional and hub-manager levels, really the core of people running our business, and we continue to get stronger in those positions, and I believe that trend and the work that the people are doing there should bode well for the company and the shareholders for a long time going forward. And I really pounded that point yesterday at the board, and I want to make that point with our shareholders, because it really is important, because all the numbers don't mean anything if you don't have the team on the field that really wants to win and it wants to work here. And at that part of our business, I think we're doing very well. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan will give you a lot more color and granularity to the numbers. Thank you."
270747,114144882,79724,"Fastenal Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 12, 2010",2010-10-12,"Earnings Calls","Fastenal Company","Executives","Thank you, Will, and good morning, everybody, and again thank you for participating in our call today. As you saw, our sales trends continue to improve. If I look at the information that we break out on Page 2 of our earnings release, we talked about the",1081,"Thank you, Will, and good morning, everybody, and again thank you for participating in our call today. As you saw, our sales trends continue to improve. If I look at the information that we break out on Page 2 of our earnings release, we talked about the sequential patterns. 
In the first quarter, if you look at what our sequential patterns are doing relative to our benchmark period, we were beating those numbers on a sequential basis on average about 1%. So our sequential change, the Delta, was about 1% above. And the second quarter, that moderated slightly down to about 0.4%. We're still beating it but it moderated slightly. In the third quarter, to be honest with you I was surprised by this. We continue to see -- we saw that turnaround and we were beating that sequential pattern by about 1.4% And as Will mentioned, a lot of that can be attributed to strengthen in our Large Account business, which is going quite well right now. Our Large Account business, our key account business growing closer to, well, 30% neighborhood versus the overall business and giving us a nice surge in top line and gross profit dollars.
And while that business, as Will mentioned, might carry a lower gross margin, the operating margin in that business is very attractive because over time, there's enough volume going there that you can manage in your operating expenses quite effectively and garner very attractive operating margin in the business.
In addition to the sequential pattern, if you look at the chart we have on Page 3, you can see that we now, for the year, every month except for February and February was really hurt a little bit because of weather, every other month of the year has been at or above our trendline. So we feel comfort and sustainability in these trends. Therefore, I'll touch on a little later, a little louder, our inventory dollars to grow a little bit to support that business. I'll touch on that in a few minutes. 
From an end market perspective, we added a couple of new graphs to our earnings release, Manufacturing business continued a positive trend, and we continue to see some upticks in our non-res construction business that we started to see in the June, July timeframe. If I look at where our daily average was in January and I fast forward that to September, our Manufacturing business year-to-date is up 17%, daily average. Our Construction business is actually up 24.4% from where it was January to September. Now most of that is normal seasonality. Obviously, especially in the northern states, January is not exactly the best month to be doing outside construction work. September is a much better month. But that is a stronger number than we've seen in recent years.
When I look at active account growth, active accounts up 2.8% in the month of September. That's a weaker number we'd like to see when you look at it, if you look at our business and look under the hood of our business, we have a -- we actually have more non-residential customers than we do manufacturing customers. We have a lot of small non-residential customers that do nominal amounts with us. The non-res construction segment, the active account is actually down year-over-year. There's a lot of two, three, four, five, ten-person firms that have kind of disappeared into the woodwork over the last 18 months, 12 to 18 months and that's really hurting that number. But overall, our Manufacturing businesses, Active Account growth is in the mid-single digits.
As Will mentioned, the 'pathway to profit', our store headcount has been stabilized since last fall. We're starting to grow that number, and I think we continue to do a nice job of managing the remaining piece of our operating expense, of our headcount, both the distribution and manufacturing group, as well as the administrative support. Gross profit margin, as Will touched on this slipped a bit from Q2 to Q3. Drop about 35 basis points and again, when you look under the hood, really driven by the end market mix change. We slipped our transactional margins, slipped about 25 basis points and our organizational profit, second point to that, slipped about 10 but it's really driven by the end market change, large OEM customers, fewer non-res construction customers, smaller customers in the mix.
Operating administrative expenses overall managed it well. The growth there is all centered on incentive compensation, store commission, profitability, bonuses throughout the organization, profit sharing contributions throughout the organization and if I look at that year-over-year, that number is up. Those three things combined are up over 100% more than they were a year ago. Sequentially though, they're up about 6.5%, which is much more in line with the 7.6% sequential growth in pretax.
From a working capital standpoint, we continue to manage our working capital, I believe, well. Accounts receivable grew nominally more than sales, and that's really attributed to the fact that again, similar to out gross margin discussion, large accounts, large customers drove a lot of our sales growth and they've oftentimes have the ability to negotiate terms that maybe are slightly better than our overall average business.
Inventory, while we did -- our goal was to hold it flat, we did allow it to grow to support the added business because what we provide to our customers, we are their source of supply. They essentially outsource, procurement of a lot of these products to us. We will not betray that trust. We will stand ready to support their needs throughout their business cycle, and therefore we allow the inventory to grow somewhat.
From a cash flow standpoint, when we started the 'pathway to profit' our stated goal consisted of really three numbers: an operating cash flow that would run somewhere between 80% and 90% of our net earnings; we would spend somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% of that number over time, we felt on capital expenditures, which should lead 55% to 65% of our net earnings available in the form of free cash, year-to-date, we generated 83.1% of earnings in operating cash flow, we've spent about 20% of that in CapEx infrastructure to support future growth; free cash flow, which in our definition is operating cash flow less CapEx, came in at 63.4%.
With that, I will turn it over to the narrator for Q&A, and we'll take your calls. Thank you."

And sometimes what happens is when companies are busy, unless they're less inclined to make changes to things because you're too busy to do it because changing a supplier or making changes to your business requires a tremendous amount of energy and sometimes you just don't have that energy left over at the end of the day to make those changes. And so we saw -- so I do know in 2008, '09 and '10, we have been gaining market share. With that said, when I look at it on a customer-by-customer basis, that business was mauled a year ago. That business was off dramatically. It wasn't uncommon to see a customer down 35%, 40%, 45%. And so a good chunk of this is shared dollar per customer gain on a year-over-year basis. But we are taking market share."

When you look at the dramatic fluctuations you've had over the last 18, 24 months, sometimes, the only sanity you can get or clarity you can get to your business is looking at the sequential patterns because again, when your comparisons are changing so widely, they become less meaningful. So it's really about us when we look out to historically September, October is our high watermark of the year as far as daily sales average. From October to January, you pick up maybe 90 basis points in additional daily sales and then you start that stairway for the next year of where do we get to by September, October. Providing we continue to see things we're seeing today, which are positive to that historical trendline, that's what really builds confidence in your business and this  is where we are today. And the only wild card that comes into play in my mind is when you look at things that are going on, for example, a lot of the investments we're making internationally that Will touched on earlier doesn't necessarily translate into always so many stores because we're going into new markets. And sometimes, the footprints of that market, it can be a manifest, differently. But generally speaking, we're fairly optimistic when we look at 2011 and we're mid-Western and conservative almost on the verge of being boring."

And trying to understand what's the best way to utilize that cash for them. In 2008, we saw it as additional dividend. We increased our dividend meaningfully in each of the last two years. However, in 2010, I've chosen not to be in the market, we still waver between what is the best value, what is the best return for our shareholders.

So about 300 basis points of labor efficiency and about 200 basis points of occupancy efficiency. And that efficiency and occupancy was all about growing our average store size because the occupancy expense on a per store basis doesn't change when you go from 50,000 to 100,000 appreciably. And when I look at the third quarter numbers as an example, of that 200 basis points of operating margin expansion that we were getting from occupancy alone, 160 of that is still on the table.

So our plan for e-commerce, and it seems to be working well although it's small, is to get our customers in the local market to place orders off the web using in as order a search method and an order placing mechanism through our local place of business. Now if they want to buy it just like they do from Amazon and have it shipped in, we're happy to do that but most customers would rather have the product delivered locally if they can. So we need to do as an organization we need to go out to our customers and all the customers in the area, introduce them to fastenal.com, which is a very good website, it has a very good search engine, show them what we're capable of doing and change their habits from picking up the telephone and calling us to turning on their keyboard and placing an order with us electronically. The benefit to us: one is, they see a lot broader product offering; two is we can download their customized pricing so we don't have to look it up every time they call; and three is that the order comes in electronically. It does save us time and energy and processing the order because it's already in the system. They entered it instead of one of our people. So we recognize the benefits of it. We have a very strong initiative internally. Nevertheless, well, basically throughout 2010 we've seen a tremendous increase in the activity but we have a long ways to go. The first one to admit, that's one area where Fastenal is probably not the leader in industrial distribution. We're going to catch up and pass people as time goes on and we're going to do it fast."

I'm very proud of the results that we produced in the third quarter of 2010. Overall, I think we did a very good job. We continue to see strength in our top line revenue in all areas of our business. Geographically, in the United States, we really don't see any weak spots at this time. We have stores and small areas that may not be doing as well, but overall, we're seeing strength in all parts of the country, which is very encouraging. It's been a long time since we've seen that. Even back in 2008 when we were doing well, there were certain areas that were very slow.
We had a particularly strong September and when you look at September year-over-year, the number was good at 23 1/2% but really the strength -- the good numbers from September looked at the sequential growth, because September is really the most difficult comp that we had from last year because we had a very good September, August, September last year when we improved upon that in 2010, so we're very happy with those results.
Both our Canadian and Mexican businesses are growing above the company average, and they're both becoming larger and actually a meaningful part of our growth number at this point. The other international businesses, mainly Asia and Europe, are both doing very well and are also growing above the company averages. So outside of the United States, our business is very strong and the profitability of those businesses continues to improve as we become better at running the businesses and have greater sales revenue.
At this time, the real strength in our business is being driven by our manufacturing customers and if you broke down the manufacturing customers, it's mainly the large ones. We're doing well with all sections and sizes and types of manufacturing businesses, but the large customers are driving our business. We're seeing the best growth out of that group of customers. 
But because of this, we're also seeing pressure on our margin. Traditionally, the large manufacturing customers are also our lowest margin customers. So although our margin did go backwards from the second quarter, we're pretty comfortable with where we are and we're still very comfortable with that 52% margin range that we’ve stated over the last year or two. We're going to have to work hard for it, but we also believe that over time, our smaller customers in our Construction business will pick back up and the mix will change more positively for our growth going forward.
The entire Fastenal team did a really nice job on expense control not only in the third quarter, but throughout the entire year. The only area of expenses that really outgrew or was disproportionate to our sales growth was the commission and bonuses, which is, as we say, a very good problem. But even that will normalize in 2011 because in 2009, the commission and bonuses were at basically all-time low levels as a percentage of revenue. 2010 at an almost all-time high level. So in 2011, that will normalize and should be able to show a very good growth over those numbers from an earnings standpoint.
We continue to add new stores in the third quarter. We added 45 new stores. We plan to end the year at somewhere between 125 and 130 new stores for the year, which would give us about 35 to 40 stores for the rest of the year. And we're comfortable that we can get that done in the next two, mainly in the next two months in the beginning of December.
From a headcount standpoint, we continue to add people in our stores. We're not really aggressive with that. We do continue to add people in our stores mainly to support our existing and growing business, but also some additional sales people. 
On the support side, we've been really pretty tight. We've added, if you do a comparison, we're looking back at the numbers, if you look back to the start of our 'pathway to profit,' which was the first quarter of 2007, we actually -- if you take out the 90 people we added for the Holo-Krome acquisition, we have fewer people in support today than we did in the first quarter of 2007, and I don't think we're squeezing it too hard. I think we're just working really hard at becoming more efficient with how we run our business and finding things that we maybe didn't have to do or can't do in the future, but overall, the business seems to be running well. We're seeing very low turnover with our support help, so I don't think we're driving them out the door by driving them too hard. So we're very comfortable with where we are on the support help, and we believe we can continue to see that trend going forward. We'll have to add some additional people, but the trend of becoming more efficient should stay with us for a long time.
Just changing to a more of an overview or some thoughts on the business. I had a Fastenal board meeting yesterday and I was talking to our board members, and the one thing that I pointed out at the end of the meeting that I think is helping us do as well as we are, and it's really the strength of our team. 
If you look at everywhere from the starting at the store managers, district managers, warehouse managers, our VPs and all the way to the top, our turnover has continued to go down and especially at the district, regional and hub-manager levels, really the core of people running our business, and we continue to get stronger in those positions. And I believe that trend and the work that the people are doing there should bode well for the company and the shareholders for a long time going forward. And I really pounded that point yesterday with the board, and I want to make that point with our shareholders, because it really is important, because all the numbers don't mean anything if you don't have the team on the field that really wants to win and that wants to work here. And at that part of our business, I think we're doing very well. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan will give you a lot more color and granularity to the numbers. Thank you."

As you saw, our sales trends continue to improve. If I look at the information that we break out on Page 2 of our earnings release, we talk about the se",1093,"Thank you, Will, and good morning, everybody, and again thank you for participating in our call today. As you saw, our sales trends continue to improve. If I look at the information that we break out on Page 2 of our earnings release, we talk about the sequential patterns. 
In the first quarter, if you look at what our sequential patterns are doing relative to our benchmark period, we were beating those numbers on a sequential basis on average about 1%. So our sequential change, the Delta, was about 1% above. And the second quarter moderated slightly down to about 0.4%. We're still beating it, but it moderated slightly. In the third quarter, to be honest with you, I was surprised by this; we continued to see -- we saw that turn around and we were beating that sequential pattern by about 1.4%. And as Will mentioned, a lot of that can be attributed to strengthen in our Large Account business, which is growing quite well right now. Our largest account business, what we call our key account business is growing closer to, well, 30% neighborhood versus the overall business and giving us a nice surge in top line and gross profit dollars.
And while that business, as Will mentioned, might carry a lower gross margin, the operating margins in that business are very attractive because over time, there's enough volume going there that you can manage in your operating expenses quite effectively and garner a very attractive operating margin on the business.
In addition to the sequential patterns, if you look at the chart we have on Page 3, you can see that we now, for the year, every month except for February, and February was really hurt a little bit because of weather, every other month of the year has been at or above our trend line. So we feel comfort in the sustainability of these trends. Therefore, as I touch on a little bit later, we allowed our inventory dollars to grow a little bit to support that business. I'll touch on that in a few minutes. 
From an end market perspective, and we added a couple new graphs to our earnings release, Manufacturing business continued the positive trend, and we continued to see some upticks in our Non-Res Construction business that we started to see in the June, July timeframe. If I look at where our daily average was in January and I fast-forward that to September, our Manufacturing business year-to-date is up 17%, daily average. Our Construction business is actually up 24.4% from where it was January to September. Now most of that is normal seasonality. Obviously, especially in the northern states, January is not exactly the best month to be doing outside construction work. September is a much better month. But that is a stronger number than we've seen in recent years.
When I look at active account growth, active accounts up 2.8% in the month of September. That's a weaker number we'd like to see. When you really look at it, if you look at our business and look under the hood of our business, we have a -- we actually have more non-residential customers than we do manufacturing customers. We have a lot of small non-residential customers that do nominal amounts with us. The Non-Res Construction segment, the active accounts there is actually down year-over-year. There's a lot of two-, three-, four-, five-, ten-person firms that have kind of disappeared into the woodwork over the last 18 months, 12 to 18 months, and that's really hurting that number. But overall, our Manufacturing businesses, active account growth is in the mid-single digits.
As Will mentioned, in the 'pathway to profit,' our store headcount has been stabilized since last fall. We're starting to grow that number, and I think we continue to do a nice job of managing the remaining piece of our operating expense, of our headcount, both the distribution and manufacturing group, as well as the administrative support. Gross profit margin, as Will touched on, did slip a bit from Q2 to Q3. It dropped about 35 basis points and again, when you look under the hood, really driven by the end market mix change. Our transactional margin slipped about 25 basis points and our organizational profit, the second point of that, slipped about 10, but it's really driven by the end market change, large OEM customers, fewer non-res construction customers, smaller customers in the mix.
Operating and administrative expenses overall managed it well. The growth there is all centered on incentive compensation, store commission, profitability bonuses throughout the organization, profit sharing contributions throughout the organization and if I look at that year-over-year, that number is up. Those three things combined are up over 100% from where they were a year ago. Sequentially though, they're up about 6 1/2%, which is much more in line with the 7.6% sequential growth in pretax.
From a working capital standpoint, we continue to manage our working capital, I believe, well. Accounts receivable grew nominally more than sales, and that's really attributed to the fact that again, similar to our gross margin discussion, large accounts, large customers drove a lot of our sales growth and they oftentimes have the ability to negotiate terms that maybe are slightly better than our overall average business.
Inventory, while we did -- our goal was to hold it flat, we did allow it to grow to support the added business because what we provide to our customers, we are their source of supply. They essentially outsource procurement of a lot of these products to us. We will not betray that trust. We will stand ready to support their needs throughout their business cycle, and therefore we allow the inventory to grow somewhat.
From a cash flow standpoint, when we started the 'pathway to profit,' our stated goal consisted of really three numbers: an operating cash flow that would run somewhere between 80% and 90% of our net earnings; we would spend somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% of that number over time, we felt, on capital expenditures, which would lead 55% to 65% of our net earnings available in the form of free cash. Year-to-date, we generated 83.1% of earnings in operating cash flow. We've spent about 20% of that in CapEx infrastructure to support future growth. Free cash flow, which in our definition is operating cash flow less CapEx, came in at 63.4%.
With that, I will turn it over to the narrator for Q&A, and we'll take your calls. Thank you."

And sometimes what happens is when companies are busy, sometimes they're less inclined to make changes to things because you're too busy to do it because changing a supplier or making changes to your business requires a tremendous amount of energy and sometimes you just don't have that energy left over at the end of the day to make those changes. And so we saw -- so I do know in 2008, '09 and '10, we have been gaining market share. With that said, when I look at it on a customer-by-customer basis, that business was mauled a year ago. That business was off dramatically. It wasn't uncommon to see a customer down 35%, 40%, 45%. And so a good chunk of this is shared dollar per customer gain on a year-over-year basis.

I think it's more about what's the sequential pattern. When you look at the dramatic fluctuations you've had over the last 18, 24 months, sometimes, the only sanity you can get or clarity you can get to your business is looking at the sequential patterns because again, when your comparisons are changing so wildly, they become less meaningful. So it's really about us, when we look out to historically September, October is our high watermark of the year as far as daily sales average. From October to January, you pick up maybe 90 basis points in additional daily sales and then you start that stairway for the next year of where do we get to by September, October. Providing we continue to see things we're seeing today, which are positive to that historical trend line, that's what really builds confidence in your business and this is where we are today. And the only wild card that comes into play in my mind is when you look at things that are going on, for example, a lot of the investments we're making internationally, as Will touched on earlier, doesn't necessarily translate into always so many stores because we're going into new markets. And sometimes, the footprints of that market manifest itself a little differently.

When we started the 'pathway to profit,' and e talked about the 500-basis-points increase improvement in our operating margin, it was largely an operating expense discussion. About 60% of that was going to come from labor efficiencies over time because we didn't need to add as much support infrastructure to support that sales growth. So about 300 basis points of labor efficiency and about 200 basis points of occupancy efficiency. And that efficiency in occupancy was all about growing our average store size because the occupancy expense on a per store basis doesn't change when you go from 50,000 to 100,000 appreciably. And when I look at the third quarter numbers as an example, of that 200 basis points of operating margin expansion that we were getting from occupancy alone, 160 of that’s still on the table. But what needs to happen to get that is our average store size needs to continue to grow and run away from, if you will, that fixed occupancy expense."

So we've really done a nice job. What it really tells me is that we don't need to get to the 125,000 because of all the things we're doing, and so the goal of 'pathway to profit' 23% is not as far away as we once thought it was. So those are very encouraging numbers, and we still have a lot of opportunity. One other thing, and I was going to touch on this, we also have opportunity in distribution for next year because we don't plan to open any large distribution centers. In the last couple years, we've invested very heavily in Indianapolis and some of our other distribution centers, Dallas, to mention another one. That's pretty much behind us so we're going to start leveraging that fixed cost as we go forward with higher revenue base."

So our plan for e-commerce, and it seems to be working well although it's small, is to get our customers in the local market to place orders off the Web, using as an order a search method and an order placing mechanism through our local place of business. Now if they want to buy it just like they do from Amazon and have it shipped in, we're happy to do that, but most customers would rather have the product delivered locally if they can. So what we need to do as an organization, we need to go out to our existing customers and all the customers in the area; introduce them to fastenal.com, which is a very good website, it has a very good search engine; show them what we're capable of doing and change their habits from picking up the telephone and calling us to turning onto their keyboard and placing an order with us electronically. The benefit to us, one is they see a lot broader product offering; two is we can download their customized pricing for them so we don't have to look it up every time they call; and three is that the order comes in electronically. It does save us time and energy in processing the order because it's already in the system. They entered it instead of one of our people entering it. So we recognize the benefits of it. We have a very strong initiative internally. Nevertheless, well, basically throughout 2010, we've seen a tremendous increase in the activity, but we have a long ways to go. The first one to admit, that's one area where Fastenal is probably not the leader in industrial distribution. We plan to catch up and pass people as time goes on and we're going to do it fast."

I'm very proud of the results that we produced in the third quarter of 2010. Overall, I think we did a very good job. We continue to see strength in our top line revenue in all areas of our business. Geographically, in the United States, we really don't see any weak spots at this time. We have stores and small areas that may not be doing as well, but overall, we're seeing strength in all parts of the country, which is very encouraging. It's been a long time since we've seen that. Even back in 2008 when we were doing well, there were certain areas that were very slow.
We had a particularly strong September and when you look at September year-over-year, the number was good at 23 1/2% but really the strength -- the good numbers from September looked at the sequential growth, because September is really the most difficult comp that we had from last year because we had a very good September, August, September last year when we improved upon that in 2010, so we're very happy with those results.
Both our Canadian and Mexican businesses are growing above the company average, and they're both becoming larger and actually a meaningful part of our growth number at this point. The other international businesses, mainly Asia and Europe, are both doing very well and are also growing above the company averages. So outside of the United States, our business is very strong and the profitability of those businesses continues to improve as we become better at running the businesses and have greater sales revenue.
At this time, the real strength in our business is being driven by our manufacturing customers and if you broke down the manufacturing customers, it's mainly the large ones. We're doing well with all sections and sizes and types of manufacturing businesses, but the large customers are driving our business. We're seeing the best growth out of that group of customers. 
But because of this, we're also seeing pressure on our margin. Traditionally, the large manufacturing customers are also our lowest margin customers. So although our margin did go backwards from the second quarter, we're pretty comfortable with where we are and we're still very comfortable with that 52% margin range that we’ve stated over the last year or two. We're going to have to work hard for it, but we also believe that over time, our smaller customers in our Construction business will pick back up and the mix will change more positively for our growth going forward.
The entire Fastenal team did a really nice job on expense control not only in the third quarter, but throughout the entire year. The only area of expenses that really outgrew or was disproportionate to our sales growth was the commission and bonuses, which is, as we say, a very good problem. But even that will normalize in 2011 because in 2009, the commission and bonuses were at basically all-time low levels as a percentage of revenue. 2010 at an almost all-time high level, and so 2011, that will normalize and should be able to show very good growth over those numbers from an earnings standpoint.
We continued to add new stores in the third quarter. We added 45 new stores. We plan to end the year at somewhere between 125 and 130 new stores for the year, which would give us about 35 to 40 stores for the rest of the year. And we're comfortable that we can get that done in the next two, mainly in the next two months in the beginning of December.
From a headcount standpoint, we continue to add people in our stores. We're not really aggressive with that. We do continue to add people in our stores mainly to support our existing and growing business, but also some additional salespeople. 
On the support side, we've been really pretty tight. We've added, if you do a comparison, we're looking back at the numbers, if you look back to the start of our 'pathway to profit,' which was in the first quarter of 2007, if you take out the 90 people we added for the Holo-Krome acquisition, we have fewer people in support today than we did in the first quarter of 2007, and I don't think we're squeezing it too hard. I think we're just working really hard at becoming more efficient with how we run our business and finding things that we maybe didn't have to do or we can't do in the future. But overall, the business seems to be running well. We're seeing very low turnover with our support help, so I don't think we're driving them out the door by driving them too hard. So we're very comfortable with where we are on the support help, and we believe we can continue to see that trend going forward. We'll have to add some additional people, but the trend of becoming more efficient should stay with us for a long time.
Just changing to more of an overview or some thoughts on the business. I had a Fastenal board meeting yesterday and I was talking to our board members, and the one thing that I pointed out at the end of the meeting that I think is helping us do as well as we are, and it's really the strength of our team. 
If you look at everywhere from the starting at the store managers, district managers, warehouse managers, RVPs and all the way to the top, our turnover has continued to go down and especially at the district, regional and hub-manager levels, really the core of people running our business, and we continue to get stronger in those positions. And I believe that trend and the work that the people are doing there should bode well for the company and the shareholders for a long time going forward. And I really pounded that point yesterday with the board, and I want to make that point with our shareholders, because it really is important, because all the numbers don't mean anything if you don't have the team on the field that really wants to win and that wants to work here. And at that part of our business, I think we're doing very well. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dan. Dan will give you a lot more color and granularity to the numbers. Thank you."

As you saw, our sales trends continue to improve. If I look at the information that we break out on Page 2 of our earnings release, we talk about the se",1096,"Thank you, Will, and good morning, everybody, and again thank you for participating in our call today. As you saw, our sales trends continue to improve. If I look at the information that we break out on Page 2 of our earnings release, we talk about the sequential patterns. 
In the first quarter, if you look at what our sequential patterns are doing relative to our benchmark period, we were beating those numbers on a sequential basis on average about 1%. So our sequential change, the delta, was about 1% above. And the second quarter that moderated slightly down to about 0.4%. We were still beating it, but it moderated slightly. In the third quarter, to be honest with you, I was surprised by this; we continued to see -- we saw that turn around and we were beating that sequential pattern by about 1.4%. And as Will mentioned, a lot of that can be attributed to strength in our Large Account business, which is growing quite well right now. Our largest account business, what we call our key account business is growing closer to, low 30% neighborhood versus the overall business and giving us a nice surge in top line and gross profit dollars.
And while that business, as Will mentioned, might carry a lower gross margin, the operating margins in that business are very attractive because over time, there's enough volume going there that you can manage in your operating expenses quite effectively and garner a very attractive operating margin on the business.
In addition to the sequential patterns, if you look at the chart we have on Page 3, you can see that we now, for the year, every month except for February, and February was really hurt a little bit because of weather, every other month of the year it's been at or above our trend line. So we feel some comfort in the sustainability of these trends. Therefore, as I touch on a little bit later, we allowed our inventory dollars to grow a little bit to support that business. But I'll touch on that in a few minutes. 
From an end market perspective, and we added a couple new graphs to our earnings release, Manufacturing business continued the positive trend, and we continued to see some upticks in our Non-Res Construction business that we started to see in the June, July timeframe. If I look at where our daily average was in January and I fast-forward that to September, our Manufacturing business year-to-date is up 17%, daily average. Our Construction business is actually up 24.4% from where it was January to September. Now most of that is normal seasonality. Obviously, especially in the northern states, January is not exactly the best month to be doing outside construction work. September is a much better month. But that is a stronger number than we've seen in recent years.
When I look at active account growth, active accounts up 2.8% in the month of September. That's a weaker number we'd like to see. When you really look at it, if you look at our business and look under the hood of our business, we actually have more non-residential customers than we do manufacturing customers. We have a lot of small non-residential customers that do nominal amounts with us. The Non-Res Construction segment, the active accounts there is actually down year-over-year. There's a lot of two-, three-, four-, five-, 10-person firms that have kind of disappeared into the woodwork over the last 18 months, 12 to 18 months, and that's really hurting that number. But overall, our Manufacturing business's active account growth is in the mid-single digits.
As Will mentioned, in the 'pathway to profit,' our store headcount has been stabilized since last fall. We're starting to grow that number, and I think we continue to do a nice job of managing the remaining piece of our operating expense, of our headcount, both the distribution and manufacturing group, as well as the administrative support. Gross profit margin, as Will touched on, did slip a bit from Q2 to Q3. It dropped about 35 basis points, and again, when you look again under the hood, really driven by the end market mix change. Our transactional margin slipped about 25 basis points and our organizational profit, the second component of that, slipped about 10 basis points, but it's really driven by the end market change, large OEM customers, fewer non-res construction customers, smaller customers in the mix.
Operating and administrative expenses overall managed it well. The growth there is all centered on incentive compensation, store commission, profitability bonuses throughout the organization, profit sharing contributions throughout the organization and if I look at that year-over-year, that number is up. Those three things combined are up over 100% from where they were a year ago. Sequentially though, they're up about 6 1/2%, which is much more in line with the 7.6% sequential growth in pretax.
From a working capital standpoint, we continue to manage our working capital, I believe, well. Accounts receivable grew nominally more than sales, and that's really attributed to the fact that again, similar to our gross margin discussion, large accounts, large customers drove a lot of our sales growth and they oftentimes have the ability to negotiate terms that maybe are slightly better than our overall average business.
Inventory, while we did -- our goal was to hold it flat, we did allow it to grow to support the added business because what we provide to our customers, we are their source of supply. They essentially outsource procurement of a lot of these products to us. We will not betray that trust. We will stand ready to support their needs throughout their business cycle, and therefore we allow the inventory to grow somewhat.
From a cash flow standpoint, when we started the 'pathway to profit,' our stated goal consisted of really three numbers: an operating cash flow that would run somewhere between 80% and 90% of our net earnings; we would spend somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% of that number over time, we felt, on capital expenditures, which would lead 55% to 65% of our net earnings available in the form of free cash. Year-to-date, we generated 83.1% of earnings in operating cash flow. We've spent about 20% of that in CapEx infrastructure to support future growth. Free cash flow, which in our definition is operating cash flow less CapEx, came in at 63.4%.
With that, I will turn it over to the narrator for Q&A, and we'll take your calls. Thank you."

And sometimes what happens is when companies are busy, sometimes they're less inclined to make changes to things because you're too busy to do it because changing a supplier or making changes to your business requires a tremendous amount of energy and sometimes you just don't have that energy left over at the end of the day to make those changes. And so we saw -- so I do know in 2008, '09 and '10, we have been gaining market share. With that said, when I look at it on a customer-by-customer basis, that business was mauled a year ago. That business was off dramatically. It wasn't uncommon to see a customer down 35%, 40%, 45%. And so a good chunk of this is shared dollar per customer gain on a year-over-year basis.

So it's really about us, when we look out to historically September, October is our high watermark of the year as far as daily sales average. From October to January, you pick up maybe 90 basis points in additional daily sales and then you start that stairway for the next year of where do we get to by September, October. Providing we continue to see things we're seeing today, which are positive to that historical trend line, that's what really builds confidence in your business and this is where we are today. And the only wild card that comes into play in my mind is when you look at things that are going on, for example, a lot of the investments we're making internationally, as Will touched on earlier, doesn't necessarily translate into always so many stores because we're going into new markets. And sometimes, the footprints of that market manifest itself a little differently.

When we started the 'pathway to profit,' and we talked about the 500-basis-points increase improvement in our operating margin, it was largely an operating expense discussion.

So about 300 basis points of labor efficiency and about 200 basis points of occupancy efficiency. And that efficiency in occupancy was all about growing our average store size because the occupancy expense on a per store basis doesn't change when you go from 50,000 to 100,000 appreciably. And when I look at the third quarter numbers as an example, of that 200 basis points of operating margin expansion that we were getting from occupancy alone, 160 of that’s still on the table.

So our plan for e-commerce, and it seems to be working well although it's small, is to get our customers in the local market to place orders off the Web, using it as a search method and an order placing mechanism through our local place of business. Now if they want to buy it just like they do from Amazon and have it shipped in, we're happy to do that, but most customers would rather have the product delivered locally if they can. So what we need to do as an organization, we need to go out to our existing customers and all the customers in the area; introduce them to fastenal.com, which is a very good website, has a very good search engine; show them what we're capable of doing and change their habits from picking up the telephone and calling us to turning around to their keyboard and placing an order with us electronically. The benefit to us, one is they see a lot broader product offering; two is we can download their customized pricing to them so we don't have to look it up every time they call; and three is if the order comes in electronically, it does save us time and energy in processing the order because it's already in the system. They entered it instead of one of our people entering it. So we recognize the benefits of it. We have a very strong initiative internally. Nevertheless, well, basically throughout 2010, we've seen a tremendous increase in the activity, but we have a long ways to go. The first one to admit, that's one area where Fastenal is probably not the leader in industrial distribution. We plan to catch up and pass people as time goes on and we're going to do it fast."
