I'm Susan White, Director of Investor Relations for Novell. And with me today from our executive offices in Waltham, Massachusetts are Ron Hovsepian, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dana Russ",664,"Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm Susan White, Director of Investor Relations for Novell. And with me today from our executive offices in Waltham, Massachusetts are Ron Hovsepian, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dana Russell, our Chief Financial Officer. We are here this afternoon to discuss Novell's financial results for the first fiscal quarter 2010. If you don't yet have our press release, you can access it by visiting our Investor Relations webpage at www.novell.com/company/ir. This call is also being broadcast through our website and will be archived on our website for a minimum of 12 months.Before I turn the call over to Dana, I'd like to take a moment to say that we will be providing non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. We believe that these measures enhance an overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future to enable investors to evaluate our performance in the same way that management does. Management uses these same non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, allocate resources and determine compensation. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results, but they eliminate expenses and gains that are excluded from most analysts' consensus estimates that are unusual and/or that arise outside the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, those related to stock-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, restructuring, asset impairments, litigation judgments and settlements, purchase in-process research and development, and the sale of business operations, long-term investments and property, plant and equipment.  We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. As I mentioned, a copy of that release is on our website. During our prepared remarks, we will mention some non-GAAP measures. The corresponding GAAP measures are Q1 '10 GAAP net income of $20 million and GAAP EPS of $0.06 per share. Q1 fiscal 2010 GAAP operating margin of 11%, up from 6% year-over-year. We may also provide projections for non-GAAP financial measures, such as projected non-GAAP operating margin, projected non-GAAP tax rate and so forth. The corresponding forward-looking GAAP financial measures are not available, and cannot be provided without undue effort because we are unable to accurately forecast information regarding expenses or gains such as, but not limited to, those previously described. We believe that the corresponding GAAP financial measure is not likely to be significant to an understanding of our business, because there's likely to be substantial variability between projected and actual realization of the expenses and gains described above and/or that such expenses or gains are likely to arise outside the ordinary course of business.We will also provide information regarding Novell's general product direction roadmap. It is intended for information purposes only and may not be incorporated into any contract. It is not a commitment to deliver any material, code or functionality, and should not be relied upon in making purchasing decisions. The development, release and timing of any features or functionality described in Novell's products remains at the sole discretion of Novell.Finally, please note that during today's call, we may make forward-looking statements. You should be aware that actual results could differ materially  from those contained in the forward-looking statements, which are based on current management expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2009, and in a press release we issued earlier today. Forward-looking statements do not reflect the occurrence of unplanned or unanticipated events, and cannot take into account unforeseen circumstances. Actual results for future periods may differ from those projected. Any forward-looking information that we provide in this call represents our outlook as of today, February 25, 2010, and we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements, except as may be required by the law. With that, we're ready for our CFO, Dana Russell."

Novell's first fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $202 million. GAAP income from operations was $21 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $33 million. Non-GAAP net income w",733,"Thanks, Susan. Novell's first fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $202 million. GAAP income from operations was $21 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $33 million. Non-GAAP net income was $25 million or $0.07 per share.The quarter's financial results included a $5 million change in accounting estimate related to 2009 sales compensation expense that increased profitability in the quarter. This benefit was more than offset by a $6 million negative impact to income from operations from foreign currency exchange rates on a year-over-year basis. Product invoicing was up year-over-year by 10%, driven by strength in Linux and Identity products. However, revenue declined 6% due to softness in 2009 invoicing and weakness in our legacy products.In alignment with our Intelligent Workload Management strategy, which we announced last year, we've reorganized in two business units. The Open Platform Solutions, Identity and Security Management and Systems and Resource Management business units have been combined into one business unit called Security, Management and Operating Platforms. The W Workgroup business unit has been renamed Collaboration Solutions. As a result, we're reporting two business unit P&Ls instead of four, as seen on Page 9 of our press release. In addition, we have also provided fully allocated BU P&Ls.Now I'll highlight some of our business unit results on Pages 9 and 10 of our press release. Our Security Management and Operating Platforms product revenue was $109 million, up 3% year-over-year. Invoicing was up 26% year-over-year. Operating margins were a negative 3%, improved from a negative 7% a year ago. We made a commitment that Linux would be breakeven at the end of this year. Even though we don't report Linux separately, this business was breakeven, which is a significant milestone. While operating margins for Security, Management and Operating Platform business unit may fluctuate on a quarterly basis, we feel good about the progress we've made and expect margins to continue to improve.Linux Platform Products revenue in the quarter was $37 million, increasing 6% from the year-ago quarter. Linux invoicing was fairly consistent with the last few quarters, but was up 75% year-over-year. Renewal of Linux distribution associated with Microsoft certificates began during the quarter, and as expected, we realized much lower invoicing than the original agreement. Lower invoicing associated with Microsoft certificates was offset by significant growth in our non-Microsoft invoicing.Moving on to Identity, Access and Compliance Management, product revenue was $29 million, up 13%, and invoicing increased 40%. Systems and Resource Management product revenue was $38 million, down 5%. Turning to Collaboration Solutions business unit, product revenue was $71 million, down 12%. Within Collaboration, the combined OES and NetWare-related product revenue was $42 million, down 6%. Collaboration operating margin was 47%. Since we have no current plans to reduce expenses in this business unit, margins will depend upon revenue levels.Operating expenses were down compared to a year ago, primarily due to reduced sales and marketing and product development expenses. Q2 expenses are expected to increase compared to Q1 levels. Q1 expenses were unnaturally low due to the $5 million benefit I previously discussed.Next, I want to highlight a cost of revenue reclassification. We have historically reported all technical support costs in the services cost of revenue line. We have moved technical support costs associated with maintenance to the maintenance cost of revenue line. This is approximately a $9 million quarterly change between line items in the Cost of Revenue section of the P&L. This change only impacts line items within cost of sales, and does not impact revenue, total cost of sales or total gross profit. A schedule showing the recast in historical amounts is available on our IR website. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 3,500, down from 3,600 in the prior quarter.Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, cash and short-term investments were $991 million, up from the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $5 million for the quarter. This compares to $13 million a year ago, which included a $25 million payment from Microsoft, normalizing for this payment, cash flow from operations was up $17 million year-over-year.Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we expect revenue to be similar to the Q1 levels, and non-GAAP operating margins of 12% to 15%. We assume FX rates hold steady with today's exchange rates.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron."

I'm pleased we delivered the invoicing growth we predicted last quarter while maintaining our non-GAAP operating margins. We saw signs that select markets improved, particularly in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Customer and partner reaction",916,"Thanks, Dana. I'm pleased we delivered the invoicing growth we predicted last quarter while maintaining our non-GAAP operating margins. We saw signs that select markets improved, particularly in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Customer and partner reaction to our Intelligent Workload Management strategy has been encouraging. Consequently, we expect many of the solutions within our Security, Management and Operating Platforms business unit to benefit.Intelligent Workload Management capitalizes on the emerging trends of virtualization and cloud computing. According to Gartner, 16% of computing workloads are virtualized today, growing to an estimated 50% of workloads by 2012. IDC estimates only about 1% of computing workloads are hosted in the cloud today, and is expected to grow very quickly at about a 30% CAGR. The move to virtualization in cloud computing is motivated by two factors: Minimizing costs and maximizing flexibility. So while the prospect of lower cost and increased flexibility of these new business models is promising, issues around security, performance management and availability have slowed their adoption.Customers are seeking workload portability across their physical, virtual and cloud environments, while minimizing risk and complexity. They need integrated security, compliance and control so they can trust their critical business processes and data to a cloud environment. To satisfy these competing requirements, they need tools that enable them to create and manage workloads that have built-in security, identity and management capabilities that travel with the workload as it moves from one environment to another. This intelligence inside the workload makes them portable and provides business flexibility. These requirements play well to our current and future capabilities. Our strategy is to help customers build, secure, manage and measure these portable, intelligent workloads that can work across physical, virtual or cloud environments. Novell already has many of the technologies required to address the market. Our Linux Solution to build workloads, Identity and Security Management to secure workloads and Systems Management to manage and measure workloads. I believe this combination of capabilities differentiates us from the competition.We have already begun delivering the Intelligent Workload Management solutions to the market, and our product roadmap for 2010 should further strengthen our portfolio to build, secure, manage and measure intelligent workloads. Here's a brief preview of our product announcements we have planned for fiscal 2010.Starting with build, we help clients build intelligent workloads on the foundation of our SUSE Linux operating platform. In the first quarter, we announced the SUSE Appliance Toolkit, which further extends our SUSE Studio capabilities. Taken together, these tools improve the efficiency of building, deploying and maintaining appliances or workloads in the physical, virtual and cloud environments.Next, we help clients secure intelligent workloads with products from our Identity and Security Management portfolio. This year, we plan to add new capabilities to these products that bring identity and policy awareness into the workload itself, allowing it to be managed and moved with the appropriate security in the data center and the cloud. Later this year, Novell plans to ship two new products to further extend customers' ability to secure their intelligent workloads.The first is the Novell Cloud Security Service, which is a new solution that would enable enterprises to enforce their own identity and security protocols into the cloud. The second offering is the Novell Identity Manager 4, which adds significant functionality to Novell's flagship Identity Management product, making it possible to securely manage identities and access across physical and virtual environments.Moving on to manage. In 2010, Novell plans to introduce new products that integrate and extend our systems and resource management capabilities to the cloud to ensure optimal execution of workloads, both on and off-site. These product announcements include PlateSpin Atlantic, which is a self-service system that will provide on-demand applications to business managers, while automatically optimizing IT deployment of workloads using a combination of physical, virtual and cloud computing resources.And finally, measure. To help customers measure and gain real-time insights into IT operations, Novell offers a suite of business service products. This year, we plan to launch Novell Compliance Automation, which is an integrated holistic view of both IT system performance and compliance. This will make it easier to optimize the deployment of workloads across physical, virtual and cloud systems, as well as get real-time alerts to compliance issues.To align around our Intelligent Workload Management strategy, we have consolidated our operations from four business units down to two. The new Security, Management and Operating Platforms business unit will be better equipped to address all of the components to build, secure, manage and measure intelligent workloads. Leading this new business unit is Jim Ebzery, who formerly ran our Identity and Security Management business unit. Jim's background in security fits well with our security-focused approach to intelligent workload management. The Collaboration Solutions business unit is focused on expanding Novell's collaboration portfolio to address the unique requirements of this evolving market. Colleen O'Keefe is the General Manager of the business unit.We believe intelligent workload management is an attractive and growing market and that Novell has the assets to offer a differentiated solution. Our current product portfolio and product roadmap are focused to strengthen our capabilities to build, secure, manage and measure intelligent workloads. We are building our partner ecosystem to complement our solutions and expand our distribution channels. I'm excited about our prospects, and I believe Novell is well positioned to lead in the emerging market of the intelligent workload management, while extending our innovation in the collaboration market. With that, we're ready for your questions. Operator, please open the line for our listeners."

I guess, and I think everyone or at least, we anticipated you're going to see some capacity reductions, given the downturn in the economy, given that these customers, obviously, it was supplemented by Microsoft. So they got them at a much reduced rate themselves. And also, the pricing environment since then has gone down. Can you give us some kind of idea of what kind of renewal rate you did see on that?"

I'll let Ron jump in. I'll make a few comments before he does. I think in terms of the renewals, let me give a more holistic statement about the way we feel about the situation with the deployment of the Microsoft certificates and our ability to renew those. We feel very good about the ability to renew, and we have been renewing very well and feel like we'll continue to do that. When you look at the pricing, though, in terms of the financial impact of the financial statements, the original certificates, we were paid from Microsoft at a 45%-off list price. So 45% discount. And in most of these certificates, especially in the early part of this program, went out to very large strategic customers at fairly significant discounts. And so as we look at the renewals, the expectation is that we could see, well especially for the very large strategic customers, the pricing now has changed dramatically. And what we're seeing is something more akin to an 80% to 90% discount. So if you do the math on that, that would give you a bit of an indication, or give you a very good indication on what we expect as we go forward here with the program, and the financial impact associated with it."

So in 2009, especially as we got midway through the year, we introduced some compensation programs in the sales organization with some accelerators to try to generate some additional revenues. It was outside of our normal program, so to speak, and it was a result of the softness that the entire industry was feeling. And so we felt like some additional motivation might be necessary. We over-expensed in 2009, to put it simply. And as we got through and made the final calculations, the accelerators and things that we had out there that we thought we were going to pay out, we just didn't achieve the revenue numbers that we thought we were going to achieve. And basically, we reversed out $5 million of expense, it was actually about $4.5 million in 2010. So it is a one-time event. And it was really associated with the anomalies that we had in 2009, the general economic circumstances that we're faced with there, the lack of invoicing that we saw throughout the year, as well as programs that we'd implemented that were sort of outside of our norms.

And that was really associated with some unique situation that wasn't related to NetWare OES or group-wise. So from that standpoint, if you were to look at the overall invoicing or recognized revenue, it would be less than what we would be showing in terms of the total recognized revenue drop of 12%. With that said, I can't give you a whole lot of color in terms of what to expect as we go forward here. We did have higher than expected declines in 2009. We did see that diminish a bit here in the first quarter. Looking out into the forecast, where, I guess, we could couch that as cautiously optimistic, that we will have better run rates and a more muted decline. But we don't have great insight into that.

The trick will be as Microsoft goes through its Windows refresh out into the marketplace, is either applications over there that were written in Java that we can get on to a Linux platform in a less expensive manner than it would cost to run on a Windows environment. And that's where the opportunity is for us. They're obviously trying to attack the UNIX to Linux conversions and trying to get over as much of that footprint as they can. In terms of inside the shop, which was kind of your other part of your question, when you look underneath it, almost all the customers I've spoken to personally have both footprints in their shop and anticipate having both a .net framework in their shop, as well as a Java-based framework in their shop, therefore having multiple platforms. And that is strategically part of our bet in the market is that the customer will have multiple platforms. They'll have multiple hypervisors as well, as another dimension of this conversation of an operating platform, because you have the two core stacks of Linux and Windows, but then you'll also have multiple hypervisors into the marketplace. So obviously, ESX from VMware in Hyper-V from Microsoft but the additions of Zen from the Open Source community, KBM, et cetera, are going to be critical as part of that thought process. So I think both camps existed most customers. I don't see one particular group winning or losing at a noticeable rate. They tend to stay in each side of the fence, so to speak, if that helps answer your question."

Three, the thought processes links back to the overall company direction. If you're going to try to optimize the financials for the company inside of that business, you got a lot of lines of code to support on a specialized operating system, which is what NetWare is. It's a ton of lines or codes inside of that. And the key for us was to get that migrated over to between generalized operating system, which is SUSE Linux. So underneath OES, that's really what is critical from my point of view. Also additionally, as you listen with the customers, they're looking for additional flexibility from that specialized operating system. And as you know, as these lifecycles go, the amount of training and skills that are in the market shrinks. And you're managing a very large code base at that point. So that's the trade-off and the juggling act that we approach that with. And it is a fine line of balancing that, but we also saw the opportunity to then bring the customers over and give more flexibility with OES was really the key, and bring forward some of those features, while trying to optimize that financial stream, optimize the customers and really keep those customers with us. We don't want them to leave, obviously. And we obviously want to maintain those revenue relationships as long as we can. So that's why the extended support addresses one group, and then the group that's ready to move to a new operating platform, we think we have to attack that group equally as aggressive, or else we are going to lose them to Windows or to another platform. So from our perspective, you're definitely a novice on it and you have to give your customer choices, and we've given them two choices in our mind: One where they can migrate to a new environment that provides longer-term flexibility; and then two, they can get the extended support. The issue is going to be as we add new features and where we take that product is really the challenge, given that older code base. And you're talking millions and millions of lines of code are inside of there. So you have to juggle that expense and deal with that as part of what we're dealing with in managing that situation."

It's hard to understand why sales and marketing in a company that's doing $21 million in license revenue and I add in new license -- and just not the renewals of the Linux business, but the new Linux business, whatever that is and you try to come up with something whether it's $5 million, $10 million, whatever it is.

We understand where we stand with sales and marketing, especially as it relates to software licenses. We do have to factor in that none of the Linux business is included in the software license category and that, that at least has to be considered. And even with that, we would say that we have been higher than industry standards even if you consider that. However, that has been an area of specific focus where we have been moving to a more indirect model as a way to optimize our expense structure. And so, we continue to work on that.

I'm Susan White, Director of Investor Relations for Novell. And with me today from our executive offices in Waltham, Massachusetts are Ron Hovsepian, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dana Russell, our Chief Financial Officer. We are here this afternoon to discuss Novell's financial results for the first fiscal quarter 2010. If you don't yet have our press release, you can access it by visiting our Investor Relations webpage at www.novell.com/company/ir. This call is also being broadcast through our website and will be archived on our website for a minimum of 12 months.Before I turn the call over to Dana, I'd like to take a moment to say that we will be providing non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. We believe that these measures enhance an overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future to enable investors to evaluate our performance in the same way that management does. Management uses these same non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, allocate resources and determine compensation. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results, but they eliminate expenses and gains that are excluded from most analysts' consensus estimates that are unusual and/or that arise outside the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, those related to stock-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, restructuring, asset impairments, litigation judgments and settlements, purchase in-process research and development, and the sale of business operations, long-term investments and property, plant and equipment.  We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. As I mentioned, a copy of that release is on our website. During our prepared remarks, we will mention some non-GAAP measures. The corresponding GAAP measures are Q1 '10 GAAP net income of $20 million and GAAP EPS of $0.06 per share. Q1 fiscal 2010 GAAP operating margin of 11%, up from 6% year-over-year. We may also provide projections for non-GAAP financial measures, such as projected non-GAAP operating margin, projected non-GAAP tax rate and so forth. The corresponding forward-looking GAAP financial measures are not available, and cannot be provided without undue effort because we are unable to accurately forecast information regarding expenses or gains such as, but not limited to, those previously described. We believe that the corresponding GAAP financial measure is not likely to be significant to an understanding of our business, because there's likely to be substantial variability between projected and actual realization of the expenses and gains described above and/or that such expenses or gains are likely to arise outside the ordinary course of business.We will also provide information regarding Novell's general product direction roadmap. It is intended for information purposes only and may not be incorporated into any contract. It is not a commitment to deliver any material, code or functionality, and should not be relied upon in making purchasing decisions. The development, release and timing of any features or functionality described in Novell's products remains at the sole discretion of Novell.Finally, please note that during today's call, we may make forward-looking statements. You should be aware that actual results could differ materially  from those contained in the forward-looking statements, which are based on current management expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2009, and in a press release we issued earlier today. Forward-looking statements do not reflect the occurrence of unplanned or unanticipated events, and cannot take into account unforeseen circumstances. Actual results for future periods may differ from those projected. Any forward-looking information that we provide in this call represents our outlook as of today, February 25, 2010, and we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements, except as may be required by the law.

Novell's first fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $202 million. GAAP income from operations was $21 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $33 million. Non-GAAP net income w",732,"Thanks, Susan. Novell's first fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $202 million. GAAP income from operations was $21 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $33 million. Non-GAAP net income was $25 million or $0.07 per share.The quarter's financial results included a $5 million change in accounting estimate related to 2009 sales compensation expense that increased profitability in the quarter. This benefit was more than offset by a $6 million negative impact to income from operations from foreign currency exchange rates on a year-over-year basis. Product invoicing was up year-over-year by 10%, driven by strength in Linux and Identity products. However, revenue declined 6% due to softness in 2009 invoicing and weakness in our legacy products.In alignment with our Intelligent Workload Management strategy, which we announced last year, we've reorganized in two business units. The Open Platform Solutions, Identity and Security Management and Systems and Resource Management business units have been combined into one business unit called Security, Management and Operating Platforms. The W Workgroup business unit has been renamed Collaboration Solutions. As a result, we're reporting two business unit P&Ls instead of four, as seen on Page 9 of our press release. In addition, we have also provided fully allocated BU P&Ls.Now I'll highlight some of our business unit results on Pages 9 and 10 of our press release. Our Security Management and Operating Platforms product revenue was $109 million, up 3% year-over-year. Invoicing was up 26% year-over-year. Operating margins were a negative 3%, improved from a negative 7% a year ago. We made a commitment that Linux would be breakeven at the end of this year. Even though we don't report Linux separately, this business was breakeven, which is a significant milestone. While operating margins for Security, Management and Operating Platform business unit may fluctuate on a quarterly basis, we feel good about the progress we've made and expect margins to continue to improve.Linux Platform Products revenue in the quarter was $37 million, increasing 6% from the year-ago quarter. Linux invoicing was fairly consistent with the last few quarters, but was up 75% year-over-year. Renewal of Linux distribution associated with Microsoft certificates began during the quarter, and as expected, we realized much lower invoicing than the original agreement. Lower invoicing associated with Microsoft certificates was offset by significant growth in our non-Microsoft invoicing.Moving on to Identity, Access and Compliance Management product revenue was $29 million, up 13%, and invoicing increased 40%. Systems and Resource Management product revenue was $38 million, down 5%. Turning to Collaboration Solutions business unit, product revenue was $71 million, down 12%. Within Collaboration, the combined OES and NetWare-related product revenue was $42 million, down 6%. Collaboration operating margin was 47%. Since we have no current plans to reduce expenses in this business unit, margins will depend upon revenue levels.Operating expenses were down compared to a year ago, primarily due to reduced sales and marketing and product development expenses. Q2 expenses are expected to increase compared to Q1 levels. Q1 expenses were unnaturally low due to the $5 million benefit I previously discussed.Next, I want to highlight a cost of revenue reclassification. We have historically reported all technical support costs in the services cost of revenue line. We have moved technical support costs associated with maintenance to the maintenance cost of revenue line. This is approximately a $9 million quarterly change between line items in the Cost of Revenue section of the P&L. This change only impacts line items within cost of sales, and does not impact revenue, total cost of sales or total gross profit. A schedule showing the recasted historical amounts is available on our IR website. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 3,500, down from 3,600 in the prior quarter.Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, cash and short-term investments were $991 million, up from the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $5 million for the quarter. This compares to $13 million a year ago, which included a $25 million payment from Microsoft. Normalizing for this payment, cash flow from operations was up $17 million year-over-year.Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we expect revenue to be similar to the Q1 levels and non-GAAP operating margins of 12% to 15%. We assume FX rates hold steady with today's exchange rates.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron."

I'm pleased we delivered the invoicing growth we predicted last quarter while maintaining our non-GAAP operating margins. We saw signs that select markets improved, particularly in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Customer and partner reaction to our Intelligent Workload Management strategy has been encouraging. Consequently, we expect many of the solutions within our Security, Management and Operating Platforms business unit to benefit.Intelligent Workload Management capitalizes on the emerging trends of virtualization and cloud computing. According to Gartner, 16% of computing workloads are virtualized today, growing to an estimated 50% of workloads by 2012. IDC estimates only about 1% of computing workloads are hosted in the cloud today, and is expected to grow very quickly at about a 30% CAGR. The move to virtualization in cloud computing is motivated by two factors: Minimizing costs and maximizing flexibility. So while the prospect of lower cost and increased flexibility of these new business models is promising, issues around security, performance management and availability have slowed their adoption.Customers are seeking workload portability across their physical, virtual and cloud environments, while minimizing risk and complexity. They need integrated security, compliance and control so they can trust their critical business processes and data to a cloud environment. To satisfy these competing requirements, they need tools that enable them to create and manage workloads that have built-in security, identity and management capabilities that travel with the workload as it moves from one environment to another. This intelligence inside the workload makes them portable and provides business flexibility. These requirements play well to our current and future capabilities. Our strategy is to help customers build, secure, manage and measure these portable, intelligent workloads that can work across physical, virtual or cloud environments. Novell already has many of the technologies required to address the market. Our Linux Solution to build workloads, Identity and Security Management to secure workloads and Systems Management to manage and measure workloads. I believe this combination of capabilities differentiates us from the competition.We have already begun delivering the Intelligent Workload Management solutions to the market, and our product roadmap for 2010 should further strengthen our portfolio to build, secure, manage and measure intelligent workloads. Here's a brief preview of our product announcements we have planned for fiscal 2010.Starting with build, we help clients build intelligent workloads on the foundation of our SUSE Linux operating platform. In the first quarter, we announced the SUSE Appliance Toolkit, which further extends our SUSE Studio capabilities. Taken together, these tools improve the efficiency of building, deploying and maintaining appliances or workloads in the physical, virtual and cloud environments.Next, we help clients secure intelligent workloads with products from our Identity and Security Management portfolio. This year, we plan to add new capabilities to these products that bring identity and policy awareness into the workload itself, allowing it to be managed and moved with the appropriate security in the data center and the cloud. Later this year, Novell plans to ship two new products to further extend customers' ability to secure their intelligent workloads.The first is the Novell Cloud Security Service, which is a new solution that would enable enterprises to enforce their own identity and security protocols into the cloud. The second offering is the Novell Identity Manager 4, which adds significant functionality to Novell's flagship Identity Management product, making it possible to securely manage identities and access across physical and virtual environments.Moving on to manage. In 2010, Novell plans to introduce new products that integrate and extend our systems and resource management capabilities to the cloud to ensure optimal execution of workloads, both on and off-site. These product announcements include PlateSpin Atlantic, which is a self-service system that will provide on-demand applications to business managers, while automatically optimizing IT deployment of workloads using a combination of physical, virtual and cloud computing resources.And finally, measure. To help customers measure and gain real-time insights into IT operations, Novell offers a suite of business service products. This year, we plan to launch Novell Compliance Automation, which is an integrated holistic view of both IT system performance and compliance. This will make it easier to optimize the deployment of workloads across physical, virtual and cloud systems, as well as get real-time alerts to compliance issues.To align around our Intelligent Workload Management strategy, we have consolidated our operations from four business units down to two. The new Security, Management and Operating Platforms business unit will be better equipped to address all of the components to build, secure, manage and measure intelligent workloads. Leading this new business unit is Jim Ebzery, who formerly ran our Identity and Security Management business unit. Jim's background in security fits well with our security-focused approach to intelligent workload management. The Collaboration Solutions business unit is focused on expanding Novell's collaboration portfolio to address the unique requirements of this evolving market. Colleen O'Keefe is the General Manager of the business unit.We believe intelligent workload management is an attractive and growing market and that Novell has the assets to offer a differentiated solution. Our current product portfolio and product roadmap are focused to strengthen our capabilities to build, secure, manage and measure intelligent workloads. We are building our partner ecosystem to complement our solutions and expand our distribution channels. I'm excited about our prospects, and I believe Novell is well positioned to lead in the emerging market of the intelligent workload management, while extending our innovation in the collaboration market. With that, we're ready for your questions. Operator, please open the line for our listeners."

And in most of these certificates, especially in the early part of this program, went out to very large strategic customers at fairly significant discounts. And so as we look at the renewals, the expectation is that we could see, well especially for the very large strategic customers, the pricing now has changed dramatically. And what we're seeing is something more akin to an 80% to 90% discount. So if you do the math on that, that would give you a bit of an indication, or give you a very good indication on what we expect as we go forward here with the program, and the financial impact associated with it."

So in 2009, especially as we got midway through the year, we introduced some compensation programs in the sales organization with some accelerators to try to generate some additional revenues. It was outside of our normal program, so to speak, and it was a result of the softness that the entire industry was feeling. And so we felt like some additional motivation might be necessary. We over-expensed in 2009, to put it simply. And as we got through and made the final calculations, the accelerators and things that we had out there that we thought we were going to pay out, we just didn't achieve the revenue numbers that we thought we were going to achieve. And basically, we reversed out $5 million of expense, it was actually about $4.5 million in 2010. So it is a one-time event. And it was really associated with the anomalies that we had in 2009, the general economic circumstances that we're faced with there, the lack of invoicing that we saw throughout the year, as well as programs that we'd implemented that were sort of outside of our norms.

And that was really associated with some unique situation that wasn't related to NetWare OES or group-wise. So from that standpoint, if you were to look at the overall invoicing or recognized revenue, it would be less than what we would be showing in terms of the total recognized revenue drop of 12%. With that said, I can't give you a whole lot of color in terms of what to expect as we go forward here. We did have higher-than-expected declines in 2009. We did see that diminish a bit here in the first quarter.

The trick will be as Microsoft goes through its Windows refresh out into the marketplace, is either applications over there that were written in Java that we can get on to a Linux platform in a less expensive manner than it would cost to run on a Windows environment. And that's where the opportunity is for us. They're obviously trying to attack the UNIX to Linux conversions and trying to get over as much of that footprint as they can. In terms of inside the shop, which was kind of your other part of your question, when you look underneath it, almost all the customers I've spoken to personally have both footprints in their shop and anticipate having both a .net framework in their shop, as well as a Java-based framework in their shop, therefore having multiple platforms. And that is strategically part of our bet in the market is that the customer will have multiple platforms. They'll have multiple hypervisors as well, as another dimension of this conversation of an operating platform, because you have the two core stacks of Linux and Windows, but then you'll also have multiple hypervisors into the marketplace. So obviously, ESX from VMware in Hyper-V from Microsoft but the additions of Zen from the Open Source community, KBM, et cetera, are going to be critical as part of that thought process. So I think both camps existed most customers. I don't see one particular group winning or losing at a noticeable rate. They tend to stay in each side of the fence, so to speak, if that helps answer your question."

Three, the thought processes links back to the overall company direction. If you're going to try to optimize the financials for the company inside of that business, you got a lot of lines of code to support on a specialized operating system, which is what NetWare is. It's a ton of lines of codes inside of that. And the key for us was to get that migrated over to between generalized operating system, which is SUSE Linux. So underneath OES, that's really what is critical from my point of view. Also additionally, as you listen with the customers, they're looking for additional flexibility from that specialized operating system. And as you know, as these lifecycles go, the amount of training and skills that are in the market shrinks. And you're managing a very large code base at that point. So that's the trade-off and the juggling act that we approach that with. And it is a fine line of balancing that. But we also saw the opportunity to then bring the customers over and give more flexibility with OES was really the key and bring forward some of those features, while trying to optimize that financial stream, optimize the customers and really keep those customers with us. We don't want them to leave, obviously. And we obviously want to maintain those revenue relationships as long as we can. So that's why the extended support addresses one group. And then the group that's ready to move to a new operating platform, we think we have to attack that group equally as aggressive. Or else, we are going to lose them to Windows or to another platform. So from our perspective, you're definitely a novice on it, and you have to give the customer choices. And we've given them two choices in our mind: One where they can migrate to a new environment that provides longer-term flexibility; and then two, they can get the extended support. The issue is going to be as we add new features. And where we take that product is really the challenge, given that older code base. And you're talking millions and millions of lines of code are inside of there. So you have to juggle that expense and deal with that as part of what we're dealing with in managing that situation."

We understand where we stand with sales and marketing, especially as it relates to software licenses. We do have to factor in that none of the Linux business is included in the software license category and that, that at least has to be considered. And even with that, we would say that we have been higher than industry standards even if you consider that. However, that has been an area of specific focus where we have been moving to a more indirect model as a way to optimize our expense structure. And so, we continue to work on that.

We are here this afternoon to discuss Novell's financial results for the second fiscal quarter 2010. If you don't yet have our press release, you can access it by visiting our Investor Relations webpage at www.novell.com/company/ir. This call is also being broadcast through our website and will be archived on our website for a minimum of 12 months.
Before I turn the call over to Dana, I would like to take a moment to say that we will be providing non-GAAP financial measure during today's call. We believe that these measures enhance an overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future and enable investors to evaluate our performance in the same way that management does. Management uses these same non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, allocate resources and determine compensation. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results, but they eliminate expenses and gains that are excluded from most analysts' consensus estimates that are unusual and/or that arise outside of the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, those related to stock-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, restructuring, asset impairments, litigation judgments and settlements, strategic alternatives review and the sale of business operations, long-term investments and property, plant and equipment. We have included reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. As I mentioned, a copy of that release is on our website.
During our prepared remarks, we will mention some non-GAAP measures. The corresponding GAAP measures are: Q2 2010 GAAP net income of $20 million, GAAP EPS of $0.06 and fiscal 2010 GAAP tax rate guidance of 33% to 36%. We may also provide projections to non-GAAP financial measures such as projected non-GAAP operating margin and so forth. The corresponding forward-looking GAAP financial measures are not available and cannot be provided without undue effort because we are unable to accurately forecast information regarding expenses or gains such as, but not limited to, those previously described. We believe that the corresponding GAAP financial measure is not likely to be significant to an understanding of our business because there is likely to be substantial variability between projected and actual realization of expenses and gains described above and/or that such expenses or gains are likely to arise outside of the ordinary course of business.

Finally, please note that during today's call, we may make forward-looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, which are based on current management expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2009, and in the press release we issued earlier today.

Novell's second fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $204 million. GAAP income from operations was $20 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $30 million, and non-GAAP inc",585,"Well, thanks, Rob. Novell's second fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $204 million. GAAP income from operations was $20 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $30 million, and non-GAAP income was $24 million or $0.07 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by $2 million and negatively impacted operating expenses by $6 million and the income from operations by $4 million on a year-over-year basis.
Overall results this quarter were in line with expectations, and non-GAAP operating margins were at the high end of our guidance. Despite recent events, which we believe had a negative impact on our business, especially in Identity and Security, we remain optimistic about our future. We feel good about the progress we've made in our Linux business and confident that our Identity and Security Management prospects remain favorable.
Now I'll highlight some of our business unit results on Pages 9 and 10 of our press release.
Our Security, Management and Operating Platforms product revenue was $109 million, which was flat year-over-year. Invoicing was down 3% year-over-year. Within this business unit, Linux Platform Products revenue in the quarter was $35 million, decreasing 4% from the year-ago quarter. Linux invoicing was down 1% year-over-year.
As expected, the depletion of the original Microsoft certificates last year makes for challenging year-over-year comparisons. Excluding Microsoft, invoicing growth was quite strong, up 46%. We continue to cite sizable deals with large enterprise customers, and we're pleased with the growth of our core business.
Moving on to Identity, Access and Compliance Management. Product revenue was $30 million, up 9%, and invoicing decreased 12%. As I stated earlier, the recent uncertainty has had a negative impact on our business, especially in Identity, where we believe our results would've been better otherwise. We observed this through several loss and split deals. We've also seen a reduction in contract length, which we believe is due to market uncertainty. If we were to normalize for contract length, invoicing would've been up 14% year-over-year. We remain encouraged by the growth opportunities in this market.
System and Resource Management product revenue was $40 million, consistent with a year ago. We saw strength in our new business due to increased traction of our endpoint solutions, which drove positive new invoicing growth, reversing recent trends.
Turning to our Collaboration Solutions business unit, product revenue was $72 million, down 9%. Within Collaboration, the combined OES and network-related product revenue was $42 million, down 7%. Invoicing declined rates have moderated to high single digits. We expect rates to remain within this range.
Operating expenses were down compared to a year ago primarily due to reduced product development expenses. G&A costs were higher primarily due to increased legal costs associated with our successful spill litigation. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 3,500, consistent with the prior quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and short-term investments were $980 million compared to $991 million last quarter. Cash flow from operations was negative $7 million for the quarter, improved from a year ago primarily due to improved core Linux invoicing this quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $205 million and $210 million and non-GAAP operating margins to be similar to Q2 levels, assuming consistent FX rates. We now expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 28% compared to our prior guidance of 24%.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron."

Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to remind you of the company's position concerning the unsolicited conditional proposal we received from Elliott Associates to purchase Novell. As you know, on March 20, we issued a press release in which our Board of Directors announced its rejection of the unsolicited conditional proposal. We stated in that press release we do not intend to disclose developments with respect to any of these alternatives unless and until our board has approved a specific course of action. Accordingly, we will not be answering any questions regarding the matter during this call, and I ask for your cooperation in this regard.
Last quarter, I reviewed our strategy to lead in the emerging Intelligent Workload Management market and how our current portfolio end product roadmap uniquely positions us in this market. I'm pleased to report that we continue to make progress in developing solutions that build, secure, manage and measure intelligent workloads. We have a healthy pipeline, and we have recently announced new partnerships with several service providers. We believe this progress validates the promise of our Intelligent Workload Management strategy and our strength as a company.
In the area of building workloads, initial feedback on the SUSE Appliance Program has been very positive. Since its launch, over 65,000 users have built over 311,000 appliances using the SUSE Studio Online tool. In fact, one appliance, Google for Chrome, has been downloaded over 1 million times.
Large players like IBM and Ingres have also embraced SUSE Studio. IBM has already created SUSE Linux-based appliances in several areas, including Lotus IBM Foundations, IBM Lotus Protector for Mail Security and IBM WebSphere Application Server Hypervisor Edition. We are encouraged by the rapid adoption of this new technology.
In the area of securing workloads, we're on track to ship Novell Identity Manager 4 this quarter. IBM 4 adds significant functionality to Novell's flagship Identity Management product, making it possible to securely manage identities and access across physical, virtual and cloud environments.
Early reaction to the beta program for IBM 4 has been extremely enthusiastic. This quarter, we're also planning to release the beta version of Novell Cloud Manager, which help enterprises leverage a private cloud using their existing IT assets to better manage their workloads.
While many companies are releasing cloud construction tools, Novell Cloud Manager is unique and that we work with all the major hypervisors and all of the major hardware platforms. With Novell Cloud Manager, customers run their data centers as if it were a private cloud without expensive retooling.
Both Novell Cloud Manager and Novell Identity Manager 4 were previewed at our recent BrainShare user events in Salt Lake City and Amsterdam, where they received very positive reviews from customers and industry analysts.
We continue to build our partner ecosystem to compliment our solutions and expand our distribution channels around Intelligent Workload Management. We recently announced several relationships with the leading service providers.
Last month, we partnered with Verizon Business to offer cloud-based security solutions. The identity as a service offering, called Secure Access Services from Verizon, will be powered by Novell technology. And we will provide Verizon Business's customers with security required to run cloud-based applications. Security is the number one cloud concern for IT professionals, and this new service addresses that concern with a cost-effective, scalable solution.
Just a week ago, we announced a partnership with Vodacom Business, in which they have agreed to provide infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service solutions using many of our Intelligent Workload Management technologies, including SUSE Linux Enterprise, PlateSpin Virtualization and Workload Management and our Identity and Security products. Novell technology will power Vodacom's cloud hosting solutions.
The partnership is aimed at helping businesses securely provision, manage and monitor multi-tenant applications deployed in Vodacom's business cloud infrastructure. These service provider agreements are another example of how Novell is executing on our strategy to become the leader in Intelligent Workload Management marketplace.
Now turning to some other events during the quarter. We had an important legal victory determining the ownership of UNIX copyrights. The Salt Lake City federal jury's decision confirmed Novell's ownership of the UNIX copyrights, which still had asserted it owned in connection with its assault on many users of Linux. Novell has demonstrated its commitment to promote Linux, including defending Linux intellectual property.
Moving on to some comments around our business. Within our Security, Management and Operating Platforms business unit, our Linux product line continues to gain traction with partners, and we continue to enjoy the confidence of large enterprise customers.
Within our Systems and Resource Management product line, our Endpoint Management partners are building momentum, leveraging the strong adoption of Windows 7. During the quarter, we released ZENworks 10.3, which provides the tools to migrate the risks that come with large-scale Windows 7 migrations.
Our Identity and Security Management product line invoicing is up 7% in the first half of the year, and we remain confident in the solid full year performance.
Gartner recently positioned Novell Security Management products in the leader's quadrant, validating our leadership in the security market. Novell is now linked in the leader's quadrant and all of the Identity and Security Management products that are covered by Gartner, which distinguishes us from our competition. The strength of our portfolio, coupled with the uncertainty of the competitive landscape, enabled us to recruit four regional key Sun Identity partners.
Within our Collaboration business, declined rates had moderated, and we expect longer-term declined rates to be similar. At BrainShare, we previewed Novell Pulse, the first realtime collaboration platform for the enterprise. Novell Pulse is designed to deliver a collaboration environment that works the way people want to work, drawing on the best of instant messaging, document sharing, social connections and realtime co-editing in a secure and compliant manner. Through redefining the next generation of Collaboration, we believe Novell Pulse has the potential to revolutionize realtime business Collaboration.
Our second quarter results were in line with expectations. Our product portfolio continues to strengthen, and our IWM [Intelligent Workload Management] strategy has been well received. These strengths have allowed us to sign significant new partnerships, which extend our value and distribution capabilities. We remain focused on topline growth while managing our expenses.
With that said, I would like to turn the call over to the operator. Would you please open up the call for questions? Thank you."

The recent developments, I think, affect customers in a couple of different ways. Those conversations really get magnified when a customer is making a platform decision over a long period of time, where we know those technologies sitting there for seven, 10, 12 years. And as you know, that platform around Identity is exactly that type of environment when you install that as a customer. So that is obviously going to have an opportunity for pause to occur inside the customer environment. So from that perspective, we did see those pauses. I personally participated in calls with customers, where we actually saw a deal slip because of that reservation that they do have. So factually, I could tell you firsthand experiencing some of that. In terms of the Linux business and the Identity business, the part that we can't judge is where we're not being invited into particular deals and where we don't see that. So the ones that we've seen our pipeline were managing appropriately. And as I shared with you, I'm participating in some of those calls just because we want to make sure that we try to lay all the customer concerns as best we can.  The part that I can't measure that would've been additive to the performance would be the ones that we didn't see, that didn't flow through the business, that we were unfamiliar with, that didn't show up on our radar. So from that perspective, I don't have a mathematical point of view on that particular one. So that's kind of the range of the customer reaction. I'll let Dana comment a little bit on the annual versus multi-year."

So maybe if I could elaborate just a little bit and to reiterate what we said earlier, the original certificates that we sold to Microsoft in 2007 were at a 45% discount from Linux. Today's pricing as we know is closer to 85% discount for large enterprise customers. And to put that in perspective, if all the original certificates sold to Microsoft were renewed at today's price, the total value instead of $240 million would be $65 million. So accounting for that difference, we were quite happy with the overall value of renewals we received in the quarter. And to clarify and emphasize what I said in my prepared remarks, in the first half of the year, we were up over 20% on an invoicing basis without any adjustment. If we normalize for the pricing difference in Microsoft certificates, we were up over 40%, actually closer to 46%. And if we actually excluded all Microsoft activity from all periods, we were up over 57%, well, close to 57%. So we've seen tremendous growth in the Open Source products during the first half of the year, and this has been very exciting. The growth here has occurred despite recent events, and we expect our long-term growth to continue at a very robust pace. However, just to make sure that everyone -- that we're clear on this, we are subject to swings due to the proportion of our business is dependent on large deals, and we'll continue to see swings on a quarterly basis. But as we look over the longer term for the entire fiscal year and future years, we expect growth rates to be at or above market growth rates."

So I actually see the right indicators inside the pipeline that we'd align with recovery. Obviously, geographic differences exist. So you've got the pressure in Europe as we all know, and AP continues to show good, generally good direction. And the Americas showed some level of recovery the last few week. Last week aside, we have seen some of that recovery in the Americas.

I'm Rob Kain, Vice President of Investor Relations for Novell. And with me today from our executive offices in Waltham, Massachusetts are Ron Hovsepian, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dana Russell, our Chief Financial Officer.
We are here this afternoon to discuss Novell's financial results for the second fiscal quarter 2010. If you don't yet have our press release, you can access it by visiting our Investor Relations webpage at www.novell.com/company/ir. This call is also being broadcast through our website and will be archived on our website for a minimum of 12 months.
Before I turn the call over to Dana, I would like to take a moment to say that we will be providing non-GAAP financial measure during today's call. We believe that these measures enhance an overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future and enable investors to evaluate our performance in the same way that management does. Management uses these same non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, allocate resources and determine compensation. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results, but they eliminate expenses and gains that are excluded from most analysts' consensus estimates that are unusual and/or that arise outside of the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, those related to stock-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, restructuring, asset impairments, litigation judgments and settlements, strategic alternatives review and the sale of business operations, long-term investments and property, plant and equipment. We have included reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. As I mentioned, a copy of that release is on our website.
During our prepared remarks, we will mention some non-GAAP measures. The corresponding GAAP measures are: Q2 2010 GAAP net income of $20 million, GAAP EPS of $0.06 and fiscal 2010 GAAP tax rate guidance of 33% to 36%. We may also provide projections to non-GAAP financial measures such as projected non-GAAP operating margin and so forth. The corresponding forward-looking GAAP financial measures are not available and cannot be provided without undue effort because we are unable to accurately forecast information regarding expenses or gains such as, but not limited to, those previously described. We believe that the corresponding GAAP financial measure is not likely to be significant to an understanding of our business because there is likely to be substantial variability between projected and actual realization of expenses and gains described above and/or that such expenses or gains are likely to arise outside of the ordinary course of business.
We will also provide information regarding Novell's general product direction and roadmap. It's intended for information purposes only and may not be incorporated in any contract. It is not a commitment to deliver any material, code or functionality and should not be relied upon in making purchasing decisions. The development, release and timing of any features or functionality described for Novell's products remains at the sole discretion of Novell.
Finally, please note that during today's call, we may make forward-looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, which are based on current management expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2009, and in the press release we issued earlier today.
Forward-looking statements do not reflect the occurrence of unplanned or unanticipated events and cannot take into account unforeseen circumstances. Actual results for future periods may differ from those projected. Any forward-looking information that we provide in this call represents our outlook as of today, May 27, 2010, and we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements except as may be required by the law.
With that, we are ready for our CFO, Dana Russell."

Novell's second fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $204 million. GAAP income from operations was $20 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $30 million, and non-GAAP inc",585,"Well, thanks, Rob. Novell's second fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $204 million. GAAP income from operations was $20 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $30 million, and non-GAAP income was $24 million or $0.07 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by $2 million and negatively impacted operating expenses by $6 million and the income from operations by $4 million on a year-over-year basis.
Overall results this quarter were in line with expectations, and non-GAAP operating margins were at the high end of our guidance. Despite recent events, which we believe had a negative impact on our business, especially in Identity and Security, we remain optimistic about our future. We feel good about the progress we've made in our Linux business and confident that our Identity and Security Management prospects remain favorable.
Now I'll highlight some of our business unit results on Pages 9 and 10 of our press release.
Our Security, Management and Operating Platforms product revenue was $109 million, which was flat year-over-year. Invoicing was down 3% year-over-year. Within this business unit, Linux Platform Products revenue in the quarter was $35 million, decreasing 4% from the year-ago quarter. Linux invoicing was down 1% year-over-year.
As expected, the depletion of the original Microsoft certificates last year makes for challenging year-over-year comparisons. Excluding Microsoft, invoicing growth was quite strong, up 46%. We continue to cite sizable deals with large enterprise customers, and we're pleased with the growth of our core business.
Moving on to Identity, Access and Compliance Management. Product revenue was $30 million, up 9%, and invoicing decreased 12%. As I stated earlier, the recent uncertainty has had a negative impact on our business, especially in Identity, where we believe our results would've been better otherwise. We observed this through several loss and split deals. We've also seen a reduction in contract length, which we believe is due to market uncertainty. If we were to normalize for contract length, invoicing would've been up 14% year-over-year. We remain encouraged by the growth opportunities in this market.
System and Resource Management product revenue was $40 million, consistent with a year ago. We saw strength in our new business due to increased traction of our endpoint solutions, which drove positive new invoicing growth, reversing recent trends.
Turning to our Collaboration Solutions business unit, product revenue was $72 million, down 9%. Within Collaboration, the combined OES and network-related product revenue was $42 million, down 7%. Invoicing declined rates have moderated to high single digits. We expect rates to remain within this range.
Operating expenses were down compared to a year ago primarily due to reduced product development expenses. G&A costs were higher primarily due to increased legal costs associated with our successful spill litigation. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 3,500, consistent with the prior quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and short-term investments were $980 million compared to $991 million last quarter. Cash flow from operations was negative $7 million for the quarter, improved from a year ago primarily due to improved core Linux invoicing this quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $205 million and $210 million and non-GAAP operating margins to be similar to Q2 levels, assuming consistent FX rates. We now expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 28% compared to our prior guidance of 24%.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron."

Accordingly, we will not be answering any questions regarding the matter during this call, and I ask for your cooperation in this regard.
Last quarter, I reviewed our strategy to lead in the emerging Intelligent Workload Management market and how our current portfolio and product roadmap uniquely positions us in this market.

In the area of building workloads, initial feedback on the SUSE Appliance Program has been very positive. Since its launch, over 65,000 users have built over 311,000 appliances using the SUSE Studio Online tool. In fact, one appliance, Google for Chrome, has been downloaded over 1 million times.
Large players like IBM and Ingres have also embraced SUSE Studio. IBM has already created SUSE Linux-based appliances in several areas, including Lotus IBM Foundations, IBM Lotus Protector for Mail Security and IBM WebSphere Application Server Hypervisor Edition. We are encouraged by the rapid adoption of this new technology.
In the area of securing workloads, we're on track to ship Novell Identity Manager 4 this quarter. IBM 4 adds significant functionality to Novell's flagship Identity Management product, making it possible to securely manage identities and access across physical, virtual and cloud environments.
Early reaction to the beta program for IBM 4 has been extremely enthusiastic. This quarter, we're also planning to release the beta version of Novell Cloud Manager, which help enterprises leverage a private cloud using their existing IT assets to better manage their workloads.
While many companies are releasing cloud construction tools, Novell Cloud Manager is unique and that we work with all the major hypervisors and all of the major hardware platforms. With Novell Cloud Manager, customers run their data centers as if it were a private cloud without expensive retooling.
Both Novell Cloud Manager and Novell Identity Manager 4 were previewed at our recent BrainShare user events in Salt Lake City and Amsterdam, where they received very positive reviews from customers and industry analysts.
We continue to build our partner ecosystem to compliment our solutions and expand our distribution channels around Intelligent Workload Management. We recently announced several relationships with the leading service providers.
Last month, we partnered with Verizon Business to offer cloud-based security solutions. The identity as a service offering, called Secure Access Services from Verizon, will be powered by Novell technology. And we will provide Verizon Business' customers with security required to run cloud-based applications. Security is the number one cloud concern for IT professionals, and this new service addresses that concern with a cost-effective, scalable solution.
Just a week ago, we announced a partnership with Vodacom Business, in which they have agreed to provide infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service solutions using many of our Intelligent Workload Management technologies, including SUSE Linux Enterprise, PlateSpin Virtualization and Workload Management and our Identity and Security products. Novell technology will power Vodacom's cloud hosting solutions.
The partnership is aimed at helping businesses securely provision, manage and monitor multi-tenant applications deployed in Vodacom's business cloud infrastructure. These service provider agreements are another example of how Novell is executing on our strategy to become the leader in Intelligent Workload Management marketplace.
Now turning to some other events during the quarter. We had an important legal victory determining the ownership of UNIX copyrights. The Salt Lake City federal jury's decision confirmed Novell's ownership of the UNIX copyrights, which still had asserted it owned in connection with its assault on many users of Linux. Novell has demonstrated its commitment to promote Linux, including defending Linux intellectual property.
Moving on to some comments around our business. Within our Security, Management and Operating Platforms business unit, our Linux product line continues to gain traction with partners, and we continue to enjoy the confidence of large enterprise customers.
Within our Systems and Resource Management product line, our Endpoint Management partners are building momentum, leveraging the strong adoption of Windows 7. During the quarter, we released ZENworks 10.3, which provides the tools to migrate the risks that come with large-scale Windows 7 migrations.
Our Identity and Security Management product line invoicing is up 7% in the first half of the year, and we remain confident in the solid full year performance.
Gartner recently positioned Novell Security Management products in the leader's quadrant, validating our leadership in the security market. Novell is now linked in the leader's quadrant and all of the Identity and Security Management products that are covered by Gartner, which distinguishes us from our competition. The strength of our portfolio, coupled with the uncertainty of the competitive landscape, enabled us to recruit four regional key Sun Identity partners.
Within our Collaboration business, declined rates had moderated, and we expect longer-term declined rates to be similar. At BrainShare, we previewed Novell Pulse, the first realtime collaboration platform for the enterprise. Novell Pulse is designed to deliver a collaboration environment that works the way people want to work, drawing on the best of instant messaging, document sharing, social connections and realtime co-editing in a secure and compliant manner. Through redefining the next generation of Collaboration, we believe Novell Pulse has the potential to revolutionize realtime business Collaboration.
Our second quarter results were in line with expectations. Our product portfolio continues to strengthen, and our IWM [Intelligent Workload Management] strategy has been well received. These strengths have allowed us to sign significant new partnerships, which extend our value and distribution capabilities. We remain focused on topline growth while managing our expenses.
With that said, I would like to turn the call over to the operator. Would you please open up the call for questions? Thank you."

The recent developments, I think, affect customers in a couple of different ways. Those conversations really get magnified when a customer is making a platform decision over a long period of time, where we know those technologies sitting there for seven, 10, 12 years. And as you know, that platform around Identity is exactly that type of environment when you install that as a customer. So that is obviously going to have an opportunity for pause to occur inside the customer environment. So from that perspective, we did see those pauses. I personally participated in calls with customers, where we actually saw a deal slip because of that reservation that they do have. So factually, I could tell you firsthand experiencing some of that. In terms of the Linux business and the Identity business, the part that we can't judge is where we're not being invited into particular deals and where we don't see that. So the ones that we've seen our pipeline were managing appropriately. And as I shared with you, I'm participating in some of those calls just because we want to make sure that we try to lay all the customer concerns as best we can.  The part that I can't measure that would've been additive to the performance would be the ones that we didn't see, that didn't flow through the business, that we were unfamiliar with, that didn't show up on our radar. So from that perspective, I don't have a mathematical point of view on that particular one. So that's kind of the range of the customer reaction. I'll let Dana comment a little bit on the annual versus multi-year."

So maybe if I could elaborate just a little bit and to reiterate what we said earlier, the original certificates that we sold to Microsoft in 2007 were at a 45% discount from Linux. Today's pricing as we know is closer to 85% discount for large enterprise customers. And to put that in perspective, if all the original certificates sold to Microsoft were renewed at today's price, the total value instead of $240 million would be $65 million. So accounting for that difference, we were quite happy with the overall value of renewals we received in the quarter. And to clarify and emphasize what I said in my prepared remarks, in the first half of the year, we were up over 20% on an invoicing basis without any adjustment. If we normalize for the pricing difference in Microsoft certificates, we were up over 40%, actually closer to 46%. And if we actually excluded all Microsoft activity from all periods, we were up over 57%, well, close to 57%. So we've seen tremendous growth in the Open Source products during the first half of the year, and this has been very exciting. The growth here has occurred despite recent events, and we expect our long-term growth to continue at a very robust pace. However, just to make sure that everyone -- that we're clear on this, we are subject to swings due to the proportion of our business is dependent on large deals, and we'll continue to see swings on a quarterly basis. But as we look over the longer term for the entire fiscal year and future years, we expect growth rates to be at or above market growth rates."

I'm Rob Kain, Vice President of Investor Relations for Novell. And with me today from our executive offices in Waltham, Massachusetts are Ron Hovsepian, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dana Russell, our Chief Financial Officer.
We are here this afternoon to discuss Novell's financial results for the second fiscal quarter 2010. If you don't yet have our press release, you can access it by visiting our Investor Relations webpage at www.novell.com/company/ir. This call is also being broadcast through our website and will be archived on our website for a minimum of 12 months.
Before I turn the call over to Dana, I would like to take a moment to say that we will be providing non-GAAP financial measure during today's call. We believe that these measures enhance an overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future and enable investors to evaluate our performance in the same way that management does. Management uses these same non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, allocate resources and determine compensation. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results, but they eliminate expenses and gains that are excluded from most analysts' consensus estimates that are unusual and/or that arise outside of the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, those related to stock-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, restructuring, asset impairments, litigation judgments and settlements, strategic alternatives review and the sale of business operations, long-term investments and property, plant and equipment. We have included reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. As I mentioned, a copy of that release is on our website.
During our prepared remarks, we will mention some non-GAAP measures. The corresponding GAAP measures are: Q2 2010 GAAP net income of $20 million, GAAP EPS of $0.06 and fiscal 2010 GAAP tax rate guidance of 33% to 36%. We may also provide projections to non-GAAP financial measures such as projected non-GAAP operating margin and so forth. The corresponding forward-looking GAAP financial measures are not available and cannot be provided without undue effort because we are unable to accurately forecast information regarding expenses or gains such as, but not limited to, those previously described. We believe that the corresponding GAAP financial measure is not likely to be significant to an understanding of our business because there is likely to be substantial variability between projected and actual realization of expenses and gains described above and/or that such expenses or gains are likely to arise outside of the ordinary course of business.
We will also provide information regarding Novell's general product direction and roadmap. It's intended for information purposes only and may not be incorporated in any contract. It is not a commitment to deliver any material, code or functionality and should not be relied upon in making purchasing decisions. The development, release and timing of any features or functionality described for Novell's products remains at the sole discretion of Novell.
Finally, please note that during today's call, we may make forward-looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, which are based on current management expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2009, and in the press release we issued earlier today.
Forward-looking statements do not reflect the occurrence of unplanned or unanticipated events and cannot take into account unforeseen circumstances. Actual results for future periods may differ from those projected. Any forward-looking information that we provide in this call represents our outlook as of today, May 27, 2010, and we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements except as may be required by the law.
With that, we are ready for our CFO, Dana Russell."

Novell's second fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $204 million. GAAP income from operations was $20 million.

The company reported net revenue of $204 million. GAAP income from operations was $20 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $30 million, and non-GAAP income was $24 million or $0.07 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by $2 million and negatively impacted operating expenses by $6 million and the income from operations by $4 million on a year-over-year basis.
Overall results this quarter were in line with expectations, and non-GAAP operating margins were at the high end of our guidance. Despite recent events, which we believe had a negative impact on our business, especially in Identity and Security, we remain optimistic about our future. We feel good about the progress we've made in our Linux business and confident that our Identity and Security Management prospects remain favorable.
Now I'll highlight some of our business unit results on Pages 9 and 10 of our press release.
Our Security, Management and Operating Platforms product revenue was $109 million, which was flat year-over-year. Invoicing was down 3% year-over-year. Within this business unit, Linux Platform Products revenue in the quarter was $35 million, decreasing 4% from the year-ago quarter. Linux invoicing was down 1% year-over-year.
As expected, the depletion of the original Microsoft certificates last year makes for challenging year-over-year comparisons. Excluding Microsoft, invoicing growth was quite strong, up 46%. We continue to cite sizable deals with large enterprise customers, and we're pleased with the growth of our core business.
Moving on to Identity, Access and Compliance Management. Product revenue was $30 million, up 9%, and invoicing decreased 12%. As I stated earlier, the recent uncertainty has had a negative impact on our business, especially in Identity, where we believe our results would've been better otherwise. We observed this through several loss and split deals. We've also seen a reduction in contract length, which we believe is due to market uncertainty. If we were to normalize for contract length, invoicing would've been up 14% year-over-year. We remain encouraged by the growth opportunities in this market.
System and Resource Management product revenue was $40 million, consistent with a year ago. We saw strength in our new business due to increased traction of our endpoint solutions, which drove positive new invoicing growth, reversing recent trends.
Turning to our Collaboration Solutions business unit, product revenue was $72 million, down 9%. Within Collaboration, the combined OES and network-related product revenue was $42 million, down 7%. Invoicing declined rates have moderated to high single digits. We expect rates to remain within this range.
Operating expenses were down compared to a year ago primarily due to reduced product development expenses. G&A costs were higher primarily due to increased legal costs associated with our successful spill litigation. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 3,500, consistent with the prior quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and short-term investments were $980 million compared to $991 million last quarter. Cash flow from operations was negative $7 million for the quarter, improved from a year ago primarily due to improved core Linux invoicing this quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $205 million and $210 million and non-GAAP operating margins to be similar to Q2 levels, assuming consistent FX rates. We now expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 28% compared to our prior guidance of 24%.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron."

Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to remind you of the company's position concerning the unsolicited conditional proposal we received from Elliott Associates to purchase Novell. As you know, on March 20, we issued a press release in which our Board of Directors announced its rejection of the unsolicited conditional proposal. We stated in that press release we do not intend to disclose developments with respect to any of these alternatives unless and until our board has approved a specific course of action. Accordingly, we will not be answering any questions regarding the matter during this call, and I ask for your cooperation in this regard.
Last quarter, I reviewed our strategy to lead in the emerging Intelligent Workload Management market and how our current portfolio and product roadmap uniquely positions us in this market. I'm pleased to report that we continue to make progress in developing solutions that build, secure, manage and measure intelligent workloads. We have a healthy pipeline, and we have recently announced new partnerships with several service providers. We believe this progress validates the promise of our Intelligent Workload Management strategy and our strength as a company.
In the area of building workloads, initial feedback on the SUSE Appliance Program has been very positive. Since its launch, over 65,000 users have built over 311,000 appliances using the SUSE Studio Online tool. In fact, one appliance, Google for Chrome, has been downloaded over 1 million times.
Large players like IBM and Ingres have also embraced SUSE Studio. IBM has already created SUSE Linux-based appliances in several areas, including Lotus IBM Foundations, IBM Lotus Protector for Mail Security and IBM WebSphere Application Server Hypervisor Edition. We are encouraged by the rapid adoption of this new technology.
In the area of securing workloads, we're on track to ship Novell Identity Manager 4 this quarter. IBM 4 adds significant functionality to Novell's flagship Identity Management product, making it possible to securely manage identities and access across physical, virtual and cloud environments.
Early reaction to the beta program for IBM 4 has been extremely enthusiastic. This quarter, we're also planning to release the beta version of Novell Cloud Manager, which help enterprises leverage a private cloud using their existing IT assets to better manage their workloads.
While many companies are releasing cloud construction tools, Novell Cloud Manager is unique and that we work with all the major hypervisors and all of the major hardware platforms. With Novell Cloud Manager, customers run their data centers as if it were a private cloud without expensive retooling.
Both Novell Cloud Manager and Novell Identity Manager 4 were previewed at our recent BrainShare user events in Salt Lake City and Amsterdam, where they received very positive reviews from customers and industry analysts.
We continue to build our partner ecosystem to compliment our solutions and expand our distribution channels around Intelligent Workload Management. We recently announced several relationships with the leading service providers.
Last month, we partnered with Verizon Business to offer cloud-based security solutions. The identity as a service offering, called Secure Access Services from Verizon, will be powered by Novell technology. And we will provide Verizon Business' customers with security required to run cloud-based applications. Security is the number one cloud concern for IT professionals, and this new service addresses that concern with a cost-effective, scalable solution.
Just a week ago, we announced a partnership with Vodacom Business, in which they have agreed to provide infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service solutions using many of our Intelligent Workload Management technologies, including SUSE Linux Enterprise, PlateSpin Virtualization and Workload Management and our Identity and Security products. Novell technology will power Vodacom's cloud hosting solutions.
The partnership is aimed at helping businesses securely provision, manage and monitor multi-tenant applications deployed in Vodacom's business cloud infrastructure. These service provider agreements are another example of how Novell is executing on our strategy to become the leader in Intelligent Workload Management marketplace.
Now turning to some other events during the quarter. We had an important legal victory determining the ownership of UNIX copyrights. The Salt Lake City federal jury's decision confirmed Novell's ownership of the UNIX copyrights, which still had asserted it owned in connection with its assault on many users of Linux. Novell has demonstrated its commitment to promote Linux, including defending Linux intellectual property.
Moving on to some comments around our business. Within our Security, Management and Operating Platforms business unit, our Linux product line continues to gain traction with partners, and we continue to enjoy the confidence of large enterprise customers.
Within our Systems and Resource Management product line, our Endpoint Management partners are building momentum, leveraging the strong adoption of Windows 7. During the quarter, we released ZENworks 10.3, which provides the tools to migrate the risks that come with large-scale Windows 7 migrations.
Our Identity and Security Management product line invoicing is up 7% in the first half of the year, and we remain confident in the solid full year performance.
Gartner recently positioned Novell Security Management products in the leader's quadrant, validating our leadership in the security market. Novell is now linked in the leader's quadrant and all of the Identity and Security Management products that are covered by Gartner, which distinguishes us from our competition. The strength of our portfolio, coupled with the uncertainty of the competitive landscape, enabled us to recruit four regional key Sun Identity partners.
Within our Collaboration business, declined rates had moderated, and we expect longer-term declined rates to be similar. At BrainShare, we previewed Novell Pulse, the first realtime collaboration platform for the enterprise. Novell Pulse is designed to deliver a collaboration environment that works the way people want to work, drawing on the best of instant messaging, document sharing, social connections and realtime co-editing in a secure and compliant manner. Through redefining the next generation of Collaboration, we believe Novell Pulse has the potential to revolutionize realtime business Collaboration.
Our second quarter results were in line with expectations. Our product portfolio continues to strengthen, and our IWM [Intelligent Workload Management] strategy has been well received. These strengths have allowed us to sign significant new partnerships, which extend our value and distribution capabilities. We remain focused on topline growth while managing our expenses.
With that said, I would like to turn the call over to the operator. Would you please open up the call for questions? Thank you."

The recent developments, I think, affect customers in a couple of different ways. Those conversations really get magnified when a customer is making a platform decision over a long period of time, where we know those technologies sitting there for seven, 10, 12 years. And as you know, that platform around Identity is exactly that type of environment when you install that as a customer. So that is obviously going to have an opportunity for pause to occur inside the customer environment. So from that perspective, we did see those pauses. I personally participated in calls with customers, where we actually saw a deal slip because of that reservation that they do have. So factually, I could tell you firsthand experiencing some of that. In terms of the Linux business and the Identity business, the part that we can't judge is where we're not being invited into particular deals and where we don't see that. So the ones that we've seen our pipeline were managing appropriately. And as I shared with you, I'm participating in some of those calls just because we want to make sure that we try to lay all the customer concerns as best we can.  The part that I can't measure that would've been additive to the performance would be the ones that we didn't see, that didn't flow through the business, that we were unfamiliar with, that didn't show up on our radar. So from that perspective, I don't have a mathematical point of view on that particular one. So that's kind of the range of the customer reaction. I'll let Dana comment a little bit on the annual versus multi-year."

But even if we disregarded that, and we just looked at contract life, the difference there would have had, which our deals where we renewed and things that have happened, however people wanted to do that with a shorter timeframe.

So maybe if I could elaborate just a little bit and to reiterate what we said earlier, the original certificates that we sold to Microsoft in 2007 were at a 45% discount from Linux. Today's pricing as we know is closer to 85% discount for large enterprise customers. And to put that in perspective, if all the original certificates sold to Microsoft were renewed at today's price, the total value instead of $240 million would be $65 million. So accounting for that difference, we were quite happy with the overall value of renewals we received in the quarter. And to clarify and emphasize what I said in my prepared remarks, in the first half of the year, we were up over 20% on an invoicing basis without any adjustment. If we normalize for the pricing difference in Microsoft certificates, we were up over 40%, actually closer to 46%. And if we actually excluded all Microsoft activity from all periods, we were up over 57%, well, close to 57%. So we've seen tremendous growth in the Open Source products during the first half of the year, and this has been very exciting. The growth here has occurred despite recent events, and we expect our long-term growth to continue at a very robust pace. However, just to make sure that everyone -- that we're clear on this, we are subject to swings due to the proportion of our business is dependent on large deals, and we'll continue to see swings on a quarterly basis. But as we look over the longer term for the entire fiscal year and future years, we expect growth rates to be at or above market growth rates."

I'm Rob Kain, Vice President of Investor Relations for Novell. And with me today from our executive offices in Waltham, Massachusetts are Ron Hovsepian, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dana Russell, our Chief Financial Officer.
We are here this afternoon to discuss Novell's financial results for the second fiscal quarter 2010. If you don't yet have our press release, you can access it by visiting our Investor Relations webpage at www.novell.com/company/ir. This call is also being broadcast through our website and will be archived on our website for a minimum of 12 months.
Before I turn the call over to Dana, I would like to take a moment to say that we will be providing non-GAAP financial measure during today's call. We believe that these measures enhance an overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future and enable investors to evaluate our performance in the same way that management does. Management uses these same non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, allocate resources and determine compensation. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results, but they eliminate expenses and gains that are excluded from most analysts' consensus estimates that are unusual and/or that arise outside of the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, those related to stock-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, restructuring, asset impairments, litigation judgments and settlements, strategic alternatives review and the sale of business operations, long-term investments and property, plant and equipment. We have included reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. As I mentioned, a copy of that release is on our website.
During our prepared remarks, we will mention some non-GAAP measures. The corresponding GAAP measures are: Q2 2010 GAAP net income of $20 million, GAAP EPS of $0.06 and fiscal 2010 GAAP tax rate guidance of 33% to 36%. We may also provide projections to non-GAAP financial measures such as projected non-GAAP operating margin and so forth. The corresponding forward-looking GAAP financial measures are not available and cannot be provided without undue effort because we are unable to accurately forecast information regarding expenses or gains such as, but not limited to, those previously described. We believe that the corresponding GAAP financial measure is not likely to be significant to an understanding of our business because there is likely to be substantial variability between projected and actual realization of expenses and gains described above and/or that such expenses or gains are likely to arise outside of the ordinary course of business.
We will also provide information regarding Novell's general product direction and roadmap. It's intended for information purposes only and may not be incorporated in any contract. It is not a commitment to deliver any material, code or functionality and should not be relied upon in making purchasing decisions. The development, release and timing of any features or functionality described for Novell's products remains at the sole discretion of Novell.
Finally, please note that during today's call, we may make forward-looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, which are based on current management expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2009, and in the press release we issued earlier today.
Forward-looking statements do not reflect the occurrence of unplanned or unanticipated events and cannot take into account unforeseen circumstances. Actual results for future periods may differ from those projected. Any forward-looking information that we provide in this call represents our outlook as of today, May 27, 2010, and we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements except as may be required by the law.
With that, we are ready for our CFO, Dana Russell."

Novell's second fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $204 million. GAAP income from operations was $20 million.

The company reported net revenue of $204 million. GAAP income from operations was $20 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $30 million, and non-GAAP income was $24 million or $0.07 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by $2 million and negatively impacted operating expenses by $6 million and the income from operations by $4 million on a year-over-year basis.
Overall results this quarter were in line with expectations, and non-GAAP operating margins were at the high end of our guidance. Despite recent events, which we believe had a negative impact on our business, especially in Identity and Security, we remain optimistic about our future. We feel good about the progress we've made in our Linux business and confident that our Identity and Security Management prospects remain favorable.
Now I'll highlight some of our business unit results on Pages 9 and 10 of our press release.
Our Security, Management and Operating Platforms product revenue was $109 million, which was flat year-over-year. Invoicing was down 3% year-over-year. Within this business unit, Linux Platform Products revenue in the quarter was $35 million, decreasing 4% from the year-ago quarter. Linux invoicing was down 1% year-over-year.
As expected, the depletion of the original Microsoft certificates last year makes for challenging year-over-year comparisons. Excluding Microsoft, invoicing growth was quite strong, up 46%. We continue to cite sizable deals with large enterprise customers, and we're pleased with the growth of our core business.
Moving on to Identity, Access and Compliance Management. Product revenue was $30 million, up 9%, and invoicing decreased 12%. As I stated earlier, the recent uncertainty has had a negative impact on our business, especially in Identity, where we believe our results would've been better otherwise. We observed this through several loss and split deals. We've also seen a reduction in contract length, which we believe is due to market uncertainty. If we were to normalize for contract length, invoicing would've been up 14% year-over-year. We remain encouraged by the growth opportunities in this market.
System and Resource Management product revenue was $40 million, consistent with a year ago. We saw strength in our new business due to increased traction of our endpoint solutions, which drove positive new invoicing growth, reversing recent trends.
Turning to our Collaboration Solutions business unit, product revenue was $72 million, down 9%. Within Collaboration, the combined OES and network-related product revenue was $42 million, down 7%. Invoicing declined rates have moderated to high single digits. We expect rates to remain within this range.
Operating expenses were down compared to a year ago primarily due to reduced product development expenses. G&A costs were higher primarily due to increased legal costs associated with our successful spill litigation. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 3,500, consistent with the prior quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and short-term investments were $980 million compared to $991 million last quarter. Cash flow from operations was negative $7 million for the quarter, improved from a year ago primarily due to improved core Linux invoicing this quarter.
Turning to our outlook for the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $205 million and $210 million and non-GAAP operating margins to be similar to Q2 levels, assuming consistent FX rates. We now expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 28% compared to our prior guidance of 24%.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron."

Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to remind you of the company's position concerning the unsolicited conditional proposal we received from Elliott Associates to purchase Novell. As you know, on March 20, we issued a press release in which our Board of Directors announced its rejection of the unsolicited conditional proposal. We stated in that press release we do not intend to disclose developments with respect to any of these alternatives unless and until our board has approved a specific course of action. Accordingly, we will not be answering any questions regarding the matter during this call, and I ask for your cooperation in this regard.
Last quarter, I reviewed our strategy to lead in the emerging Intelligent Workload Management market and how our current portfolio and product roadmap uniquely positions us in this market. I'm pleased to report that we continue to make progress in developing solutions that build, secure, manage and measure intelligent workloads. We have a healthy pipeline, and we have recently announced new partnerships with several service providers. We believe this progress validates the promise of our Intelligent Workload Management strategy and our strength as a company.
In the area of building workloads, initial feedback on the SUSE Appliance Program has been very positive. Since its launch, over 65,000 users have built over 311,000 appliances using the SUSE Studio Online tool. In fact, one appliance, Google for Chrome, has been downloaded over 1 million times.
Large players like IBM and Ingres have also embraced SUSE Studio. IBM has already created SUSE Linux-based appliances in several areas, including Lotus IBM Foundations, IBM Lotus Protector for Mail Security and IBM WebSphere Application Server Hypervisor Edition. We are encouraged by the rapid adoption of this new technology.
In the area of securing workloads, we're on track to ship Novell Identity Manager 4 this quarter. IBM 4 adds significant functionality to Novell's flagship Identity Management product, making it possible to securely manage identities and access across physical, virtual and cloud environments.
Early reaction to the beta program for IBM 4 has been extremely enthusiastic. This quarter, we're also planning to release the beta version of Novell Cloud Manager, which help enterprises leverage a private cloud using their existing IT assets to better manage their workloads.
While many companies are releasing cloud construction tools, Novell Cloud Manager is unique and that we work with all the major hypervisors and all of the major hardware platforms. With Novell Cloud Manager, customers run their data centers as if it were a private cloud without expensive retooling.
Both Novell Cloud Manager and Novell Identity Manager 4 were previewed at our recent BrainShare user events in Salt Lake City and Amsterdam, where they received very positive reviews from customers and industry analysts.
We continue to build our partner ecosystem to compliment our solutions and expand our distribution channels around Intelligent Workload Management. We recently announced several relationships with the leading service providers.
Last month, we partnered with Verizon Business to offer cloud-based security solutions. The identity as a service offering, called Secure Access Services from Verizon, will be powered by Novell technology. And we will provide Verizon Business' customers with security required to run cloud-based applications. Security is the number one cloud concern for IT professionals, and this new service addresses that concern with a cost-effective, scalable solution.
Just a week ago, we announced a partnership with Vodacom Business, in which they have agreed to provide infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service solutions using many of our Intelligent Workload Management technologies, including SUSE Linux Enterprise, PlateSpin Virtualization and Workload Management and our Identity and Security products. Novell technology will power Vodacom's cloud hosting solutions.
The partnership is aimed at helping businesses securely provision, manage and monitor multi-tenant applications deployed in Vodacom's business cloud infrastructure. These service provider agreements are another example of how Novell is executing on our strategy to become the leader in Intelligent Workload Management marketplace.
Now turning to some other events during the quarter. We had an important legal victory determining the ownership of UNIX copyrights. The Salt Lake City federal jury's decision confirmed Novell's ownership of the UNIX copyrights, which still had asserted it owned in connection with its assault on many users of Linux. Novell has demonstrated its commitment to promote Linux, including defending Linux intellectual property.
Moving on to some comments around our business. Within our Security, Management and Operating Platforms business unit, our Linux product line continues to gain traction with partners, and we continue to enjoy the confidence of large enterprise customers.
Within our Systems and Resource Management product line, our Endpoint Management partners are building momentum, leveraging the strong adoption of Windows 7. During the quarter, we released ZENworks 10.3, which provides the tools to migrate the risks that come with large-scale Windows 7 migrations.
Our Identity and Security Management product line invoicing is up 7% in the first half of the year, and we remain confident in the solid full year performance.
Gartner recently positioned Novell Security Management products in the leader's quadrant, validating our leadership in the security market. Novell is now linked in the leader's quadrant and all of the Identity and Security Management products that are covered by Gartner, which distinguishes us from our competition. The strength of our portfolio, coupled with the uncertainty of the competitive landscape, enabled us to recruit four regional key Sun Identity partners.
Within our Collaboration business, declined rates had moderated, and we expect longer-term declined rates to be similar. At BrainShare, we previewed Novell Pulse, the first realtime collaboration platform for the enterprise. Novell Pulse is designed to deliver a collaboration environment that works the way people want to work, drawing on the best of instant messaging, document sharing, social connections and realtime co-editing in a secure and compliant manner. Through redefining the next generation of Collaboration, we believe Novell Pulse has the potential to revolutionize realtime business Collaboration.
Our second quarter results were in line with expectations. Our product portfolio continues to strengthen, and our IWM [Intelligent Workload Management] strategy has been well received. These strengths have allowed us to sign significant new partnerships, which extend our value and distribution capabilities. We remain focused on topline growth while managing our expenses.
With that said, I would like to turn the call over to the operator. Would you please open up the call for questions? Thank you."

The recent developments, I think, affect customers in a couple of different ways. Those conversations really get magnified when a customer is making a platform decision over a long period of time, where we know those technologies sitting there for seven, 10, 12 years. And as you know, that platform around Identity is exactly that type of environment when you install that as a customer. So that is obviously going to have an opportunity for pause to occur inside the customer environment. So from that perspective, we did see those pauses. I personally participated in calls with customers, where we actually saw a deal slip because of that reservation that they do have. So factually, I could tell you firsthand experiencing some of that. In terms of the Linux business and the Identity business, the part that we can't judge is where we're not being invited into particular deals and where we don't see that. So the ones that we've seen our pipeline were managing appropriately. And as I shared with you, I'm participating in some of those calls just because we want to make sure that we try to lay all the customer concerns as best we can.  The part that I can't measure that would've been additive to the performance would be the ones that we didn't see, that didn't flow through the business, that we were unfamiliar with, that didn't show up on our radar. So from that perspective, I don't have a mathematical point of view on that particular one. So that's kind of the range of the customer reaction. I'll let Dana comment a little bit on the annual versus multi-year."

So maybe if I could elaborate just a little bit and to reiterate what we said earlier, the original certificates that we sold to Microsoft in 2007 were at a 45% discount from Linux. Today's pricing as we know is closer to 85% discount for large enterprise customers. And to put that in perspective, if all the original certificates sold to Microsoft were renewed at today's price, the total value instead of $240 million would be $65 million. So accounting for that difference, we were quite happy with the overall value of renewals we received in the quarter. And to clarify and emphasize what I said in my prepared remarks, in the first half of the year, we were up over 20% on an invoicing basis without any adjustment. If we normalize for the pricing difference in Microsoft certificates, we were up over 40%, actually closer to 46%. And if we actually excluded all Microsoft activity from all periods, we were up over 57%, well, close to 57%. So we've seen tremendous growth in the Open Source products during the first half of the year, and this has been very exciting. The growth here has occurred despite recent events, and we expect our long-term growth to continue at a very robust pace. However, just to make sure that everyone -- that we're clear on this, we are subject to swings due to the proportion of our business is dependent on large deals, and we'll continue to see swings on a quarterly basis. But as we look over the longer term for the entire fiscal year and future years, we expect growth rates to be at or above market growth rates."

I'm Rob Kain, Vice President of Investor Relations for Novell. And with me today from our executive offices in Waltham, Massachusetts are Ron Hovsepian, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dana Russell, our Chief Financial Officer.
 We are here this afternoon to discuss Novell's financial results for the second fiscal quarter 2010. If you don't yet have our press release, you can access it by visiting our Investor Relations webpage at www.novell.com/company/ir. This call is also being broadcast through our website and will be archived on our website for a minimum of 12 months.
 Before I turn the call over to Dana, I would like to take a moment to say that we will be providing non-GAAP financial measure during today's call. We believe that these measures enhance an overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future and enable investors to evaluate our performance in the same way that management does. Management uses these same non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, allocate resources and determine compensation. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results, but they eliminate expenses and gains that are excluded from most analysts' consensus estimates that are unusual and/or that arise outside of the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, those related to stock-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, restructuring, asset impairments, litigation judgments and settlements, strategic alternatives review and the sale of business operations, long-term investments and property, plant and equipment. We have included reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. As I mentioned, a copy of that release is on our website.
 During our prepared remarks, we will mention some non-GAAP measures. The corresponding GAAP measures are: Q2 2010 GAAP net income of $20 million, GAAP EPS of $0.06 and fiscal 2010 GAAP tax rate guidance of 33% to 36%. We may also provide projections to non-GAAP financial measures such as projected non-GAAP operating margin and so forth. The corresponding forward-looking GAAP financial measures are not available and cannot be provided without undue effort because we are unable to accurately forecast information regarding expenses or gains such as, but not limited to, those previously described. We believe that the corresponding GAAP financial measure is not likely to be significant to an understanding of our business because there is likely to be substantial variability between projected and actual realization of expenses and gains described above and/or that such expenses or gains are likely to arise outside of the ordinary course of business.
 We will also provide information regarding Novell's general product direction and roadmap. It's intended for information purposes only and may not be incorporated in any contract. It is not a commitment to deliver any material, code or functionality and should not be relied upon in making purchasing decisions. The development, release and timing of any features or functionality described for Novell's products remains at the sole discretion of Novell.
 Finally, please note that during today's call, we may make forward-looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, which are based on current management expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2009, and in the press release we issued earlier today.
 Forward-looking statements do not reflect the occurrence of unplanned or unanticipated events and cannot take into account unforeseen circumstances. Actual results for future periods may differ from those projected. Any forward-looking information that we provide in this call represents our outlook as of today, May 27, 2010, and we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements except as may be required by the law.
 With that, we are ready for our CFO, Dana Russell.

Novell's second fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $204 million. GAAP income from operations was $20 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $30 million, and non-GAAP in",585," Well, thanks, Rob. Novell's second fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago. The company reported net revenue of $204 million. GAAP income from operations was $20 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $30 million, and non-GAAP income was $24 million or $0.07 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by $2 million and negatively impacted operating expenses by $6 million and the income from operations by $4 million on a year-over-year basis.
 Overall results this quarter were in line with expectations, and non-GAAP operating margins were at the high end of our guidance. Despite recent events, which we believe had a negative impact on our business, especially in Identity and Security, we remain optimistic about our future. We feel good about the progress we've made in our Linux business and confident that our Identity and Security Management prospects remain favorable.
 Now I'll highlight some of our business unit results on Pages 9 and 10 of our press release.
 Our Security, Management and Operating Platforms product revenue was $109 million, which was flat year-over-year. Invoicing was down 3% year-over-year. Within this business unit, Linux Platform Products revenue in the quarter was $35 million, decreasing 4% from the year-ago quarter. Linux invoicing was down 1% year-over-year.
 As expected, the depletion of the original Microsoft certificates last year makes for challenging year-over-year comparisons. Excluding Microsoft, invoicing growth was quite strong, up 46%. We continue to cite sizable deals with large enterprise customers, and we're pleased with the growth of our core business.
 Moving on to Identity, Access and Compliance Management. Product revenue was $30 million, up 9%, and invoicing decreased 12%. As I stated earlier, the recent uncertainty has had a negative impact on our business, especially in Identity, where we believe our results would've been better otherwise. We observed this through several loss and split deals. We've also seen a reduction in contract length, which we believe is due to market uncertainty. If we were to normalize for contract length, invoicing would've been up 14% year-over-year. We remain encouraged by the growth opportunities in this market.
 System and Resource Management product revenue was $40 million, consistent with a year ago. We saw strength in our new business due to increased traction of our endpoint solutions, which drove positive new invoicing growth, reversing recent trends.
 Turning to our Collaboration Solutions business unit, product revenue was $72 million, down 9%. Within Collaboration, the combined OES and network-related product revenue was $42 million, down 7%. Invoicing declined rates have moderated to high single digits. We expect rates to remain within this range.
 Operating expenses were down compared to a year ago primarily due to reduced product development expenses. G&A costs were higher primarily due to increased legal costs associated with our successful spill litigation. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 3,500, consistent with the prior quarter.
 Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and short-term investments were $980 million compared to $991 million last quarter. Cash flow from operations was negative $7 million for the quarter, improved from a year ago primarily due to improved core Linux invoicing this quarter.
 Turning to our outlook for the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $205 million and $210 million and non-GAAP operating margins to be similar to Q2 levels, assuming consistent FX rates. We now expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 28% compared to our prior guidance of 24%.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron.

Before I review our second quarter results, I'd like to remind you of the company's position concerning the unsolicited conditional proposal we received from Elliott Associates to purchase Novell. As you know, on March 20, we issued a press release in which our Board of Directors announced its rejection of the unsolicited conditional proposal. We stated in that press release we do not intend to disclose developments with respect to any of these alternatives unless and until our board has approved a specific course of action. Accordingly, we will not be answering any questions regarding the matter during this call, and I ask for your cooperation in this regard.
 Last quarter, I reviewed our strategy to lead in the emerging Intelligent Workload Management market and how our current portfolio end product roadmap uniquely positions us in this market. I'm pleased to report that we continue to make progress in developing solutions that build, secure, manage and measure intelligent workloads. We have a healthy pipeline, and we have recently announced new partnerships with several service providers. We believe this progress validates the promise of our Intelligent Workload Management strategy and our strength as a company.
 In the area of building workloads, initial feedback on the SUSE Appliance Program has been very positive. Since its launch, over 65,000 users have built over 311,000 appliances using the SUSE Studio Online tool. In fact, one appliance, Google for Chrome, has been downloaded over 1 million times.
 Large players like IBM and Ingres have also embraced SUSE Studio. IBM has already created SUSE Linux-based appliances in several areas, including Lotus IBM Foundations, IBM Lotus Protector for Mail Security and IBM WebSphere Application Server Hypervisor Edition. We are encouraged by the rapid adoption of this new technology.
 In the area of securing workloads, we're on track to ship Novell Identity Manager 4 this quarter. IBM 4 adds significant functionality to Novell's flagship Identity Management product, making it possible to securely manage identities and access across physical, virtual and cloud environments.
 Early reaction to the beta program for IBM 4 has been extremely enthusiastic. This quarter, we're also planning to release the beta version of Novell Cloud Manager, which help enterprises leverage a private cloud using their existing IT assets to better manage their workloads.
 While many companies are releasing cloud construction tools, Novell Cloud Manager is unique and that we work with all the major hypervisors and all of the major hardware platforms. With Novell Cloud Manager, customers run their data centers as if it were a private cloud without expensive retooling.
 Both Novell Cloud Manager and Novell Identity Manager 4 were previewed at our recent BrainShare user events in Salt Lake City and Amsterdam, where they received very positive reviews from customers and industry analysts.
 We continue to build our partner ecosystem to compliment our solutions and expand our distribution channels around Intelligent Workload Management. We recently announced several relationships with the leading service providers.
 Last month, we partnered with Verizon Business to offer cloud-based security solutions. The identity as a service offering, called Secure Access Services from Verizon, will be powered by Novell technology. And we will provide Verizon Business's customers with security required to run cloud-based applications. Security is the number one cloud concern for IT professionals, and this new service addresses that concern with a cost-effective, scalable solution.
 Just a week ago, we announced a partnership with Vodacom Business, in which they have agreed to provide infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service solutions using many of our Intelligent Workload Management technologies, including SUSE Linux Enterprise, PlateSpin Virtualization and Workload Management and our Identity and Security products. Novell technology will power Vodacom's cloud hosting solutions.
 The partnership is aimed at helping businesses securely provision, manage and monitor multi-tenant applications deployed in Vodacom's business cloud infrastructure. These service provider agreements are another example of how Novell is executing on our strategy to become the leader in Intelligent Workload Management marketplace.
 Now turning to some other events during the quarter. We had an important legal victory determining the ownership of UNIX copyrights. The Salt Lake City federal jury's decision confirmed Novell's ownership of the UNIX copyrights, which still had asserted it owned in connection with its assault on many users of Linux. Novell has demonstrated its commitment to promote Linux, including defending Linux intellectual property.
 Moving on to some comments around our business. Within our Security, Management and Operating Platforms business unit, our Linux product line continues to gain traction with partners, and we continue to enjoy the confidence of large enterprise customers.
 Within our Systems and Resource Management product line, our Endpoint Management partners are building momentum, leveraging the strong adoption of Windows 7. During the quarter, we released ZENworks 10.3, which provides the tools to migrate the risks that come with large-scale Windows 7 migrations.
 Our Identity and Security Management product line invoicing is up 7% in the first half of the year, and we remain confident in the solid full year performance.
 Gartner recently positioned Novell Security Management products in the leader's quadrant, validating our leadership in the security market. Novell is now linked in the leader's quadrant and all of the Identity and Security Management products that are covered by Gartner, which distinguishes us from our competition. The strength of our portfolio, coupled with the uncertainty of the competitive landscape, enabled us to recruit four regional key Sun Identity partners.
 Within our Collaboration business, declined rates had moderated, and we expect longer-term declined rates to be similar. At BrainShare, we previewed Novell Pulse, the first realtime collaboration platform for the enterprise. Novell Pulse is designed to deliver a collaboration environment that works the way people want to work, drawing on the best of instant messaging, document sharing, social connections and realtime co-editing in a secure and compliant manner. Through redefining the next generation of Collaboration, we believe Novell Pulse has the potential to revolutionize realtime business Collaboration.
 Our second quarter results were in line with expectations. Our product portfolio continues to strengthen, and our IWM [Intelligent Workload Management] strategy has been well received. These strengths have allowed us to sign significant new partnerships, which extend our value and distribution capabilities. We remain focused on topline growth while managing our expenses.
 With that said, I would like to turn the call over to the operator. Would you please open up the call for questions? Thank you.

But can you maybe talk a little bit about why we didn't see as much of a drag on Linux invoicing? Or do you think, similarly, Linux invoicing could've been that much better? And then as you think about that, or maybe talk to that a little bit, can you talk along the dimensions of duration? So a mix of one- versus three-year subscriptions versus discounting as a result of customer apprehension and what's been going on.

The recent developments, I think, affect customers in a couple of different ways. Those conversations really get magnified when a customer is making a platform decision over a long period of time, where we know those technologies sitting there for seven, 10, 12 years. And as you know, that platform around Identity is exactly that type of environment when you install that as a customer. So that is obviously going to have an opportunity for pause to occur inside the customer environment. So from that perspective, we did see those pauses. I personally participated in calls with customers, where we actually saw a deal slip because of that reservation that they do have. So factually, I could tell you firsthand experiencing some of that. In terms of the Linux business and the Identity business, the part that we can't judge is where we're not being invited into particular deals and where we don't see that. So the ones that we've seen our pipeline were managing appropriately. And as I shared with you, I'm participating in some of those calls just because we want to make sure that we try to lay all the customer concerns as best we can.  The part that I can't measure that would've been additive to the performance would be the ones that we didn't see, that didn't flow through the business, that we were unfamiliar with, that didn't show up on our radar. So from that perspective, I don't have a mathematical point of view on that particular one. So that's kind of the range of the customer reaction. I'll let Dana comment a little bit on the annual versus multi-year.

But even if we disregarded that, and we just looked at contract life, the difference there would have had, which our deals where we renewed and things that have happened, however people wanted to do that with a shorter timeframe. And if we were to normalize that, we'd have been up irrespective of those slipped or lost deals by about 14%.

So maybe if I could elaborate just a little bit and to reiterate what we said earlier, the original certificates that we sold to Microsoft in 2007 were at a 45% discount from Linux. Today's pricing as we know is closer to 85% discount for large enterprise customers. And to put that in perspective, if all the original certificates sold to Microsoft were renewed at today's price, the total value instead of $240 million would be $65 million. So accounting for that difference, we were quite happy with the overall value of renewals we received in the quarter. And to clarify and emphasize what I said in my prepared remarks, in the first half of the year, we were up over 20% on an invoicing basis without any adjustment. If we normalize for the pricing difference in Microsoft certificates, we were up over 40%, actually closer to 46%. And if we actually excluded all Microsoft activity from all periods, we were up over 57%, well, close to 57%. So we've seen tremendous growth in the Open Source products during the first half of the year, and this has been very exciting. The growth here has occurred despite recent events, and we expect our long-term growth to continue at a very robust pace. However, just to make sure that everyone -- that we're clear on this, we are subject to swings due to the proportion of our business is dependent on large deals, and we'll continue to see swings on a quarterly basis. But as we look over the longer term for the entire fiscal year and future years, we expect growth rates to be at or above market growth rates.

I’m Rob Kain, Vice President of Investor Relations for Novell. And with me today from our executive offices in Waltham Massachusetts are Ron Hovsepian, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dana Russell, our Chief Financial Officer.
We are here this afternoon to discuss Novell’s financial results for the third fiscal quarter 2010. If you don’t yet have our press release, you can access it by visiting our Investor Relations webpage at www.novell.com/company/ir. This call is also being broadcast through our website and will be archived on our webcast for a minimum of 12 months.
But before I turn the call over to Dana, I’d like to take a moment to say that we will be providing non-GAAP financial measures during today’s call. We believe that these measures enhance our overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future and enable investors to evaluate our performance in the same way that management does.
Management uses these same non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, allocate resources, and determine compensation. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results, but they eliminate expenses and gains that are excluded from most analysts’ consensus estimates that are unusual and/or that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, such as, but not limited to those related stock-based compensation, acquisition related intangible asset amortization, restructuring asset impairments, litigation judgments and settlements, strategic alternative review and the sale of business operations, long-term investments and property plant and equipment.
We have included reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. As I mentioned, a copy of that release is on our website. During our prepared remarks we will mention some non-GAAP measures. The corresponding GAAP measures are Q3 fiscal year ‘10 GAAP net income of $16 million and GAAP earnings per share of $0.04.
We may also provide information regarding Novell’s general product direction and roadmap as intended for information purposes only and may not be incorporated into any contract. Is not a commitment to deliver any material, code or functionality and should not be relied upon in making purchasing decisions. The development, release and timing of any features or functionality described for Novell’s products remains at the sole discretion of Novell.
Finally, please note that during today’s call, we may make forward-looking statements. You should be aware that the actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, which are based on current management expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, factors described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 8, 2010 and in the press release we issued earlier today.
Forward-looking statements do not reflect the occurrence of unplanned or unanticipated events and cannot take into account unforeseen circumstances. Actual results for future periods may differ from those projected. Any forward-looking information that we provide in this call represents our outlook as of today, August 26, 2010 and we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements except as may be required by the law.
With that, we are ready for our CFO, Dana Russell.

Revenue was below expectations and non-GAAP operating margin was at the high end of our guidance.
Now, I’ll highlight some of our business unit results on pages nine and 10 of our press release. Our Security Management and Operating platforms product revenue was $108 million, down 2% year-over-year. Invoicing was down 8% year-over-year.
Linux platform products revenue in the quarter was $36 million, decreasing 7% from the year ago quarter. Linux invoicing was down 11% year-over-year.
As expected, depletion of the original Microsoft certificates this year makes for a challenging year-over-year comparison. However, this business continues to perform well even in a difficult environment, excluding Microsoft certificates, core invoicing was up 15% year-over-year and year-to-date core invoicing is up 41%.
Moving on to Identity, Access and Compliance Management, product revenue was $30 million, up 8%, while invoicing decreased 8%. Systems and Resource Management product revenue was $38 million down 4%, while invoicing declined 8%.
Turning to our Collaboration Solutions business unit, product revenue was $69 million, down 14% and invoicing was down 17%. Within Collaboration Solutions, the combined OES and NetWare related product revenue was $40 million, down 11%.
Operating expenses were down compared to the year ago period due to expense management and favorable foreign exchange rates. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 3,450, down from approximately 3,500 in the prior quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, cash and short-term investments was $143 billion, compared to $980 million last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $26 million for the quarter, down from $30 million in the year ago quarter.
As we saw this quarter, our financial performance has been disrupted by the process associated with the Novell Board of Directors ongoing review of various alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Accordingly, we are not seeing expected trends in our operating results and therefore, we will not be providing financial guidance at this time.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Ron.

As I stated in our press release today regarding our Q3 earnings, our third quarter revenue results were below our initial expectations, which we believe is principally related to customer uncertainty associated with the Novell Board of Directors ongoing review of various alternatives to enhance stockholder value as described in Novell’s March 20, 2010 press release.
As we stated in the March 20, 2010 release, we do not intend to disclose developments with respect to any of these alternatives unless and until our Board has approved a specific course of action. Accordingly, we will not be answering any questions regarding the matter during this call and I ask for your cooperation in this regard.
We continue to make progress enabling and leading the rapidly growing market for intelligent workload management. Last week, we announced WorkloadIQ, our strategy for leading in this emerging market.
Our differentiated approach which is based on our ability to integrate identity and security into IT workloads, gives customers the confidence and flexibility needed to deliver IT services to end users across physical, virtual and cloud environments. With WorkloadIQ, Novell addresses fundamental security and automation concerns by taking a unique identity centric approach to Workload Management.
When we announced our strategy to compete in the IWM market last December, we indicated we would introduce eight new IWM products in 2010. Novell has already shipped seven of these products and plans to ship five additional products before year end. These 12 products provide the foundation for WorkloadIQ.
Customer and partner support of WorkloadIQ has been strong. More than 30 new customers and major partners have already committed by purchasing one or more of our WorkloadIQ products. Some early customers include ACS Xerox, Ericsson, GE, Monsanto and Sony. Partners large and small have identified WorkloadIQ as the strategy of choice for Intelligent Workload Management.
In June, VMware announced it will include an OEM copy of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with every shipment of its vSphere product at no additional cost to the end customer. VMware and its extensive network of solution provider partners will also be able to offer customers the option to purchase technical support for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server delivered directly by VMware for a seamless support experience.
Finally, VMware also announced it is standardizing its virtual appliance program on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. This expanded relationship between VMware and Novell benefits customers by reducing the cost and complexity of deploying and maintaining an enterprise operating system with VMware solutions.
In addition to the VMware announcement, Novell has signed significant cloud partner agreements with Amazon Web Services, Atos Origin, BasisOne, [Alisa Corporation], Fujitsu and Vodacom Business, adding to the previously announced support from ECS Technology, Gen-i, IBM, Tencent and Trustmark.
Each of these cloud vendors is using various components of the WorkloadIQ architecture to help them securely manage their cloud environments and to help their customers realize Intelligent Workload Management.
Although, our third quarter revenue results were below our initial expectations, the end result was not unexpected given the uncertainty created by the process. We will continue to closely manage expenses to maintain profitability while focusing on returning to topline growth. Our confidence in our strategy with WorkloadIQ and the growth prospects of our chosen markets is strong.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to the Operator. Would you please open the call for questions? Thank you.

There’s a couple of questions you had in there. In terms of what it means to us being a preferred Linux guest environment on those hypervisors that means that we’ll be able to ship with the hottest software in the virtualization market, VMware, ship our SUSE Linux as I said with every addition of vSphere that goes out. So that gives us a very unique position to really be a guest in their environment and behave accordingly inside that market.
Additionally, as you look at it from the standardization on SUSE Linux Enterprise server with the appliance tool as well, that also will allow us to take advantage of the wide range of application vendors that we’ve built on top of and certified on top of our platform. SUSE Linux leads by a wide margin over Red Hat, the number of applications certified on its platform.
The closeness of this relationship will allow us to bring about 5300, 5400 application vendors into the combined world of pre-certification into the VMware world with our platform because it’s certified on our Linux platform. So this creates a market value proposition where the customer can get the hottest hypervisor in the market as well as creating the opportunity to bring across all those applications.
So what that translates to from a competitive perspective is it really allows our operating system to play a much bigger role inside of those VMware shops for the customer and be very collaborative and co-operative inside of that environment versus competitive.

Novell cloud security service is a product that we’re just getting out the door now and again, the launch on that particular one is coming shortly and feel good about that. And then when you go through the -- just give me one second here. The way we looked at it was that there were larger set of products that we were focused on in terms of key releases. The ones that we have coming in Q4 is the 1.0 of the cloud security service which is in the beta phase, wrapping that up.
Cloud Manager is another key product that we’re getting out the door that we’ll get. Then there are a series of other products around our network -- our Novell operations center, repackaging of some of the Xen works componentry and our Novell service desk but the major ones that we focus big launch programs around were the Identity Manager 4 was a key one, our cloud security service was a major, Novell Cloud Manager is a major and those products get a how -- I am sorry, including all the plate spin pieces as part of that plate spin, migrate protect and forge, all of those get what we call a Tier 1 launch versus a Tier 2 launch as some of those products, because the others are complementary or adjacent products.
And the ones that we’ve launched have been well received so far and the adjacent products have been well received. Cloud Manager and cloud security service this quarter are really key products for us that we’re very excited about and those betas have gone extremely well, one of the Cloud Manager products I just reviewed yesterday and there’s a multi-data center customer who has eight to 10 customers up on it right now and has another 20 in the pipe they’re bringing on so we’re very excited about where that’s going.

The relationship with Microsoft was to accomplish several objectives. One was to bring the brand back to relevance in the marketplace and to demonstrate that through a very deep interoperability relationship with a Microsoft and to create an environment where the customer -- where we could gain new customers through that interoperability relationship.
The VMware relationship is we now have a -- depending on how you count it, somewhere in the mid-20s for a market share in the Linux -- paid Linux server marketplace. So when you look at it and you look underneath it, the first relationship got us brand awareness and got us some customers and got us going again in the market.
The second relationship builds on that to allow us to take advantage of interoperability but more importantly to get a wider net of channel partners as well as key customers where we can do a better job as you are highlighting on the up-sell and the cross-sell opportunities. So from my vantage point, they really were -- really served two different points, two different goals at two different points in time in the company in the last three years.

One, you are absolutely correct, there is more virtualization of the Microsoft platforms on top of the hypervisors today. And that’s because, fundamentally, it is just more market share for them. However, those environments as they continue to get consolidated have applications on top of them that run in a Windows world and that will continue to happen. What we’re trying to do is make sure that we introduce to the customer the opportunity to run those applications in a Linux environment as well.
And as the customer gets comfortable with the hypervisor, they may choose to run it on the hypervisor, they may choose to run it as a physical OS, as a guest on the operating as a guest on the hypervisor and what this does is it gives the customer just many more choices in the marketplace. The good news is, the range of opportunity to do consolidation I think is very high and as the customer continues to migrate Linux to Linux, that’s going to continue to create growth opportunities for virtualization on just a pure Linux platform. 
And as I said before, as you go to build more virtual appliances, the operating system becomes less known. However required in the virtual appliance and when you do that, the customer really is looking at the hypervisor and to have that standardized on our OS would allow our OS to be in a lot more spots but it will just be hidden from people. So you may not know what it’s running under there in that scenario.

I'm Rob Kain, Vice President of Investor Relations for Novell. And with me today from our executive offices in Waltham, Massachusetts are Ron Hovsepian, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dana Russell, our Chief Financial Officer.
We are here this afternoon to discuss Novell's financial results for the third fiscal quarter 2010. If you don't yet have our press release, you can access it by visiting our Investor Relations webpage at www.novell.com/company/ir. This call is also being broadcast through our website and will be archived on our website for a minimum of 12 months.
Before I turn the call over to Dana, I would like to take a moment to say that we will be providing non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. We believe that these measures enhance an overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future, and enable investors to evaluate our performance in the same way that management does. 
Management uses these same non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, allocate resources and determine compensation. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results, but they eliminate expenses and gains that are excluded from most analysts' consensus estimates that are unusual, and/or that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, such as but not limited to, those related to stock-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible-asset amortization, restructuring, asset impairments, litigation judgments and settlements, strategic-alternative review, and the sale of business operations, long-term investments and property, plant and equipment. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. As I mentioned, a copy of that release is on our website.
During our prepared remarks, we will mention some non-GAAP measures. The corresponding GAAP measures are Q3 fiscal year '10, GAAP net income of $16 million and GAAP earnings per share of $0.04. We may also provide information regarding Novell's general product direction and roadmap. It is intended for information purposes only, and may not be incorporated into any contract. It is not a commitment to deliver any material, code or functionality, and should not be relied upon in making purchasing decisions. The development, release and timing of any features or functionality described for Novell's products remains at the sole discretion of Novell.
Finally, please note that during today's call, we may make forward-looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, which are based on current management expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, factors described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 8, 2010, and in the press release we issued earlier today.
Forward-looking statements do not reflect the occurrence of unplanned, or unanticipated events, and cannot take into account unforeseen circumstances. Actual results for future periods may differ from those projected. Any forward-looking information that we provide in this call represents our outlook as of today, August 26, 2010, and we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements, except as may be required by the law. With that, we are ready for our CFO, Dana Russell."

Novell's third fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago, the company reported net revenue of $199 million. GAAP income from operations was $21 million.

Novell's third fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago, the company reported net revenue of $199 million. GAAP income from operations was $21 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $30 million. Non-GAAP net income was $22 million, or $0.06 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by $1 million, operating expenses by $1 million and income from operations by $2 million on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was below expectations and non-GAAP operating margin was at the high-end of our guidance. 
Now I'll highlight some of our business unit results on Pages 9 and 10 of our press release. Our Security, Management and Operating Platform's product revenue was $108 million, down 2% year-over-year. Invoicing was down 8% year-over-year. Linux platform products revenue in the quarter was $36 million, decreasing 7% from the year-ago quarter. Linux invoicing was down 11% year-over-year.
As expected, depletion of the original Microsoft certificates this year, makes for a challenging year-over-year comparison. However, this business continues to perform well even in a difficult environment. Excluding Microsoft certificates, core invoicing was up 15% year-over-year, and year-to-date core invoicing is up 41%.
Moving on to Identity, Access and Compliance Management. Product revenue was $30 million, up 8%, while Invoicing decreased 8%. Systems and Resource Management product revenue was $38 million, down 4%, while Invoicing declined 8%.
Turning to our Collaboration Solutions business unit, product revenue was $69 million, down 14%, and Invoicing was down 17%. Within Collaboration Solutions, the combined OES and network-related product revenue was $40 million, down 11%.
Operating expenses were down compared to the year ago period, due to expense management and favorable foreign-exchange rates. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 3,450, down from approximately 3,500 in the prior quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and short-term investments was $1,043,000,000 compared to $980 million last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $26 million for the quarter, down from $30 million in the year-ago quarter.
As we saw this quarter, our financial performance has been disrupted by the process associated with the Novell Board of Directors' ongoing review of various alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Accordingly, we are not seeing expected trends in our operating results and therefore, we will not be providing financial guidance at this time.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron."

As I stated in our press release today regarding our Q3 earnings, our third quarter revenue results were below our initial expectations, which we believe is principally related to customer uncertainty, associated with the Novell Board of Directors' ongoing review of various alternatives to enhance stockholder value, as described in Novell's March 20, 2010, press release.
As we stated in the March 20, 2010 release, we do not intend to disclose developments, with respect to any of these alternatives, unless and until our board has approved a specific course of action. Accordingly, we will not be answering any questions regarding the matter during this call, and I asked for your cooperation in this regard.
We continue to make progress, enabling and leading the rapidly growing market for Intelligent Workload Management. Last week, we announced WorkloadIQ, our strategy for leading in this emerging market. Our differentiated approach, which is based on our ability to integrate identity and security into IT workloads, gives customers the confidence and flexibility needed to deliver IT services, to end-users across physical, virtual and cloud environments.
With WorkloadIQ, Novell addresses fundamental security and automation concerns, by taking a unique identity-centric approach to workload management. When we announced our strategy to compete in the IWM market last December, we indicated we would introduce eight new IWM products in 2010. Novell has already shipped seven of these products, and plans to ship five additional products before year-end.  These 12 products provide the foundation for WorkloadIQ. 
Customer and partner support of WorkloadIQ has been strong. More than 30 new customers and major partners have already committed by purchasing one or more of our WorkloadIQ products. Some early customers include ACS, Xerox, Ericsson, GE, Monsanto and Sony.
Partners, large and small, have identified WorkloadIQ as the strategy of choice for Intelligent Workload Management. In June, VMware announced it will include an OEM copy of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, with every shipment of its vSphere product, at no additional cost to the end customer. VMware and its extensive network of solution-provider partners, will also be able to offer customers the option to purchase technical support for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, delivered directly by VMware for a seamless support experience.
Finally, VMware also announced it is standardizing its virtual-appliance program on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. This expanded relationship between VMware and Novell, benefits customers by reducing the cost and complexity of deploying and maintaining an enterprise operating system with VMware solutions.
In addition to the VMware announcement, Novell has signed significant cloud partner agreements with Amazon Web Services, Atos Origin, BasisOne, Elisa Corporation, Fujitsu and Vodacom Business. Adding to the previously announced support from ECS Technology, Gen-i, IBM, Tencent and Trustmarque.
Each of these cloud vendors is using various components of the WorkloadIQ architecture, to help them securely manage their cloud environments, and to help their customers realize Intelligent Workload Management.
Although our third quarter revenue results were below our initial expectations, the end result was not unexpected, given the uncertainty created by the process. We will continue to closely manage expenses to maintain profitability, while focusing on returning to top-line growth. Our confidence in our strategy with WorkloadIQ and the growth prospects of our chosen markets is strong.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to the operator. Would you please open the call for questions? Thank you."

In terms of what it means to us being a preferred Linux guest environment on those hypervisors, that means that we'll be able to ship with the hottest software in the virtualization market, VMware, ship our SUSE Linux, as I said, with every addition of vSphere that goes out. So that gives us a very unique position to really be a guest in their environment and behave accordingly inside that market. Additionally, as you look at it from a standardization of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with the appliance tool as well, that also will allow us to take advantage of the wide range of application vendors that we've built on top of, and certified on top of our platform. SUSE Linux leads by a wide margin over Red Hat, the number of applications certified on its platform. The closeness of this relationship will allow us to bring about 5,300, 5,400 application vendors into the combined world of pre-certification into the VMware world with our platform, because it's certified on our Linux Platform. So this creates a market value proposition where the customer can get the hottest hypervisor in the market, as well as creating the opportunity to bring across all those applications. So what that translates to from a competitive perspective, is it really allows our operating system to play a much bigger role inside of those VMware shops for the customer, and be very collaborative and cooperative inside of that environment versus competitive."

And then when you go through the -- the way we look at it was that there were a larger set of products that we were focused on in terms of key releases. The ones that we have coming in Q4 is the 1.0 of the Cloud Security Service, which is in the beta phase, wrapping that up. Cloud Manager is another key product that we're getting out the door that we'll get it. Then there are a series of other products around our Novell Operations Center, repackaging of some of the ZENworks componentry and our Novell Service Desk. But the major ones that we focused big launch programs around were the Identity Manager 4, was a key one; our Cloud Security Service was a major; Novell Cloud Manager is a major. And those products, including all the PlateSpin pieces is part of that PlateSpin Migrate, Protect and Forge. All of those get what we call a Tier 1 launch bonds versus a Tier 2 launch as some of those products because, yes, those are complementary or adjacent products. And the ones that we've launched have been well received so far, and the adjacent products have been well received. Cloud Manager and Cloud Security Service this quarter are really key products for us that we're very excited about, and those betas have gone extremely well.

The relationship with Microsoft was to accomplish several objectives. One was to bring the brand back to relevance in the marketplace, and to demonstrate that through a very deep interoperability relationship with Microsoft and to create an environment where we could gain new customers through that interoperability relationship. The VMware relationship is -- we now have, depending upon how you count it somewhere in the mid-20s from a market share in the Linux, paid Linux Server marketplace. So when you look at it and you look underneath it, the first relationship got us brand awareness and got us some customers and got us going again in the market. This second relationship builds on that to allow us to take advantage of interoperability but more importantly, to get a wider net of channel partners as well as key customers, where we can do a better job, as you are highlighting, on the upsell and the cross-sell opportunities.

There is more virtualization of the Microsoft platforms on top of the hypervisors today, and that's because fundamentally, there's just more market share for them. However, those environments, as they continue to get consolidated, have applications on top of them that run in a Windows world, and that will continue to happen. What we're trying to do is make sure that we introduce to the customer the opportunity to run those applications in a Linux environment as well. And as the customer gets comfortable with the hypervisor, they may choose to run it on the hypervisor, they may choose to run on the physical OS as a guest on the operating, as a guest on the hypervisor. And what this does is it gives the customer just many more choices in the marketplace. The good news is the range of opportunity to do consolidation, I think, is very high. And as the customer continues to migrate UNIX to Linux, that's going to continue to create growth opportunities for virtualization on just a pure Linux Platform. And as I said before, as you go to build more virtual appliances, the operating system becomes less known however required in the virtual appliance. And when you do that, the customer, really, is looking at the hypervisor. And to have that standardized on our OS would allow our OS to be in a lot more spots, but it will just be hidden from people. So you may not know what it's running under there in that scenario."

I'm Rob Kain, Vice President of Investor Relations for Novell. And with me today from our executive offices in Waltham, Massachusetts are Ron Hovsepian, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dana Russell, our Chief Financial Officer.
We are here this afternoon to discuss Novell's financial results for the third fiscal quarter 2010. If you don't yet have our press release, you can access it by visiting our Investor Relations webpage at www.novell.com/company/ir. This call is also being broadcast through our website and will be archived on our website for a minimum of 12 months.
Before I turn the call over to Dana, I would like to take a moment to say that we will be providing non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. We believe that these measures enhance an overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future, and enable investors to evaluate our performance in the same way that management does. 
Management uses these same non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, allocate resources and determine compensation. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results, but they eliminate expenses and gains that are excluded from most analysts' consensus estimates that are unusual, and/or that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, such as but not limited to, those related to stock-based compensation, acquisition-related intangible-asset amortization, restructuring, asset impairments, litigation judgments and settlements, strategic-alternative review, and the sale of business operations, long-term investments and property, plant and equipment. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. As I mentioned, a copy of that release is on our website.
During our prepared remarks, we will mention some non-GAAP measures. The corresponding GAAP measures are Q3 fiscal year '10, GAAP net income of $16 million and GAAP earnings per share of $0.04.
We may also provide information regarding Novell's general product direction and roadmap. It is intended for information purposes only, and may not be incorporated into any contract. It is not a commitment to deliver any material, code or functionality, and should not be relied upon in making purchasing decisions. The development, release and timing of any features or functionality described for Novell's products remains at the sole discretion of Novell.
Finally, please note that during today's call, we may make forward-looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, which are based on current management expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, factors described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 8, 2010, and in the press release we issued earlier today.
Forward-looking statements do not reflect the occurrence of unplanned, or unanticipated events, and cannot take into account unforeseen circumstances. Actual results for future periods may differ from those projected. Any forward-looking information that we provide in this call represents our outlook as of today, August 26, 2010, and we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements, except as may be required by the law. With that, we are ready for our CFO, Dana Russell."

Novell's third fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago, the company reported net revenue of $199 million. GAAP income from operations was $21 million.

Novell's third fiscal quarter 2010 results were released a short time ago, the company reported net revenue of $199 million. GAAP income from operations was $21 million. Non-GAAP income from operations was $30 million. Non-GAAP net income was $22 million, or $0.06 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue by $1 million, operating expenses by $1 million and income from operations by $2 million on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was below expectations and non-GAAP operating margin was at the high-end of our guidance. 
Now I'll highlight some of our business unit results on Pages 9 and 10 of our press release. Our Security, Management and Operating Platform's product revenue was $108 million, down 2% year-over-year. Invoicing was down 8% year-over-year. Linux platform products revenue in the quarter was $36 million, decreasing 7% from the year-ago quarter. Linux invoicing was down 11% year-over-year.
As expected, depletion of the original Microsoft certificates this year, makes for a challenging year-over-year comparison. However, this business continues to perform well even in a difficult environment. Excluding Microsoft certificates, core invoicing was up 15% year-over-year, and year-to-date core invoicing is up 41%.
Moving on to Identity, Access and Compliance Management. Product revenue was $30 million, up 8%, while Invoicing decreased 8%. Systems and Resource Management product revenue was $38 million, down 4%, while Invoicing declined 8%.
Turning to our Collaboration Solutions business unit, product revenue was $69 million, down 14%, and Invoicing was down 17%. Within Collaboration Solutions, the combined OES and network-related product revenue was $40 million, down 11%.
Operating expenses were down compared to the year ago period, due to expense management and favorable foreign-exchange rates. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 3,450, down from approximately 3,500 in the prior quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and short-term investments was $1,043,000,000 compared to $980 million last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $26 million for the quarter, down from $30 million in the year-ago quarter.
As we saw this quarter, our financial performance has been disrupted by the process associated with the Novell Board of Directors' ongoing review of various alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Accordingly, we are not seeing expected trends in our operating results and therefore, we will not be providing financial guidance at this time.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron."

As I stated in our press release today regarding our Q3 earnings, our third quarter revenue results were below our initial expectations, which we believe is principally related to customer uncertainty, associated with the Novell Board of Directors' ongoing review of various alternatives to enhance stockholder value, as described in Novell's March 20, 2010, press release.
As we stated in the March 20, 2010 release, we do not intend to disclose developments, with respect to any of these alternatives, unless and until our board has approved a specific course of action. Accordingly, we will not be answering any questions regarding the matter during this call, and I ask for your cooperation in this regard.
We continue to make progress, enabling and leading the rapidly growing market for Intelligent Workload Management. Last week, we announced WorkloadIQ, our strategy for leading in this emerging market. Our differentiated approach, which is based on our ability to integrate identity and security into IT workloads, gives customers the confidence and flexibility needed to deliver IT services, to end-users across physical, virtual and cloud environments.
With WorkloadIQ, Novell addresses fundamental security and automation concerns, by taking a unique identity-centric approach to workload management. When we announced our strategy to compete in the IWM market last December, we indicated we would introduce eight new IWM products in 2010. Novell has already shipped seven of these products, and plans to ship five additional products before year-end.  These 12 products provide the foundation for WorkloadIQ. 
Customer and partner support of WorkloadIQ has been strong. More than 30 new customers and major partners have already committed by purchasing one or more of our WorkloadIQ products. Some early customers include ACS-Xerox, Ericsson, GE, Monsanto and Sony.
Partners, large and small, have identified WorkloadIQ as the strategy of choice for Intelligent Workload Management. In June, VMware announced it will include an OEM copy of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, with every shipment of its vSphere product, at no additional cost to the end customer. VMware and its extensive network of solution-provider partners, will also be able to offer customers the option to purchase technical support for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, delivered directly by VMware for a seamless support experience.
Finally, VMware also announced it is standardizing its virtual-appliance program on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. This expanded relationship between VMware and Novell, benefits customers by reducing the cost and complexity of deploying and maintaining an enterprise operating system with VMware solutions.
In addition to the VMware announcement, Novell has signed significant cloud partner agreements with Amazon Web Services, Atos Origin, BasisOne, Elisa Corporation, Fujitsu and Vodacom Business. Adding to the previously announced support from ECS Technology, Gen-i, IBM, Tencent and Trustmarque.
Each of these cloud vendors is using various components of the WorkloadIQ architecture, to help them securely manage their cloud environments, and to help their customers realize Intelligent Workload Management.
Although our third quarter revenue results were below our initial expectations, the end result was not unexpected, given the uncertainty created by the process. We will continue to closely manage expenses to maintain profitability, while focusing on returning to top-line growth. Our confidence in our strategy with WorkloadIQ and the growth prospects of our chosen markets is strong.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to the operator. Would you please open the call for questions? Thank you."

In terms of what it means to us being a preferred Linux guest environment on those hypervisors, that means that we'll be able to ship with the hottest software in the virtualization market, VMware, ship our SUSE Linux, as I said, with every addition of vSphere that goes out. So that gives us a very unique position to really be a guest in their environment and behave accordingly inside that market. Additionally, as you look at it from the standardization of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with the appliance tool as well, that also will allow us to take advantage of the wide range of application vendors that we've built on top of, and certified on top of our platform. SUSE Linux leads by a wide margin over Red Hat, the number of applications certified on its platform. The closeness of this relationship will allow us to bring about 5,300, 5,400 application vendors into the combined world of pre-certification into the VMware world with our platform, because it's certified on our Linux Platform. So this creates a market value proposition where the customer can get the hottest hypervisor in the market, as well as creating the opportunity to bring across all those applications. So what that translates to from a competitive perspective, is it really allows our operating system to play a much bigger role inside of those VMware shops for the customer, and be very collaborative and cooperative inside of that environment versus competitive."

The ones that we have coming in Q4 is the 1.0 of the Cloud Security Service, which is in the beta phase, wrapping that up. Cloud Manager is another key product that we're getting out the door that we'll get it.

The relationship with Microsoft was to accomplish several objectives. One was to bring the brand back to relevance in the marketplace, and to demonstrate that through a very deep interoperability relationship with Microsoft and to create an environment where we could gain new customers through that interoperability relationship. The VMware relationship is we now have, depending upon how you count it somewhere in the mid-20s from a market share in the Linux, paid Linux Server marketplace. So when you look at it and you look underneath it, the first relationship got us brand awareness and got us some customers and got us going again in the market. This second relationship builds on that to allow us to take advantage of interoperability but more importantly, to get a wider net of channel partners as well as key customers, where we can do a better job, as you are highlighting, on the upsell and the cross-sell opportunities.

There is more virtualization of the Microsoft platforms on top of the hypervisors today, and that's because fundamentally, there's just more market share for them. However, those environments, as they continue to get consolidated, have applications on top of them that run in a Windows world, and that will continue to happen. What we're trying to do is make sure that we introduce to the customer the opportunity to run those applications in a Linux environment as well. And as the customer gets comfortable with the hypervisor, they may choose to run it on the hypervisor, they may choose to run on the physical OS as a guest on the operating, as a guest on the hypervisor. And what this does is it gives the customer just many more choices in the marketplace. The good news is the range of opportunity to do consolidation, I think, is very high. And as the customer continues to migrate UNIX to Linux, that's going to continue to create growth opportunities for virtualization on just a pure Linux Platform. And as I said before, as you go to build more virtual appliances, the operating system becomes less known however required in the virtual appliance. And when you do that, the customer, really, is looking at the hypervisor. And to have that standardized on our OS would allow our OS to be in a lot more spots, but it will just be hidden from people. So you may not know what it's running under there in that scenario."

So I'm curious as what is the monetization strategy for Novell specifically? I know you talked about possibly upselling and cross-selling. But on the initial sale, do you guys recognize revenue? How does that work?"

But the way we would upsell without getting into all the numbers, the way we would upsell inside of here is built into the agreement. So their partners are incented to sell the technical service, support services on our behalf, which I think is the most critical piece of it. So their sales teams are incented by quota-and-quota retirement to sell our technical support, which is where we make our money. So that's the incentive mechanism. It's very strong and very tight. So from my vantage point, that's a very good use of a partnership from our perspective in terms of getting reached in a lower cost manner."
