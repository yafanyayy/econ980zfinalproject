I'd like to start this morning on Slide 5 with a quick rundown of our overall performance for 2009. First though, I'd like to thank our employees for a great year operationally and financially under very challenging conditions",950,"Thanks, Bruce. Good morning. I'd like to start this morning on Slide 5 with a quick rundown of our overall performance for 2009. First though, I'd like to thank our employees for a great year operationally and financially under very challenging conditions. In a year like 2010, where execution across the board will be so critical to El Paso's success, it's worth looking at how we did in 2009 versus our objectives in pipeline construction and drill bit performance and in providing adequate funding for our operations. Three key determinants of our success in 2010. If the past is prologue, then 2010 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for El Paso. Jim and his team in the Pipes had another very strong year in 2009. Adjusted EBIT was up 12% over 2008. We secured a 50% partner for the $3 billion Ruby Pipeline, the largest single component of our pipeline backlog. We continue to show good execution on capital spending, putting four new projects in service on time and on budget. And we continued to make good progress on the balance of the backlog, the remainder of which remains on time and on budget.As for the E&P company, Brent and E&P team performed better than at any time in my tenure. Production came in at the high end of guidance despite spending less capital. We shaved almost $0.20 off our per unit direct lifting cost, which we believe will put us in the top quartile on this measure of efficiency, again, for 2009. Reserve replacement costs, before price revisions, came in at $1.57, down significantly from $2.87 in 2008. And this was accomplished while keeping our proved undeveloped reserves, as a percentage of total proved reserves, modest relative to our peers at 31%, giving us further confidence that these results are sustainable.Our risk unproved resource growth rose by 44% for the year. Our Haynesville area went from a standing start to an exit rate of 150 million cubic feet a day gross and 110 million a day net by year end. And this was accomplished at costs that are as good as anyone in the play.We got off to a strong start in the Eagle Ford, putting our first well on production and building an acreage position from scratch that now totals 138,000 acres and counting. We're currently completing the second well on our acreage and have made a decision to add a second rig in the Eagle Ford, likely for the balance of the year. And finally, E&P generated $600 million in cash flow after CapEx for the year, even after the purchase of the Flying J assets in Altamont at year end.With regard to balance sheet management, Mark Leland, John Hopper and more recently, J.R. and her teams did yeoman work, staying well ahead of our financing needs in 2009. We completed $3.8 billion in new financings between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2009, keeping liquidity very strong throughout the year. We ended the year at the high end of our guidance for liquidity, $1.8 billion, after funding the Altamont acquisition in December. And finally, we generated strong earnings for the quarter at $0.34 and for the year, at $1.29 on an adjusted basis, as a result of the combined contribution from Pipes and E&P, as well significant company-wide cost reductions.Now moving to 2010, we are off to a great start on the goals we laid out for you back in December at our Analyst Day. On Ruby, we received our final Environmental Impact Statement in early January. We expect to receive FERC approval this month. And we expect to begin construction in the May-June time frame, all consistent with our previous guidance. As J.R. will detail in his comments, we now have in hand financing commitments in excess of our needed $1.5 billion and at very favorable rates. And we see an increasingly positive macro for Ruby as new shales compete for eastern markets, making a western path more attractive for Rockies producers and as Canadian production continues to decline. In E&P, a strong start to the year gives us confidence to edge up our production guidance by 20 million a day from the original range of 720 million to 760 million, to the new range of 740 million to 780 million a day.With regard to the pipeline backlog, we complete another major milestone today, as we put both the third expansion of the Elba Island LNG terminal and the Elba Express pipeline in service and generating revenue. This represents over five years of effort and close to $1 billion in capital and both start service on time and on budget. And we continue to build on to the pipeline franchise. In the most recent instance, we added another Marcellus-related growth project at PGP, the Northeast Upgrade. Together with the previously-added Line 300 project, that makes $1 billion in new growth on PGP, fully subscribed with long-term contracts and in-service dates in 2011 and 2013. These big project wins validate both the skills of our commercial team and the value of having a large existing footprint in the key market and supply areas across the U.S.As we alluded to back in December, we just announced an agreement to sell our Mexican Infrastructure business for $300 million, an important component to our overall financing plan for 2010. And finally, El Paso Pipeline Partners, our MLP, completed a very successful equity sale in January, generating almost $240 million in proceeds, which I expect they'll put to work soon. With that, I'll turn the call over to J.R. and come back at the end to wrap up, and then take your questions. J.R.?"

In early December, on our Annual Analyst Meeting in New York, I outline our financing plan for 2010. And although we're only 60 days into the new year, we've already accomplished a great deal toward meeting our 201",1398,"Thanks, Doug and good morning, everyone. In early December, on our Annual Analyst Meeting in New York, I outline our financing plan for 2010. And although we're only 60 days into the new year, we've already accomplished a great deal toward meeting our 2010 funding needs. I'll update you on our progress in a minute. But first, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results. I'm starting on Slide 11 titled, 2009 Fourth Quarter Financial Results. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.34, an increase of 62% over the $0.21 per share in 2008. As we've reminded you on previous calls, our results for the quarter do not include $0.04 per share associated with the early settlement of our $110 per barrel oil hedges, which we realize in the first quarter. Our earnings would've been $0.38 per share for the quarter, if we had held the hedge positions to maturity. Actual GAAP reported earnings for the quarter was $0.36 per share. A summary of the adjustments and the reconciliation to our reported earnings per share are included in our Financial and Operational Reporting package on our website. Items impacting the fourth quarter included the international ceiling test charges, severance costs related to our recent reorganization, the impact of our E&P hedges, certain legacy matters and a tax benefit associated with the liquidation of certain foreign entities. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter, after adjusting for the tax benefit associated with the liquidation of foreign earnings, was 35%. Our results for the quarter were driven by strong performance in both the Pipes and E&P, each posting solid increases in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA. In Pipeline Group, adjusted EBIT increased 19% for the quarter driven largely by the impact of expansion projects placed in service and lower operating costs across the franchise. In E&P, lower cash costs in DD&A, together with higher-realized commodity prices, which benefited from our hedging program, led the performance improvement. We've also included for your reference in our reporting package, our adjusted pro rata EBITDA results, including our share of both Citrus and Four Star. Now turning to Slide 12. For the full year, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29, roughly in line with our 2008 performance, despite realized natural gas prices that were 7% below 2008 levels. GAAP reported earnings per share for the year was a loss of $0.83, which was significantly impacted by the first quarter ceiling test charges. I would once again refer you to our reporting package for the items impacting our full year earnings per share.In the Pipeline Group, adjusted EBIT increased 12% to $1.4 billion, supported by incremental expansion revenues and capacity sales, higher-retained fuel revenues, lower electric compression costs and lower operating costs. The team will elaborate further in a few minutes. The Pipeline Group placed four new expansion projects in service and 2009, on time and on budget. Adjusted EBITDA for the Pipes surpassed $1.8 billion for the year. In the E&P Group, lower DD&A and cash costs help to offset the impact of lower commodity prices and production volumes. Our successful hedge program contributed about $1 billion to our 2009 results. Moving on to Slide 13, cash flow from operations for the year was $2.1 billion compared to $2.4 billion for 2008, despite significantly lower commodity prices. Capital expenditures came in on target at $2.8 billion for 2009, essentially flat with 2008 spending levels. Pipeline capital of $1.7 billion was split $1.4 billion to expansions and $0.3 billion to maintenance. Major expansion projects included Ruby, Elba and Elba Express and Line 300, among others. On the E&P side, total capital end of the year around $1 billion, reflecting the pullback earlier in the year and the response to low commodity prices, coupled with then higher service costs. Despite the reduction in capital allocation, the E&P Group grew proved reserves 8%, reduced its domestic reserve replacement cost to $1.57 and delivered production volumes at the high end of our full year guidance. Importantly, we ended the year with strong liquidity, $1.8 billion. The amount was at the high end of our December guidance after spending about $100 million at the Altamont oil property acquisition at year end. Our liquidity is comprised of $1.3 billion in bank revolver capacity, about a $500 million in cash. Now, note that our total liquidity excludes about $400 million of combined cash and credit facility capacity to meet capital expansion needs at EPB and Ruby.As Doug mentioned in his opening remarks, this year is all about execution, and the Finance group is no exception. From my organization, that means delivering on the finance plan we laid out to you in December, period.Moving to Slide 14, we've made significant progress in the first 60 days. Noteworthy[ph], we're very pleased with where we are on the financing, and I'll give you an update on the next slide. On asset sales, we told you back in December that we anticipated news regarding asset sales would come earlier in the year rather than later. And last week, we announced the sale of our Mexican pipeline assets for $300 million. The vast majority of these assets are a joint venture with Pemex.Finally on the MLP front, El Paso Pipeline Partners was among the first MLP of accessing the equity markets in early January. Demand for the units was strong, the base steel is upside by nearly 10% and substantially all the green shoot was exercised. Total net proceeds from the offering was nearly $240 million. With the proceeds in hand, I would expect the partnership to put the money to work in the near future.Turning to Slide 15, as Doug previously indicated we've received executed commitment letters from a diverse group of financial institutions totaling over $1.5 billion to provide project financing for the Ruby Pipeline project. The commitment letters are subject to various customary conditions precedent and execution of definitive long agreements. We're in the process of negotiating these agreements, so we won't be providing much detail on the specifics of the transaction. However, the terms for the facility are expected to be typical for project financing of this nature. One detail I will share is the facility will be structured as a seven-year traditional bank project financing. Based on current market conditions and assuming required hedging, we would anticipate an initial interest rate of less than 7%. As I said in December, Ruby is the preeminent project financing transaction on the market this year, and has attracted the top-tier project financed banks from around the globe. Although we still have additional works to close with financing prior to the start of construction, we believe receipt of the commitments is an important milestone in the project and reflects strong interest in our project from the financial community. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in the support of our group of banks in helping to bring the financing closer to the goal line.  Before I turn the call over to Jim Yardley, I want to remind you of the considerable commodity price protection we have in place for our 2010 and 2011 natural gas and oil production. On Slide 16, you see these hedge positions are designed to provide us greater cash flow certainty as we complete the backlog pipeline expansion projects in 2010 and '11. We have $6.41 in floors under roughly 80% of our domestic natural gas production for the full year 2010, with the positions weighted for the first three quarters, and nearly fully hedged through the third quarter and about a 30% hedged in the fourth quarter. In 2011, about 60% of our domestic gas production is hedged with a floor price of $6. With oil, we've had substantially all of our production in 2010 with a floor price of $76, and about 25% of our estimated 2011 production with an $80 floor. We've included our customary detailed schedule of all our hedge positions in the reporting package. That's my update for you this morning. Both our business has performed well in 2009 and have carried forward that performance level into 2010. We've made excellent progress on our financing plan, and I look forward to sharing further updates with you in the near future.With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the Pipeline Group."

EBITDA for the Pipeline Group adjusted for a proportion of interest in Citrus is now $2 billion. And we'll continue to see earnings growth as we execute our backlog of growth projects. We placed four more in service in 2009, on time and essentially, on budget. And as Doug said, today, we placed two big ones in service. The expansion of our Elba Island terminal and its associated Elba Express pipeline, also on time and budget. Ruby continues to meet milestones towards the startup of construction in late spring. And finally, we added a significant new project through our commitment backlog, we secured commercial arrangements with shippers to move forward with a major expansion out of the Marcellus.Now let me digress here to say that while this slide actually accurately summarizes our financial and growth achievements for 2009, it doesn't do justice to our solid blocking and tackling operating performance. We successfully served our customers 24/7. We settled a major rate case. Our multi-year pipeline integrity program is now nearly 90% complete. And we made major steps to do all this work more efficiently, as evidenced by our financial results. So my hats off to our pipeline workforce in the office and in our field locations across the country.On Slide 19, a throughput summary. For the first year in many, our throughput decreased by 3%. This is generally a result of the economic slowdown. Remember the throughput has only a minor impact on our financials because of demand charge and nature of our business. Throughput on EPNG decreased due to the economy in Arizona and Southern California, as well as the startup of a competitor service lateral into the Phoenix area. Also, our pipes are impacted both by lower industrial demand, particularly in the Southeast, and the mild summer in the Northeast on PGP. Increasing power gen demand in the Southeast, including some displacement of coal loads, somewhat offset these declines, as its supply-related throughput, especially in the Rockies, were recapitalize on our various recent expansions.Slides 20 and 21 review our Elba and Elba Express Projects. Both projects entered service today and are now generating revenue. At the terminal, the expansion of the vaporization center [ph] capacity is in service and the new tank capacity will go in service this summer as planned. These two projects were conceived more than five years ago, so we're celebrating today a major achievement and the culmination of a huge effort by our employees, contractors and suppliers, customers and regulators. And they're going in service on time and on budget. These are very attractive projects for us. Together, they represent a capital investment of approximately $900 million. They will generate solid regulated-like returns. They're supported by very long-term contracts for 100% of the expansion capacity. The contracts are at Shell, clearly a high-quality customer. And as you know, our revenue stream is demand charge-based so that our profitability is not sensitive to how much or how often the capacity is used.Both the Elba expansion and Elba Express are examples of excellent project execution. Elba Express on Slide 21 is a major new pipeline from the Elba terminal to an interconnect with the Transco mainline, which, of course, is a significant supplier to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. This was a very large construction project, large diameter pipe, nearly 200 miles long, much of it greenfield; two major directional drills, one, a half-mile long through solid rock; a vary topography along the pipeline route, significant wetlands, rolling hills, rocky terrain at the northern end; and constructed through very wet, rainy, muddy conditions in the Southeast during the late summer, late fall and winter. So the takeaway here is that we executed very well: On time, on budget.Slide 22 provides an update on our Ruby Pipeline project. It remains on schedule and on budget. We received the final EIS in early January. The EIS provides more certainty about environmental mitigation, construction conditions and the pipeline route, all subject to FERC approval. We expect that approval this month, with BLM right-of-way grant expected in April.We then plan to start construction in May/June. Over 85% of the right-of-way on the privately-owned land has already been acquired. As you know, we'll be utilizing seven different construction spreads from four experienced contractors. For each spread, we've devoted a lot of time to the construction planning, together with the contractors. At the peak of construction this summer, we'll have approximately 4,300 people working on the job.Also over half of the pipe has now been produced and continues to move west in unit trains. Pipe production is on schedule. So we're executing. And 2010 is obviously an active year for the Ruby project.Finally in the Northeast, as you know, TGP has a $1 billion expansion program to move Appalachian and Marcellus gas to markets. The Line 300 expansion will go in service in late 2011 for equitable. And the Northeast upgrade project, that we just announced with Chesapeake and Statoil, will go in service late 2013. On the Line 300 expansion, we just received an important permit from the New Jersey DEP. Also, FERC has issued its environmental assessment on the project and we expect FERC approval in April. Both these projects are fully subscribed under long-term contracts and provide solid regulated returns.In addition to these 2 forward-haul projects, we secured firm transportation backhaul business with Marcellus producers, who will provide an additional $50 million of annual revenue by 2012. So we're right in the middle of the activity in Marcellus. It's providing us with significant and profitable growth.So in summary on the Pipes, we executed well in 2009. In 2010, we're executing again and will be another busy year for us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brent."
1038355,85175826,51994,"El Paso Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2010",2010-03-01,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 25 this morning, which lists some of our 2009 highlights, all of which are relevant to our 2010 plan. Due to a strong fourth quarter, we ended the year with a lot of positive momentum. Our full y",1639,"Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 25 this morning, which lists some of our 2009 highlights, all of which are relevant to our 2010 plan. Due to a strong fourth quarter, we ended the year with a lot of positive momentum. Our full year production volumes, when we include our interest in Four Star, averaged $763 million a day, which is at the high end of our full year production guidance. Our domestic direct lifting cost, which were already among the lowest in industry, got even lower. We shaved $0.19 off of our 2008 results, coming in at about $0.70 per Mcfe. I noted in our last call, we got some benefit from deflation, but a lot of our progress is due to the efforts of our production operations teams. For sometime now, we've talked about the work we've done to improve our portfolio, at shifting to more onshore, more unconventional and more predictable opportunities. And those shifts are visible in our improved domestic reserve replacement costs of $1.57. And our unproved resources grew significantly as well. We had a 44% increase in risk resources that came mostly from the Haynesville and Eagle Ford shales. We also believe that we've got good opportunities in the hopper to grow the 5.1 Tcf of unproved resources going forward. And finally, we advanced several of our key programs. As Doug noted, the Haynesville was a fairly minor contributor as we began 2009, and now generates more production than any other single asset, currently close to 15% of our total net production. During 2009, we went from one rig to five rigs with excellent drilling and completion performance throughout the year. Now it's still early days for the Eagle Ford, but it's moving quickly, thanks to our Haynesville experience. And I'll give you an update on that program in a few minutes. We're pleased with the results of our Altamont oil program. And we closed it very nice, bolt-on acquisition in the field, right at the end of the year. And we ramped up to three rigs in that development. And we continue to advance international programs. We established first production from our Camarupim project in Brazil. And we drove one additional well in our South Alemain block in Egypt, which has been temporarily abandoned while we evaluate the drilling and the oiling [ph] results.Turning to Slide 26, we show you the full year production numbers as well as the monthly production profile during 2009. The graph on the right also shows our drilling rig level at the end of each month. Production declined from 2008, which was consistent with our planned drop in capital spending. The Central division grew nicely, thanks to the Haynesville program and the Gulf Coast division declined as we chose to pullback investment on those assets. Now remember that this shift in capital resulted in the significant excess cash flows that E&P company generated last year.The chart on the right side of the page shows that our production bottomed in September, after we cut activity down to six rigs. Currently, we're back up to 14 rigs with five of those in the Haynesville, three in the Altamont and one rig drill in Eagle Ford. Our fourth quarter volumes averaged 742 million per day and as you can see, inclined through the quarter. As a result of a strong start to the year, with an entry rate of about $750 million per day, we're raising our 2010 guidance by the 20 million a day to 740 million to 780 million per day.On Slide 27, we show per unit cash costs. We made great progress here. Remember that our volumes were down in 2009, so having a lower denominator makes this improvement in unit cash costs even more satisfying for us. Domestic lifting costs went from $0.89 last year to $0.70. As I noted earlier that a lot of that reduction was due to the efforts of our operations teams. Note that unit G&A went up year-over-year. We had some one-time benefits in 2008 and some one-time cost in 2009 that account for most of that difference. So it's a great story for total cash costs in 2009. For 2010, based on our improved production guidance and continued focus on costs, we're updating our guidance slightly to $1.85 to $2.15 per Mcfe versus our December guidance, which had a midpoint of $2.05. We improved cash cost trends we established in 2009 and are continuing in 2010 and essentially, the same levels for all the categories except for increases related to production taxes and the international lifting costs. Production taxes are up in the guidance, due to higher gas price estimate in 2010 and uncertain reduction in the assumed production tax credits versus our 2009 actuals. The lifting cost associated with our early production from the Camarupim project in Brazil will be elevated on a unit-cost basis, until we maximize the fuel production and add more production from the offset expiration projects and more efficiently utilize the FPSO.Slide 28 shows a snapshot of our 2009 domestic F&D costs and the reserve replacement rate. $1.57 F&D, that's before price-related revisions, is a significant improvement over 2008 results, reflecting the changes that we've made in the portfolio over the last two years. As Doug indicated, the new reserve booking rules had a minimal impact on us, other than the negative price revisions to associated with the new pricing methodology. Overall, our PUD percentage of total reserves hasn't changed much over the last three years. We were 29% in 2007, 25% in 2008 and now up to 31% in 2009. And the 220% reserve replacement is even better than it appears on the surface, since we spent over $600 million or about 42% less on domestic capital in 2009 than we did in 2008. For the total company, we reported a healthy 8% reserve growth, and we look forward to posting good numbers again for 2010.On Slide 29, we show you the updated year-end growth in our unproved resources since 2006. That's a full doubling over that three-year period. And again, the progress mirrors our shifts in the asset portfolio. Unconventional resources, particularly shales, have driven that up dramatically but also the conventional low-risk assets have also doubled. So we've done a lot to expand our sources at future proved reserves and production growth. When we add our PUD reserves to our unproved resources, we now have well over a ten-year drilling inventory.Let's turn to a quick update on our three major joint programs. Slide 30 updates our Haynesville program. We now have 25 wells producing in the program, and across-the-board results continue to be ahead of our models. In the Holly area, which constitutes about half of our acreage, the well results are still excellent. The average of 30-day IP rate in those wells is in excess of $17 million a day. More recently, we've been drilling wells outside of Holly and the results continue to be very encouraging. The last five wells in this area have averaged IP-30s, exceeding 10 million a day. So the story here is still positive overall. Our well performance and our drilling efficiencies are still as good as anyone in the industry and will continue with our five-rig good [ph] drilling program throughout the year. So Haynesville continue to be a growing part of our overall production.On Slide 31, as an update of the Eagle Ford. We're pleased with the drilling results of our second well and we were hoping to have a test results ready for this call now that we are still in the process of frac-ing the well. We plan to press release those results after we finish the completion and get a full production test. We've continued to expand our lease position and we're now up to 138,000 net acres. There's an incredible amount of industry activity taking place in the southwest part of the play and much of it is around two of our acreage blocks. On the map, we show the lines designating the dry gas, gas condensating oil areas, and these lines are still moving as we continue to learn more about the trends. But generally speaking, the northwestern part of the play may even be more liquids rich than others ,us and others, have previously thought. In order to accelerate our learning in the play, we've decided to add a second rig in the March, April time frame that will also give us the option to reallocate capital toward the Eagle Ford and keep both rigs running in the second half of the year. We're learning quickly in Eagle Ford, and we feel that we benefited greatly in the Eagle Ford play from our Haynesville experience that exist in our organization. I'll wrap up with an update on the Altamont program. As you know, we made a nice acquisition right before the year end of last year. This had primarily at all property, so the $9 per barrel equivalent acquisition cost is very attractive. The project really defines a bolt-on acquisition for us. The map shows just how well Flying J properties line up with ours in terms of acreage. Some of the properties we bought were even non-operating interest in wells that we currently operate. We took over operations as soon as we closed and the integration is going very smoothly since then. Following the addition of these properties and a significant drilling inventory that comes with them, we've raised our activity to three rigs in this field.That concludes my update this morning. We've started the year strong. All of our major programs have a good deal of momentum, which allows us to raise our full year production guidance and lower our cash cost guidance. Now I'll turn the call back over to Doug."

When we met with many of you back in December, we felt good about our plan for 2010 and our longer-term objectives through 2012. We also felt confident that we'd be able to share you meaningful progress against those plans early in the year and we've done that. We finished 2009 with a strong quarter giving us momentum going into 2010. The Elba terminal expansion and Elba Express pipeline are in service on time and on budget. Ruby is moving along nicely with financing commitments now on hand at favorable rates, FERC approval expected this month and construction to begin soon. E&P is off to a great start, strong enough to give us confidence in increasing production guidance and decreasing unit cash cost guidance. And our overall financial plan is falling into place nicely with the Ruby commitments, the MLP equity sale in January and the recent announcement of the sale in Mexico, which we expect to close soon. We indicated at December that we had great visibility into the elements of our financing plan and we did. So we're on track for each of the goals we set out in December for 2010 and for 2010 to 2012 longer-term objectives, including a goal to generate an average 15% annual growth in earnings per share. So off to a great start, you should expect to see more positive news as we continue to execute on the plan. And with that, we're happy to open it up to your questions this morning."

Now we see that clearly in the Southeast, in particular, relative to a year ago. On the supply side, I think we see supply push coming out of the Haynesville, clearly. It's actually impacted in a slight negative way, our volumes on Tennessee in the supply area because we have not moved some volumes from West to East there. That's being displaced now by some of the new, bigger pipes. So what happens is that some of that goes Northeast, some of it comes into the Southeast, which is good for us Southern Natural. In the Northeast, we have big new volumes coming on in the Marcellus. We have -- a year ago at this time, we probably weren't taking much at all into TGP and the Marcellus. We're up to over 300 a day. That's provided us with obviously good opportunities at our revenue lines. It's displaced some of the volumes coming in from Canada.

Secondly, remember we have very, very high growth pipeline assets meaning we're spending lots of development capital in our pipeline business today. So it would actually be, in our view, inappropriate to contemplate dropping down all of our pipeline assets into MLP given the spending profile we have. And third, remember that we have this $3 billion NOL, which is unique among MLP sponsors that allows us to continue to drop down in a measured pace assets in a very tax efficient way and create a really steady stream of growth and distributions and value to both the MLP unitholders and EPC itself.

Back in December at our Analyst Day we laid out a multiyear view of El Paso along with metrics and milestones which in many ways the investment thesis for our stock. We have assembled what we believe is an enviable portfolio of growth projects; in the pipes those projects helped build on the nation’s premier interstate natural gas pipeline system providing long term and very visible future earnings growth. At E&P, we have repositioned our asset base to have a much deeper inventory of predominantly onshore opportunities that are competitive at much lower commodity prices. And across the company we have cut cost and improved our processes, thereby improving our returns in a way that we think is sustainable.
The keys to our plan are execution, funding growth capital, particularly in 2010, and continuing to improve balance sheet.
In the execution bucket, we intend to bring our industry leading pipeline backlog in on time and on budget. We also need to demonstrate that last year’s performance in E&P was no fluke and that we can sustain first quartile operating performance and returns. In particular in this area, we need to continue to show progress in the Haynesville and Altamont and begin to move our Eagle Ford position into full development to prove up the value of this early entry position in one of the best North American unconventional plays and we need to continue to prudently build our opportunity set in the pipes and E&P and then our nascent midstream business.
In the funding growth capital bucket, we intend to ensure that we can successfully fund over $4 billion in CapEx in 2010 as spending on the pipeline backlog peaks and maintain strong liquidity during this period of historically high CapEx. In the improving the balance sheet bucket, we plan to get to free cash positives certainly by 2012 as CapEx peaks this year and then declines in the 2011 and the full impact of that growth capital begins to show in earnings and cash flow moving into 2012.
This morning we will show you that we have gotten a lot done on all of these fronts during the first quarter. First, on balance, we had a great quarter. Earnings was $0.51 a share reported or $0.33 a share on an adjusted basis puts us off to a great start on our 2010 goals. On the execution front, we moved a big step closer to starting construction on Ruby with the receipt of our FERC certificate. Jim will update you further on this important project later.
We put two projects in service in the quarter, Elba Island and the Elba Express pipeline. Total capital on the two was $900 million and they were both on time and on budget. We also started construction on two new expansions and expect to start construction a third soon. In all cases, those projects remain on and on budget. And finally in the pipes, we now have a billion dollars in growth projects in the Marcellus with line 300 and the northeast upgrade both on TGP. So we continue to take advantage of our incumbent position in key areas.
Still on the execution front but in E&P, we had a great kickoff in 2010. Production was up $40 million a day from the fourth quarter and cash costs were down 6% versus Q1 ‘09 at $1.88. The Haynesville paced our activity for the quarter with gross volumes hitting a 180 million a day and made continued progress in the Eagle Ford adding our first successful well in the liquids rich portion of the play and adding to our acreage position during the quarter.
Finally on the execution front, we remain on track to achieve our overall cost reduction goal baked into our guidance for the year of $150 million.
On the funding and balance sheet fronts, we completed three key objectives during the quarter. The Mexican asset sale, which we highlighted earlier, closed adding $300 million to the (inaudible) and achieving our goal for 2010 for asset sales. Second and more importantly, we closed the project financing for Ruby yesterday ensuring the funding of this key project at very favorable rates and on very favorable terms, a testament to the strength of the project as well as the strength of our finance and pipeline teams.
And finally we completed our largest dropdown to El Paso Pipeline Partners, our MLP during the quarter with the sale of 51% interest in the Elba Island LNG terminal and the Elba Express pipeline. This transaction generated roughly $660 million in cash to El Paso and was a real win-win for the EPB unit holders and the EP shareholders. With these three key objectives reached, we have essentially assured our funding for 2010 as J.R. will explain in more detail later, improving our balance sheet and keeping liquidity very strong at $2.7 billion.
This strong performance across the board means that we are trending towards the high-end of our guidance range in virtually every category, earnings, cash flow, costs and E&P volumes. All in all, a great start to the year and now I will turn it over to J.R., Jim, and Brent and I will come back at the end to wrap up. J.R.?

Since our last call in early March, we have continued to make significant progress on our 2010 financing plan and I am extremely pleased to report that we have essentially met our funding requirements for all of 2010 in the first four months of the year. I will spend most of my time this morning reviewing our progress with you, but first I want to view our first quarter 2010 financial results, and I am starting on slide five titled 2010 first quarter financial results. As Doug indicated, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.33 reflecting strong performances in both pipelines and E&P. solid pipeline earnings driven by expansions, strong production volumes and lower cash operating cost at E&P and a lower effective tax rate contributed to our first quarter performance.
Not surprisingly current quarter results are lower than a year ago. First quarter of 2009 benefited from higher average realized commodity prices including the impact of our hedge position. As you will recall, we had a $9.04 of a significant portion of our 2009 natural gas production. In addition, you will recall that we monetized our $110 per barrel oil swaps last year. Adjusted EPS for the prior quarter included $0.12 per share or $149 million attributable to swaps for the second, third, fourth quarters of 2009. So in total last year’s quarter benefited by about $0.25 a share or $300 million from higher realized commodity prices included the oil swaps and other derivate settlements.
Our GAPP reported diluted earnings for the first quarter of 2010 was $0.51 per share. A summary of these adjustments and a reconciliation to our reported earnings are included in our financial and operational reporting package on our website. The items impacting the first quarter included the impact of our (E&P) hedges, certain legacy matters and the tax impact of the healthcare legislation.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, which is lower than the statutory rate due primarily to an increase in income attributable to non-taxable, non-controlling interest. This was partially offset by an $18 million deferred tax charge from the healthcare legislation enacted in March of this year, which includes a provision (inaudible) to deductibility of certain retiree prescription drug expenses. With the exception of the impact of the healthcare legislation, the effective rate is consistent with the rate we assumed in our 2010 guidance shared with you back in December.
In the pipeline growth for adjusted EBIT increased 6% to $421 million for the quarter, driven largely by the impact of expansion projects. Adjusted EBITDA for the pipes was just over $525 million. In E&P adjusted EBIT of $189 million declined from year ago due to lower average prices I mentioned earlier but also due to decline in revenues for lower cash operating cost and DD&A. Adjusted EBITDA for E&P was nearly $300 million for the quarter.
We have also included for your reference in the reporting package our adjusted pro rate EBITDA results, including our share of Citrus and Four Star.
Turning to slide six, which shows our cash flow from operations and capital expenditures for the quarter, cash flow from ops for the quarter was $570 million reflecting the support of our hedge program, or a substantial portion of our first quarter domestic natural gas production was hedged at a price north of $6. As expected, operating cash flow in 2010 was below last year’s level again driven primarily by lower average commodity prices including our hedges.
As far as capital is concerned, our 2010 plan remains on target. Pipeline capital was up in ‘10 consistent with the anticipated spending levels for the development of the backlog. As you will recall, 2010 is the peak spending year associated with the construction of the backlog with our Ruby pipeline project accounting for a significant portion of current year activity. E&P capital on the other hand is lower in 2010 reflecting higher rig activity and service cost as we entered 2009. The 2010 capital spend levels reflect some frontend loading of our more traditional programs as Brent will discuss later in the call.
Total liquidity on April 30th stood at $2.7 billion exclusive of cash and credit facility capacity at both EPB and Ruby.
Turning now to slide seven, I am sure most of you have seen the press release that we issued yesterday announcing the closing of the Ruby project financing. The second year $1.5 billion debt facility is supported by the (inaudible) the traditional pipe project financing loan based on LIBOR plus of spread. Ruby’s borrowing rate is LIBOR plus 300 basis points for the first two years, LIBOR plus 325 for the third and fourth years and LIBOR plus 375 for the fifth through to seventh years. The spread beginning in year five assumes that we have refinanced the portion of the debt prior to that day. Earlier today Ruby entered into forward swap agreements to fix at least 75% of the floating LIBOR interest rate beginning in June 2011 and extending through the maturity of the bank facility.
Based on the swap rates and the current six month LIBOR of the unhedged portion, the weighted average rate would be approximately 6.5% excluding debt issue costs. (inaudible) the facility in total required conditions president are satisfied which includes among others receipt of the BLM right-of-way grant and the FERC final notice to proceed and Jim Yardley, will update that review in few minutes.
As I mentioned in our December Analyst meeting that Ruby financing was our single largest transaction in our 2010 financing plan. I’m very pleased with the outcome and happy to have this one in the call. I’m starting on slide eight, which is a summary of a recent dropdown to El Paso Pipeline Partners. In March, we completed the sale of 51% of the entities in Elba Island LNG terminal and Elba Express Pipeline to RTB [ph].
This is our third drop down to the partnership since (inaudible) were getting started. The beauty of our MLP on the drop down strategy is that these transactions are truly win-win for both El Paso and EPB stakeholders. At El Paso we received $660 million in cash making a significant contribution for meeting our financing requirements for 2010. The transaction also further accelerates growth and the value of El Paso’s incentive distribution rights or IDRs since we continue to move higher and higher in the splits.
And finally we have a greater portion of our premium pipeline franchise whose value is directly tied in the market price of EPB which carries a significantly higher and readily apparent valuation. For EPB this is a great transaction as well, to borrow on the Parkship’s assets based by adding interest in two high quality assets that are as good as gifts for MLP. We have incredibly stable cash flows with contracts that are 20 to 30 years long with subsidiaries of Shell and BG.
Unit holders are also benefiting from the recent 6% increase in distribution following the acquisition and the 17% increase over the past year reflecting a success of the growth strategy driven by both organic growth and drop downs from El Paso. On slide nine, is an update of the status of our 2010 financing plans. Back at the analyst meeting we laid out the road map for funding our $4 billion capital budget. We also said at the time that we had excellent line of sight the execution of the components of our plant.
With the close of the Ruby project financing, recent sale of our Mexican pipeline assets and the dropdown of the EPB with essentially met our 2010 funding requirements. Our current year needs have been achieved, we’ll continue to be opportunistic in the financial markets to remain fully committed growing in our MLP for the benefit of both El Paso and El Paso Pipeline Partners and stakeholders.
We can’t predict how many more drops we’ll do in 2010 or the size, that we’re optimistic about the potential of access in the MLP capital markets to advance for the longer term improving in El Paso’s balance sheet.
On slide 10, there is a summary of our 2010 and 2011 hedge position for our natural gas and oil production. With $6.33 more than roughly 70% of our domestic natural gas projection for the remainder of 2010, with those positions waited to the second and third quarter. We’re nearly fully hedged in third quarter and about 30% hedged in the fourth quarter.
In 2011 about 65% of our domestic production tensed with the floor of $6 and then on the oil side we remained substantially hedged in ‘10 with an average floor price of $76. The key change from the last updated March is that we put on more oil hedges in 2011. We now have roughly 70% of our 2011 oil production hedge with an $84 floor. We’ve included our customers detail of all our hedges in the reporting package. That’s my update for you this morning. We’re very pleased with the financial performance for the Company so far this year and we populously made terrific progress on our financing plan.
With that I’ll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the Pipeline Group. Jim?

Adjusted EBIT of $421 million is up 6% from first quarter of 2009 and the four non-controlling interest attributable to El Paso Pipeline Partners EBIT is up 11%. We’re executing very well on our growth projects. In the first quarter we placed and serviced on time and on budget both the Elba Express Pipeline and Elba expansion. As Doug, said these are large projects, total capital of $900 million and now generating revenue and they’re both fully contracted long term.
On our Ruby pipeline, we received the FERC certificate and we expect to start construction in late June or early July. We also kicked up construction on the large FGT Phase VIII expansion. And finally we added a significant new growth projects to our backlog with secured commercial arrangements with shippers to move forward with another major expansion on the Marcellus.
Slide 13 summarizes throughput our major pipes. Changes in throughput versus last year reflects the economy, weather and production threats. In the East, TGP market areas throughput was flat, driven mostly by pretty normal winter weather in the Northeast. While we did a meaningful change in where supplies came from, volumes have went up rapidly out of the Marcellus and also Rex [ph] in Ohio and these new supply sources displays for both Canadian imports to Niagara and some long haul volumes transported out of the Gulf Coast.
Some of the Gulf Coast volumes haven’t instead been transported on short hauls to other pipes serving primarily in the Southeast. In the Southeast on SNG, throughput was very strong primarily for the record breaking cold winter weather, also industrial finance required recovered quite well from depressed levels of early 2009.
On EP&G throughput decreased especially due to the continued slow economy in the Southwest. Also contributing increase of gas from California Storage, startup carters of LNG delivered the (inaudible) and increased Canadian imports in to California. Finally throughput on our Rockies pipelines increased primarily due to Rockies production levels and the start of the (inaudible). And March and April was seeing a slow increase in Rockies production from its low point at the end of 2009.
So there were some swings in throughput year-to-year, but remember the throughput levels have only a small impact on our near term financials because of the nature of our business. Slide 14 summarizes where we are on Ruby. Ruby remains on budget and on schedule. We received FERC approval on April 5. In the order FERC agreed that the proposed route will have the least amount of environmental impact.
We’ve been working with all stakeholders over the past two to three years to come up with the route that has the least impact and we develop the restoration plants that preserve habitats for threatened plants and animals. We now expect BLM’s approval for the right-of-way grant over Federal lands by the end of May.
About 56% of Ruby’s route on Federal land. Once we receive the BLM approval and on the FERC notice of receipt we expect to start construction most lightly in late June or early July. We plan to do some staging in pipe and equipment in advance so that we can get of a fast start. As you know we’ll be utilizing seven different construction spreads from four contractors. Most of that is high desert, it’s about 120 miles and more mountainous terrain. For each spread we devoted a lot of time to detailed construction planning of the contractors.
We still expect all the pipe were being a grant by yearend or shortly thereafter. We’ll then complete pipeline tie ends, do the commissioning of the compression and test the systems. With Ruby’s ongoing and service next spread. Switching gears to the Northeast, the Marcellus continues to be an exciting area for us. Marcellus production in to TGP is now over 500 a day. We affirm transportation backhaul business with Marcellus producers that will provide approximately $60 million of annual revenue by 2012.
This business requires only minimal new capital. In addition, we’ve committed to a $1 billion forward haul expansion to move Appalachian and Marcellus gas to markets on a forward haul basis. Both of the projects are fully contracted under long term contracts and provides solid regulated returns. On the Line 300 expansion, we expect FERC approval soon. We’ll do some construction work later this year, but the bulk of the construction will be done in 2011 which is expected in service in November 2011.
The Northeast upgrade project is a step behind and is planned to go in service in late 2013. So TGP is in the center of the Marcellus activity in Northeast Pennsylvania and this is becoming a significant and growing business for us. Finally on slide 16, as you know we have several other great projects under construction this year in addition to Ruby and Line 300. We just started construction on both SNG, South System Pre-expansion and FGT Phase VIII expansion. Both of these are primarily pipeline looping and compression expansions.
Construction on Gulf LNG is well underway with the outer tank concrete work on both tanks now complete and construction will start soon on TIG’s expansion (inaudible). We just received last week our FERC certificate on that one. All these projects are on time and on budget and will start contributing revenue early in 2011.
In summary, 2010 is obviously a busy execution year for us. We’ve made very good progress so far and we’re on track with all the projects in the backlog. And now I’ll turn it over to Brent.

Our first quarter volumes came in at the high end of our range of expectations. Much of that increase was driven by the Haynesville which continues to deliver better results in our models, while all of our operating areas performed well versus our plan in Q1. We continued to find ways to further reduce operating cost. Our first quarter per unit cash costs were favorable and we’re modestly lowering our full year cost guidance and most importantly we believe there were any solid returns on our capital programs and as I’ll show you our capital is now largely focused in three areas and all three programs are progressing nicely.
We’re really excited about the Eagle Ford opportunity. We now believe that economics in the gas condensate area are even better than we anticipated. I’ll mention that Haynesville success and I’ll update you on drivers there in a few slides and the Altamonte program will continue to provide our good profitable oil option to our capital program and we’re now growing volumes in that area.
Oil and condensate production contributes about 13 to 14% of our total equivalent volumes, but due to the higher, to the combination of higher oil prices and more oil production in Altamonte almost a quarter of our domestic revenues are now tied to liquids pricing versus about 15% in Q1 of ‘09 and remember in Brazil, Camarupim gas volumes are also indexed to a basket of fuel oils and also benefit from higher oil prices.
On slide 19, on the left graph we show you our first quarter 2010 production compared to 2009 and we were down about 3% from a year ago. And remember we significantly shifted our capital allocation over the last year and you can see the impact to the capital shifts and year-over-year production changes. We’re not investing as much in the Gulf of Mexico or traditional South Texas areas as we have historically and you can see the expected decline in the blue bars.
We’re also spending less in some of our traditional Rockies programs in our western region but we’re still managing the whole production relatively stable in the west. We’re experiencing solid growth in our Haynesville program which is showing up in the green bands in our central region.
The graph on the right side of the chart maybe more importantly shows how our production has rebounded from the third quarter lows of last year as we’ve increased activity levels. As we look out the rest of this year, our production profiles should be relatively flat and I’ll show you in a few minutes our rig count were declined in the second half for the year, but we front-end loaded the drilling in our more traditional programs and much of that work is now being completed and we’ll see the production benefits through the year.
For now we’re maintaining our 740 to 780 million per day guidance, with the Q1 coming at 780, we have a chance to trend near the high end of the range for the full year. Slide 20 shows the summary of our cash cost. Total cash cost for the quarter were $1.88 which is down 6% as J.R. said from $2 a year ago and the big change is from domestic LOE which came in at $0.62 per unit.
We’ve been a top quartile performer for a number of years in this area but we found ways to further drive improvement in the cost. There has been some cost inflation since this time last year but you may recall that we’ve consolidated our domestic operations into one organization and we’re definitely realizing benefits from that change.
And the national LOE was manageable in the first quarter of 2009, but its present to 2010 with the addition of the Camarupim volumes. Those Brazil unit cost will trend down later in the year as we bring on the fourth well in that field. Given our progress with domestic LOE and the strong start to the year, we’re reducing our range of per unit cash cost down $0.05 to $1.80 to $2.10. If you turn to slide 21, I’ll give you an update on our Haynesville program.
At this time last year, we were kind of just catching up our stride in the Haynesville. Since then, we have demonstrated that our drilling and completion capabilities are as good as anyone in the play. We have recently drilled a well in 25 days from spud to rig release and that’s about three days better than our previous best well in the field. And then, while we don’t have the largest Haynesville position, we arguably have one of the best.
We look at numerous production comparisons including 30-day IPs, the first three months totals, the first six month total production. In all cases, our wells compete favorably with industry averages. As an example, for the wells that have been on production for six months, the El Paso wells on average have tuned (ph) about 1.5 Bcf of production versus about 1.2 Bcf for the industry average or roughly about 30% difference. So we have got an advantaged acreage position and we are doing a good job of drilling and completing their wells.
The only negative news in the Haynesville is the stimulation cost were up about 10% since the beginning of the year and we continue to experience upward cost pressure in the field. We have gotten our - we had gotten our average completed well cost down to about $7.5 million and today that cost is more like $8 million to $9 million for well.
And I believe this is part of why you have heard a number of operators discuss reductions in their Haynesville activity levels. We have not made a decision yet to reduce activity, but there is a logical limit to high service cost and low natural gas prices and we are getting close.
The good news for the quarter is that both our non-Holly and our Holly wells continue to perform as good or better than the models that we shared with you in New York in December, which again has contributed to domestic production running at the high-end of our expectations.
Slide 22, there is a 15-month history of our gross operated Haynesville production. A year-ago, we were around about 30 million a day. In the first quarter of 2010, we averaged above a 170 million a day, and we currently have eight wells waiting on completion. So we expect to produce a 180 million to 200 million a day during the second quarter. And remember that our net volumes here are roughly 70% to 75% of that gross total.
Now, if you turn to slide 23, I will give you an Eagle Ford update. When we had our fourth quarter call, our second well which is in the gas condensate area, it hadn’t been completed or tested. We announced the IP rate a few weeks later and it’s a nice well. It tested about 2.9 million a day of gas and 721 barrels of condensate per day.
Now the headline, 7.2 million a day equivalent volume is less impressive than Haynesville gas rates. But the liquids content of this well significantly improves the economics of the area. We had a second gas rig in the Eagle Ford program in March, and we are now drilling our third well in the gas condensate area, and we will continue to develop that part of the play.
We are also completing our second well in the dry gas area and assuming $4 net back gas well (ph). This area is not as strong as the gas condensate area. But when prices do turn, this is going to be a really good program for us. We will probably drill another well or two this year to continue the pilot tested to test this part of the play.
A key issue for the Eagle Ford is takeaway in processing capacity. And as you know, there is a lot of companies floating potential infrastructure projects. We are looking at a number of those options and we are also working on some ideas internally that could favor Tennessee Gas Pipeline. And we don’t have anything to announce yet, but we plan to get ahead of our takeaway capacity needs here just as we did in the Haynesville.
We continued to acquire additional acreage in the gas condensate part of the play and we now have closer to a 150,000 net acres overall with about 80,000 acres of the leases in the gas condensate area.
On slide 24, there is a chart showing some comparative data between the two areas in our first four wells. The first thing I would point to is the difference in the Btu content of the gas between the Briscoe (inaudible) that’s the southern dry gas area and the Hickson (ph) 1H that’s the northern gas condensate area. And you can see that’s a 970 Btu versus 1368.
And also note, the condensate is 731 barrels per day on the Hickson. And I will show you the impact of those liquids on the world economics in the next slide. And then, finally, our most recent wells - in our most recent well, we drilled a 5,000 foot lateral and we plan to complete this well with an 18-stage frac as we continue to optimize the drilling and completion designs in the play.
Slide 25 shows the economic impact of the liquids on the returns in the Eagle Ford economics. As I mentioned a moment ago, there is a big difference between the Btu content of the two areas and a $4 net back gas world, the natural gas liquid content improves the value of an Mcf of gas to north of $7.
And if you include an average of about a 150 barrels of condensate production per million of gas and note that our initial rate on the Hickson well was at a much higher condensate rate, it was more like 250 barrels per million. But if you assume that 150 barrels per million and you assume $80 oil price, we would add another $8 of value for every Mcf we produce.
And the text box at the bottom gives an indication of the returns for dry gas well and a condensate well at $4 and $80 price assumption. And the takeaway is gas pricing, we would expect sort of breakeven returns in the dry gas area and very attractive economics in the gas condensate area, which is why we are rapidly moving into development mode and while this area has quickly become a core program for us.
Now slide 26, I will give you a quick update on our two international programs. Our Camarupim project has three wells producing about a $130 million to $140 million a day of gross production, so that’s about $30 million to $35 million a day net to El Paso and the fourth well is still expected to be on stream in the fourth quarter. We have adjusted full-year international guidance down by 10 million a day to 35 million to 45 million a day, while keeping the total company range unchanged.
In the ES-5 block, we and our partners Petrobras are drilling an exploratory cast on our VISY (ph) project. And this is a look-like prospect to Camarupim and it would be tied back to the Camarupim production facility. Note, there were also drilling that inside the ES-5 block, so we have a 35% working interest in that project versus the 24% unitized interest we have in the Camarupim field.
We continue to make progress in Egypt with current activity in each of our three blocks. In South Alamein block, we are drilling our fifth well with the operator SEPSA and EP operated South Mariut Block, we have begun acquisition of 3D - of the second phase of 3D seismic, and in the RWE operated Tanta block, we are evaluating seismic and we will decide jointly whether or not we will drill a well later this year.
And finally, slide 27 provides the snapshot of our drilling program for the year as you can see we front loaded our 2010 rig schedule to some of our more traditional programs. And we did this, because we feared the service cost were headed higher and we wanted to ensure the economics of these wells. We will soon be down to eight to 10 rigs, that will be four to five in the Haynesville, two to three in Altamont, and one to two in the Eagle Ford. And these are our most profitable and most liquidous programs, so that will be the focus of our capital program for the remainder of the year.
We are going to be pretty fluid between now and yearend if gas prices remain soft and service companies keep trying to increase cost, then we may drop a couple of those rigs and be closer to eight. We will be disciplined about the capital spending in the current environment and we will allocate capital to the programs with the greatest value creation and return potential just as we did last year, and we will do the same thing this year as well.
So that’s it for E&P. We excited 2009 with a lot of positive momentum and we haven’t skipped a beat so far this year.
With that, I will turn the call back to Doug for closing comments.

I hope you see from our results that our businesses are really hitting on all cylinders so far this year. The pipelines continue to exit well on their growth projects, putting close to a $1 billion in service during the quarter on-time and on-budget, starting construction on two projects and receiving approval to start on a third.
We moved the ball down the field on Ruby toward a summer start to construction and we continued to add to the backlog in the Marcellus. E&P continues to perform very well both on the volume and cost fronts and we continued to add to our position in the Eagle Ford during the quarter, and we made significant progress on the balance sheet with the Mexican asset closing, another MLP drop, and the closing of the Ruby project financing.
As we look to the second half of 2010, we continue to monitor gas prices and oil field services cost closely. We are largely shielded from gas price issues, given the relative stability of our pipeline cash flows and significant hedging in E&P, all the way through 2011. In addition, most of our acreage in E&P is held by production, so we have very little need to drill the hole in 2010.
So our efforts are to make sure that we maximize returns by allocating capital to the best areas, given the combination of acreage position, commodity pricing, and costs. You see from Brent’s presentation that we now plan to focus virtually all of our second half capital on our three most profitable areas, Altamont and Eagle Ford given their liquids content, and Haynesville given our preferred position there.
We are currently planning to cut overall capital relative to our original guidance, which was basically already flat to last year. But we have begun to reallocate where it makes sense. And we don’t factor our hedges into any incremental capital decisions. Those hedges are there to ensure our cash flows not to justify drilling.
As the rest of industry, we are also very concerned about recent upticks in some service costs, particularly in this natural gas price environment, and we are prepared to cut back if those costs aren’t in line with the reality of the current gas price environment.
Finally, as I have discussed at the beginning of the call, the strong start to the year has us trending toward the high end of our guidance range is virtually across the board. So we will be working to sustain that in the balance of the year.
With that, we will open it up to your questions this morning. And let me ask - let me start by requesting that you limit yourself to a couple of questions, so we can accommodate everybody that’s in the queue.

So Marcellus, we are right on top of it in northeast Pennsylvania. It’s allowed us to do forward haul expansions to the tune of a billion dollars, these projects stand on their own. By the way if you relate that billion dollars to the rig face today on TGP, the existing rate base is probably about $2.5 billion. So those are very meaningful expansions.
Coming back to the base business, the backhaul business that we have that is coming out of Marcellus protects us from a lot of downside challenges. While we are most challenged on TGP is in the mid section of TGP coming up through Kentucky and Ohio and in all - it’s that section that one would worry about wrecks lines or Marcellus backing up. But really in (inaudible) there, we’ve been challenged since probably 2000 or so. We have significant excess capacity there today and it’s highly, highly competitive in that area. So it’s not any backing out of additional business we don’t think is a significant thing relative to that backhaul business. In addition to that, we save on fuel, on electricity to run our compression and we will just naturally save on operating cost if that happens down there. So on balance when we look at the total picture we see much more positive than negative.

Well it’s a great question, it’s one that we’re going to - that we have and we’ll spend a lot of time discussing and analyzing internally as we go through the year. We now have two competitors who have announced restructurings of their business in order to unlock what they perceive to be discounts to their stocks. And one of those cases is to be accomplished by essentially moving all of their pipeline and midstream assets into one MLP all at once and that relieves them of future funding requirements there and highlights their (inaudible) franchise.
And the other, they intend to separate their businesses with a tax free spend of most of their E&P assets. In each of them we think has different drivers. For El Paso they represent too many possible alternatives and so we’ll watch closely to see whether either or both of those result in differential shareholder value. Here’s where we are. The next year for us is absolutely critical. We see the discount between our current share price in our NAV as composed really of three components. The first of those relates to the balance sheet. We don’t have investment grade statistics today and we’re in our peak year for capital spending.
We think there is some discount to our NAV that’s associated with concerns about our ability to adequately turn our pipeline business and at the same time fund E&P and our (nascent) midstream business. And we believe that as we get rid of those concerns, as we move toward our target of free cash in 2012 and as we move toward our target of investment grade in 2012, there is a significant value accretion to our shareholders.
Obviously, yesterday and that was a key day for us in that journey with the closing of the Ruby financing. The second component of discount between our NAV and our share price revolves, we think, around execution. Shareholders want to know that we can put pipeline projects on time and on budget and generate predictable sustainable earnings growth. We’ve got a - we think we have a differentiated track record on this front and we further that this quarter putting close to a billion dollars of new projects and service but we know we have to do this with the rest of the backlog.
We think as we show that through the balance of this year and into early 2011, our shareholders are going to be rewarded. On the E&P side, we have to show that the performance that we logged in 2009 was continued to trend and was a step function improvement, wasn’t a fluke and we can compete in this business at the high end of returns and at the low end to cost.
So putting up 2010 numbers similar to 2009 will go a long way toward eliminating this as a concern and we think it’ll result in going concern value of our E&P franchise being reflected in our share price. So, will by the way moving our Eagle Ford acreage into development mode as we did with the Haynesville in 2009.
And then the third component of the discount is driven by the fact that we are in a pure play. As we sit here today, we don’t know what the waiting of those three are, but we do intend to largely eliminate the first two as we put the backlog in service and as we deliver another good year in E&P as we bring our Eagle Ford play into full development as we complete our capital spending overall in 2010 and start to improve our balance sheet and we intend to do all of that much of it in the balance of 2010.
So while we intend to continue to monitor the performance of our competitors really closely to see if either of their decisions or some permutation of those decisions that generate excess returns to El Paso investors we think today at this red hot moment while we’re in the middle of the biggest CapEx year in our company’s 82-year history and while we’re in the midst of what maybe the best combined year for our business units it’s in our shareholders best interest that we stay laser focused on balance sheet improvement, execution and moving towards positive free cash.

We’re incented to do that both by the incentive distribution rights that we hold in the GP and by the units that we hold and. So that’s been a good formula for us so far. We think it’ll continue to be a good formula. If you think about sort of the - we have always thought that the practical limit in the near term to the growth in our MLP is really the size of the MLP market and the capacity at least right now of the retail market to absorb new equity. So if you think about that as JR mentioned earlier kind of $300 million of equity at a time and $50 million debt-to-cap, that’s on the order of $600 million drop at a time. We think that we can do more than one of those a year and probably can’t do four of those in a year, so somewhere in the one to three range in a year given current market conditions.
Until we get to the holy grail for us, which is investment grade as a company and until we get to free cash, we think it’s pretty simple for us to figure out what we do with proceeds and that’s a great way for us with a really efficient source of capital to accelerate our deleveraging plan and move that 2012 date up if you can.

Back in December at our Analyst Day, we laid out a multi-year view of El Paso, along with metrics and milestones, which is in many ways the investment pieces for our stock. We've assembled what we believe is an enviable portfolio of growth projects. In the Pipes, those projects helped build on the nation's premier interstate natural gas pipeline system, providing long-term and very visible future earnings growth.
In E&P, we've repositioned our asset base to have a much deeper inventory of predominantly onshore opportunities that are competitive at much lower commodity prices. And across the company, we've cut costs and improved our processes, thereby improving our returns in a way that we think is sustainable.
The keys to our plan are execution; funding growth capital, particularly in 2010; and continuing to improve our balance sheet. In the execution bucket, we intend to bring our industry-leading pipeline backlog in on time and on budget. We also need to demonstrate that last year's performance in E&P was no fluke, and that we can sustain first quartile operating performance and returns.
And particular in this area, we need to continue to show progress in the Haynesville and Altamont, and begin to move our Eagle Ford position into full development to prove up the value of this early entry position in one of the best American unconventional plays. And we need to continue to prudently build our opportunities set in the Pipes and E&P and in our native Midstream business.
In the funding growth capital bucket, we intend to ensure that we can successfully fund over $4 billion in CapEx in 2010, as spending on the pipeline backlog peaks, and maintain strong liquidity during this period of historically high CapEx.
In the improving the balance sheet bucket, we plan to get to free cash positive certainly by 2012, as CapEx peaks this year and then declines into 2011, and the full impact that, that gross capital begins to show in earnings and cash flow moving into 2012.  
This morning, we'll show you that we've gotten a lot done on all these fronts during the first quarter. First, on balance, we had a great quarter. Earnings-wise, $0.51 a share reported, or $0.33 a share on an adjusted basis, puts us off to a great start on our 2010 goals.
On the execution front, we moved a big step closer to starting construction on Ruby with the receipt of our FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] certificate. Jim will update you further on this important project later.
We put two projects in service in the quarter, Elba Island and the Elba Express Pipeline. Total capital on the two was $900 million, and they were both on time and on budget. We also started construction on two new expansions and expect to start construction on the third, soon. In all cases, those projects remained on time and on budget.
And finally, in the Pipes, we now have $1 billion in growth projects in the Marcellus, with Line 300 (sic) [300 Line], and the Northeast Upgrade, both on TGP [Tennessee Gas Pipeline]. So we continue to take advantage of our incumbent position in key areas.
Still on the execution front, but in E&P, we had a great kick off in 2010. Production was up $40 million a day during the fourth quarter and cash costs were down 6% versus Q1 '09 at $1.88. The Haynesville paced our activity for the quarter, with gross volumes hitting 180 million a day. And we made continued progress in the Eagle Ford, adding our first successful well in the liquids-rich portion of the play, and adding to our acreage position during the quarter.
Finally, on the execution front, we remain on track to achieve our overall cost reduction goal baked into our guidance for the year of $150 million.
On the funding and balance sheet fronts, we completed three key objectives during the quarter. The Mexican asset sale, which we highlighted earlier, closed, adding $300 million to the coffers, and achieving our goal for 2010 for asset sales. Second, and more importantly, we closed the project financing for Ruby yesterday, ensuring the funding of this key project at very favorable rates and on very favorable terms, a testament to the strength of the project, as well as the strength of our finance and pipeline teams.
And finally, we completed our largest drop down through El Paso Pipeline Partners or MLP [master limited partnership] during the quarter, with the sale of 51% interest in the Elba Island LNG terminal and the Elba Express Pipeline. This transaction generated roughly $660 million in cash to El Paso, and was a real win-win for the EPB unit holders and the EP shareholders. With these three key objectives reached, we've essentially assured our funding for 2010, as J.R. will explain in more detail later, and proving our balance sheet and keeping liquidity very strong at $2.7 billion.
This strong performance across the board means that we're trending towards the high end of our guidance range in virtually every category: Earnings, cash flow, costs and E&P volumes. All in all, a great start to the year. And now I'll turn it over to J.R., Jim, and Brent, and I'll come back at the end to wrap up. J.R.?"

And I'm extremely pleased to report that we've essentially met our funding requirements for all of 2010 in the fir",1572,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning. Since our last call in early March, we've continued to make significant progress on our 2010 financing plan. And I'm extremely pleased to report that we've essentially met our funding requirements for all of 2010 in the first four months of the year. 
I'll spend most of time this morning reviewing our progress with you. But first, I'll review our first quarter 2010 financial results. And I'm starting on Slide 5 titled 2010 First Quarter Financial Results. As Doug indicated, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.33, reflecting strong performances in both pipelines and E&P. Solid pipeline earnings, driven by expansions, strong production volumes and lower cash operating costs at E&P and a lower effective tax rate attributed to our first quarter performance.
Not surprisingly, current quarter results are lower than a year ago. First quarter of 2009 benefited from higher average realized commodity prices, including the impact of our hedge positions. If you will recall, we had a $9 floor on a significant portion of our 2009 natural gas production. 
In addition, you'll recall that we monetized our $110 per barrel of oil swaps last year. Adjusted EPS for the prior quarter includes $0.12 a share, or $149 million attributable to the swaps for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2009. So in total, last year's quarter benefited by about $0.25 a share, or $300 million, from higher realized commodity prices, including the oil swaps and other derivative settlements. Our GAAP reported diluted earnings for the first quarter of 2010 was $0.51 per share. 
In summary, the adjustments and reconciliation to our reported earnings are included in our financial and operational reporting package on our website. The items impacting the first quarter included the impacts of our E&P hedges, certain legacy matters and the tax impact of the healthcare legislation. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, which is lower than the statutory rate, due primarily to an increase in income attributable for non-taxable, non-controlling interests. This was partially offset by an $18-million deferred tax charge from the healthcare legislation enacted in March of this year, which includes a provision to reduce the deductibility of certain retiree prescription drug expenses. With the exception of the impact of the healthcare legislation, the effective rate is consistent with the rate we assumed in our 2010 guidance shared with you back in December.
In the Pipeline Group, adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $421 million in the quarter, driven largely by the impact of expansion projects. Adjusted EBITDA for the Pipes was just over $525 million. In E&P, adjusted EBITDA of $189 million declined from a year ago, due to lower average prices I mentioned earlier. But offsetting the decline in revenues were lower cash operating costs and D&A [depreciation and amortization]. Adjusted EBITDA at E&P was nearly $300 million for the quarter. We've also included, for your reference in the reporting package, our adjusted pro rata EBITDA results, including our share of both Citrus and Four Star.
Turning to Slide 6, which shows our cash flow from operations and capital expenditures for the quarter. Cash flow from ops for the quarter is $570 million, reflecting the support of our hedge program, where a substantial portion of our first quarter domestic natural gas production was hedged to the price north of $6. As expected, operating cash flow in 2010 was below last year's levels, again, driven primarily by lower average commodity prices, including our hedges.
As far as capital is concerned, our 2010 plan remains on target. Pipeline capital is up in '10, consistent with the anticipated spending levels for the development of the backlog. If you will recall, 2010 is the peak spending year associated with the construction of the backlog, with our Ruby Pipeline project accounting for a significant portion to our current year activity.
E&P capital, on the other hand, is lower in 2010, reflecting higher rig activity and service costs as we entered 2009. In 2010, capital expense levels reflect some front-end loading of our more traditional programs, as Brent will discuss later in the call. Total liquidity on April 30 stood at $2.7 billion, exclusive of cash and credit facility capacity at both EPB and Ruby.
Turning now to Slide 7, I'm sure most of you have seen the press release that we issued yesterday, announcing the closing of the Ruby project financing (sic) [Ruby Financing project]. The seven-year $1.5 billion debt facility is supported by a large group of banks. The facility is a traditional bank project financing loan, based on LIBOR plus the spread. Ruby's borrowing rate is LIBOR plus 300 basis points for the first two years, LIBOR plus 325 for the third and fourth years, LIBOR plus 375 for the fifth through the seventh years. The spread beginning in the year five assumes that we have refinanced the portion of the debt prior to that date. 
Earlier today, Ruby entered into forward swap agreements to fix at least 75% of the floating LIBOR interest rate beginning in June 2011, and extending through the maturity of the bank facility. Based on the swap rates and the current six-month LIBOR on the unhedged portion, weighted average rate would be approximately 6.5%, excluding debt issue costs. We will draw the facility if total required conditions presented are satisfied, which includes, among others, receipt of the BLM [Bureau of Land Management] right-of-way grant and the FERC final notes to proceed. Jim Yardley will update you that review in a few minutes.
As I mentioned in our December Analyst Meeting, the Ruby financing was our single largest transaction in our 2010 financing plan. I'm very pleased with the outcome. I'm happy to have this one under one call. 
Let's turn now to Slide 8, which is a summary of the recent drop downs to El Paso Pipeline Partners. In March, we completed the sale of 51% of the entities that own Elba Island LNG terminal and Elba Express Pipeline to EPB. This is our third drop down of the partnership to synthesize skill and, frankly, we're just getting started. The beauty of our MLP and the drop down strategy is that these transactions are truly win-win for both El Paso and EPB stakeholders.
For El Paso, we received $660 million in cash, making a significant contribution toward meeting our financing requirements for 2010. The transaction also further accelerates growth in the value of El Paso's incentive distribution rights or IDRs, since we've continued to move higher and higher in the splits.
In summary, we have a greater portion of our premium pipeline franchise, whose value is directly tied to the market price of EPB, which carries a significantly higher and readily apparent valuation. For EPB, this is a great transaction as well, to borrow on the partnership's asset base by having interests in two high-quality assets that are as good as it gets for an MLP. They have incredibly stable cash flows, with contracts that are 20- to 30-years long with subsidiaries of Shell and BG.
Unit holders are also benefiting from the recent 6% increase in distribution following the acquisition, and a 17% increase over the past year, reflecting the success of the growth strategy, driven by both organic growth and drop downs from El Paso.
On Slide 9 is an update on the status of our 2010 financing plan. Back at the Analyst Meeting, we laid out a roadmap for funding our $4 billion capital budget. We also said at the time that we had excellent line of sight on the execution of the components of our plan. With the close of the Ruby project financing (sic) [Ruby Financing project], the recent sale of our Mexican pipeline assets and the drop down of the EPB would essentially bear our 2010 funding requirements.
Even though our current year needs have been achieved, we'll continue to be opportunistic in the financial markets, to remain fully committed growing our MLP for the benefit of both El Paso and El Paso Pipeline Partners stakeholders. We cannot predict how many more drops we'll do in 2010 on the side. But we're optimistic about the potential of accessing the MLP capital markets to advance the longer-term improvement in El Paso's balance sheet.
On Slide 10, there's a summary of our 2010 and 2011 hedge positions for our natural gas and oil production. We have $6.33 floors on roughly 70% of our domestic natural gas production for the remainder of 2010, but those positions weighted for the second and third quarter. We're nearly fully hedged through third quarter, about 30% hedged than the fourth quarter. 
In 2011, about 65% of our domestic production is hedged for the floor of $6. And then on the oil side, we remain substantially hedged in '10, with an average floor price of $76.
The key change from the last update in March is that we put on more oil hedges in 2011. We now have roughly 70% of our 2011 oil production hedged with an $84 floor. We've included our customers the details of all our hedges in the reporting package.
That's my update for you this morning. We're very pleased with the financial performance of the company so far this year. And we've obviously made terrific progress on our financing plan. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the Pipeline Group. Jim?"
1038355,85200909,60288,"El Paso Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 06, 2010",2010-05-06,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks, J.R. The Pipes are off to a solid start this year.

Adjusted EBIT of $421 million is up 6% from first quarter 2009 and, before noncontrolling interests attributable to El Paso Pipeline Partners, EBIT is up 11%. We're executing very well on our growth projects. 
In the first quarter, we placed and serviced on time and on budget both the Elba Express Pipeline and Elba expansion. As Doug said, these are large projects, total capital of $900 million. They're now generating revenue and they're both fully contracted long-term.
On our Ruby Pipeline, we received the FERC certificate. And we expect to start construction in late June or early July. We also have kicked off construction on the large FGT Phase VIII expansion. And finally, we added a significant new growth project to our backlog. We secured commercial arrangements with shippers to move forward with another major expansion on the Marcellus.
Slide 13 summarizes throughput on major pipes. Changes in throughput versus last year reflects the economy, weather and production trends. In the East of TGP, the market area's throughput was flat, driven mostly by pretty normal winter weather in the Northeast. While we did see a meaningful change in where supplies came from, volumes have ramped up rapidly over the Marcellus and also REX [Rockies Express] in Ohio. And these new supply sources displaced both Canadian imports in Niagara and some long-haul volumes transported out of the Gulf coast.  Some of the Gulf coast volumes have instead been transported on short hauls to other pipes serving primarily the Southeast. 
In the Southeast, on SNG [Southern Natural Gas], throughput was very strong, primarily through record-breaking cold winter weather. Also industrial demand has recovered quite well from the depressed levels of early 2009. On EPNG [El Paso Natural Gas], throughput decreased especially due to the continued slow economy in the Southwest. Also contributing, increase of gas from California storage, startup cargoes of LNG delivered to Costa Azul and increased Canadian imports into California.
Finally, throughput on our Rockies Pipeline decreased primarily due to the Rockies production levels and the startup of REX-East. In March and April, we are seeing a slow increase in the Rockies production from its low point at the end of 2009. So there were some swings in throughput year-to-year, but remember that throughput levels have only a small impact on our near-term financials because of the demand-charge nature of our business.
Slide 14 summarizes where we are on Ruby. Ruby remains on budget and on schedule. We received FERC approval on April 5. In the order, FERC agreed that the proposed route will have the least amount of environmental impact. we've been working with all stakeholders over the past two to three years to come up with a route that has the least impact. And we've developed restoration plans to preserve habitats for threatened plants and animals.
We now expect BLM's approval for the right-of-way grant over federal lands by the end of May. About 56% of Ruby's route is on federal land. Once we receive the BLM approval and then the FERC to proceed, we expect to start construction most likely in late June or early July. We plan to do some staging of piping equipment in advance so that we can get off to a fast start.
As you know, we'll be utilizing seven different construction spreads from four contractors. Most of the route is high desert, it was about 120 miles, and more mountainous terrain. For each spread, we've devoted a lot of time to detailed construction planning with the contractors. We still expect all the pipe will be in the ground by year-end or shortly thereafter. We'll then complete pipeline tie-ends, do the commissioning of the compression and test the system, with Ruby done and going in service next spring.
Switching gears to the Northeast, the Marcellus continues to be an exciting area for us. Marcellus production into TGP is now over 500 a day. We affirmed transportation backhaul business with Marcellus producers who will provide approximately $60 million of annual revenue by 2012. This business requires only minimal new capital. In addition, we've committed to a $1 billion forward-haul expansion to move Appalachian and Marcellus gas to markets on a forward-haul basis. Both of these projects are fully contracted under long-term contracts and provide solid regulated returns.
On the Line 300 (sic) [300 Line] expansion, we expect FERC approval soon. We'll then do some construction work later this year, but the bulk of the construction will be done in 2011, with expected in-service in November 2011. The Northeast Upgrade Project is a step behind and is planned to go in service in late 2013. So TGP is in the center of the Marcellus activity in Northeast Pennsylvania, and this is becoming a significant and growing business for us.
Finally, on Slide 16, as you know, we have several other growth projects under construction this year in addition to Ruby and Line 300 (sic) [300 Line]. We just started construction on both SNG South System III expansion and FGT Phase VIII expansion. Both of these are primarily pipeline looping and compression expansions.
Construction on Gulf LNG is well underway, with the other tank concrete work on both tanks now complete. And construction will start soon on CIG's expansion out of the Raton. We just received last week our FERC certificate on that one. All these projects are on time and on budget, and will start contributing revenue early in 2011.
In summary, 2010 is obviously a busy execution year for us. We've made very good progress so far, and we're on track with all of the projects in the backlog. And now I'll turn it over to Brent."

Our first quarter volumes came in at the high end of our range of expectations. Much of that increase was driven by the Haynesville, which continues to deliver better results in our models, while all of our operating areas performed well versus our plan in Q1.
We continue to find ways to further reduce operating costs. Our first quarter per unit cash cost were favorable, and we're modestly lowering our full-year cost guidance. And most importantly, we believe they were earnings solid returns on our capital programs. And as I'll show you, our capital is now largely focused in three areas, and all three programs are progressing nicely.
We're really excited about the Eagle Ford opportunity. We now believe that the economics in the gas condensate area are even better than we anticipated. I mentioned the Haynesville success and I'll update you on our progress there in a few slides.
And the Altamont program, we continue to provide a good profitable oil option our capital program, and we're now growing volumes in that area. Oil and condensate production contributes about 13% to 14% of our total equivalent volumes. But due to combination of higher oil prices and more oil production in Altamont, almost 1/4 of our domestic revenues are now tied to liquids pricing versus about 58% in Q1 of '09. And remember, in Brazil, Camarupin gas volumes are also indexed to a basket of fuel oils and also benefit from higher oil prices.
On Slide 19, on the left graph, we show you our first quarter 2010 production compared to 2009, and we were down about 3% from a year ago. Now remember, we significantly shifted our capital allocation over the last year, and you can see the impact of the capital shifts in the year-over-year production changes. We're not investing as much in the Gulf of Mexico, or traditional South Texas areas, as we have historically. And you can see the expected decline in the blue bars.
We're also spending less in some of our traditional Rockies programs in our Western region, but we're still managing the whole production relatively stable in the West. We're experiencing solid growth in our Haynesville program, which is showing up in the green bands in our Central region. The graph on the right side of the chart, maybe more importantly, shows how production has rebounded from the third quarter lows of last year as we've increased activity levels.
As we look out the rest of this year, our production profile should be relatively flat. And as I'll show you in a few minutes, our rig count will decline in the second half of the year, but we've front-end loaded the drilling in our more traditional programs, and much of that work is now being completed and we'll see the production benefits through the year.  For now we're maintaining our 740 million to 780 million per day guidance. With Q1 coming in at 780 million, we have a chance to trend at the high end of the range for the full year. 
Slide 20 shows our summary of our cash costs. And the total cash costs the quarter were $1.88, which is down 6% as J.R. said, from $2 a year ago. And the big change is from domestic LOE [lease and operating expense], which came in at $0.62 per unit. We've been a top-quartile performer for a number of years in this area, but we found ways to further drive improvement in the costs. There's been some cost deflations since this time last year, but you may recall that we've consolidated our domestic operations into one organization, and we're definitely realizing benefits from that change.  
International LOE was negligible in the first quarter of 2009, but is present in 2010, with the addition of the Camarupin volumes. Thus, Brazil unit cost will trend down later in the year, as we bring on the fourth well in that field. Given our progress of domestic LOE and the strong start to the year, we're reducing our range of per unit cash cost down $0.05 to $1.80 to $2.10.
If you turn to Slide 21, I'll give you an update on our Haynesville program. At this time last year, we we're kind of just catching our stride into Haynesville. Since then, we've demonstrated that our drilling and completion capabilities are as good as anyone in the play. We have recently drilled a well in 25 days from spud to rig release, and that's about three days better than our previous best well in the field. And now while we don't have the largest Haynesville position, we argue we really have one of the best. And we look at numerous production comparisons, including 30-day IPs, the first three months totals, the first six-month total production. In all cases, our wells compete favorably with industry averages.
As an example, for the wells that have been on production for six months, the El Paso wells on average have achieved about 1.5 Bcf of production versus about 1.2 Bcf for the industry average, or roughly about 30% difference. So we've got an advantage acreage position and we're doing a good job of drilling and completing the wells.
The only negative news in the Haynesville is that the stimulation costs were up about 10% since the beginning of the year. And we continue to experience upward cost pressure in the field. We had gotten our average completed well cost down to about $7.5 million. And today, that cost is more like $8 million to $9 million per well. And I believe this is part of why you've heard a number of operators discuss reductions in their Haynesville activity levels. We've not made a decision yet to reduce activity, but there's a logical limit to high service costs and low natural gas prices, and we're getting close. 
The good news for the quarter is that both our non-Holly and our Holly wells continue to perform as good, or better than the models that we shared with you in New York in December, which again has contributed to domestic production running at the high end of our expectations.
On Slide 22, there's a 15-month history of our gross operated Haynesville production. A year ago, we're around about 30 million a day. In the first quarter of 2010, we averaged above 170 million. And we currently have eight wells waiting on completion. So we expect to produce 180 million to 200 million a day during the second quarter. And remember that our net volumes here are roughly 70% to 75% of that gross total.
Now if you turn to Slide 23, I'll give you an Eagle Ford update. When we had our fourth quarter call, our second well, which is in a gas-condensate area hadn't been completed or tested. We announced the IP rate a few weeks later, and it's a nice well. It tested about 2.9 million a day of gas and 721 barrels of condensate per day. Now the headline, 7.2 million a day equivalent volume is less impressive than Haynesville gas rates. But the liquids content of this well significantly improves the economics of the area. We had a second gas rig in the Eagle Ford program in March. And we're now drilling our third well in the gas condensate area, and we'll continue to develop that part of the play. 
We're also completing our second well in the dry gas area, and assuming a $4 net back gas rolled [ph], this area is not as strong as the gas condensate area, but when prices do turn, this is going to be a really good program for us. We'll probably drill another well or two this year to continue the pilot tested to test this part of the play.
Our key issue for the Eagle Ford is takeaway and processing capacity. And as you know, there's a lot of companies floating potential infrastructure projects. We'll look into the number of those options, and we're also working on some ideas internally. It should favor Tennessee Gas Pipeline. And we don't have anything to announce yet, but we plan to get ahead of our takeaway capacity needs here just as we did in the Haynesville. We've continued to acquire additional acreage in the gas condensate part of the play, and we now have closer to 150,000 net acres overall, with about 80,000 acres of the leases in the gas condensate area.
On Slide 24, there's a chart showing some comparative data between the two areas and our first four wells. The first thing I'd point to you is the difference in the Btu content of the gas between the Briscoe-Nunley, that's the southern dry gas area and the Hixon 1H, that's the northern gas condensate area. And you can see it's a 970 Btu versus 1,368. Also note that condensate is 721 barrels per day on the Hixon. I'll show you the impact of those liquids on the well economics in the next slide. And then finally, in our most recent well, we drilled a 5,000 foot lateral, and we plan to complete this well with an 18-stage frac as we continue to optimize the drilling and completion designs in the play.
Slide 25 shows the economic impact of the liquids on the returns in the Eagle Ford well economics. As I mentioned a moment ago, there's a big difference between the Btu content of the two areas. And the $4 net back gas rolled [ph], the natural gas liquid content improves the value of an Mcf for gas to north of $7. And if you include an average of about 150 barrels of condensate production per million of gas, and note that our initial rate on the Hixon well was at a much higher condensate rate. It was more like 250 barrels per million. But if you assume that 150 barrels per million and you assume $80 oil price, we'd add another $8 of value for every Mcf we produce. 
On the text box at the bottom gives an indication of the returns for dry gas well and the condensate well at $4 and $80 price assumption. And the takeaway is that at low gas pricing, we d expect sort of breakeven returns in the dry gas area and very attractive economics in the gas condensate area, which is why we're rapidly moving into development mode, and a lot of these areas quickly become a core program for us.
Now Slide 26, I'll give you a quick update on our two international programs. Our Camarupim project has three wells producing about 130 million to 140 million a day of gross production. So that's about 30 million to 35 million in net to El Paso. And the fourth well is still expected to be on-stream in the fourth quarter. We've adjusted full year international guidance down by 10 million a day to 35 million to 45 million a day while keeping the total company range unchanged.
And in the same ES-5 block, we and our partners, Petrobras, are drilling an exploratory cast on our Versailles [ph] project. And it's a look-alike prospect to Camarupim and it would be tied back to the Camarupim production facility. Note that we're also drilling that inside the ES-5 block, so we have a 35% working interest in that project versus the 24% unitized interest we have in the Camarupim field.
We continue to make progress in Egypt, with current activity in each of our three blocks. In the South Alamein block, we're drilling our fifth well with the operator Cepsa. In the EP-operated South Mariut Block, we've begun acquisition of the second phase of 3D seismic. And in the RWE-operated Tanta Block, we're evaluating seismic. And we'll decide jointly whether or not we drill a well later this year. 
And finally, Slide 27 provides a snapshot of our drilling program for the year. As you can see, we front-loaded our 2010 rig schedule for some of our more traditional programs. And we did this because we feared the service costs were headed higher, and we wanted to ensure the economics of these wells. We'll soon be down to eight to 10 rigs. That'll be four to five in the Haynesville, two to three in Altamont and one to two in the Eagle Ford. And these are most profitable and most liquidous programs, so that'll be the focus of our capital program for the remainder of the year.
We're going to be pretty fluid between now and year end. If gas prices remain soft and service companies keep trying to increase cost, then we may drop a couple of those rigs and be closer to eight. We'll be disciplined about the capital spending in the current environment. And we'll allocate capital to the programs with the greatest value creation and return potential just as we did last year, and we'll do the same thing this year as well. So that's it for E&P. We exited 2009 with a lot of positive momentum, and we haven't skipped a beat so far this year. With that, I'll turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."
1038355,85200909,60288,"El Paso Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 06, 2010",2010-05-06,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks, Brent.

I hope you see from our results that our businesses are really hitting on all cylinders so far this year. The pipelines continue to exit well on our growth projects, putting close to $1 billion in service during the quarter on time and on budget, starting construction on two projects and receiving approval to start on a third.
We've moved the ball down the field on Ruby toward a summer start to construction, and we continue to add to the backlog in the Marcellus. E&P continues to perform very well, both on the volume and cost fronts. And we continue to add to our position in the Eagle Ford during the quarter. And we made significant progress on the balance sheet with the Mexican asset closing, another MLP drop and the closing of the Ruby project financing.
As we look to the second half of 2010, we continue to monitor gas prices and oilfield services costs closely. We're largely shielded from gas price issues, given the relative stability of our pipeline cash flows and significant hedging in E&P all the way through 2011. In addition, most of our acreage in E&P is held by production, so we have very little need to drill the hole in 2010. So our efforts are to make sure that we maximize returns by allocating capital to the best areas, given the combination of acreage position, commodity pricing and costs.
You see from Brent's presentation that we now plan to focus virtually all of our second half capital on our three most profitable areas: Altamont and Eagle Ford, given their liquids content and Haynesville, given our preferred position there. We are currently planning to cut overall capital relative to our original guidance, which was basically already flat to last year while we've begun to reallocate where it makes sense. And we don't factor our hedges into any incremental capital decisions. Those hedges are there to ensure our cash flows, not to justify drilling. As the rest of industry, we're also very concerned about recent upticks in some service costs, particularly in this natural gas price environment, and we're prepared to cut back at those costs, all in line with the reality of the current gas price environment.
Finally, as I discussed at the beginning of the call, the strong start to the year had us trending toward the high end of our guidance ranges virtually across the board, so we'll be working to sustain that in the balance of the year. With that, we'll open it up to your questions this morning. And let me start by requesting that you limit yourself to a couple of questions, so we can accommodate everybody that's in the queue.

Coming back to the base business, the Backhaul business that we have that's coming out of Marcellus protects us from a lot of downside challenges. Where we are most challenged on TGP is in the midsection of TGP coming up through Kentucky and Ohio. And in all account, it's that section that one would worry about wrecks volumes or Marcellus backing up. But really, in all Kansas [ph] there, we've been challenged since probably 2000 or so. We have significant excess capacity there today, and it's highly, highly competitive in that area. So it's not any -- and backing out of additional business, we don't think is a significant thing relative to that Backhaul business. In addition to that, we saved on fuel, on electricity to run our compression. And we'll just naturally save on operating costs, if that happens downright.

It's one that we have, and we'll spend a lot of time discussing and analyzing internally as we go through the year. We now have two competitors who've announced restructurings of their business in order to unlock what they perceive to be discounts to their stocks. And one of those cases is to be accomplished by essentially moving all of their pipeline and midstream assets into one MLP all at once. And that relieves them of future funding requirements there and highlights their Rockies E&P franchise. And the other, they intend to separate their businesses with a tax-free spin of most of their E&P assets. And each of them, we think, has different drivers. For El Paso, they represent too many possible alternatives, and so we'll watch closely to see whether either or both of those result in differential shareholder value. Here's where we are. The next year for us, it's absolutely critical. We see the discount between our current share price and our NAV as composed really of three components. The first of those relates to the balance sheet. We don't have investment-grade statistics today, and we're in our peak year for capital spending. We think there is some discounts or NAV that's associated with concerns about our ability to adequately fund our Pipeline business and at the same time, fund E&P and our nascent Midstream business. And we believe that as we get rid of those concerns, as we move toward our target of free cash in 2012 and as we move toward our target of investment grade in 2012, there's a significant value accretion to our shareholders. Obviously, yesterday, that was a key day for us in that journey with the closing of the Ruby financing. The second component of discount between our NAV and our share price revolves, we think, around execution. Shareholders want to know that we can put pipeline projects on time and on budget and generate predictable, sustainable earnings growth. We think we have a differentiated track record on this front, and we further that this quarter, putting close to $1 billion in new projects and service. But we know we have to do this with the rest of the backlog. We think as we show that through the balance of this year and into early 2011, our shareholders are going to be rewarded. On the E&P side, we have to show that the performance that we logged in 2009 was continued a trend and was a step function improvement, wasn't a fluke, and we can compete in this business at the high end of returns and at the low end of cost. So putting up 2010 numbers similar to 2009 will go a long way toward eliminating this as a concern. And we think it'll result in going concern value of our E&P franchise being reflected in our share price, so will, by the way, moving our Eagle Ford acreage into development mode as we did with the Haynesville in 2009. And then the third component of the discount is driven by the fact that we are in a pure play. As we sit here today, we don't know what the waiting of those three are. But we do intend to largely eliminate the first two as we put the backlog in service. And as we deliver another good year in E&P, as we bring our Eagle Ford play into full development, as we complete our capital spending overall in 2010 and start to improve our balance sheet, and we intend to do all of that, much of it, in the balance of 2010. So while we intend to continue to monitor the performance of our competitors really closely to see if either of their decisions or some permutation of those decisions could generate excess returns to El Paso investors, we think today, at this red-hot moment, while we're in the middle of the biggest CapEx year in our company's 82-year history and while we're in the midst of what may be the best combined year for our business units is on our shareholders' best interest that we stay laser focused on balance sheet improvement, execution and moving toward positive free cash."

We think it'll continue to be a good formula. If you think about sort of the -- we have always thought that the practical limit in the near term to the growth in our MLP is really the size of the MLP market and the capacity, at least right now, of the retail market to absorb new equity. So if you think about that as J.R. mentioned earlier, kind of $300 million of equity at a time and $50 million debt to cap. That's on the order of $600 million drop at a time. We think we can do more than one of those a year and probably can't do four of those in a year, so somewhere in the one-to-three range in a year given current market conditions. And until we get to the Holy Grail for us, which is investment grade as a company, and until we get to free cash, we think it's pretty simple for us to figure out what we'll do with proceeds.

We’ve talked a lot about execution since our December 10th Analyst Meeting. And, so far in 2010, we’ve delivered on our execution promises, both operationally and financially.
In the pipes, the projects put in service so far this year, the Elba Expansion and the Elba Express Pipeline were both on time and on budget. And at $900 million in total capital, this is a large part of the backlog that you can now check off as successfully completed. 
In a few minutes, Jim will show you that we have more projects to go into service this year, and we think we have a good chance of delivering those projects on time and under budget. 
The Ruby Pipeline, our largest single project in our backlog, just reached another milestone, and is now under construction. As important as this step is though, we now start the critical phase of review, the construction of 675 miles of pipe across the Western US. This is a large complex project, one that will employ 5,000 people at its peak, roughly the same number of folks that work at El Paso in total today. So there is no time to take an early victory lap.
We’ll focus now on executing this project safely, on-time, and on budget, and we have the best team of folks on the job; experienced members of team El Paso as well as a cadre of highly skilled contractors.
On Tennessee Gas Pipeline, last week, we announced yet another expansion, to supporting our customers in the Marcellus unconventional shale play. This isn’t a big one, but cumulatively we now have $1.1 billion in growth capital that will leverage our position right in the heart of this important new resource play.
In E&P, we had another very solid quarter. Production has now risen for the last three quarters and the Haynesville continues to lead the way. Unit cash cost were below our first quarter number. And, you’ll recall that, we lowered our cash cost guidance last quarter. We’ve continued to grow our position in the Eagle Ford, adding more inventory, particularly in the liquids rich portion of the play. 
Our investment strategy in E&P hasn’t changed at all. E&P is leaving within its means, staying focused on continuous improvements in operations, leading to improvements in unit costs, generating good returns, and continuing to grow our inventory of repeatable low-cost, low-risk growth opportunities for the long term.
On the Midstream front, we continue to evaluate potential projects, particularly in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus. None have reached maturity yet, but we continue to look for projects that we provide synergies with our existing business. Eight projects wouldn’t likely come to service before 2012 and wouldn’t cause us to back away from our free cash target in 2012.
On the finance front, our financing needs for 2010 have already been put to bed. We also already have about $200 million of 2011 capital spoken for and will continue to look to grow our MLP in the second half.
Finally, we raised our full-year 2010 guidance today for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $0.90 to $1 a share, up from our original guidance for the year of $0.75 to $0.95. 
With that, I’ll turn the call over to J.R., and comeback at the end, to wrap things up.

As Doug just highlighted, we did have another good quarter and continued success executing on our financing plan. We think our results provide further crew for the benefits of our focus on executive.
So let’s chip right in and talk about the quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.22, which not surprisingly is down slightly from a year-ago. Growth in pipeline earnings and higher E&P production volumes were more than offset by lower natural gas prices including our hedges.
A significant portion of our 2009 gas production was hedged with a floor of $9. Now, our actual GAAP reported earnings for the quarter was $0.21 per diluted share. Items impacting the second quarter include the impact of our E&P hedges, a gain on sale of our Mexican pipeline assets, and the impact of market-to-market on our legacy power book.
In the Pipeline Group, adjusted EBIT increased 11% for the quarter, driven by largely by the impact of expansion projects. Higher reservation revenues from the Elba and expansion in the Elba Express Pipeline that went into service earlier this year, as well as the expansion project that went into service late last year, led our growth.
In addition, pipeline results also benefited from an increase in AFUDC or allowance used for funds during construction on the capital employed and our pipeline expansion projects that are not yet in service. The AFUDC is reflecting in both EBIT as well as a reduction of interest expense in our result. 
In E&P, adjusted EBIT declined from a year-ago, primarily due to lower natural gas prices including our hedges. 
Interest expense was higher for the quarter, mostly due to debt associated with the Ruby Pipeline Project, as well as a one-time adjustment to AFUDC to reflect the lower interest rates we achieved on the Ruby Project financing and the final capital structure expected for the project.
Let’s shift gears and talk about operating cash flow and capital investment. Our capital plan remained on track. This roughly $4 billion capital budget and $1.6 billion spend to date, activity and spending levels will be considerably higher in the second half, driven by construction of the Ruby Pipeline.
On the E&P side, despite continuing to fight the headwinds of service cost increases, we remained focused on lending within our means. If you’ll recall, we front loaded a portion of our 2010 capital program to get out ahead of some of the expected cost increases. Brent, will give you an update on what we are doing to proactively manage AFE cost increases.
Our liquidity remains very strong. There’s $2.7 billion available at the end of the July. Now, this does not include the $1.5 billion Ruby Project financing that will be used to fund the construction of the pipeline.
Finally, cash flow from operations for the quarter was below last year’s level, again due largely to lower commodity prices including our hedges.
Successfully managing commodity price risk is an important element when we talk about financial execution. We’ve got a disciplined approach to price risk management, it’s the responsibility of our Price Risk Management Committee. Brent, Mark, Dave Whitehead the Head of our Strategy, and me sit on that committee. This Group meets weekly to discuss market conditions and oversee the execution of our hedging strategy. 
So let’s take a look at our 2010 and 2011 hedge positions on slide seven. By the way as a side note, our 2010 hedge positions contributed about a $100 million to cash flows in the second quarter alone.
As you can see from the slide, about 75% of our domestic natural gas production is hedged for the remainder of 2010 at just over $6. We added modestly to our fourth quarter position since our last call, when market conditions permitted. While some of our peers have 2010 hedge positions comparable to ours, we think our 2011 positions lead the pack.
We’ve got about 65% of our domestic natural gas production hedged in 2011 with a $6 floor. We think this syncs up well with our pipeline expansion backlog, the majority of which is expected to be placed in service by late 2011.
Now, going forward, you should expect us to continue to prudently manage commodity price risk, to protect our balance sheet and cash flows.
Let me wrap up my remarks today with just a couple of additional comments on our financing plan. In our security, $2.5 billion of funding came like a really big challenge to many when we announced our 2010 capital program back in December. But we had a good planning and then we have confidence in our ability to execute against that plan.
As Doug mentioned, we reached our $2.5 billion target during the quarter. As a result, our focus immediately shifted to 2011 and the far more modest level of funding needed to meet our 2011 capital needs. In fact, the $2.7 billion of financings completed this year, we’ve got a substantial start on 2011. In addition, we may meet our 2011 needs, our focus will remain on advancing the longer-term improvement in our balance sheet. 
As for the MLP, well, I think as Doug indicated, we’ll continue to grow the MLP. Recently, I met with an investor who asked me a similar, what about the MLP question this way. He said, “J.R., you’ve completed two drop-downs to the MLP this year. Are you done? Or is the peddle still to the metal?” I’ll tell you the same thing I told him. “We have not let our foot off the accelerator.” We will continue to execute our drop-down strategy, because it’s value enhancing for both El Paso and El Paso Pipeline Partners. Bottom-line, you should expect us to stay the course with EPB. 
That’s my update for you this morning. We’re very pleased with the financial performance for the company so far this year, and are happy to have completed our 2010 financing plan early.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jim, for an update on the Pipeline Group.

Going around the horn, throughput is up a little on TGP and the Northeast, it’s up a lot in the Southeast due to a cold winter and hot summer. It’s down in the Southwest, partially due to the economy. And then, on our Rockies space, due to lower production, which has now started to recover over the last few months.
Overall, these throughput changes, both up and down, had only a smaller impact on our revenues, because of the reservation charge nature of our business. Over 80% of our revenue comes from monthly reservation charges. But we are watching closely a couple of throughput items.
First, on TGP, there’s been a significant change in the sourcing of supplies, proceeds from Marcellus and Rex in Ohio, together are up over 800 a day year-to-year. These receipts have displaced imports from Canada at Niagara and long-haul volumes from the Gulf Coast. So capacity utilization has declined through the middle part of TDP system. And we’re watching the impact of this on short-term volumes and rates, fuel usage, and our O&M costs.
Second, our EPNG, the decline in throughput is somewhat of function of the economy in the Southwest, but it’s also a result of the increased imports into California, both from LNG arriving at Costa Azul and indirectly imports from Canada. It’s not clear one of these trends on EPNG are temporary or more long lived. But, in combination, that resulted in lower freight rates available on short-term capacity sales on EPNG. And we filed a rate case on EPNG this fall for new rates to be effective next spread.
On Ruby, we’ve received FERCs and BLMs construction underway. Obviously, this is a major milestone. It results from a 2.5 year process involving a comprehensive review by BLM, FERC, and various Federal, state, and local agencies. In fact, this is one of the most extensive records we’ve seen in the new pipeline application. Hundreds of thousands of pages of comments were filed by various groups and they’re been addressed one by one. The agencies have carefully balanced stakeholder issues with a need for this important infrastructure project.
Now, we’re focused on delivering Ruby on-time and on budget for the benefit of markets on the West Coast and Rockies producers. Relative to our original planning a two years ago, construction is starting two months later than planned. We’ve adjusted by adding an additional construction spread in one of the more not necessaries to complete that section before winter. So there’ll now be eight spreads working on Ruby simultaneously. And, as Doug mentioned, 5,000 workers.
We’re also likely to reconfigure our spread deploying it in the western section of the Erath, also to make up some time. We’re focused on delivering Ruby for in-service next spread.
On side 13, Marcellus - Marcellus continues to be a very exciting new area for us. Over 700 a day of Marcellus gas is not flowing into TGP, it’s flowing under a variety of transportation arrangements, including firm backhauls that ramp-up overtime and they’ll bring in about $60 million of annual revenue by 2012, all requiring very little new capital.
And we now have in the backlog three, four, haul expansions amounting to over $1 billion of investment. These three projects are essentially all fully subscribed under long-term contracts. Construction’s underway on the first of these, the line 300 Expansion and we’re starting into the regulatory approval process on the other two.
Our success in the Marcellus is obviously the result of having existing infrastructure in the area, but the magnitude of this opportunity is a pleasant surprise for us. 
Turning to slide 14, we’re focused across the country on executing on our large backlog. You’re aware that we placed them service, our Elba projects on-time and on budget. In fact, the Elba Tank was placed on service July 1, a month ahead of schedule.
Three more projects still in service later this year. They’re all well along now in construction at their own schedule. I’ll be very surprised that if they’re not completed at low budget.
The backlog projects as a group have been significantly de-risked, while some involve Greenfield construction, some are straight-forward pipeline and looping and compression upgrades of existing systems.
The pipe has been purchased for all these projects. All the construction contracts are in place. They’re either fixed price arrangements or unit priced in which the contractor varies the productivity risk or has significant productivity incentives.
And, finally, in terms of de-risking, in total, the backlog is approximately 90% subscribed under long-term contracts with high-quality customers.
So, in summary, the pipes had another strong quarter, and we have our heads down and are executing on our growth projects. 
And now, I’ll turn it over to Brent.

1038355,85200914,72124,"El Paso Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks Jim. Good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter of financial and operating results in the E&P Company. Our production increased to 788 million a day, while we kept our cash costs low at a $1.77 per Mcf equivalent.And, as I noted in our",1414,"Thanks Jim. Good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter of financial and operating results in the E&P Company. Our production increased to 788 million a day, while we kept our cash costs low at a $1.77 per Mcf equivalent.
And, as I noted in our last call, we tend to run a very focused-driven program in the second half of the year, and we’re devoting capital to the programs and off with the highest returns and we’re leaving within our 2010 capital plan.
So in the second half of the year, we’ll operate eight rigs in our core programs. There will be four in the Haynesville, two in the Eagle Ford, both of those would be being in the liquids rich area and two in the Altamont.
I’m sure most of you are aware that the pressure pumping and the stimulation services have been tight and the costs have been going up. Last year, we had really good coordination with our frac crews and led the onsite, ready to begin the frac work soon after we finished drilling the well, and that hasn’t been the case lately. And, like others in the industry, we’ve developed a backlog of Haynesville wells that are been drilled and are awaiting on completion.
In response, we’ve recently entered long-term agreements for stimulation services in all three core programs, which will help us improve our cycle time and it’ll give us costs certainty on our future drilling programs. 
Internationally, we’ve drilled successful wells in Brazil and Egypt in the quarter. In Brazil, we drilled an exploration discovery with Petrobras in the ES-5 block, that’s the block where our Camarupim project is located. And we [inaudible] and we’re working with Petrobras to design a production test. Given success would ultimately tieback to the floating production facility that’s on the Camarupim production and El Paso will have a 35% working interest in the project.
In Egypt, we drilled a well in the South Alamein block with SEPSA that also had very encouraging shows. We’re not currently drilling in that block, we’ll take some time off to assess our results today, and then likely begin a phase of drilling in the block later this year.
Total production was up versus the second quarter of 2009, with much of the growth in the Central region, which includes our Haynesville program. That trends visible on the left side of the chart on slide 17, and on the right side, you can see that we’ve added roughly 50 million a day of production over the past three quarters, again largely from the Haynesville program. 
In Q2, we continue to trend near the high-end of our full-year production guidance. So going forward, we raised our lower end of our range to 760 million a day. We maintained the high end of the target range of 780 million a day for several regions. First, we’ve factored in the production uncertainties of the Petrobras-operated Camarupim build in Brazil. 
Second, we’re running two rigs in the second half of the year which is again consistent with our 2010 capital plan, but it’ll be harder to hold the current levels of production with lower activity levels. And then, finally, we’ve got more uncertainty regarding the - when the wells in our Haynesville backlog will come on line. And we expect those wells to produce in the 15 million to 20 million a day range initially, so the timing of first production on those wells really matters. Looking back, though, we had good production results in Q2 with exceptional performance from our domestic divisions.
I’ll now turn to the Haynesville. And, as Doug noted, this program just continuous to exceed our expectations. On slide 18, you can see that our net production has risen by more than 100 million a day since the second quarter of 2009. We now have about 13 wells that have been drilled and are waiting on completion, so we’ve got line of sight for continued production growth, although at a lower growth rate than we’ve seen so far.
Now, we continue to look for ways to mitigate our service cost that I mentioned earlier and we’ve blocked in rates for the next two years from much of our projected pressure-pumping needs. We also continue to chip away our drilling times. Our current best pace is 22 days from spud to TD. And we see a few companies that are below 30 days, but none to our knowledge that are in the 20s, so we’re definitely setting the standard for drilling performance in the play. And, maybe more important, our average well production is as good as any operator in the play. So we benefit from having a great lease hold position in the Haynesville, but our teams also have done a terrific job of continuously improving the program and delivering great results.
Our Eagle Ford program continued to perform well during the quarter also. Since our last call, we’ve expanded our acreage position as Doug mentioned and has completed three very good wells. Two of the wells were in our Northern area, and both of them had very high oil content, and they both exceeded our pre-drill expectations.
The map on slide 19 shows our Eagle Ford acreage relative to the dry gas and the liquids rich areas. We ran another 5,000 net acres which brings our total position to a 170,000. We’ve not included those newest lands on the map, since we’re still attempting the lease in those areas. But the new acreage is generally north of our LaSalle county position on the oilier side of the play. We’re currently completing two wells, one each in each year, and I will keep two rigs running in the liquids rich area for the remainder of the year.
Although, we’ve got a smaller backlog of completions in this program, we’ve also secured long-term contract with stimulation services in the play. And, again, that’s going to give us clarity on our cost, equipment, crew availability, and it's going to shorten our cycle times. 
And, as I mentioned before, we plan to further wrap up our Eagle Ford program in 2011. And, although we don’t have an approved budget yet, we have a significant inventory here to develop, and this is currently one of our most economic programs. Given higher relative oil prices, Altamont-Bluebell continues to be a very economic program also. 
Slide 20 shows, how we’ve grown total net production volumes over the last three plus years. Year-to-date, we’ve averaged over 7,500 barrels a day net, and we’ve recently produced over 10,000 barrels a day on a given since we brought on some relatively high rate new completions. 
Now, this is an older more mature old field, where improving execution is the name of the game. And, this year, we’ve continued to reduce drilling times and cost, and while at the same time, improving our initial producing rates. And we’ve made great strides in reducing our lifting cost here. Year-to-date LOE is almost 20% lower than the first half of 2009 and less than $0.13 a barrel or so, which is good, considering the depth of the wells and the waxy nature of the crew.
Overall, we’re pleased with the success of the program. But, as we met with investors and analysts in recent months, it’s become clear that Altamont is probably the least well known and the well understood of our core capital programs. And, given that, we have over 800 locations and over a 100 million barrels of recoverable oil potential, we need to have a better job of explaining the program. So our plan is to host a conference call that’s devoted to Altamont sometime in the fall.
So let me conclude by saying that, I’m really pleased with the execution of our teams. We’ve developed a deep drilling inventory and we’ve continued to focus on improving in all aspects of our operations in our capital program execution. We’re carefully allocating our capital for the programs that create the greatest value. And, although our Eagle Ford and Altamont programs don’t offer the same high equivalent gas rates as the Haynesville wells, the economics of these two programs are strong and that’s primarily due to oil prices and to a lesser degree to the higher liquids pricing.
So we’ll continue to focus capital on these three core programs for the balance of the year.
And, I’ll turn it back to Doug, for his final comments.

So what our plan is we’ll take those three pilot wells and everybody else’s industry data and we’ll assess the gas window, we’ll focus to the rest of the year and beginning of next year on the oilier side.

We're excited to follow up a successful first quarter with another very good performance in Q2. We've talked a lot about execution since our December 10 analyst meeting and so far in 2010, we've delivered on our execution promises both operationally and financially.
In the pipes, the projects put in service so far this year, the Elba expansion and the Elba Express Pipeline, were both on time and on budget. And at $900 million in total capital, this is a large part of the backlog that you can now check off as successfully completed. 
In a few minutes, Jim will show you that we have more projects to go into service this year, and we think we have a good chance of delivering those projects on time and under budget. The Ruby Pipeline, the largest single project in our backlog, just reached another major milestone and is now under construction. As important as this step is though, we now start the critical phase of Ruby: the construction of 675 miles of pipe across the Western U.S. This is a large, complex project, one that will employ 5,000 people at its peak, roughly the same number of folks that work at El Paso in total today. So there's no time to take an early victory lap. We're focused now on executing this project safely, on time and on budget, and we have the best team of folks on the job, experienced members of team El Paso, as well as a cadre of highly skilled contractors.
On Tennessee Gas Pipeline. Last week, we announced yet another expansion to support our customers in the Marcellus unconventional shale play. This isn't a big one, but cumulatively, we now have $1.1 billion in growth capital that will leverage our position right in the heart of this important new resource play. 
In E&P, we had another very solid quarter. Production has now risen for the last three quarters, and the Haynesville continues to lead the way. Unit cash costs were below our first quarter number, and you'll recall that we lowered our cash cost guidance last quarter. We've continued to grow our position in the Eagle Ford, adding more inventory particularly in the liquids-rich portion of the play. Our investment strategy in E&P hasn't changed at all. E&P's living within its means, staying focused on continuous improvements in operations leading to improvements in unit costs, generating good returns and continuing to grow our inventory of repeatable, low-cost, low-risk growth opportunities for the long term.
On the midstream front. We continue to evaluate potential projects, particularly in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus. None have reached maturity yet, but we continue to look for projects that provide synergies with our existing business. Any projects wouldn't likely come into service before 2012 and wouldn't cause us to back away from our free cash target in 2012.
On the finance front. Our financing needs for 2010 have already been put to bed. We also already have about $200 million of 2011 capital spoken for, and we'll continue to look to grow our MLP in the second half. 
Finally, we raised our full year 2010 guidance today for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $0.90 to $1 a share, up from our original guidance for the year of $0.75 to $0.95. With that, I'll turn the call over to J.R. and come back at the end to wrap things up."

As Doug just highlighted, we did have another good quarter and continued success executing on our financing plan. We think our results provide further proof of the benefits of our focus on execution. So let's jump right in",1008,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning. As Doug just highlighted, we did have another good quarter and continued success executing on our financing plan. We think our results provide further proof of the benefits of our focus on execution. So let's jump right in and talk about the quarter.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.22, which not surprisingly is down slightly from a year ago. Growth in pipeline earnings and higher E&P production volumes were more than offset by lower natural gas prices, including our hedges. A significant portion of our 2009 gas production was hedged with a floor of $9. Now our actual GAAP reported earnings for the quarter was $0.21 per diluted share. Items impacting the second quarter include the impact of our E&P hedges, a gain on sale of our Mexican pipeline assets and the impact of mark-to-market on our legacy power book. 
In the Pipeline Group, adjusted EBIT increased 11% for the quarter, driven largely by the impact of expansion projects. Higher reservation revenues from the Elba Island expansion and the Elba Express Pipeline that went into service earlier this year, as well as expansion projects that went into service late last year led our growth. In addition, pipeline results also benefited from an increase of AFUDC, or allowance used for funds during construction, on the capital employed in our pipeline expansion projects that are not yet in service. AFUDC is reflected in both EBIT, as well as a reduction of interest expense in our results. 
In E&P, adjusted EBIT declined from a year ago, primarily due to lower natural gas prices including our hedges. Interest expense was higher for the quarter, mostly due to debt associated with the Ruby Pipeline project, as well as a one-time adjustment to AFUDC to reflect the lower interest rates we achieved on the Ruby project financing and the final capital structure expected for the project.
Let's shift gears and talk about operating cash flow and capital investment. Our capital plan remains on track. With roughly $4 billion capital budget and $1.6 billion spent to date, activity and spending levels will be considerably higher in the second half, driven by construction of the Ruby Pipeline. 
On the E&P side, despite continuing to fight the headwinds of service cost increases, we remain focused on living within our means. If you recall, we front-loaded a portion of our 2010 capital program to get out ahead of some of the expected cost increases. Brent'll give you an update on what we're doing to proactively manage E&P cost increases. Our liquidity remains very strong with $2.7 billion available at the end of the July. Now this does not include the $1.5 billion Ruby project financing that will be used to fund the construction of the pipeline. 
Finally, cash flow from operations for the quarter was below last year's level, again due largely to lower commodity prices including our hedges. You know, successfully managing commodity price risk is an important element when we talk about financial execution. We've got a disciplined approach to price risk management, the responsibility of our price risk management committee. Brent; Mark; Dane Whitehead, the head of our strategy; and me sit on that committee. This group meets weekly to discuss market conditions and oversee the execution of our hedging strategy. 
So let's take a look at our 2010 and 2011 hedge positions on Slide 7. By the way, as a sidenote, our 2010 hedge positions contributed about $100 million to cash flows in the second quarter alone. As you can see from the slide, about 75% of our domestic natural gas production is hedged for the remainder of 2010 at just over $6. We added modestly to our fourth quarter position since our last call when market conditions permitted. While some of our peers have 2010 hedge positions comparable to ours, we think our 2011 positions lead the pack. We've got about 65% of our domestic natural gas production hedged in 2011 with a $6 floor. We think this syncs up well with our pipeline expansion backlog, the majority of which is expected to be placed in service by late 2011. Now going forward, you should expect us to continue to prudently manage commodity price risk to protect our balance sheet and cash flows. 
Let me wrap up my remarks today with just a couple of additional comments on our financing plan. You know, securing $2.5 billion of funding seemed like a really big challenge to many when we announced our 2010 capital program back in December. But we had a good plan, and we have confidence in our ability to execute against that plan. As Doug mentioned, we reached our $2.5 billion target during the quarter. As a result, our focus immediately shifted to 2011 and the far more modest level of funding needed to meet our 2011 capital needs. In fact, with $2.7 billion of financings completed this year, we've got a substantial start on 2011. In addition to meeting our 2011 needs, our focus will remain on advancing the longer-term improvement in our balance sheet. 
As for the MLP. Well, I think as Doug indicated, we'll continue to grow the MLP. Now recently, I met with an investor who asked me a similar ""what about the MLP"" question this way: he said, ""J.R., you've completed two drop downs to the MLP this year. Are you done? Or is the pedal still to the metal?"" I'll tell you the same thing I told him. We have not let our foot off the accelerator. We will continue to execute on our drop down strategy because it's value enhancing for both El Paso and El Paso Pipeline Partners. Bottom line, you should expect us to stay the course with EPB.
That's my update for you this morning. We're very pleased with the financial performance of the company so far this year, and are happy to have completed our 2010 financing plan early. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the Pipeline Group."

Adjusted EBIT was up 11% from second quarter 2009 after backing out the gain from the sale of our Mexican business. As J.R. said, essentially all of this increase resulted from our expansion programs.
We continue to execute well on our growth projects. We started construction on four additional projects this quarter as planned. And this is in addition to three others that are well underway: SNG South System Expansion, FGT's Phase 8 and the Gulf LNG terminal. And we were successful in adding another project to our growth backlog, our third expansion out of Marcellus. As Doug said, we've now committed to over $1 billion of Marcellus expansions. 
Slide 11 shows a snapshot of our throughput, and it reflects the overall economy, weather and changes in supply sources. Going around the horn, throughput is up a little on TGP in the Northeast; it's up a lot in the Southeast due to a cold winter and hot summer; it's down in the Southwest partially due to the economy; and down on our Rockies pipes due to lower production, which has now started to recover over the last few months. Overall, these throughput changes, both up and down, had only a small impact on our revenues because of the reservation charge nature of our business. Over 80% of our revenue comes from monthly reservation charges. But we are watching closely a couple of throughput items.
First, on TGP. There's been a significant change in the sourcing of supplies. Receipts from Marcellus and REX in Ohio together are up over 800 a day, year-to-year. These receipts have displaced imports from Canada at Niagara and long-haul volumes from the Gulf Coast. So capacity utilization has declined through the middle part of TGP's system, and we're watching the impact of this on short-term volumes and rates, fuel usage and our O&M costs.
Second, on EPNG. The decline in throughput is somewhat a function of the economy in the Southwest, but it's also a result of the increased imports into California, both from LNG arriving at Costa Azul and, indirectly, imports from Canada. It's not clear whether these trends on EPNG are temporary or more long-lived, but in combination, they've resulted in lower freight rates available on short-term capacity sales on EPNG. And we're likely to file a rate case on EPNG this fall for new rates to be effective next spring.
On Ruby, we've received FERC's and BLM's notice to proceed with construction, and we're under way. Obviously, this is a major milestone. It results from a two and a half year process involving a comprehensive review by BLM, FERC and various federal, state and local agencies. In fact, this is one of the most extensive records we've seen in a new pipeline application. Hundreds of thousands of pages of comments were filed by various groups, and they've been addressed one by one. The agencies have carefully balanced stakeholder issues with the need for this important infrastructure project.
Now we're focused on delivering Ruby on time and on budget for the benefit of markets on the West Coast and Rockies producers. Relative to our original planning of two years ago, construction is starting two months later than planned. We've adjusted by adding an additional construction spread in one of the more mountainous areas to complete that section before winter. So there'll now be eight spreads working on Ruby simultaneously, and as Doug mentioned, 5,000 workers. We're also likely to reconfigure our spread deployment in the western section of the route, also to makeup some time. We're focused on delivering Ruby for in service next spring. 
On Slide 13, Marcellus. Marcellus continues to be a very exciting new area for us. Over 700 a day of Marcellus gas is now flowing into TGP. It's flowing under a variety of transportation arrangements, including firm backhauls that ramp up over time and will bring in about $60 million of annual revenue by 2012, all requiring very little new capital. And we now have in the backlog three Ford haul expansions amounting to over $1 billion of investment. These three projects are essentially all fully subscribed under long-term contracts. Construction is underway on the first of these, the Line 300 expansion, and we're starting into the regulatory approval process on the other two. Our success in the Marcellus is obviously the result of having existing infrastructure in the area, but the magnitude of this opportunity is a pleasant surprise for us.
Turning to Slide 14. We're focused across the country on executing on our large backlog. You're aware that we placed in service our Elba projects on-time and on budget. In fact, the Elba tank was placed in service July 1, a month ahead of schedule. Three more projects still in service later this year. They're all well along now in construction and are on schedule. I'd be very surprised if they're not completed below budget.
The backlog projects as a group has been significantly de-risked. While some involve greenfield construction, some are straightforward pipeline looping and compression upgrades of existing systems. The pipe has been purchased for all these projects. All the construction contracts are in place. They are either fixed-price arrangements or unit priced, in which the contractor bears the productivity risk or has significant productivity incentives. And finally in terms of de-risking, in total, the backlog is approximately 90% subscribed under long-term contracts with high-quality customers.
So in summary, the pipes had another strong quarter, and we have our heads down and are executing on our growth projects. And now I'll turn it over to Brent."

We had another solid quarter of financial and operating results in the E&P Company. Production increased to 788 million a day, while we kept our cash cost low at $1.77 per Mcf equivalent.Now as I've noted in our last",1408,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter of financial and operating results in the E&P Company. Production increased to 788 million a day, while we kept our cash cost low at $1.77 per Mcf equivalent.
Now as I've noted in our last call, we plan to run a very focused drilling program in the second half of the year. We're developing capital to the programs that offer the highest returns, and we're living within our 2010 capital plan. So in the second half of the year, we'll operate eight rigs in our core programs. That'll be four in the Haynesville; two in the Eagle Ford, both of those will be in the liquids-rich area; and two in the Altamont.
I'm sure most of you are aware that the pressure pumping and stimulation services have been tight, and the costs have been going up. Last year, we had really good coordination with our frac crews, and they'd be on-site ready to begin the frac work soon after we finished drilling the well, and that hadn't been the case lately. Like others in industry, we've developed a backlog of Haynesville wells that have been drilled and are waiting on completion. In response though, we've recently entered into the long-term agreements for stimulation services in all three core programs, which will help us improve our cycle time. And it will give us cost certainty on our future drilling programs. 
Internationally, we've drilled successful wells in Brazil and Egypt in the quarter. In Brazil, we drilled an exploration discovery with Petrobras in the ES-5 block. That's the block where our Camarupin project is located. We logged apparent gas petty [ph] (00:30:18) and we're working with Petrobras to design a production test. Given success, we'd ultimately tie back to the floating production facility that's handling the Camarupin production, and El Paso will have a 35% working interest in the project. In Egypt, we drilled a well in the South Alamein block with Cepsa that also had very encouraging shows. We're not currently drilling in that block. We'll take some time off to assess our results to date, and then we'll likely begin appraisal drilling in the block later this year. 
Total production was up versus the second quarter of 2009, with much of the growth in the Central region, which includes our Haynesville program. That trend's visible on the left side of the chart on Slide 17, and on the right side you can see that we've added roughly 50 million a day of production over the past three quarters, again largely from the Haynesville program.
Through Q2, we continue to trend near the high end of our full year production guidance. So going forward, we've raised our lower end of our range to 760 million a day. But we maintain the high end of the target range at 780 million a day for several reasons. First, we factored in the production uncertainties of the Petrobras-operated Camarupin field in Brazil. Second, we're running fewer rigs in the second half of the year, which is again consistent with our 2010 capital plan. But it'll be harder to hold the current levels of production with lower activity levels. And then finally, we've got more uncertainty regarding when the wells in our Haynesville backlog will come online. And we expect those wells to produce in the 15 million to 20 million a day range initially, so the timing of first production on those wells really matters. Looking back, though, we had good production results in Q2, with exceptional performance from our domestic divisions.
I'll now turn to the Haynesville. And as Doug noted, this program just continues to exceed our expectations. On Slide 18, you can see that our net production has risen by more than 100 million a day since the second quarter of 2009. We now have about 13, over 13 wells that have been drilled and are waiting on completion. So we've got good line of sight for continued production growth, although at a lower growth rate than we've seen so far.
We continue to look for ways to mitigate our service cost that I mentioned earlier, and we've locked in rates for the next two years for much of our projected pressure pumping needs. We also continue to chip away at drilling times. Our current best pace is 22 days from spud to TD. And we see a few companies that are below 30 days, but none to our knowledge that are in the low 20s. So we're definitely setting the standard for drilling performance in the play. And maybe more important, our average well production is as good as any operator in the play. So we benefit from having a great leasehold position in the Haynesville. But our team's also done a terrific job of continuously improving the program and delivering great results.
Our Eagle Ford program continued to perform well during the quarter also. Since our last call, we've expanded our acreage position, as Doug mentioned, and we've completed three very good wells. Two of the wells are in the northern area. Both of them had very high oil content, and they both exceeded our pre-drill expectations.
The map on Slide 19 shows our Eagle Ford acreage relative to the dry gas and the liquid-rich areas. We've added another 5,000 net acres, which brings our total positioning to 170,000. We've not included those newest lands on the map, since we're still attempting to lease in those areas. But the new acreage is generally north of our LaSalle County position on the oilier side of play. We're currently completing two wells, one in each area, and I will keep two rigs running in the liquids-rich area for the remainder of the year.
And although we've got a smaller backlog of completions in this program, we've also secured long-term contracts for stimulation services in the play. And again, that's going to get us clarity on our cost, equipment, crew availability, and it's going to shorten our cycle times. As I've mentioned before, we plan to further ramp up our Eagle Ford program in 2011. And although we don't have an approved budget yet, we have a significant inventory here to develop, and this is currently one of our most economic programs. 
Given higher relative oil prices, Altamont-Bluebell continues to be a very economic program also. Slide 20 shows how we've grown total net production volumes over the last three plus years. Year-to-date, we've averaged over 7,500 barrels a day net. And we've recently produced over 10,000 barrels a day on a given day because we've brought on some relatively high-rate new completions.
Now this is an older, more material oil field where improving execution's the name of the game. And this year, we've continued to reduce drilling times and costs, and while at the same time improving our initial producing rates. And we've made great strides in reducing our lifting costs here. Year to date LOE is almost 20% lower than the first half of 2009 and less than $13 a barrel or so, which is good considering the depth of the wells and the waxy nature of the crude. 
Overall, we're pleased with the success of the program. But as we've investors and analysts in recent months, it's become clear that Altamont is probably the least well known and the least well understood of our core capital programs. And given that we have over 800 locations and over 100 million barrels of recoverable oil potential, we need to do a better job of explaining the program. So our plan is to host a conference call that's devoted to Altamont sometime in the fall.
So let me conclude by saying that I'm really pleased with the execution of our teams. We've developed a deep drilling inventory, and we continue to focus on improving in all aspects of our operations and our capital program execution. We're carefully allocating our capital for the programs that create the greatest value, and although our Eagle Ford and Altamont programs don't offer the same high equivalent gas rates as the Haynesville wells, the economics of these two programs are strong. And that's primarily due to oil prices and, to a lesser degree, to the higher liquids pricing. So we'll continue to focus capital on these three core programs for the balance of the year. And I'll turn back to Doug for his final comments."

And that -- I think that's largely because we've managed to front-load, as J.R. said, our capital program into the first half of the year before they started increasing as much, and then partly because we've locked the services in longer term. So we've got our rigs currently contracted at least through the end of this year and some into next year. And then we've got stimulation contracts now for the three core programs that are two-year contracts. So they go from kind of midyear this year to a midyear 2012.

We're excited to follow up a successful first quarter with another very good performance in Q2. We've talked a lot about execution since our December 10 analyst meeting and so far in 2010, we've delivered on our execution",576,"Thanks, Bruce, and good morning. We're excited to follow up a successful first quarter with another very good performance in Q2. We've talked a lot about execution since our December 10 analyst meeting and so far in 2010, we've delivered on our execution promises both operationally and financially.
In the pipes, the projects put in service so far this year, the Elba expansion and the Elba Express Pipeline, were both on time and on budget. And at $900 million in total capital, this is a large part of the backlog that you can now check off as successfully completed. 
In a few minutes, Jim will show you that we have more projects to go into service this year, and we think we have a good chance of delivering those projects on time and under budget. The Ruby Pipeline, the largest single project in our backlog, just reached another major milestone and is now under construction. As important as this step is though, we now start the critical phase of Ruby: the construction of 675 miles of pipe across the Western U.S. This is a large, complex project, one that will employ 5,000 people at its peak, roughly the same number of folks that work at El Paso in total today. So there's no time to take an early victory lap. We're focused now on executing this project safely, on time and on budget, and we have the best team of folks on the job, experienced members of team El Paso, as well as a cadre of highly skilled contractors.
On Tennessee Gas Pipeline. Last week, we announced yet another expansion to support our customers in the Marcellus unconventional shale play. This isn't a big one, but cumulatively, we now have $1.1 billion in growth capital that will leverage our position right in the heart of this important new resource play. 
In E&P, we had another very solid quarter. Production has now risen for the last three quarters, and the Haynesville continues to lead the way. Unit cash costs were below our first quarter number, and you'll recall that we lowered our cash cost guidance last quarter. We've continued to grow our position in the Eagle Ford, adding more inventory particularly in the liquids-rich portion of the play. Our investment strategy in E&P hasn't changed at all. E&P's living within its means, staying focused on continuous improvements in operations leading to improvements in unit costs, generating good returns and continuing to grow our inventory of repeatable, low-cost, low-risk growth opportunities for the long term.
On the midstream front. We continue to evaluate potential projects, particularly in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus. None have reached maturity yet, but we continue to look for projects that provide synergies with our existing business. Any projects wouldn't likely come into service before 2012 and wouldn't cause us to back away from our free cash target in 2012.
On the finance front. Our financing needs for 2010 have already been put to bed. We also already have about $200 million of 2011 capital spoken for, and we'll continue to look to grow our MLP in the second half. 
Finally, we raised our full year 2010 guidance today for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $0.90 to $1 a share, up from our original guidance for the year of $0.75 to $0.95. With that, I'll turn the call over to J.R. and come back at the end to wrap things up."

As Doug just highlighted, we did have another good quarter and continued success executing on our financing plan. We think our results provide further proof of the benefits of our focus on execution. So let's jump right in",1009,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning. As Doug just highlighted, we did have another good quarter and continued success executing on our financing plan. We think our results provide further proof of the benefits of our focus on execution. So let's jump right in and talk about the quarter.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.22, which not surprisingly is down slightly from a year ago. Growth in pipeline earnings and higher E&P production volumes were more than offset by lower natural gas prices, including our hedges. A significant portion of our 2009 gas production was hedged with a floor of $9. Now our actual GAAP reported earnings for the quarter was $0.21 per diluted share. Items impacting the second quarter include the impact of our E&P hedges, a gain on sale of our Mexican pipeline assets and the impact of mark-to-market on our legacy power book. 
In the Pipeline Group, adjusted EBIT increased 11% for the quarter, driven largely by the impact of expansion projects. Higher reservation revenues from the Elba Island expansion and the Elba Express Pipeline that went into service earlier this year, as well as expansion projects that went into service late last year led our growth. In addition, pipeline results also benefited from an increase of AFUDC, or allowance used for funds during construction, on the capital employed in our pipeline expansion projects that are not yet in service. AFUDC is reflected in both EBIT, as well as a reduction of interest expense in our results. 
In E&P, adjusted EBIT declined from a year ago, primarily due to lower natural gas prices including our hedges. Interest expense was higher for the quarter, mostly due to debt associated with the Ruby Pipeline project, as well as a onetime adjustment to AFUDC to reflect the lower interest rates we achieved on the Ruby project financing and the final capital structure expected for the project.
Let's shift gears and talk about operating cash flow and capital investment. Our capital plan remains on track. With roughly $4 billion capital budget and $1.6 billion spent to date, activity and spending levels will be considerably higher in the second half, driven by construction of the Ruby Pipeline. 
On the E&P side, despite continuing to fight the headwinds of service cost increases, we remain focused on living within our means. If you recall, we front-loaded a portion of our 2010 capital program to get out ahead of some of the expected cost increases. Brent will give you an update on what we're doing to proactively manage E&P cost increases. Our liquidity remains very strong with $2.7 billion available at the end of the July. Now this does not include the $1.5 billion Ruby project financing that will be used to fund the construction of the pipeline. 
Finally, cash flow from operations for the quarter was below last year's level, again due largely to lower commodity prices including our hedges. You know, successfully managing commodity price risk is an important element when we talk about financial execution. We've got a disciplined approach to price risk management, the responsibility of our price risk management committee. Brent; Mark; Dane Whitehead, the head of our strategy; and me sit on that committee. This group meets weekly to discuss market conditions and oversee the execution of our hedging strategy. 
So let's take a look at our 2010 and 2011 hedge positions on Slide 7. By the way, as a sidenote, our 2010 hedge positions contributed about $100 million to cash flows in the second quarter alone. As you can see from the slide, about 75% of our domestic natural gas production is hedged for the remainder of 2010 at just over $6. We added modestly to our fourth quarter position since our last call when market conditions permitted. While some of our peers have 2010 hedge positions comparable to ours, we think our 2011 positions lead the pack. We've got about 65% of our domestic natural gas production hedged in 2011 with a $6 floor. We think this syncs up well with our pipeline expansion backlog, the majority of which is expected to be placed in service by late 2011. Now going forward, you should expect us to continue to prudently manage commodity price risk to protect our balance sheet and cash flows. 
Let me wrap up my remarks today with just a couple of additional comments on our financing plan. You know, securing $2.5 billion of funding seemed like a really big challenge to many when we announced our 2010 capital program back in December. But we had a good plan, and we have confidence in our ability to execute against that plan. As Doug mentioned, we reached our $2.5 billion target during the quarter. As a result, our focus immediately shifted to 2011 and the far more modest level of funding needed to meet our 2011 capital needs. In fact, with $2.7 billion of financings completed this year, we've got a substantial start on 2011. In addition to meeting our 2011 needs, our focus will remain on advancing the longer-term improvement in our balance sheet. 
As for the MLP. Well, I think as Doug indicated, we'll continue to grow the MLP. Now recently, I met with an investor who asked me a similar ""what about the MLP"" question this way: he said, ""J.R., you've completed two drop downs to the MLP this year. Are you done? Or is the pedal still to the metal?"" I'll tell you the same thing I told him. We have not let our foot off the accelerator. We will continue to execute on our drop down strategy because it's value enhancing for both El Paso and El Paso Pipeline Partners. Bottom line, you should expect us to stay the course with EPB.
That's my update for you this morning. We're very pleased with the financial performance of the company so far this year, and are happy to have completed our 2010 financing plan early. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the Pipeline Group."

Adjusted EBIT was up 11% from second quarter 2009 after backing out the gain from the sale of our Mexican business. As J.R. said, essentially all of this increase resulted from our expansion programs.
We continue to execute well on our growth projects. We started construction on four additional projects this quarter as planned. And this is in addition to three others that are well underway: SNG South System Expansion, FGT's Phase 8 and the Gulf LNG terminal. And we were successful in adding another project to our growth backlog, our third expansion out of Marcellus. As Doug said, we've now committed to over $1 billion of Marcellus expansions. 
Slide 11 shows a snapshot of our throughput, and it reflects the overall economy, weather and changes in supply sources. Going around the horn, throughput is up a little on TGP in the Northeast; it's up a lot in the Southeast due to a cold winter and hot summer; it's down in the Southwest partially due to the economy; and down on our Rockies pipes due to lower production, which has now started to recover over the last few months. Overall, these throughput changes, both up and down, had only a small impact on our revenues because of the reservation charge nature of our business. Over 80% of our revenue comes from monthly reservation charges. But we are watching closely a couple of throughput items.
First, on TGP. There's been a significant change in the sourcing of supplies. Receipts from Marcellus and REX in Ohio together are up over 800 a day, year-to-year. These receipts have displaced imports from Canada at Niagara and long-haul volumes from the Gulf Coast. So capacity utilization has declined through the middle part of TGP's system, and we're watching the impact of this on short-term volumes and rates, fuel usage and our O&M costs.
Second, on EPNG. The decline in throughput is somewhat a function of the economy in the Southwest, but it's also a result of the increased imports into California, both from LNG arriving at Costa Azul and, indirectly, imports from Canada. It's not clear whether these trends on EPNG are temporary or more long-lived, but in combination, they've resulted in lower freight rates available on short-term capacity sales on EPNG. And we're likely to file a rate case on EPNG this fall for new rates to be effective next spring.
On Ruby, we've received FERC's and BLM's notice to proceed with construction, and we're under way. Obviously, this is a major milestone. It results from a two and a half year process involving a comprehensive review by BLM, FERC and various federal, state and local agencies. In fact, this is one of the most extensive records we've seen in a new pipeline application. Hundreds of thousands of pages of comments were filed by various groups, and they've been addressed one by one. The agencies have carefully balanced stakeholder issues with the need for this important infrastructure project.
Now we're focused on delivering Ruby on time and on budget for the benefit of markets on the West Coast and Rockies producers. Relative to our original planning of two years ago, construction is starting two months later than planned. We've adjusted by adding an additional construction spread in one of the more mountainous areas to complete that section before winter. So there'll now be eight spreads working on Ruby simultaneously, and as Doug mentioned, 5,000 workers. We're also likely to reconfigure our spread deployment in the western section of the route, also to makeup some time. We're focused on delivering Ruby for in-service next spring. 
On Slide 13, Marcellus. Marcellus continues to be a very exciting new area for us. Over 700 a day of Marcellus gas is now flowing into TGP. It's flowing under a variety of transportation arrangements, including firm backhauls that ramp up over time and will bring in about $60 million of annual revenue by 2012, all requiring very little new capital. And we now have in the backlog three Ford haul expansions amounting to over $1 billion of investment. These three projects are essentially all fully subscribed under long-term contracts. Construction is underway on the first of these, the Line 300 expansion, and we're starting it to the regulatory approval process on the other two. Our success in the Marcellus is obviously the result of having existing infrastructure in the area, but the magnitude of this opportunity is a pleasant surprise for us.
Turning to Slide 14. We're focused across the country on executing on our large backlog. You're aware that we placed in service our Elba projects on-time and on budget. In fact, the Elba tank was placed in service July 1, a month ahead of schedule. Three more projects still in service later this year. They're all well along now in construction and are on schedule. I'd be very surprised if they're not completed below budget.
The backlog projects as a group has been significantly de-risked. While some involve greenfield construction, some are straightforward pipeline looping and compression upgrades of existing systems. The pipe has been purchased for all these projects. All the construction contracts are in place. They are either fixed-price arrangements or unit priced, in which the contractor bears the productivity risk or has significant productivity incentives. And finally in terms of de-risking, in total, the backlog is approximately 90% subscribed under long-term contracts with high-quality customers.
So in summary, the pipes had another strong quarter, and we have our heads down and are executing on our growth projects. And now I'll turn it over to Brent."

We had another solid quarter of financial and operating results in the E&P Company. Production increased to 788 million a day, while we kept our cash cost low at $1.77 per Mcf equivalent.Now as I've noted in our last",1407,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter of financial and operating results in the E&P Company. Production increased to 788 million a day, while we kept our cash cost low at $1.77 per Mcf equivalent.
Now as I've noted in our last call, we plan to run a very focused drilling program in the second half of the year. We're developing capital to the programs that offer the highest returns, and we're living within our 2010 capital plan. So in the second half of the year, we'll operate eight rigs in our core programs. That'll be four in the Haynesville; two in the Eagle Ford, both of those will be in the liquids-rich area; and two in the Altamont.
I'm sure most of you are aware that the pressure pumping and stimulation services have been tight, and the costs have been going up. Last year, we had really good coordination with our frac crews, and they'd be on-site ready to begin the frac work soon after we finished drilling the well, and that hadn't been the case lately. Like others in industry, we've developed a backlog of Haynesville wells that have been drilled and are waiting on completion. In response though, we've recently entered into long-term agreements for stimulation services in all three core programs, which will help us improve our cycle time. And it will give us cost certainty on our future drilling programs. 
Internationally, we've drilled successful wells in Brazil and Egypt in the quarter. In Brazil, we drilled an exploration discovery with Petrobras in the ES-5 block. That's the block where our Camarupin project is located. We logged apparent gas petty [ph] (00:30:18) and we're working with Petrobras to design a production test. Given success, we'd ultimately tie back to the floating production facility that's handling the Camarupin production, and El Paso will have a 35% working interest in the project. In Egypt, we drilled a well in the South Alamein block with CEPSA that also had very encouraging shows. We're not currently drilling in that block. We'll take some time off to assess our results to date, and then we'll likely begin appraisal drilling in the block later this year. 
Total production was up versus the second quarter of 2009, with much of the growth in the Central region, which includes our Haynesville program. That trend's visible on the left side of the chart on Slide 17, and on the right side you can see that we've added roughly 50 million a day of production over the past three quarters, again largely from the Haynesville program.
Through Q2, we continue to trend near the high end of our full year production guidance. So going forward, we've raised our lower end of our range to 760 million a day. But we maintain the high end of the target range at 780 million a day for several reasons. First, we factored in the production uncertainties of the Petrobras-operated Camarupin field in Brazil. Second, we're running fewer rigs in the second half of the year, which is again consistent with our 2010 capital plan. But it'll be harder to hold the current levels of production with lower activity levels. And then finally, we've got more uncertainty regarding when the wells in our Haynesville backlog will come online. And we expect those wells to produce in the 15 million to 20 million a day range initially, so the timing of first production on those wells really matters. Looking back, though, we had good production results in Q2, with exceptional performance from our domestic divisions.
I'll now turn to the Haynesville. And as Doug noted, this program just continues to exceed our expectations. On Slide 18, you can see that our net production has risen by more than 100 million a day since the second quarter of 2009. We now have about 13, over 13 wells that have been drilled and are waiting on completion. So we've got good line of sight for continued production growth, although at a lower growth rate than we've seen so far.
We continue to look for ways to mitigate our service cost that I mentioned earlier, and we've locked in rates for the next two years for much of our projected pressure pumping needs. We also continue to chip away at drilling times. Our current best pace is 22 days from spud to TD. And we see a few companies that are below 30 days, but none to our knowledge that are in the low 20s. So we're definitely setting the standard for drilling performance in the play. And maybe more important, our average well production is as good as any operator in the play. So we benefit from having a great leasehold position in the Haynesville. But our team's also done a terrific job of continuously improving the program and delivering great results.
Our Eagle Ford program continued to perform well during the quarter also. Since our last call, we've expanded our acreage position, as Doug mentioned, and we've completed three very good wells. Two of the wells are in the northern area. Both of them had very high oil content, and they both exceeded our pre-drill expectations.
The map on Slide 19 shows our Eagle Ford acreage relative to the dry gas and the liquid-rich areas. We've added another 5,000 net acres, which brings our total positioning to 170,000. We've not included those newest lands on the map, since we're still attempting to lease in those areas. But the new acreage is generally north of our LaSalle County position on the oilier side of play. We're currently completing two wells, one in each area, and I will keep two rigs running in the liquids-rich area for the remainder of the year.
And although we've got a smaller backlog of completions in this program, we've also secured long-term contracts for stimulation services in the play. And again, that's going to get us clarity on our cost, equipment, crew availability, and it's going to shorten our cycle times. As I've mentioned before, we plan to further ramp up our Eagle Ford program in 2011. And although we don't have an approved budget yet, we have a significant inventory here to develop, and this is currently one of our most economic programs. 
Given higher relative oil prices, Altamont-Bluebell continues to be a very economic program also. Slide 20 shows how we've grown total net production volumes over the last three plus years. Year-to-date, we've averaged over 7,500 barrels a day net. And we've recently produced over 10,000 barrels a day on a given day because we've brought on some relatively high-rate new completions.
Now this is an older, more material oil field where improving execution's the name of the game. And this year, we've continued to reduce drilling times and costs, and while at the same time improving our initial producing rates. And we've made great strides in reducing our lifting costs here. Year to date LOE is almost 20% lower than the first half of 2009 and less than $13 a barrel or so, which is good considering the depth of the wells and the waxy nature of the crude. 
Overall, we're pleased with the success of the program. But as we've investors and analysts in recent months, it's become clear that Altamont is probably the least well known and the least well understood of our core capital programs. And given that we have over 800 locations and over 100 million barrels of recoverable oil potential, we need to do a better job of explaining the program. So our plan is to host a conference call that's devoted to Altamont sometime in the fall.
So let me conclude by saying that I'm really pleased with the execution of our teams. We've developed a deep drilling inventory, and we continue to focus on improving in all aspects of our operations and our capital program execution. We're carefully allocating our capital for the programs that create the greatest value, and although our Eagle Ford and Altamont programs don't offer the same high equivalent gas rates as the Haynesville wells, the economics of these two programs are strong. And that's primarily due to oil prices and, to a lesser degree, to the higher liquids pricing. So we'll continue to focus capital on these three core programs for the balance of the year. And I'll turn back to Doug for his final comments."

As you know, this morning, we issued our third quarter earnings press release and filed it with the SEC. During this morning’s call, we will be referring to slides that are available in the Investor section of our website at elpaso.com. 
Also, on our website, you will find a financial and operational reporting package that includes information that we believe you will find helpful as well as GAAP financial statements and non-GAAP reconciliations. I hope you’ve downloaded this package, so that you will have all relevant financial information available to you.
During this conference call, we will make a number of forward-looking statements and projections. We’ve made every reasonable effort to ensure that the information and assumptions on which these statements and projections are based are current, reasonable and complete.
However, there are a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements and projections expressed during this call. You will find those factors listed under the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on slide two of this morning’s presentation as well as in other SEC filings. Please take the time to review them.
We do not assume any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
Finally I’d like to ask those of you who will be participating in Q&A to limit yourselves to two questions so that we can give more people an opportunity to ask questions. Thank you for your help on this. I’ll now turn the call over to Doug.

So in the interest of time, I’ll keep my opening comments brief. We made substantial progress against our goals this quarter and made several moves designed to position us for long-term success. In the pipes, we’re definitely in execution mode right now with several key projects under construction.
We expect our 2010 in-service projects to come in on-time and substantially under budget like 25% under budget. On Ruby, we’re under construction of making good progress. As Jim will share with you in a minute, our delays getting started mean that we now expect to be over our original budget by 10% to 15%. We never like a project to be over but the fact is we are on this on.
As we told you from the beginning though, we view our backlog as a portfolio and when you look at the entirety of the backlog, much of which is already completed or under construction, we expect to be within 5% or less of our original budget overall. We think that will put us at the ahead of the class in terms of new project execution and Jim will go into more detail on that later.
In E&P, we just continued to hit on all cylinders. Another good quarter operationally with volumes ahead of plan, unit costs trending down as our efforts of continuous improvement payoff and those same efforts in our drilling operations work to offset cost inflation. And in Midstream, Mark and his team continue to make progress both with existing assets that he now has dominion over, as well as with key new projects in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford that we continue to move closer to the finish line.
In addition to these more tactical things though we made some strategic moves during the quarter that’s serve to increase our competitiveness and better position us for the long-term. First we added a new core area in E&P during the quarter with our substantial acreage acquisition in the emerging Wolfcamp play. This combined with our Eagle Ford position and our consolidated position in Altamont gives substantial increase in drilling inventory and at the same time a substantial increase in inventory with oil exposure.
Second, we added to an already enviable price risk management position during the quarter improving our line on gas in 2011 and 2012 and adding some hedges on oil in 2011, all in favorable prices that adds certainty to our ability to generate the cash flow needed to fund both maintenance and growth capital, even in a poor gas price environment.
And finally, we continue to accelerate our balance sheet improvement during the quarter redeeming a large portion of the five year financing we did at the height of the financial crisis in late 2008, and continuing to grow El Paso Pipeline Partners or MLP. The combination of steps we’ve already taken combined with planed actions between now and the end of the year, mean that we’ll end the year having completely funded our 2011 plans, another key step as we move towards free cash in 2012.
With those comments to set the stage, I’ll turn it over to J.R. to review our financial performance. J.R.?

1038355,85200916,85067,"El Paso Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks Doug and good morning.

As Doug just mentioned, we did have another good quarter with continued progress towards our long-term goals. During last quarter’s call, I told you that we would not let our foot off the accelerator to our MLP strategy and we haven’t.
Although I don’t have a third dropdown transaction to announce yet, with more than $400 million in new equity capital, El Paso Pipeline Partners is eager to put the money to work. We are as well. Make no mistake about it. We have the stamina and commitment to maintain our accelerated pace. Shortly, after our last call, we expanded our 2011 natural gas hedges and extended them in 2012. We took what was already a great hedge position and made it even better. Now remember our hedges do not support our drilling economics, but instead support our balance sheet and cash flows.
I’ll show you our current hedges in a few minutes. Finally as Doug said we took advantage of the strong credit markets during the quarter and replaced about $350 million of the 12% five year notes we issued in the midst of the financial storm in December 2008 with 6.5% ten year debt. We continue to look for similar opportunities that are aligned with our goal of accelerating balance sheet improvement. As a result of our success executing our 2010 financing plans and actions we anticipate completing before year-end, we expect to have our 2011 funding requirements met before the end of the year.
So let’s look at our quarterly results beginning on slide 6. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.22 which roughly flat for a year ago. Actual GAAP reported earnings for the quarter was $0.19 per diluted share and is always a complete reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to our GAAP reported financial measures included in our website. In the Pipeline Group, adjusted EBIT increased 2% for the quarter, driven largely by the impact of expansion projects. The Elba Island expansion and Elba Express Pipeline representing nearly $1 billion in growth capital went into service earlier this year.
In addition, pipeline results for the quarter reflect an increase in equity AFUDC or allowance for funds used during construction on the capital employed in our pipeline expansion projects that are not yet in service. AFUDC will continue to increase until the individual projects are placed in service. These increases were somewhat offset by higher non-controlling interest expense primarily resulting from our successful MLP dropdown strategy and a non-cash write down based on our recent FERC order on CIG.
Finally, third quarter results for the pipelines reflect continued regional, economic, competitive and changing GAAP slowed challenges impacting EPNG and TGP. Jim will have more on these dynamics shortly. In E&P, adjusted EBIT was down $30 million from last year. Now if you judged E&P’s third quarter performance based solely on earnings trends, you’d be making a mistake. The story for our E&P group this quarter continues to be about operational execution. More from Brent in a few minutes.
So what are the headlines? Production up 4% while unit cash cost decline 9%. The big differences quarter-to-quarter, although we had a large portion of our 2009 gas production hedged with a $9 floor compared with a $6 floor this year. And oil hedged $110 in 2009 versus $76 this year. Now don’t get me wrong, with gas prices currently below $4 we’re very pleased with our $6 hedges this year.
Interest expense was flat quarter-over-quarter and down from our second quarter as I projected during the last call. One last point before we leave this slide, our adjusted EBIT was down slightly, adjusted EBITDA was up 4% for the reasons I just discussed.
Let’s turn to operating cash flow on slide 7. Cash flow from operations year-to-date was below last year’s level primarily due to lower realized commodity prices and working capital changes. So far this year, our 2010 hedge program has contributed almost $250 million to operating cash flow above what otherwise would be market levels. The result, estimated fiscal year 2010 operating cash flows that are ahead of the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Capital spending picked up during the quarter as we expected and we anticipate continuing this pace for the rest of the year.
If you’ll turn to slide 8, you’ll see the pipelines are running ahead of last year again consistent with expectations driven by the peak capital spending on the expansion backlog notably Ruby. On the E&P side, we’re up above $300 million from last year. You may recall that part of this is because we frontloaded a portion of our 2010 capital program to get ahead of the expected cost increases.
In addition, we acquired approximately 123,000 acres in the Wolfcamp oil field during the quarter almost - for about $180 million. As we indicated, we announced the acquisition we will fund the cost of entering the new play overtime through portfolio rationalization. We’ve also made additional investments in the Eagle Ford acreage funded through reduced international spending.
In the aggregate, we expect fiscal year 2010 CapEx to be essentially on budget before considering the significant strategic investment in the Wolfcamp shale. Finally, our liquidity remains very strong with $2.5 billion available at the end of September, not including cash or available credit facilities of our MLP for Ruby.
As I mentioned earlier, we advanced an already good hedge position during the quarter to an even better one as shown on slide 9. When we looked at our 6/9 callers, we saw positions that were effectively $6 swaps in the current environment. Now with those option positions still has substantial value. Rather than simply watch the value erode overtime, we leverage that embedded value to our advantage. The bottom line is that we were able to increase our 2011 gas hedges to 75% at $6 and add new positions on 25% of our 2012 gas production at $6.36. Now just a reminder the percentage hedged were all periods on this slide is based on estimated 2010 domestic production levels.
As we monitor industry hedging activity, we think our natural gas hedge positions are that as good as you’ll see. I’ll wrap it up with our oil hedges on slide 10.While we’re generally bullish on longer term oil prices, we remain prudent in minimizing downside risk when opportunities present themselves. We’re about 95% hedged with an $85 floor price in 2011 based on estimated 2010 production levels.
As our production shifts more to oil in the future, expect us to continue to manage the price exposure of that increase in supply to support our balance sheet and cash flows. That’s my update for you this morning. I’m pleased to have another good quarter under our belt and proud of the progress we’ve made. With that I’ll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the Pipeline Group. Jim?

At the pipes, the third quarter was highlighted by continuing to execute on our backlog of growth projects. We advanced three more projects towards in-service in the fourth quarter and replace them in-service as Doug said on-time and approximately 25% under budget. That’s about $100 million under budget. The first of these, the WIC expansion (inaudible) and into the Ruby pipeline was placed in-service on-time on November 1.
And we’ll follow that up with a return expansion going in-service on December 1 and then the SNG South System expansion on January 1. On Ruby, although we’ve had some delays in obtaining cultural resources clearances, construction is moving ahead now on all spreads. And we’ve made good progress on the other projects in the backlog including the other large ones for in-service during 2011. TGP’s Line 300 expansion across Pennsylvania, Gulf LNG and the FGT Phase VIII expansion.
We’re also filing two new rate cases. Both of these are essentially the result of shifts in the way gas is flowing across the country. We just filed a rate case on EPNG and we’ll file one on TGP most likely by the end of the month. Let’s look at throughput and these changes in flows on slide 13.
In total, throughput this year is down approximately 3% from 2009. And it’s a mixed bag on our pipes across the country as you can see. I want to talk about a couple of throughput trends that are noteworthy and are driving the new rate cases. First, on TGP. While overall throughput is up, there has been a significant change in the sourcing of supplies. Receipts from Marcellus in Pennsylvania and REX in Ohio together are up about 1.3 Bcf a day year-to-year. These receipts have displaced imports from Canada at Niagara and long-haul transport from the Gulf Coast.
The impact of this on TGP is the short-haul and backhaul revenue out of Marcellus has increased, but long-haul commodity and interruptible transportation are down. Also TGP’s revenue from gas not used in operations is lower due to those lower fuel volumes retained and obviously lower prices. Because of these changes, we’ll file a rate case on TGP to fully recover revenue and structure rates that are more properly reflect the reality of today’s gas flows.
Secondly on EPNG, the decline in throughput is somewhat a function of the economy in the Southwest, but is also the result of increased pipeline competition and import into California. Both from LNG arriving at Costa Azul and indirectly imports from Canada. In combination this has resulted in lower freight rates available on short-term capacity sales, also some turn back of FT. And so we’ve recently filed a rate case on EPNG for new rates to be effective next spring.
Changing gas flows are a reality in today’s gas market. And they are varying impacts on individual pipes. In general because El Paso owns a large and diverse set of pipelines, we are better able to absorb these ongoing changes in market conditions. And remember that we have further protection because over 80% of our revenues comes from monthly demand charges and this percentage will likely further increase as TGP goes to a more traditional rate design in its new rate case.
On Ruby, slide 14. We’re well underway with construction in all spreads. As you recall, we started construction on July 31. This is about two months later the plan and after 2.5 year review process by BLM, FERC and the various federal state and local agencies. We now have eight construction spreads working on Ruby. Having out of the spread in one of the more mountainous areas of Utah to complete that section before winter. That section so called Spread 2 is proceeding very well. Ditching and pipe stringing are approximately three quarters complete and the welding of the pipe sections about two-thirds complete.
As shown on the photos, a lot is going on across the entire pipeline route. Some clearing and grading, ditching, stringing and some lowering end of the pipe. Our two manned camps are up and running in Western Nevada and Oregon to house and support up to 1000 men throughout construction. So we had a lot of activity ongoing on all spreads.
In general, on slide 15, construction is progressing very well on the eastern spreads and slower than expected on the western spreads in parts of Nevada and Oregon. On the western spreads, we’ve had some delays in obtaining cultural resource clearances. This in turn has restricted our construction activity there. We recently had over 150 archeologists in the field and now the permitting process is improved.
In Nevada and Oregon, we now have access to over half the right-of-way. We continue to get more released on a regular basis in Nevada. And in Oregon we’re seeing improvement in the permit approval timelines. As part of this process, Ruby continues to work with the tribes and their concerns about cultural disturbances. Separately, our compression station construction is going very well, and all four of our stations, nearly all the major equipment has been set on their foundations.
With respect to cost and schedule, as Doug said, we now expect Ruby to be 10% to 15% over budget, primarily due to the delays, and our target in-service is next June. The key variables will be weather this winter, the pace of getting final regulatory clearances, and dealing with various construction restrictions due to fish and game habitat or nesting periods.
In sum on Ruby, construction activity continues to ramp up, and as you know, both we and our major contractors are incentivized and focused on construction productivity.
Finally, slide 16. Slide 16 summarizes our multiyear major pipeline expansion program, both our performance to date and expectations. Our projects for in-service this year are either complete or nearing completion as scheduled. As I mentioned, these four projects as a group will be approximately a $100 million under budget.
For the five projects that will go in service next year, all are well under construction, and other than Ruby, all are essentially on budget. And at this point they have been substantially derisked with essentially all the pipe delivered and all the construction contracts in place either fixed price, unit price or incentive based.
While it’s a little early to talk about progress on our projects to go in service in 2012 and beyond, note that these are primarily lower risk pipeline looping and compression projects. So as Doug said, in total, this multiyear capital program including Ruby is expected to be within 5% of budget, and this holds whether considering gross CapEx or CapEx net to El Paso. And you’re aware that these projects have also been derisked on the market side. As a group they’re approximately 90% subscribed under long-term contracts with high-quality customers.
So our focus at the pipes is a very clear one, it’s executing on all these growth projects.
And with that I’ll turn it over Mark to update you on the Midstream business.

Well, it’s been a year since we announced our intention to enter the Midstream business, and I’m happy to report that we’re making visible progress on several fronts.
We’re now operating and in fact expanding a gathering system in the Eagle Ford, which will have a capacity of about a 150 million a day. In the Haynesville, we have a 70 million a day gathering system that delivers to Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and we’re about to begin construction on our 150 million a day [inaudible].
In the Uintah Basin of Utah we have the Altamont gathering and processing system which gathers associated gas from this oil field, and has about 800 miles of gathering line, 40 million a day gas processing plant, and just under 4,000 barrels a day at fractionation capacity. In all three of these areas, we’re evaluation future growth needs of El Paso’s E&P Company, and we’re being very successful in pursing third-party opportunities.
We’re in particularly excited about the growth potential in the Altamont system, which we’ll talk more about on our upcoming Altamont Analyst Call.
We have two major shale infrastructure projects under development, one in the Marcellus and one for the Eagle Ford. As you may have seen from our recent press release, we joined forces with Spectra to leverage more existing assets to make the Marcellus Ethane Pipeline System as competitive as possible.
In the case of El Paso, we’ll convert a Tennessee Gas mainline that is underutilized primarily due to changes in flows discussed by Jim. And for Spectra, we’ll contribute excess TETCO right away in the northeast.
At this point, we continue discussions with producers and petrochemical plant operators to assess demand for capacity either Mont Belvieu or like Charles and Baton Rouge. So depending on how discussions with these potential customers go, we would hope to have a binding open season later this year and then sanction of project shortly thereafter.
The Camino Real pipeline is a 600 million a day project. They’ll gather and process rich Eagle Ford shale gas with new pipelines that would tie into Tennessee Gas Pipeline that has existing capacity near Victoria, Texas. The gas will then move north on Tennessee to Paul County, where we’ll build a project processing plant. The NGOs will be shipped to Mont Belvieu via pipeline. We’re actively marketing this project to Eagle Ford producers.
The business that we’re building and the project we’re developing are very attractive, and we’ve been approached by industry and financial players wanting to participate with us in one form or another. We’re evaluating these partnering opportunities to not only enhance our business prospects, but to manage our capital requirements.
So you can see we’re starting to gain momentum on several fronts, and in all cases we’re leveraging El Paso’s asset base to provide synergies, build value for El Paso and enable the MEPS and Camino Real pipeline to be competitive solutions for Marcellus and Eagle Ford producers.
With my first Midstream update complete, I’ll turn the call over to Brent.

I’m proud to report another good E&P quarter. Production was up from a year-ago and we’re tracking towards the high end of our full-year guidance range of 760 million to 780 million a day equivalent.Cash cost",2056,"Thanks Mark, and good morning, everyone. I’m proud to report another good E&P quarter. Production was up from a year-ago and we’re tracking towards the high end of our full-year guidance range of 760 million to 780 million a day equivalent.
Cash costs were down as J.R. mentioned in Q3, and we’ve reduced our full-year guidance range again to a $1.75 to a $1.85. And as I mentioned on the last quarter call, we continue to run a very focused drilling rig program with four rigs running in the Haynesville, two in the Altamont field, and two in the Eagle Ford. So you’ll see growth from those areas while we continue to cash flow the remaining domestic assets.
And as Doug noted, our drilling inventory has grown and that growths come primarily from oil projects. We’ve got a significant boost on the Wolfcamp Shale Program, and in a moment I’ll explain why we believed at our new Permian leases have tremendous potential.
Production growth from the Haynesville and the Central division, Altamont in the Western division and Brazil drove the year-over-year increase in our third quarter volumes which you can see on slide 21. The Gulf Coast is down because we’re not reinvesting in our traditional programs and the ramp in the Eagle Ford is not yet overcome in the base decline, although in total we’re about where we expected for the Gulf Coast division.
Cash costs were down 9% with really good progress across the board. Our production operations and our supply chain teams have continued to deliver cost efficiency improvement.
So let’s turn to the Eagle Ford program which continues to perform very well also. If you were not able to attend our recent field trip then perhaps you’ve seen the charts on our website that provide a full review of the Eagle Ford play. The key takeaways from that presentation are that we have a very attractive acreage position that includes a lot of oily inventory.
We now have two gas wells in the southern area and seven oil wells in the central area with gross production of about 2,500 barrels a day of oil and 7.5 million a day of dry gas. The drilling results continue to be at or better than our pre-drill models, and in fact we’re currently testing a Frio County well at over 700 barrels of oil and over 800 barrels of an equivalent basis. And currently we have six wells waiting to be completed in our dedicated factories in place here, so we expect to maintain a relatively low completion backlog.
We drilled our first well in that northern block in October and we’ll complete it later this month. Wells in the Northern Canyons will be true oil wells and we’d expect the EURs in those to be like 300,000 barrels to 550,000 barrels.
The resource potential here is significant. We’ve got about 250 million barrels of oil and liquids and about 1.8 Tcf of gas on an unrisk basis. And given the size and the quality of our Eagle Ford acreage coupled with our entry into the Wolfcamp Shale play and our desire to maintain capital discipline, we’re considering taking an Eagle Ford partner to help optimize the value of our inventory.
We plan to keep two rigs running for the remainder of the year; add a third rig in 2011, and we plan to exit 2011 at five to six rigs, and most of our near-term drilling is going to be oil focused. With current pricing, this is our most valuable program, and we’re really happy with our returns in the oil production will become more meaningful to our volume mixes as we go through 2011.
Our Haynesville program continues to outperform others in the play. Our wells are still delivering about 30% more production than the industry average, and we’ve recently drilled a well to TD in 20 days, and I don’t think anyone else can come close to that drilling pace.
On the last call, I talked about how we had entered into a two-year contract for a dedicated frac crew, so that we could eliminate delays and getting our wells completed. And our completion backlog had grown to 16 wells in late August, so we worked that backlog down to 12 wells which would benefit our production in the fourth quarter. And recently, our net production has been over 170 million a day.
Now, while some companies are seeing a falloff in oil productivity in the Haynesville, we’re seeing very consistent IP rates and EURs, and I continue to believe that’s because we start with an advantaged acreage position just right in the heart of the play and then we continue execute well on the completion in their production operations areas.
I’ll keep my Altamont comments brief today since we have our schedule call on November 18th at 4:30 Eastern Time. Altamont remember is a huge resource originally about 3 billion barrels of oil in place, only about 10% of that’s been produced, so we’re busy trying to increase recoveries from the field. This is a textbook continuous improvement story. We know the oil is there, we’ve had a large drilling inventory, and we’ll continue to drill wells faster and more cost effectively over time, and we’ll continue to improve our completion design and well performance. So please join us for more regarding Altamont in a couple of weeks.
And then a few weeks ago, we announced our new Permian Basin oil program that we’re very excited about in the Wolfcamp Shale. Slide 25 shows we now have a significant position roughly 135,000 net acres all in large contiguous blocks with a single royalty owner as the State of Texas is part of the university land system. Now, we think we have more than 600 horizontal well locations just in the upper portion of the Wolfcamp, assuming a 75% acreage utilization factor which then translates to more than a 150 million barrels of oil equivalent resources.
I’ll show you a regional map in a moment, but one of the things we really liked about the play is that we’re dealing with a known reservoir. There have been hundreds of successful vertical Wolfcamp producers in this area and there’s plenty of existing infrastructure. So although it’s still very early days for horizontal activity in the Wolfcamp, six horizontal wells have been drilled offset to our acreage with very encouraging results, and we’re tracking the current drilling activity in the area.
We cored and tested one well before we bid on the university leases. And although we had some mechanical problems during the completion, we got all the information we needed to confirm the high quality of our lease area relative to our regional view of the play. And then finally, we believe that what we’ve learned operationally in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford will be directly applicable to the development of the Wolfcamp.
Let’s step back a second and talk about why we targeted the Wolfcamp. Now earlier this year as our Eagle Ford program was moving into the development phase, we took a small position in Crockett County to study and pilot test the Wolfcamp. That recommendation came from our technical team following extensive review of the Wolfcamp Shale across the entire Permian Basin where they literally included thousands of oil logs and production histories over a 13-county study area.
The map on slide 26 shows vertical a Wolfcamp and Wolfberry production virtually surrounding our acreage. And not shown on the map, as you move from north to south towards our blocks to Sprayberry above the Wolfcamp actually gets thinner and the Wolfcamp Shale gets thicker. In fact the total upper and lower Wolfcamp Shale interval is almost a 1,000 feet thick in places. So we’re dealing with a known producing reservoir not just a known source rock, and better yet it’s an oil play with upside and all of the traditional vertically stacked Permian Basin oil reservoirs.
Let me compare and contrast the Wolfcamp Shale to other shales, we see a lot of things we like. On table 24, highlights the shale reservoir success factors, and a number of things jump out at you; shallower depth, so it’s going to be cheaper and easier to drill; a very thick section, 400 to 850 foot of net thickness; and clearly we can’t horizontally drill and complete a section this thick with one lateral. But having a very thick section creates a possibility of a second phase of horizontal development in the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, which would essentially double the resource potential.
High organic content, we need organic material to generate hydrocarbons, and a 4% to 15% indicates a very organic rich shale. High porosity with values ranging between 7% and 15%, the Wolfcamp has high oil in place storage capacity. And then finally low clay content. We want shales that have high quartz or carbonate content and low clay content. The quartz and the carbonates form brittle rocks that are easier to hydraulically frac and they tend to be more porous and permeable.
We all refer to the source rocks as shales, but what we’re really looking for is low clay content shales. So the Wolfcamp has a lot of things to like and I believe it compares very favorably to some of the more established shale plays.
Now another positive is its relative consistency of the Wolfcamp section across our acreage position. On slide 28, we showed two logs from the northeast to the south - northwest rather to the southeast across our acreage spanning roughly 35 miles. Now the laws we marked to Sprayberry, the Dean, the upper and lower Wolfcamp sections. And when our technical team was doing their original analysis, this consistency is part what we were targeting for our acreage objectives.
The laws tell us that the upper Wolfcamp is very good porosity and high organic content as we’ve discussed. And as importantly it shows that the section is very consistent all the way across our acreage position, and that consistency is what lead us to build the large acreage position quickly, and allows for the kind of repeatable inventory that can deliver predictable well results and returns that we looked for.
Now, we’ll obviously experiment with drilling and completion designs, but slide 29 summarizes our current type well economics. At the midpoints, we’ve seen 7,500 foot vertical depths, 5000 foot laterals, 16 frac stages, a 160 acres spacing, and completed well cost of about $5 million. We estimate initial producing rates of 250 to 300 equivalent barrels per day, although we’ve already seen wells offset our block that are much higher than this, and those rates would translate to gross EURs of like 300,000 to 380,000 equivalent barrels.
Ultimately the program PVR should be in the 1.25 to 1.35 range assuming $70 oil and $4.50 gas and the IRR should be in the 20% to 30% range. Now again, our model only assumes developing the upper portion of the Wolfcamp with possible upside value from the lower Wolfcamp horizontal development and horizontal development on tighter than a 160-acre spacing, and then all the other vertically stacked oil zones in the Permian basin. With all the resource potential on our new leases, we’ll hopefully be talking about the Permian Basin for a long time.
Going forward, we plan to spud another well in November, and keep that rig active into 2011. The formula we’ve used in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford has worked well for us, so we intent do mirror that approach. We’ll start with one rig and then we’ll try different lateral links and numbers of frac stages and then find ways to reduce drilling and completion cost and time.
We’ll also be spudding wells across our acreage to better understand our position and to improve our long-term plans. One of the great things about having a single very knowledgeable royalty owner is that we can better optimize our development plan and we’ve already begun the process of unitizing the university lands. By using that approach and given success you should expect this to ramp up our drilling activity throughout 2011 just as we’ve done in our other core programs.
Now, I’ll turn the call back to Doug for closing comments.

We had a very good quarter operationally. We continue to make progress in executing on our pipeline backlog and not withstanding an anticipated cost overrun on the Ruby pipeline, we expect our growth backlog in total to be within 5% of its original budget.
In Midstream, we continue to make progress on key projects in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, and are already seeing the benefit of Mark and his team’s stewardship of our existing Midstream assets in Altamont and in Haynesville. And in E&P, Brent just outlined a great quarter, and lots of reasons to be optimistic about the balance of the year, as well as the longer term.
As we plan for 2011 capital spending and E&P, it’s very likely that the bulk of our spending will be in areas that didn’t even exist as a possibility three years ago. A much large inventory comprised primarily of large core positions in areas where we’re advantaged and have a track record of performance with much more exposure to oil. That constitutes a dramatic shift in the competitive landscape over a very short period of time.
On the balance sheet side, we expect to have covered off all our financing needs for 2011 in the next two months. All of these actions served to increase our competitiveness even in a low gas price environment and we’re not sitting still. We have more plan for the balance of the year including as Brent alluded to the securing of the joint venture partner for our Eagle Ford acreage, allowing us to accelerate development, and optimize our own invested capital.
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning, and now we’d be happy to open it up to your questions.

When we say June, it is highly dependent on weather to the extent we have a benign winter, we can do better than that, and likewise doing the other way. But - so that’s the way I’d answer that. I think of the different risk that we face, we are at a formidable stage I’d say, we’re well underway in construction. But with respect to milestones, we’re going to know a lot more when we get into say February, March, maybe January, February, March.
When you think about Ruby construction, you ought to focus on three variables. One is winter weather and what that means with respect to construction productivity. A second is where we are on all these cultural clearances. And as I say, we’ve made some very good headway just in the last few weeks on that and we expect continued progress. And finally, there are different biological windows with respect to when you can build and when you can’t build to avoid migratory birds and the like.
The biggest near term weather window we have their concerns big game to the extent we have a normal winter. We think that we ought to be able to work through some of those big game windows. And if it were more severe and some of the Elk or whatever had to come down and do some grazing on lower areas without some more issues, so - but those are the three things to look for. But I think you can tell that over the course of the next month or so we’ll know a lot more.

I think what it says about the near term is that we think that there is a good change that natural gas prices are going to stay relatively low for certainly for 2011 and into 2012.
And when they rebound in our view is sort of some combination of the recovery of the US economy, so GDP going up for some sustained period of time, the beginning of the impact of old coal retirements, and the contingent fall off in exports from Canada. And how you assess the timing of that is, I mean there’s a great deal of uncertainty.
I looked at four or five of the big forecasters of just of US production for 2011 and I think by the end of the year they diverse by about 5 Bcf a day and a kind of a 60 Bcf a day market. So there is a lot of uncertainty.
I think what we’ve tried to do in position ourselves so that we’re not losing the optionality that we believe exists on at very favorable macro for gas in the long term, and in the interim we’ve got the ability because of the repositioning of our E&P portfolio to take advantage of a favored commodity right now in oil.

As you know, this morning, we issued our third quarter earnings press release and filed it with the SEC. During this morning's call, we will be referring to slides that are available in the Investors section of our website at www.elpaso.com. 
Also on our website, you will find a financial and operational reporting package that includes information that we believe you will find helpful, as well as GAAP financial statements and non-GAAP reconciliations. I hope you will download this package so that you will have all relevant financial information available to you. 
During this conference call, we will make a number of forward-looking statements and projections. We have made every reasonable effort to ensure that the information and assumptions on which these statements and projections are based are current, reasonable and complete. However, there are a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements and projections expressed during this call. You will find those factors listed under the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on Slide 2 of this morning's presentation, as well as in other SEC filings. Please take the time to review them. We do not assume any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

So in the interest of time, I'll keep my opening comments brief. 
We made substantial progress against our goals this quarter and made several moves designed to position us for long-term success. 
In the Pipes, we're definitely in execution mode right now, with several key projects under construction. We expect our 2010 in-service projects to come in on time and substantially under budget, like 25% under budget. 
On Ruby, we are under construction of making good progress. As Jim will share with you in a minute, our delays getting started mean that we now expect to be over our original budget by 10% to 15%. We never like a project to be over, but the fact is we are on this one. 
As we told you from the beginning though, we view our backlog as a portfolio. And when you look at the entirety of the backlog, much of which is already completed or under construction, we expect to be within 5% or less of our original budget overall. We think that will put us at the head of the class, in terms of new project execution and Jim will go into more detail on that later. 
In E&P, we just continue to hit on all cylinders. Another good quarter operationally with volumes ahead of plan, unit cost trending down as our efforts of continuous improvement pay off and those same efforts in our drilling operations work to offset cost inflation. 
And in Midstream, Mark and his team continue to make progress, both with existing assets that he now has dominion over, as well as with key new projects in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford that we continue to move closer to the finish line. 
In addition to these more tactical things though, we've made some strategic moves during the quarter, that serves to increase our competitiveness and better position us for the long term. 
First, we added a new core area in the E&P during the quarter, with our substantial acreage acquisition in the emerging Wolfcamp play. This, combined with our Eagle Ford position and our consolidated position in the Altamont field gives us a substantial increase in drilling inventory and at the same time a substantial increase in inventory with oil exposure. 
Second, we added to an already enviable price risk management position during the quarter, improving our line on gas in 2011 and 2012 and adding some hedges on oil in 2011, all at favorable prices that add certainty to our ability to generate the cash flow needed to fund both maintenance and growth capital, even in a poor gas price environment. 
And finally, we continue to accelerate our balance sheet improvement during the quarter, redeeming a large portion of the five-year financing we did at the height of the financial crisis in late 2008, and continuing to grow El Paso Pipeline Partners or MLP. The combination of steps we've already taken combined with planned actions between now and the end of the year mean that we'll end the year having completely funded our 2011 plans, another key step as we move toward free cash in 2012. 
With those comments to set the stage, I'll turn it over to JR to review our financial performance. JR?"

As Doug just mentioned, we did have another good quarter, with continued progress towards our long-term goals. During last quarter's call, I told you that we would not let our foot off the accelerator to our MLP strategy and we haven't. Although I don't have a third drop-down transaction to announce yet, with more than $400 million in new equity capital, El Paso Pipeline Partners is eager to put the money to work. We are as well. Make no mistake about it. We have the stamina and commitment to maintain our accelerated pace. 
Shortly after our last call, we expanded our 2011 natural gas hedges and extended them into 2012. We took what was already a great hedge position and made it even better. But remember, our hedges do not support our drilling economics, but instead support our balance sheet and cash flows. I'll show you our current hedges in a few minutes. 
Finally, as Doug said, we took advantage of the strong credit markets during the quarter, and replaced about $350 million of the 12% five-year notes we issued in the midst of the financial storm in December 2008, with 6.5% 10-year debt. 
We continue to look for similar opportunities that are aligned with our goal of accelerating balance sheet improvement. 
As a result of our success executing our 2010 financing plan and actions we anticipate completing before year-end, we expect to have our 2011 funding requirements met before the end of the year. So let's look at our quarterly results beginning on Slide 6. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.22 which roughly flat for a year ago. Actual GAAP reported earnings for the quarter was $0.19 per diluted share and is always a complete reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to our GAAP reported financial measures as included on our website. 
In the Pipeline Group, adjusted EBIT increased 2% for the quarter, driven largely by the impact of expansion projects. The Elba Island expansion and Elba Express Pipeline, representing nearly $1 billion in growth capital went into service earlier this year. In addition, pipeline results for the quarter reflect an increase in Equity AFUDC while Allowance for Funds Used During Construction on the capital employed in our pipeline expansion projects that are not yet in service. AFUDC will continue to increase until the individual projects are placed in service. 
These increases were somewhat offset by higher non-controlling interest expense, primarily resulting from our successful MLP drop-down strategy and a non-cash asset write down based on our recent FERC order on CIG. 
Finally, third quarter results for the pipelines reflect continued regional, economic, competitive and changing GAAP slow challenges impacting EPNG and TGP. Jim will have more on these dynamics shortly. 
In E&P, adjusted EBIT was down $30 million from last year. Now if you judged E&P's third quarter performance based solely on earnings trends, you'd be making a mistake. The story of our E&P group this quarter continues to be about operational execution. More from Brent in a few minutes. 
So what are the headlines? Production up 4% while unit cash cost declined 9%. The big difference is quarter-to-quarter, although we had a large portion of our 2009 gas production hedged with a $9 floor compared with a $6 floor this year and oil hedged at $110 in 2009 versus $76 this year. 
Now don't get me wrong, with gas prices currently below $4, we are very pleased with our $6 hedges this year. 
Interest expense was flat quarter-over-quarter and down from our second quarter, as I projected during the last call. 
One last point before we leave this slide, while adjusted EBIT was down slightly, adjusted EBITDA was up 4% for the reasons I just discussed. Let's turn to operating cash flow on Slide 7. 
Cash flow from operations year-to-date was below last year's level, primarily due to lower realized commodity prices and working capital changes. So far this year, our 2010 hedge program has contributed almost $250 million to operating cash flow, above what otherwise would be market levels. The result, estimated fiscal year 2010 operating cash flows that are ahead of the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. 
Capital spending picked up during the quarter, as we expected and we anticipate continuing this pace for the rest of the year. If you'll turn to Slide 8, you'll see the pipelines are running ahead of last year, again consistent with expectations, driven by the peak capital spending on the expansion backlog, notably Ruby. 
On the E&P side, we're up about $300 million from last year. You may recall that part of this is because we frontloaded a portion of our 2010 capital program to get ahead of the expected cost increases. In addition, we acquired approximately 123,000 acres in the Wolfcamp oil shale during the quarter, almost for about $180 million. As we indicated, we announced the acquisition, we will fund the cost of entering the new play overtime through portfolio rationalization. 
We've also made additional investments in the Eagle Ford acreage funded through reduced international spending. 
In the aggregate, we expect fiscal year 2010 CapEx to be essentially on budget before considering the significant strategic investment in the Wolfcamp shale. 
Finally, our liquidity remains very strong, with $2.5 billion available at the end of September, not including cash or available credit facilities of our MLP or Ruby. 
As I mentioned earlier, we advanced an already good hedge position during the quarter to an even better one, as shown on Slide 9. When we look at our six-by-nine callers, we saw positions that were effectively $6 swaps in the current environment. Now with those option position still has substantial value. Rather than simply watch the value erode over time, we leveraged that embedded value to our advantage. The bottom line is that we were able to increase our 2011 gas hedges to 75% at $6 and add new positions on 25% of our 2012 gas production at $6.36. 
Now just a reminder, the percentage hedged for all periods on this slide is based on estimated 2010 domestic production levels.
As we monitor industry hedging activity, we think our natural gas hedge positions are about as good as you'll see. 
I'll wrap it up with our oil hedges on Slide 10. Although we are generally bullish on longer-term oil prices, we remain prudent in minimizing downside risk when opportunities present themselves. We are about 95% hedged, with an $85 floor price in 2011 based on estimated 2010 production levels. 
As our production shifts more to oil in the future, expect us to continue to manage the price exposure of that increasing supply to support our balance sheet and cash flows. 
That's my update for you this morning. I'm pleased to have another good quarter under our belt and proud of the progress we've made. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the pipeline group. Jim?"
1038355,85200916,163028,"El Paso Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks, JR.

To the pipes, the third quarter was highlighted by continuing to execute on our backlog and growth projects. We advanced three more projects toward in service in the fourth quarter and we'll place them in service as Doug said on time and approximately 25% under budget. That's about $100 million under budget. 
The first of these, the WIC expansion, the field gas build down and into the Ruby pipeline was placed in service on time on November 1. And we'll follow that up with a return expansion drilling in-service on December 1 and then the SNG South System expansion on January 1. 
On Ruby, although we've had some delays on obtaining cultural resources clearances, construction is moving ahead now on all spreads. And we've made good progress on the other projects in the backlog, including the other large ones for in-service during 2011. TGP's Line 300 expansion across Pennsylvania, Gulf LNG and the FGT Phase VIII expansion. 
We're also filing two new rate cases. Both of these are essentially the result of shifts in the way gas is flowing across the country. We just filed the rate case on EPNG and we'll final one on TGP most likely by the end of the month.
Let's look at throughput and these changes in flows on Slide 13. In total, throughput this year is down approximately 3% from 2009. and some mixed bag on our pipes across the country as you can see. 
I want to talk about a couple of throughput trends that are noteworthy and are driving the new rate cases. First on TGP. While overall throughput is up, there's been a significant change in the sourcing of supplies. Receipts from Marcellus and Pennsylvania and REX and Ohio together are up about 1.3 Bcf a day year-to-year. These receipts have displayed imports from Canada at Niagara and long-haul transport from the Gulf Coast. 
The impact of this on TGP is that short-haul and backhaul revenue out of Marcellus has increased, but long-haul commodity and interruptible transportation are down. Also, TGP's revenue from gas not used in operations is lower due to both lower fuel volumes retained and obviously lower prices. Because of these changes, we'll file a rate case on TGP to fully recover revenue and structure rates that are more properly reflect the reality of today's gas flows. 
Secondly, on EPNG, the decline in throughput is somewhat a function of the economy in the Southwest, but is also the result of increased pipeline competition and imports into California. Both from LNG arriving at Costa Azul and indirectly imports from Canada. In combination, this has resulted in lower freight rates available on short-term capacity sales, also some turning back of FT. And so we've recently filed a rate case on EPNG for new rates to be effective next spring.
Changing gas flows are a reality in today's gas market. And they have varying impacts on individual pipes. In general, because El Paso owns a large and diverse set of pipelines, we are better able to absorb these ongoing changes and market conditions. And remember that we have further production because over 80% of our revenues come from monthly demand charges and this percentage will likely further increase, as TGP goes to a more traditional rate design in it's new rate case.
On Ruby, Slide 14. We are well underway with construction on all spreads. As you recall, we started construction on July 31. This is about two months later than planned and after a 2.5 year review process by BLM, FERC and the various federal state and local agencies. We now have eight construction spreads working on Ruby. Having out of the spread and one of the more mountainous areas of Utah to complete that section before winter. That section so-called spread two is proceeding very well. ditching and pipe stringing are approximately three quarters complete and the welding of the pipe sections about 2/3 complete.
As shown on the photos, a lot's going on across the entire pipeline route, some clearing and grading, ditching, stringing and some lowering in of the pipe. 
Our two-man camps are up and running in Western Nevada and Oregon to house and support up to 1,000 men throughout construction. So we have a lot of activity ongoing on all spreads.
In general, on Slide 15, construction is progressing very well on the eastern spreads and slower than expected on the western spreads in parts of Nevada and Oregon. On the Western spreads, we've had some delays in obtaining cultural resource clearances. This in turn has restricted our construction activity there. We recently had over 150 archaeologists in the field and now the permitting process is improved. In Nevada and Oregon, we now have access to over half the right of way. We continue to get more released on a regular basis in Nevada. And in Oregon, we are seeing improvement in the permit approval timelines. As part of this process, Ruby continues to work with the tribes and their concerns about cultural disturbances. 
Separately, our construction station construction -- our compression station construction is going very well. At all four of our stations nearly all of the major equipment has been set on their foundations.
With respect to cost and schedule, as Doug said, we now expect Ruby to be 10% to 15% over budget primarily due to the delays. And our target in-service is next June. The key variables will be weather this winter, the pace of getting final regulatory clearances and the dealing with various construction restrictions due to fish and game inhabitant or nesting periods. 
In some on Ruby, construction activity continues to ramp up. And as you know, both we and our major contractors are incentivized and focused on construction productivity.
Finally, Slide 16. Slide 16 summarizes our multi-year major pipeline expansion program, both our performance to date and expectations. Our projects for in-service this year are either complete or nearing completion as scheduled.
As I mentioned these four projects as a group will be approximately $100 million under budget. 
For the five projects that will go in-service next year, all are well under construction. And other than Ruby, all are essentially on budget. And at this point, they have been substantially de-risked with essentially all the pipe delivered and all the construction contracts in place, either fix-price, unit-price or incentive based. 
While it's a little early to talk about progress in our projects to go in-service in 2012 and beyond, note that these are primarily lower risk pipeline looping and compression projects. 
So as Doug said in total, this multi-year capital program, including Ruby is expected to be within 5% of budget, and this holds whether considering gross CapEx or CapEx next to El Paso. And you're aware that these projects have also been de-risked on the market site. As a group, they are approximately 90% subscribed under long-term contracts with high-quality customers. 
So our focus at the pipes is a very clear one. It's executing on all these growth projects. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to update you on the Midstream business."

Well, it's been a year since we announced our intention to reenter the Midstream business and I'm happy to report that we're making visible progress on several fronts. We are now operating and in fact expanding our gathering system in the Eagle Ford which will have a capacity of around 150 million a day. In the Haynesville, we have a $70 million a day gathering system that delivers to Tennessee Gas Pipeline and we're about to begin construction on our 150 million a day treater. 
In the Uinta Basin of Utah, we have the Altamont gathering and processing system which gathers associated gas from this oil field and has about 800 miles of gathering line, 40 million a day gas processing plant and just under 4,000 barrels a day of fractionation capacity. In all three of these areas, we are evaluating future growth needs of El Paso's E&P company and we're being very successful in pursuing third-party opportunities. 
We are in particularly excited about the growth potential in the Altamont system which we'll talk more about at our upcoming Altamont analyst call. 
We have two major shale infrastructure projects under development, one in the Marcellus and one for the Eagle Ford. As you may have seen from our recent press release, we've joined forces with Spectra to leverage more existing assets to make the Marcellus Ethane Pipeline System as competitive as possible. In the case of El Paso, we'll convert a Tennessee Gas Pipeline that is underutilized primarily due to changes in flows discussed by Jim. And for Spectra, we'll contribute Axis PETCO right away in the Northeast. At this point, we continue discussions with producers and petrochemical plant operators to assess demand for capacity either Mont Belvieu or Lake Charles or Baton Rouge. So depending on how discussions with these potential customers go, we would hope to have a binding open season later this year and then sanction the project shortly thereafter. 
The Camino Real Pipeline is a 600 million a day project. They'll gather and process Ridge Eagle Ford Shale gas with new pipelines that will tie into Tennessee Gas Pipeline that has existing capacity near Victoria, Texas. The gas will then move north on Tennessee to Paul County, where we'll build the project processing plant.  The NGLs will be shipped to Mont Belvieu via pipeline. We're actively marketing this project to Eagle Ford producers.
The business that we're building and the project we're developing are very attractive, and we've been approached by industry and financial players wanting to participate with us in one form or another. We are evaluating these partnering opportunities to not only enhance our business prospects, but to manage our capital requirements. 
So you can see we're starting to gain momentum on several fronts. And in all cases, we're leveraging El Paso's asset base to provide synergies, build value for El Paso and enable the MEPS and Camino Real Pipeline to be competitive solutions for Marcellus and Eagle Ford producers. With my first midstream update complete, I'll turn the call over to Brent."
1038355,85200916,163028,"El Paso Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.I'm proud to report another good E&P quarter. Production was up from a year ago and we're tracking toward the high end of our full year guidance range of 760 million to 780 million a day equivalent. Cash costs",2037,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.
I'm proud to report another good E&P quarter. Production was up from a year ago and we're tracking toward the high end of our full year guidance range of 760 million to 780 million a day equivalent. 
Cash costs were down, as JR mentioned in Q3 and we've reduced our full year guidance range again to $1.75 to $1.85. And as I mentioned on our last quarter call, we continue to run a very focused drilling rig program, with four rigs running in Gainesville, two in the Altamont field and two in the Eagle Ford. So you'll see growth from those areas while we continue to cash flow the remaining domestic assets. 
And as Doug noted, our drilling inventory has grown and that growth's come primarily from oil projects.
We've got a significant boost in the Wolfcamp shale program. And in a moment, I'll explain why we believe that our new Permian leases have tremendous potential. 
Production growth from the Haynesville in the Central division, Altamont in the Western division and Brazil drove the year-over-year increase in our third quarter volumes which you can see on Slide 21. The Gulf Coast is down because we're not reinvesting in our traditional programs and the ramp up in the Eagle Ford is not yet overcoming the base decline. Although in total, we're about where we expected for the Gulf Coast division. 
Cash costs were down 9%, with really good progress across the board. Our production operations in our Supply Chain team have continued to deliver cost efficiency improvements. 
So let's turn to the Eagle Ford program which continues to perform very well also. If you are not able to attend our recent field trip and perhaps you've seen the charts on our website, it provide a full review of the Eagle Ford play. The key takeaways from that presentation are that we have a very attractive acreage position that includes a lot of all the inventory. 
We now have two gas wells in the southern area and seven oil wells in the central area, with gross production of about 2,500 barrels a day of oil and 7.5 million a day of dry gas. The drilling results continue to be at or better than our pre-drill models. And in fact we're currently testing a Frio County well at over 700 barrels of oil and over 800 barrels of an equivalent basis. 
And currently we have six wells waiting to be completed and our dedicated frac crews in place here, so we expect to maintain a relatively low completion backlog. 
We drilled our first well in that Northern block in October and we'll complete it later this month. Wells in the northern county will be true oil wells and we expect the AURs in those to be like 300,000 barrels to 550,000 barrels. 
The resource potential here is significant. We've got about 250 million barrels of oil and liquids and about 1.8 TCF of gas on an unrisk basis. And given the size and the quality of our Eagle Ford acreage, coupled with our entry into the Wolfcamp shale play and our desire to maintain capital discipline, we're considering taking an Eagle Ford partner to help optimize the value of our inventory. 
We plan to keep two rigs running for the remainder of the year, add a third rig in 2011 and we plan to exit 2011 at five to six rigs and most of our near-term drilling is going to be oil-focused. 
With current pricing, this is our most valuable program and we're really happy with our returns and the oil production will become more meaningful to our volume mix as we go to 2011. 
Our Haynesville program continues to outperform others in the play. Our wells are still delivering about 30% more production than the industry average, and we've recently drilled a well to TD in 20 days and I don't think anyone else can come close to that drilling pace. 
On the last call, I talked about how we've entered into a two-year contract for a dedicated frac crew so we can eliminate delays and getting our wells completed and our completion backlog had grown to 16 wells in late August so we worked that backlog down to 12 wells which will benefit our production in the fourth quarter. And recently, our net production is been over 170 million a day. 
And while some companies are seeing a falloff in world productivity in the Haynesville, we're seeing very consistent IP rates in EURs and I continue to believe that's because we start with an advantaged acreage position that's right in the heart of the play and we continue to execute well on the completion and the production operations areas.
I'll keep all of my comments brief today since we'll have our scheduled call on November 18 at 4:30 Eastern time. Altamont remember is a huge resource originally about 3 billion barrels of oil in place. Only about 10% of that's been produced, so we're busy trying to increase recoveries from the field. This is a textbook continuous improvement story. We know the oil is there. We've got a large drilling inventory and we'll continue to drill wells faster and more cost effectively over time, and we'll continue to improve our completion design and well performance. So please join us for more regarding Altamont in a couple of weeks. 
And then a few weeks ago, we announced our new Permian basin oil program that we are very excited about in the Wolfcamp shale. On Slide 25 shows, we now have a significant position, roughly 135,000 net acres all in large contiguous blocks with a single royalty order, as Texas is part of that university land system. 
And we think we have more than 600 horizontal well locations, just in the upper proportion of the Wolfcamp assuming a 75% acreage utilization factor which should translate to more than 150 million barrels of oil equivalent resources. 
I'll show you a regional map in a moment. But one of the things we really liked about the play is that we're dealing with a known reservoir. There've been hundreds of successful vertical Wolfcamp producers in this area and there's plenty of existing infrastructure. 
So although it's still early days for a horizontal activity in the Wolfcamp, six horizontal wells have been drilled offset to our acreage with very encouraging results and we're tracking the current drilling activity in the area. 
We cored and tested one well before we riveted on the University leases. And although we had some mechanical problems during the completion, we got all the information we needed to confirm the high-quality of our lease area, relative to the region -- our regional view of the play. 
And then finally, we believe that while we've learned operationally in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford will be directly applicable to the development of the Wolfcamp. 
Let's get back a second, talk about why we targeted the Wolfcamp. Now earlier this year, as our Eagle Ford program was moving into the development phase, we took a small position in Crockett County to study and pilot test the Wolfcamp. That become initiative from our technology following the extensive review of the Wolfcamp shale across the entire Permian Basin where they literally included thousands off well logs and production histories over a 13-county study area. The map on Slide 26 shows a vertical Wolfcamp and Wolfberry production virtually surrounding our acreage. And not showing the map, as you move from north to south toward our blocks to Sprayberry above the Wolfcamp actually gets thinner and the Wolfcamp shale gets thicker.
In fact, the total upper and lower Wolfcamp shale is almost 1000 feet thick in places. So we're dealing with a known producing reservoir not just a note sorcerer, or better yet it's an oil plywood upside in all of the traditional vertically stacked Permian Basin oil reservoirs. 
When we compare and contrast the Wolfcamp shale to other shales, we see a lot of things we leprechaun table 24, highlights the shale reservoir's success factors and a number of things jump out at do. Shallower depth, so it's going to be cheaper and easier to drill, a very thick section, 400 to 850-foot of net thickness. And clearly we can't horizontally drill and complete a section this pic would wood one general but having a very thick section creates a possibility of a second phase of horizontal development in the lower portion of the Wolfcamp which would essentially double the resource potential. 
High organic content, we need organic material to generate hydrocarbons and a 4% to 15% indicates a very organic rich shale. high porosity with values ranging between 7% and 15% the Wolfcamp has high oil in place storage capacity. 
And then finally, low play content, we want shales that have high courts or carbonate content and low clay content. The courts and the carbonates form brittle rocks that are easier to and they tend to be more permeable. We all refer to the source also shows but what were really looking for our low play content shales. So the Wolfcamp has a lot of things to like and I believe it compares very favorably to some of the more established shale plays. 
Now another positive is its relative consistency of the Wolfcamp section across our acreage position. On Slide 28, we showed two logs from the northeast to the south -- of northwest rather to the southeast across our acreage spanning roughly 35 miles. Nonetheless remark the Sprayberry, the Dean, the upper and lower Wolfcamp sections and when our technical team was doing the original analysis, this consistency is part of what we are targeting for our acreage objectives. The logs tell us that the upper Wolfcamp has very good porosity and high organic content as we've discussed. And as importantly, it shows that this section is very consistent all the way across our acreage position. And that consistency is what led us to build a large acreage position quickly and allows for that kind of repeatable inventory that can deliver predictable well results and returns that we look for. 
Now we'll obviously experiment with drilling and completion designs. Slide 29 summarizes our current type well economics. At the midpoint, we've seen 7,500-foot vertical depths, 5,000 foot laterals, 16 frac stages, 160-acre spacing and completed well cost of about $5 million. We estimate initial producing rates of 250 to 300 equivalent barrels per day, although we've already seen as well as offset our blocks that are much higher than its. And those rates would translate to gross EURs of like 300,000 to 380,000 equivalent barrels. 
Ultimately, the program PVR should be in the 1.25 to 1.35 range assuming $70 oil and $4.50 gas and the IRRs should be in the 20% to 30% range. 
Now again our model only assumes developing the upper portion of the Wolfcamp with possible upside value from the lower Wolfcamp horizontal development and horizontal development on tighter than 160-acre spacing and then all the other vertically stacked oil sales in the Permian Basin. With all the resource potential on our new leases, we'll hopefully be talking about the Permian Basin for a long time.
Going forward, we plan to spread another well in November and I'll keep that rig active into 2011. The formula we've used in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford has worked well for us, so we intend to mirror that approach. We'll start with one rig and then we'll try different lateral links and numbers of frac stages and find ways to reduce drilling and completion cost and time. We're also be spotting was across our acreage to better understand our position and to improve our long-term plans. One of the great things of having a single very knowledgeable royalty owner is we can better optimize our development plan and we've already begun the process of unitizing the university plants. But using that approach a given success you should expect is to ramp up our drilling activity throughout 2011 Census what you've done in other core programs will now turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

We continue to make progress in executing on our pipeline backlog and not withstanding an anticipated cost overrun on the Ruby pipeline. We expect our growth backlog in total to be within 5% of its original budget. 
In Midstream, we continue to make progress on key projects in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford and are already seeing the benefit of Mark and his team's stewardship of our existing Midstream assets in Altamont and in Haynesville. 
And in E&P, Brent just outlined a great quarter, and lots of reasons to be optimistic about the balance of the year, as well as the longer-term. 
As we plan for 2011 capital spending in E&P, it's very likely that the bulk of our spending will be in areas that didn't even exist as a possibility three years ago. A much larger inventory comprised primarily of large core positions in areas where we are advantaged and have a track record of performance with much more exposure to oil. That constitutes a dramatic shift in competitive landscape over a very short period of time. 
On the balance sheet side, we expect to have covered off all our lower financing needs for 2011 in the next two months. All of these actions serve to increase our competitiveness even in a low gas price environment and we're not sitting still. We have more plan for the balance of the year, including as Brent alluded to the securing of a joint venture partner for our Eagle Ford acreage, allowing us to accelerate development and optimize our own invested capital. That concludes our prepared remarks this morning and now would be happy to open it up to your questions."

Occasionally, they'll go to litigation and it will be sorted out by an ALJ and the commission. But, I -- we have a very long history of being able to settle these cases at reasonable returns. If you think about where the commission is on returns these days, if you work through just the formulas, the dividend growth formula that they use with proxy groups in the world of low interest rates, you can come up with a little pressure downward on allowed returns. But over the long-term, if you look over a 10-to-15-year period, relative to those formulaic prices, the commission has tended to dampen those returns, both on the upside and downside. So that when we think about regulated type returns, we're in the 14% to 15% range pretax return on capital. And we'd expect something like that here."

That when you think about Ruby construction, you ought to focus on three variables. One is winter weather and what that means, with respect to construction productivity. A second is where we are on all these cultural clearances. And as I say, we've made some very good headway just in the last few weeks on that and we expect continued progress. And finally, the different biological windows, with respect to when you can build and when you can't build to avoid migratory birds and the like. The biggest near-term weather window we have there concerns big game, to the extent we have a normal winter. We think that we ought to be able to work through some of those big game windows.

The beginning of the impact of old coal retirements and the continued fall off in exports from Canada. And how assess the timing of that is I mean, this is a great deal of uncertainty. If I look at four, five of the big forecasters of just of U.S. production for 2011 and I think by the end of the year, they diversed by about five Bcf a day and it kind of a 60 Bcf a day market. So there's a lot of uncertainty, I think what we've tried to do is position ourselves so that we're not losing the optionality that we believe exist on a very favorable macro for gas in the long term.

So in the interest of time, I'll keep my opening comments brief. 
We made substantial progress against our goals this quarter and made several moves designed to position us for long-term success. 
In the pipes, we're definitely in execution mode right now with several key projects under construction. We expect our 2010 in-service projects to come in on time and substantially under budget, like 25% under budget. On Ruby, we're under construction of making good progress. As Jim will share with you in a minute, our delays getting started mean that we now expect to be over our original budget by 10% to 15%. We never like a project to be over, but the fact is we are on this one. 
As we told you from the beginning though, we view our backlog as a portfolio. And when you look at the entirety of the backlog, much of which is already completed or under construction, we expect to be within 5% or less of our original budget overall. We think that will put us at the head of the class in terms of new project execution, and Jim will go into more detail on that later. 
In E&P, we just continue to hit on all cylinders. Another good quarter operationally with volumes ahead of plan, unit costs trending down as our efforts of continuous improvement pay off and those same efforts in our drilling operations work to offset cost inflation. 
And in Midstream, Mark and his team continue to make progress, both with existing assets that he now has dominion over, as well as with key new projects in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford that we continue to move closer to the finish line. 
In addition to these more tactical things though, we made some strategic moves during the quarter that serve to increase our competitiveness and better position us for the long term. 
First, we added a new core area in E&P during the quarter with our substantial acreage acquisition in the emerging Wolfcamp play. This, combined with our Eagle Ford position and our consolidated position in the Altamont field, gives us a substantial increase in drilling inventory and at the same time a substantial increase in inventory with oil exposure. 
Second, we added to an already enviable price risk management position during the quarter, improving our line on gas in 2011 and 2012 and adding some hedges on oil in 2011, all at favorable prices that add certainty to our ability to generate the cash flow needed to fund both maintenance and growth capital, even in a poor gas price environment. 
And finally, we continue to accelerate our balance sheet improvement during the quarter, redeeming a large portion of the 5-year financing we did at the height of the financial crisis in late 2008, and continuing to grow El Paso Pipeline Partners or MLP. 
The combination of steps we've already taken combined with planned actions between now and the end of the year mean that we'll end the year having completely funded our 2011 plans, another key step as we move toward free cash in 2012. 
With those comments to set the stage, I'll turn it over to J.R. to review our financial performance. J.R.?"

As Doug just mentioned, we did have another good quarter with continued progress towards our long-term goals. During last quarter's call, I told you that we would not let our foot off the accelerator to our MLP strategy and",1163,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning. As Doug just mentioned, we did have another good quarter with continued progress towards our long-term goals. During last quarter's call, I told you that we would not let our foot off the accelerator to our MLP strategy and we haven't. Although I don't have a third drop-down transaction to announce yet, with more than $400 million in new equity capital, El Paso Pipeline Partners is eager to put the money to work. We are as well. Make no mistake about it. We have the stamina and commitment to maintain our accelerated pace. 
Shortly after our last call, we expanded our 2011 natural gas hedges and extended them into 2012. We took what was already a great hedge position and made it even better. Now remember, our hedges do not support our drilling economics, but instead support our balance sheet and cash flows. I'll show you our current hedges in a few minutes. 
Finally, as Doug said, we took advantage of the strong credit markets during the quarter and replaced about $350 million of the 12% 5-year notes we issued in the midst of the financial storm in December 2008 with 6.5% 10-year debt. 
We continue to look for similar opportunities that are aligned with our goal of accelerating balance sheet improvement. As a result of our success executing our 2010 financing plan and actions we anticipate completing before year end, we expect to have our 2011 funding requirements met before the end of the year. So let's look at our quarterly results beginning on Slide 6. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.22, which roughly flat with the year ago. Actual GAAP reported earnings for the quarter was $0.19 per diluted share and is always a complete reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to our GAAP reported financial measures as included on our website. 
In the Pipeline Group, adjusted EBIT increased 2% for the quarter, driven largely by the impact of expansion projects. The Elba Island expansion and Elba Express Pipeline representing nearly $1 billion in growth capital went into service earlier this year. In addition, pipeline results for the quarter reflect an increase in equity AFUDC or allowance for funds used during construction on the capital employed in our pipeline expansion projects that are not yet in service. AFUDC will continue to increase until the individual projects are placed in service.  These increases were somewhat offset by higher non-controlling interest expense, primarily resulting from our successful MLP drop-down strategy and a noncash asset write-down based on our recent FERC order on CIG. 
Finally, third quarter results for the pipelines reflect continued regional, economic, competitive and changing GAAP slowed challenges impacting EPNG and TGP. Jim will have more on these dynamics shortly. 
In E&P, adjusted EBIT was down $30 million from last year. Now if you judged E&P's third quarter performance based solely on earnings trends, you'd be making a mistake. The story for our E&P group this quarter continues to be about operational execution. More from Brent in a few minutes. 
So what are the headlines? Production up 4%, while unit cash cost decline 9%. The big difference is quarter-to-quarter, although we had a large portion of our 2009 gas production hedged with a $9 floor compared with a $6 floor this year. And oil hedged at $110 in 2009 versus $76 this year. Now don't get me wrong, with gas prices currently below $4, we're very pleased with our $6 hedges this year. 
Interest expense was flat quarter-over-quarter and down from our second quarter as I projected during the last call. 
One last point before we leave this slide. While adjusted EBIT was down slightly, adjusted EBITDA was up 4% for the reasons I just discussed. 
Let's turn to operating cash flow on Slide 7. Cash flow from operations year-to-date was below last year's level, primarily due to lower realized commodity prices and working capital changes. So far this year, our 2010 hedge program has contributed almost $250 million to operating cash flow, above what otherwise would be market levels. The result, estimated fiscal year 2010 operating cash flows that are ahead of the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Capital spending picked up during the quarter as we expected and we anticipate continuing this pace for the rest of the year. 
If you'll turn to Slide 8, you'll see the pipelines are running ahead of last year, again consistent with expectations, driven by the peak capital spending on the expansion backlog, notably Ruby. 
On the E&P side, we're up about $300 million from last year. You may recall that part of this is because we front loaded a portion of our 2010 capital program to get ahead of the expected cost increases. In addition, we acquired approximately 123,000 acres in the Wolfcamp oil shale during the quarter, almost -- for about $180 million. As we indicated when we announced the acquisition, we will fund the cost of entering the new play over time through portfolio rationalization. We've also made additional investments in the Eagle Ford acreage funded through reduced international spending. 
In the aggregate, we expect fiscal year 2010 CapEx to be essentially on budget before considering the significant strategic investment in the Wolfcamp shale. 
Finally, our liquidity remains very strong with $2.5 billion available at the end of September, not including cash or available credit facilities of our MLP for Ruby. 
As I mentioned earlier, we advanced an already good hedge position during the quarter to an even better one as shown on Slide 9. When we look at our 6x9 callers, we saw positions that were effectively $6 swaps in the current environment. Now with those option positions still has substantial value. Rather than simply watch the value erode over time, we leveraged that embedded value to our advantage. The bottom line is that we were able to increase our 2011 gas hedges to 75% at $6 and add new positions on 25% of our 2012 gas production at $6.36. Now just a reminder, the percentage hedged for all periods on this slide is based on estimated 2010 domestic production levels.
As we monitor industry hedging activity, we think our natural gas hedge positions are about as good as you'll see. 
I'll wrap it up with our oil hedges on Slide 10. Although we're generally bullish on longer-term oil prices, we remain prudent in minimizing downside risk when opportunities present themselves. We're about 95% hedged, with an $85 floor price in 2011 based on estimated 2010 production levels. 
As our production shifts more to oil in the future, expect us to continue to manage the price exposure of that increasing supply to support our balance sheet and cash flows. That's my update for you this morning. I'm pleased to have another good quarter under our belt and proud of the progress we've made. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the Pipeline Group. Jim?"

At the pipes, the third quarter was highlighted by continuing to execute on our backlog of growth projects. We advanced 3 more projects toward in-service in the fourth quarter and replaced them in service, as Doug said, on time and approximately 25% under budget. That's about $100 million under budget. 
The first of these, the WIC expansion, the free gas [ph] to Opal and into the Ruby pipeline was placed in-service on time on November 1. And we'll follow that up with a return expansion drilling in-service on December 1 and then the SNG South System expansion on January 1. 
On Ruby, although we've had some delays on obtaining cultural resources clearances, construction is moving ahead now on all spreads. And we've made good progress on the other projects in the backlog, including the other large ones for in-service during 2011. TGP's Line 300 expansion across Pennsylvania, Gulf LNG and the FGT Phase VIII expansion. 
We're also filing 2 new rate cases. Both of these are essentially the result of shifts in the way gas is flowing across the country. We just filed the rate case on EPNG and we'll final one on TGP most likely by the end of the month.
Let's look at throughput and these changes in flows on Slide 13. In total, throughput this year is down approximately 3% from 2009. And it's a mixed bag on our pipes across the country as you can see. I want to talk about a couple of throughput trends that are noteworthy and are driving the new rate cases. First, on TGP. While overall throughput is up, there's been a significant change in the sourcing of supplies. Receipts from Marcellus and Pennsylvania and REX and Ohio, together are up about 1.3 Bcf a day year-to-year. These receipts have displaced imports from Canada at Niagara and long-haul transport from the Gulf Coast. 
The impact of this on TGP is that short-haul and backhaul revenue out of Marcellus has increased, but long-haul commodity and interruptible transportation are down. Also TGP's revenue from gas not used in operations is lower due to both lower fuel volumes retained and obviously lower prices. Because of these changes, we'll file a rate case on TGP to fully recover revenue and structure rates that are more properly reflect the reality of today's gas flows. 
Secondly, on EPNG, the decline in throughput is somewhat a function of the economy in the Southwest, but it's also the result of increased pipeline competition and imports into California. Both from LNG arriving at Costa Azul and indirectly imports from Canada. In combination, this has resulted in lower freight rates available on short-term capacity sales, also some turning back of FT. And so we've recently filed a rate case on EPNG for new rates to be effective next spring.
Changing gas flows are a reality in today's gas market. And they have varying impacts on individual pipes. In general, because El Paso owns a large and diverse set of pipelines, we are better able to absorb these ongoing changes in market conditions. And remember that we have further protection because over 80% of our revenues come from monthly demand charges, and this percentage will likely further increase as TGP goes to a more traditional rate design in it's new rate case.
On Ruby, Slide 14. We're well underway with construction on all spreads. As you recall, we started construction on July 31. This is about 2 months later than planned and after a 2.5 year review process by BLM, FERC and the various federal state and local agencies. We now have 8 construction spreads working on Ruby. Having out of the spread in one of the more mountainous areas of Utah to complete that section before winter. That section so called Spread 2 is proceeding very well. Ditching and pipe stringing are approximately 3 quarters complete and the welding of the pipe sections about 2/3 complete. 
As shown on the photos, a lot is going on across the entire pipeline route. Some clearing and grading, ditching, stringing and some lowering end of the pipe. Our 2 man camps are up and running in Western Nevada and Oregon to house and support up to 1,000 men throughout construction. So we have a lot of activity ongoing on all spreads.
In general, on Slide 15, construction is progressing very well on the eastern spreads and slower than expected on the western spreads in parts of Nevada and Oregon. On the western spreads, we've had some delays in obtaining cultural resource clearances. This in turn has restricted our construction activity there. We recently had over 150 archaeologists in the field and now the permitting process is improved. In Nevada and Oregon, we now have access to over half the right of way. We continue to get more released on a regular basis in Nevada. And in Oregon, we're seeing improvement in the permit approval timelines. As part of this process, Ruby continues to work with the tribes and their concerns about cultural disturbances. 
Separately, our construction station construction -- our compression station construction is going very well, and all 4 of our stations nearly, all of the major equipment has been set on their foundations.
With respect to cost and schedule, as Doug said, we now expect Ruby to be 10% to 15% over budget, primarily due to the delays. And our target in-service is next June. The key variables will be weather this winter, the pace of getting final regulatory clearances and the dealing with various construction restrictions due to fish and game habitat or nesting periods. 
In sum on Ruby, construction activity continues to ramp up. And as you know, both we and our major contractors are incentivized and focused on construction productivity.
Finally, Slide 16. Slide 16 summarizes our multi-year major pipeline expansion program, both our performance to date and expectations. Our projects for in-service this year are either complete or nearing completion as scheduled.
As I mentioned, these 4 projects as a group will be approximately $100 million under budget. 
For the 5 projects that will go in-service next year, all are well under construction. And other than Ruby, all are essentially on budget. And at this point, they have been substantially de-risked with essentially all the pipe delivered and all the construction contracts in place, either fixed price, unit price or incentive based. 
While it's a little early to talk about progress on our projects to go in-service in 2012 and beyond, note that these are primarily lower risk pipeline looping and compression projects. 
So as Doug said, in total, this multi-year capital program including Ruby is expected to be within 5% of budget, and this holds whether considering gross CapEx or CapEx net to El Paso. And you're aware that these projects have also been de-risked on the market side. As a group, they are approximately 90% subscribed under long-term contracts with high-quality customers. 
So our focus at the pipes is a very clear one. It's executing on all these growth projects. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to update you on the Midstream business."

Well, it's been a year since we announced our intention to reenter the Midstream business, and I'm happy to report that we're making visible progress on several fronts. We're now operating and in fact expanding our gathering system in the Eagle Ford, which will have a capacity of about a 150 million a day. In the Haynesville, we have a 70 million a day gathering system that delivers to Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and we're about to begin construction on our 150 million a day aiming treater[ph]. 
In the Uinta Basin of Utah, we have the Altamont gathering and processing system which gathers associated gas from this oil field and has about 800 miles of gathering line, 40 million a day gas processing plant and just under 4,000 barrels a day of fractionation capacity. In all 3 of these areas, we're evaluating future growth needs of El Paso's E&P company, and we're being very successful in pursuing third-party opportunities. 
We're in particularly excited about the growth potential in the Altamont system, which we'll talk more about on our upcoming Altamont Analyst Call. 
We have 2 major shale infrastructure projects under development, one in the Marcellus and one for the Eagle Ford. As you may have seen from our recent press release, we joined forces with Spectra to leverage more existing assets to make the Marcellus Ethane Pipeline System as competitive as possible. In the case of El Paso, we'll convert a Tennessee Gas mainline that is underutilized, primarily due to changes in flows discussed by Jim. And for Spectra, we'll contribute excess Tetco right away in the northeast. 
At this point, we continue discussions with producers and petrochemical plant operators to assess demand for capacity either Mont Belvieu or Lake Charles or Baton Rouge. So depending on how discussions with these potential customers go, we would hope to have a binding open season later this year and then sanction of project shortly thereafter. 
The Camino Real Pipeline is a 600 million a day project. They'll gather and process rich Eagle Ford Shale gas with new pipelines that will tie into Tennessee Gas Pipeline that has existing capacity near Victoria, Texas. The gas will then move north on Tennessee to Paul County, where we'll build a project processing plant.  The NGLs will be shipped to Mont Belvieu via pipeline. We're actively marketing this project to Eagle Ford producers.
The business that we're building and the project we're developing are very attractive, and we've been approached by industry and financial players wanting to participate with us in one form or another. We're evaluating these partnering opportunities to not only enhance our business prospects, but to manage our capital requirements. 
So you can see we're starting to gain momentum on several fronts. And in all cases, we're leveraging El Paso's asset base to provide synergies, build value for El Paso and enable the MEPS and Camino Real Pipeline to be competitive solutions for Marcellus and Eagle Ford producers.

Production was up from a year ago and we're tracking toward the high end of our full year guidance range of 760 million to 780 million a day equivalent. Cash costs",2065,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.
I'm proud to report another good E&P quarter. Production was up from a year ago and we're tracking toward the high end of our full year guidance range of 760 million to 780 million a day equivalent. 
Cash costs were down, as J.R. mentioned in Q3, and we've reduced our full year guidance range again to a $1.75 to a $1.85. And as I mentioned on the last quarter call, we continue to run a very focused drilling rig program with 4 rigs running in the Haynesville, 2 in the Altamont field and 2 in the Eagle Ford. So you'll see growth from those areas while we continue to cash flow the remaining domestic assets. 
And as Doug noted, our drilling inventory has grown and that growths come primarily from oil projects.
We've got a significant boost on the Wolfcamp shale program. And in a moment, I'll explain why we believe that our new Permian leases have tremendous potential. 
Production growth from the Haynesville in the Central Division, Altamont in the Western Division and Brazil drove the year-over-year increase in our third quarter volumes, which you can see on Slide 21. The Gulf Coast is down because we're not reinvesting in our traditional programs and the ramp up in the Eagle Ford is not yet overcome in the base decline. Although in total, we're about where we expected for the Gulf Coast division. 
Cash costs were down 9% with really good progress across the board. Our production operations and our supply chain teams have continued to deliver cost efficiency improvements. 
So let's turn to the Eagle Ford program which continues to perform very well also. If you were not able to attend our recent field trip, then perhaps you've seen the charts on our website that provide a full review of the Eagle Ford play. The key takeaways from that presentation are that we have a very attractive acreage position that includes a lot of oily inventory. 
We now have 2 gas wells in the southern area and 7 oil wells in the Central area with gross production of about 2,500 barrels a day of oil and 7.5 million a day of dry gas. The drilling results continue to be at or better than our pre-drill models. And in fact, we're currently testing a Frio County well at over 700 barrels of oil and over 800 barrels on an equivalent basis. 
And currently, we have 6 wells waiting to be completed and our dedicated frac crew is in place here, so we expect to maintain a relatively low completion backlog. 
We drilled our first well in that northern block in October and we'll complete it later this month. Wells in the northern counties will be true oil wells and we'd expect the EURs in those to be like 300,000 to 550,000 barrels. 
The resource potential here is significant. We've got about 250 million barrels of oil and liquids and about 1.8 Tcf of gas on an unrisk basis. And given the size and the quality of our Eagle Ford acreage, coupled with our entry into the Wolfcamp shale play and our desire to maintain capital discipline, we're considering taking an Eagle Ford partner to help optimize the value of our inventory. 
We plan to keep 2 rigs running for the remainder of the year, add a third rig in 2011 and we plan to exit 2011 at 5 to 6 rigs. And most of our near-term drilling is going to be oil focused. 
With current pricing, this is our most valuable program, and we're really happy with our returns and the oil production will become more meaningful to our volume mix as we go through 2011. 
Our Haynesville program continues to outperform others in the play. Our wells are still delivering about 30% more production than the industry average, and we've recently drilled a well to TD in 20 days, and I don't think anyone else can come close to that drilling pace. 
On the last call, I talked about how we'd entered into a 2-year contract for a dedicated frac crew so that we could eliminate delays and getting our wells completed. And our completion backlog had grown to 16 wells in late August, so we worked that backlog down to 12 wells which will benefit our production in the fourth quarter. And recently, our net production has been over 170 million a day. 
Now while some companies are seeing a falloff in oil productivity in the Haynesville, we're seeing very consistent IP rates and EURs, and I continue to believe that's because we start with an advantaged acreage position that's right in the heart of the play and then we continue to execute well on the completion in the production operations areas.
I'll keep my Altamont comments brief today since we'll have our scheduled call on November 18 at 4:30 Eastern Time. Altamont, remember, is a huge resource originally about 3 billion barrels of oil in place. Only about 10% of that's been produced, so we're busy trying to increase recoveries from the field. This is a textbook continuous improvement story. We know the oil is there. We've got a large drilling inventory and we'll continue to drill wells faster and more cost effectively over time, and we'll continue to improve our completion design and well performance. So please join us for more regarding Altamont in a couple of weeks. 
And then a few weeks ago, we announced our new Permian Basin oil program that we're very excited about in the Wolfcamp shale. Slide 25 shows we now have a significant position, roughly 135,000 net acres all in large contiguous blocks with a single royalty owner as the State of Texas is part of the University Land System. 
Now we think we have more than 600 horizontal well locations just in the upper portion of the Wolfcamp, assuming a 75% acreage utilization factor which should translate to more than 150 million barrels of oil equivalent resources. 
I'll show you a regional map in a moment, but one of the things we really liked about the play is that we're dealing with a known reservoir. There have been hundreds of successful vertical Wolfcamp producers in this area and there's plenty of existing infrastructure. So although it's still very early days for horizontal activity in the Wolfcamp, 6 horizontal wells have been drilled offset to our acreage with very encouraging results, and we're tracking the current drilling activity in the area. 
We cored and tested one well before we bid on the university leases. And although we had some mechanical problems during the completion, we got all the information we needed to confirm the high quality of our lease area relative to the region -- our regional view of the play. 
And then finally, we believe that while we've learned operationally in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford will be directly applicable to the development of the Wolfcamp. 
Let's get back a second and talk about why we targeted the Wolfcamp. Now earlier this year as our Eagle Ford program was moving into the development phase, we took a small position in Crockett County to study and pilot test the Wolfcamp. That recommendation came from our technical team following the extensive review of the Wolfcamp shale across the entire Permian Basin where they literally included thousands of oil logs and production histories over a 13-county study area.  
The map on Slide 26 shows a vertical Wolfcamp and Wolfberry production virtually surrounding our acreage. And not shown on the map, as you move from north to south toward our blocks to Sprayberry above the Wolfcamp actually gets thinner and the Wolfcamp shale gets thicker. In fact, the total upper and lower Wolfcamp shale interval is almost 1,000 feet thick in places. So we're dealing with a known producing reservoir not just a known source rock, and better yet it's an oil play with upside and all of the traditional vertically stacked Permian Basin oil reservoirs. 
Let we compare and contrast the Wolfcamp shale to other shales, we see a lot of things we like. On table 24, highlights the shale reservoir success factors, and a number of things jump out at you. Shallower depth, so it's going to be cheaper and easier to drill; a very thick section, 400 to 850 foot of net thickness; and clearly we can't horizontally drill and complete a section this thick with one lateral. But having a very thick section creates a possibility of a second phase of horizontal development in the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, which would essentially double the resource potential. 
High organic content, we need organic material to generate hydrocarbons, and a 4% to 15% indicates a very organic rich shale. High porosity with values ranging between 7% and 15%, the Wolfcamp has high oil in place storage capacity. 
And then finally, low clay content. We want shales that have high quartz or carbonate content and low clay content. The quartz and the carbonates form brittle rocks that are easier to hydraulically frac and they tend to be more porous and permeable. We all refer to the source rocks as shales, but what we're really looking for are low clay content shales. So the Wolfcamp has a lot of things to like and I believe it compares very favorably to some of the more established shale plays. 
Now another positive is its relative consistency of the Wolfcamp section across our acreage position. On Slide 28, we showed 2 logs from the northeast to the south -- northwest rather to the southeast across our acreage, spanning roughly 35 miles. Now the laws we marked to Sprayberry, the Dean, the upper and lower Wolfcamp sections. And when our technical team was doing their original analysis, this consistency is part of what we were targeting for our acreage objectives. The laws will tell us -- the laws tell us that the upper Wolfcamp has very good porosity and high organic content as we've discussed. And as importantly, it shows that this section is very consistent all the way across our acreage position. And that consistency is what led us to build a large acreage position quickly, and allows for the kind of repeatable inventory that can deliver predictable well results and returns that we look for. 
Now we'll obviously experiment with drilling and completion designs, but Slide 29 summarizes our current type well economics. At the midpoints, we've seen 7,500-foot vertical depths, 5,000-foot laterals, 16 frac stages, 160-acre spacing and completed well cost of about $5 million. We estimate initial producing rates of 250 to 300 equivalent barrels per day, although we've already seen wells offset our block that are much higher than this. And those rates would translate to gross EURs of like 300,000 to 380,000 equivalent barrels. 
Ultimately, the program PVR should be in the 1.25 to 1.35 range assuming $70 oil and $4.50 gas and the IRR should be in the 20% to 30% range. 
Now again, our model only assumes developing the upper portion of the Wolfcamp with possible upside value from the lower Wolfcamp horizontal development and horizontal development on tighter than 160-acre spacing and then all the other vertically stacked oil zones in the Permian Basin. With all the resource potential on our new leases, we'll hopefully be talking about the Permian Basin for a long time.
Going forward, we plan to spud another well in November and keep that rig active into 2011. The formula we've used in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford has worked well for us, so we intend to mirror that approach. We'll start with one rig and then we'll try different lateral links and numbers of frac stages and then find ways to reduce drilling and completion cost and time. We'll also be spudding wells across our acreage to better understand our position and to improve our long-term plans. One of the great things about having a single very knowledgeable royalty owner is that we can better optimize our development plan and we've already begun the process of unitizing the university lands. By using that approach and given success, you should expect us to ramp up our drilling activity throughout 2011, just as we've done in our other core programs. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

In Midstream, we continue to make progress on key projects in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford and are already seeing the benefit of Mark and his team's stewardship of our existing Midstream assets in Altamont and in Haynesville. 
And in E&P, Brent just outlined a great quarter and lots of reasons to be optimistic about the balance of the year, as well as the longer term. 
As we plan for 2011 capital spending in E&P, it's very likely that the bulk of our spending will be in areas that didn't even exist as a possibility 3 years ago. A much larger inventory comprised primarily of large core positions in areas where we're advantaged and have a track record of performance with much more exposure to oil. That constitutes a dramatic shift in the competitive landscape over a very short period of time. 
On the balance sheet side, we expect to have covered off all our financing needs for 2011 in the next 2 months. All of these actions serve to increase our competitiveness even in a low gas price environment and we're not sitting still. We have more plan for the balance of the year, including as Brent alluded to the securing of a joint venture partner for our Eagle Ford acreage, allowing us to accelerate development and optimize our own invested capital.

If you think about where the commission is on returns these days, if you work through just the formulas, the dividend growth formula that they use with proxy groups in the world of low interest rates, you can come up with a little pressure downward on allowed returns. But over the long term, if you look over a 10- to 15-year period, relative to those formulaic prices, the commission has tended to dampen those returns, both on the upside and downside.

But with respect to milestones, we're going to know a lot more when we get into, say, February, March, maybe January, February, March. When you think about Ruby construction, you ought to focus on 3 variables. One is winter weather and what that means with respect to construction productivity. A second is where we are on all these cultural clearances. And as I say, we've made some very good headway just in the last few weeks on that and we expect continued progress. And finally, the different biological windows with respect to when you can build and when you can't build to avoid migratory birds and the like. The biggest near-term weather window we have there concerns big game to the extent we have a normal winter. We think that we ought to be able to work through some of those big game windows. And if it were more severe and some of the elk or whatever had to come down and do some grazing on lower areas, we'd have some more issues. But those are the 3 things to look for.

I looked at 4 or 5 of the big forecasters of just of U.S. production for 2011 and I think by the end of the year they diverse by about 5 Bcf a day and a kind of a 60 Bcf a day market. So there's a lot of uncertainty. I think what we've tried to do is position ourselves so that we're not losing the optionality that we believe exist on a very favorable macro for gas in the long term.

We have a lot of things to cover on the operational side this morning so in the interest of time, I'll keep my opening comments brief. 
We made substantial progress against our goals this quarter and made several moves designed to position us for long-term success. 
In the pipes, we're definitely in execution mode right now with several key projects under construction. We expect our 2010 in-service projects to come in on time and substantially under budget, like 25% under budget. On Ruby, we're under construction and making good progress. As Jim will share with you in a minute, our delays getting started mean that we now expect to be over our original budget by 10% to 15%. We never like a project to be over but the fact is, we are on this one. 
As we told you from the beginning though, we view our backlog as a portfolio. And when you look at the entirety of the backlog, much of which is already completed or under construction, we expect to be within 5% or less of our original budget overall. We think that will put us at the head of the class in terms of new project execution, and Jim will go into more detail on that later. 
In E&P, we just continue to hit on all cylinders. Another good quarter operationally with volumes ahead of plan, unit costs trending down as our efforts of continuous improvement pay off and those same efforts in our drilling operations work to offset cost inflation. 
And in Midstream, Mark and his team continue to make progress, both with existing assets that he now has dominion over, as well as with key new projects in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford that we continue to move closer to the finish line. 
In addition to these more tactical things though, we made some strategic moves during the quarter that serve to increase our competitiveness and better position us for the long term. 
First, we added a new core area in E&P during the quarter with our substantial acreage acquisition in the emerging Wolfcamp play. This, combined with our Eagle Ford position and our consolidated position in the Altamont field, gives us a substantial increase in drilling inventory and at the same time a substantial increase in inventory with oil exposure. 
Second, we added to an already enviable price risk management position during the quarter, improving our line on gas in 2011 and 2012 and adding some hedges on oil in 2011, all at favorable prices that add certainty to our ability to generate the cash flow needed to fund both maintenance and growth capital, even in a poor gas price environment. 
And finally, we continue to accelerate our balance sheet improvement during the quarter, redeeming a large portion of the 5-year financing we did at the height of the financial crisis in late 2008, and continuing to grow El Paso Pipeline Partners or MLP. 
The combination of steps we've already taken combined with planned actions between now and the end of the year mean that we'll end the year having completely funded our 2011 plans, another key step as we move toward free cash in 2012. 
With those comments to set the stage, I'll turn it over to J.R. to review our financial performance. J.R.?"

As Doug just mentioned, we did have another good quarter with continued progress towards our long-term goals. During last quarter's call, I told you that we would not let our foot off the accelerator to our MLP strategy and",1162,"Thanks, Doug, and good morning. As Doug just mentioned, we did have another good quarter with continued progress towards our long-term goals. During last quarter's call, I told you that we would not let our foot off the accelerator to our MLP strategy and we haven't. Although I don't have a third drop-down transaction to announce yet, with more than $400 million in new equity capital, El Paso Pipeline Partners is eager to put the money to work. We are as well. Make no mistake about it, we have the stamina and commitment to maintain our accelerated pace. 
Shortly after our last call, we expanded our 2011 natural gas hedges and extended them into 2012. We took what was already a great hedge position and made it even better. Now remember, our hedges do not support our drilling economics, but instead support our balance sheet and cash flows. I'll show you our current hedges in a few minutes. 
Finally as Doug said, we took advantage of the strong credit markets during the quarter and replaced about $350 million of the 12% 5-year notes we issued in the midst of the financial storm in December 2008 with 6.5% 10-year debt. 
We continue to look for similar opportunities that are aligned with our goal of accelerating balance sheet improvement. As a result of our success executing our 2010 financing plan and actions we anticipate completing before year end, we expect to have our 2011 funding requirements met before the end of the year. So let's look at our quarterly results beginning on Slide 6. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.22, which is roughly flat with the year ago. Actual GAAP reported earnings for the quarter was $0.19 per diluted share and as always, a complete reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to our GAAP reported financial measures is included on our website. 
In the Pipeline Group, adjusted EBIT increased 2% for the quarter, driven largely by the impact of expansion projects. The Elba Island expansion and Elba Express Pipeline, representing nearly $1 billion in growth capital, went into service earlier this year. In addition, pipeline results for the quarter reflect an increase in equity AFUDC or allowance for funds used during construction on the capital employed in our pipeline expansion projects that are not yet in service. AFUDC will continue to increase until the individual projects are placed in service.  These increases were somewhat offset by higher non-controlling interest expense, primarily resulting from our successful MLP drop-down strategy and a noncash asset write-down based on our recent FERC order on CIG. 
Finally, third quarter results for the pipelines reflect continued regional, economic, competitive and changing GAAP slowed challenges impacting EPNG and TGP. Jim will have more on these dynamics shortly. 
In E&P, adjusted EBIT was down $30 million from last year. Now if you judged E&P's third quarter performance based solely on earnings trends, you'd be making a mistake. The story for our E&P group this quarter continues to be about operational execution. More from Brent in a few minutes. 
So what are the headlines? Production up 4%, while unit cash costs declined 9%. The big difference is quarter-to-quarter, although we had a large portion of our 2009 gas production hedged with a $9 floor compared with a $6 floor this year. And oil hedged at $110 in 2009 versus $76 this year. Now don't get me wrong, with gas prices currently below $4, we're very pleased with our $6 hedges this year. 
Interest expense was flat quarter-over-quarter and down from our second quarter as I projected during the last call. 
One last point before we leave this slide. While adjusted EBIT was down slightly, adjusted EBITDA was up 4% for the reasons I just discussed. 
Let's turn to operating cash flow on Slide 7. Cash flow from operations year-to-date was below last year's level, primarily due to lower realized commodity prices and working capital changes. So far this year, our 2010 hedge program has contributed almost $250 million to operating cash flow, above what otherwise would be market levels. The result, estimated fiscal year 2010 operating cash flows that are ahead of the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Capital spending picked up during the quarter as we expected and we anticipate continuing this pace for the rest of the year. 
If you'll turn to Slide 8, you'll see the pipelines are running ahead of last year, again consistent with expectations, driven by the peak capital spending on the expansion backlog, notably Ruby. 
On the E&P side, we're up about $300 million from last year. You may recall that part of this is because we front loaded a portion of our 2010 capital program to get ahead of the expected cost increases. In addition, we acquired approximately 123,000 acres in the Wolfcamp oil shale during the quarter, almost -- for about $180 million. As we indicated when we announced the acquisition, we will fund the cost of entering the new play over time through portfolio rationalization. We've also made additional investments in the Eagle Ford acreage funded through reduced international spending. 
In the aggregate, we expect fiscal year 2010 CapEx to be essentially on budget before considering the significant strategic investment in the Wolfcamp shale. 
Finally, our liquidity remains very strong with $2.5 billion available at the end of September, not including cash or available credit facilities of our MLP for Ruby. 
As I mentioned earlier, we advanced an already good hedge position during the quarter to an even better one as shown on Slide 9. When we look at our 6x9 collars, we saw positions that were effectively $6 swaps in the current environment. However those option positions still have substantial value. Rather than simply watch the value erode over time, we leveraged that embedded value to our advantage. The bottom line is that we were able to increase our 2011 gas hedges to 75% at $6 and add new positions on 25% of our 2012 gas production at $6.36. Now just a reminder, the percentage hedged for all periods on this slide is based on estimated 2010 domestic production levels.
As we monitor industry-hedging activity, we think our natural gas hedge positions are about as good as you'll see. 
I'll wrap it up with our oil hedges on Slide 10. Although we're generally bullish on longer-term oil prices, we remain prudent in minimizing downside risk when opportunities present themselves. We're about 95% hedged, with an $85 floor price in 2011 based on estimated 2010 production levels. 
As our production shifts more to oil in the future, expect us to continue to manage the price exposure of that increasing supply to support our balance sheet and cash flows. That's my update for you this morning. I'm pleased to have another good quarter under our belt and proud of the progress we've made. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an update on the Pipeline Group. Jim?"

For the pipes, the third quarter was highlighted by continuing to execute on our backlog of growth projects. We advanced 3 more projects toward in-service in the fourth quarter and will place them in service, as Doug said, on time and approximately 25% under budget. That's about $100 million under budget. 
The first of these, the WIC expansion, that will feed gas to Opal and into the Ruby pipeline, was placed in-service on time on November 1. And we'll follow that up with the Raton expansion drilling in-service on December 1 and then the SNG South System expansion on January 1. 
On Ruby, although we've had some delays in obtaining cultural resources clearances, construction is moving ahead now on all spreads. And we've made good progress on the other projects in the backlog, including the other large ones for in-service during 2011, TGP's Line 300 expansion across Pennsylvania, Gulf LNG and the FGT Phase VIII expansion. 
We're also filing 2 new rate cases. Both of these are essentially the result of shifts in the way gas is flowing across the country. We just filed the rate case on EPNG and we'll file one on TGP most likely by the end of the month.
Let's look at throughput and these changes in flows on Slide 13. In total, throughput this year is down approximately 3% from 2009. And it's a mixed bag on our pipes across the country, as you can see. I want to talk about a couple of throughput trends that are noteworthy and are driving the new rate cases. 
First, on TGP. While overall throughput is up, there's been a significant change in the sourcing of supplies. Receipts from Marcellus and Pennsylvania and REX and Ohio together are up about 1.3 Bcf a day year-to-year. These receipts have displaced imports from Canada at Niagara and long-haul transport from the Gulf Coast. 
The impact of this on TGP is that short-haul and backhaul revenue out of Marcellus has increased, but long-haul commodity and interruptible transportation are down. Also TGP's revenue from gas not used in operations is lower due to both lower fuel volumes retained and obviously lower prices. Because of these changes, we'll file a rate case on TGP to fully recover revenue and structure rates that will more properly reflect the reality of today's gas flows. 
Secondly on EPNG, the decline in throughput is somewhat a function of the economy in the Southwest, but it's also the result of increased pipeline competition and imports into California. Both from LNG arriving at Costa Azul and indirectly imports from Canada. In combination, this has resulted in lower freight rates available on short-term capacity sales, also some turning back of FT. And so we've recently filed a rate case on EPNG for new rates to be effective next spring.
Changing gas flows are a reality in today's gas market, and they have varying impacts on individual pipes. In general, because El Paso owns a large and diverse set of pipelines, we are better able to absorb these ongoing changes in market conditions. And remember that we have further protection because over 80% of our revenues come from monthly demand charges, and this percentage will likely further increase as TGP goes to a more traditional rate design in it's new rate case.
On Ruby, Slide 14. We're well underway with construction on all spreads. As you recall, we started construction on July 31. This was about 2 months later than planned and after a 2.5 year review process by BLM, FERC and the various federal state and local agencies. We now have 8 construction spreads working on Ruby, coming out of the spread in one of the more mountainous areas of Utah to complete that section before winter. That section, so called Spread 2, is proceeding very well. Ditching and pipe stringing are approximately 3/4 complete and the welding of the pipe sections about 2/3 complete. 
As shown in the photos, a lot's going on across the entire pipeline route. Some clearing and grading, ditching, stringing and some lowering end of the pipe. Our 2 man camps are up and running in Western Nevada and Oregon to house and support up to 1,000 men throughout construction. So we have a lot of activity ongoing on all spreads.
In general on Slide 15, construction is progressing very well on the eastern spreads and slower than expected on the western spreads in parts of Nevada and Oregon. On the western spreads, we've had some delays in obtaining cultural resource clearances. This in turn has restricted our construction activity there. We recently had over 150 archaeologists in the field and now the permitting process is improved. In Nevada and Oregon, we now have access to over half the right of way. We continue to get more released on a regular basis in Nevada. And in Oregon, we're seeing improvement in the permit approval timelines. As part of this process, Ruby continues to work with the tribes and their concerns about cultural disturbances. 
Separately, our construction station construction -- our compression station construction is going very well. In all 4 of our stations, nearly all of the major equipment has been set on their foundations.
With respect to cost and schedule, as Doug said, we now expect Ruby to be 10% to 15% over budget, primarily due to the delays. And our target in-service is next June. The key variables will be weather this winter, the pace of getting final regulatory clearances and dealing with various construction restrictions due to fish and game habitat or nesting periods. 
In sum on Ruby, construction activity continues to ramp up. And as you know, both we and our major contractors are incentivized and focused on construction productivity.
Finally, Slide 16. Slide 16 summarizes our multi-year major pipeline expansion program, both our performance to date and expectations. Our projects for in-service this year are either complete or nearing completion as scheduled.
As I mentioned, these 4 projects as a group will be approximately $100 million under budget. 
For the 5 projects that will go in-service next year, all are well under construction and other than Ruby, all are essentially on budget. And at this point, they've been substantially de-risked with essentially all the pipe delivered and all the construction contracts in place, either fixed price, unit price or incentive based. 
While it's a little early to talk about progress on our projects to go in-service in 2012 and beyond, note that these are primarily lower risk pipeline looping and compression projects. 
So as Doug said, in total, this multi-year capital program, including Ruby, is expected to be within 5% of budget, and this holds whether considering gross CapEx or CapEx net to El Paso. And you're aware that these projects have also been de-risked on the market side. As a group, they are approximately 90% subscribed under long-term contracts with high-quality customers. 
So our focus at the pipes is a very clear one. It's executing on all these growth projects. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to update you on the Midstream business."

Well, it's been a year since we announced our intention to reenter the Midstream business, and I'm happy to report that we're making visible progress on several fronts. We're now operating and in fact expanding our gathering system in the Eagle Ford, which will have a capacity of about a 150 million a day. In the Haynesville, we have a 70 million a day gathering system that delivers to Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and we're about to begin construction on our 150 million a day aiming treater [ph]. 
In the Uinta Basin of Utah, we have the Altamont gathering and processing system which gathers associated gas from this oil field and has about 800 miles of gathering line, 40 million a day gas processing plant and just under 4,000 barrels a day of fractionation capacity. In all 3 of these areas, we're evaluating future growth needs of El Paso's E&P company and we're being very successful in pursuing third-party opportunities. 
We're particularly excited about the growth potential in the Altamont system, which we'll talk more about on our upcoming Altamont Analyst Call. 
We have 2 major shale infrastructure projects under development, one in the Marcellus and one for the Eagle Ford. As you may have seen from our recent press release, we joined forces with Spectra to leverage more existing assets to make the Marcellus Ethane Pipeline System as competitive as possible. In the case of El Paso, we'll convert a Tennessee Gas mainline that is underutilized, primarily due to changes in flows discussed by Jim. And for Spectra, we'll contribute excess Tetco right away in the northeast. 
At this point, we continue discussions with producers and petrochemical plant operators to assess demand for capacity either Mont Belvieu or Lake Charles or Baton Rouge. So depending on how discussions with these potential customers go, we would hope to have a binding open season later this year and then sanction the project shortly thereafter. 
The Camino Real Pipeline is a 600 million a day project. They'll gather and process rich Eagle Ford Shale gas with new pipelines that will tie into Tennessee Gas Pipeline that has existing capacity near Victoria, Texas. The gas will then move north on Tennessee to Paul County, where we'll build a project processing plant.  The NGLs will be shipped to Mont Belvieu via pipeline. We're actively marketing this project to Eagle Ford producers.
The business that we're building and the projects we're developing are very attractive, and we've been approached by industry and financial players wanting to participate with us in one form or another. We're evaluating these partnering opportunities to not only enhance our business prospects, but to manage our capital requirements. 
So you can see we're starting to gain momentum on several fronts and in all cases, we're leveraging El Paso's asset base to provide synergies, build value for El Paso and enable the MEPS and Camino Real Pipeline to be competitive solutions for Marcellus and Eagle Ford producers. 
With my first Midstream update complete, I'll turn the call over to Brent."
1038355,85200916,163159,"El Paso Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","El Paso LLC","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm proud to report another good E&P quarter. Production was up from a year ago and we're tracking toward the high end of our full year guidance range of 760 million to 780 million a day equivalent. Cash costs w",2063,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm proud to report another good E&P quarter. Production was up from a year ago and we're tracking toward the high end of our full year guidance range of 760 million to 780 million a day equivalent. 
Cash costs were down, as J.R. mentioned, in Q3 and we've reduced our full year guidance range again to a $1.75 to $1.85. And as I mentioned on the last quarter call, we continue to run a very focused drilling rig program with 4 rigs running in the Haynesville, 2 in the Altamont field and 2 in the Eagle Ford. So you'll see growth from those areas while we continue to cash flow the remaining domestic assets. 
And as Doug noted, our drilling inventory has grown and that growth's come primarily from oil projects.
We got a significant boost on the Wolfcamp shale program and in a moment, I'll explain why we believe that our new Permian leases have tremendous potential. 
Production growth from the Haynesville in the Central Division, Altamont in the Western Division and Brazil drove the year-over-year increase in our third quarter volumes, which you can see on Slide 21. The Gulf Coast is down because we're not reinvesting in our traditional programs and the ramp up in the Eagle Ford is not yet overcoming the base decline. Although in total, we're about where we expected for the Gulf Coast division. 
Cash costs were down 9% with really good progress across the board. Our production operations and our supply chain teams have continued to deliver cost efficiency improvements. 
So let's turn to the Eagle Ford program which continues to perform very well also. If you were not able to attend our recent field trip, then perhaps you've seen the charts on our website that provide a full review of the Eagle Ford play. The key takeaways from that presentation are that we have a very attractive acreage position that includes a lot of oily inventory. 
We now have 2 gas wells in the southern area and 7 oil wells in the Central area with gross production of about 2,500 barrels a day of oil and 7.5 million a day of dry gas. The drilling results continue to be at or better than our pre-drill models. And in fact, we're currently testing a Frio County well at over 700 barrels of oil and over 800 barrels on an equivalent basis. 
And currently, we have 6 wells waiting to be completed and our dedicated frac crew is in place here, so we expect to maintain a relatively low completion backlog. 
We drilled our first well in that northern block in October and we'll complete it later this month. Wells in the northern counties will be true oil wells and we'd expect the EURs in those to be like 300,000 to 550,000 barrels. 
The resource potential here is significant. We've got about 250 million barrels of oil and liquids and about 1.8 Tcf of gas on an un-risk basis. And given the size and the quality of our Eagle Ford acreage, coupled with our entry into the Wolfcamp shale play and our desire to maintain capital discipline, we're considering taking an Eagle Ford partner to help optimize the value of our inventory. 
We plan to keep 2 rigs running for the remainder of the year, add a third rig in 2011 and we plan to exit 2011 at 5 to 6 rigs. And most of our near-term drilling is going to be oil focused. 
With current pricing, this is our most valuable program and we're really happy with our returns and the oil production will become more meaningful to our volume mix as we go through 2011. 
Our Haynesville program continues to outperform others in the play. Our wells are still delivering about 30% more production than the industry average, and we've recently drilled a well to TD in 20 days and I don't think anyone else can come close to that drilling pace. 
On the last call, I talked about how we'd entered into a 2-year contract for a dedicated frac crew so that we could eliminate delays in getting our wells completed. And our completion backlog had grown to 16 wells in late August, so we worked that backlog down to 12 wells, which will benefit our production in the fourth quarter. And recently, our net production has been over 170 million a day. 
Now while some companies are seeing a falloff in oil productivity in the Haynesville, we're seeing very consistent IP rates in EURs, and I continue to believe that's because we start with an advantaged acreage position that's right in the heart of the play and then we continue to execute well on the completion in the production operations areas.
I'll keep my Altamont comments brief today since we'll have our scheduled call on November 18 at 4:30 Eastern Time. Altamont, remember, is a huge resource, originally about 3 billion barrels of oil in place. Only about 10% of that's been produced, so we're busy trying to increase recoveries from the field. This is a textbook continuous improvement story. We know the oil is there. We've got a large drilling inventory and we'll continue to drill wells faster and more cost effectively over time, and we'll continue to improve our completion design and well performance. So please join us for more regarding Altamont in a couple of weeks. 
And then a few weeks ago, we announced our new Permian Basin oil program that we're very excited about in the Wolfcamp shale. As Slide 25 shows, we now have a significant position, roughly 135,000 net acres, all in large contiguous blocks with a single royalty owner as the State of Texas is part of the University Land System. 
Now we think we have more than 600 horizontal well locations just in the upper portion of the Wolfcamp, assuming a 75% acreage utilization factor which should translate to more than 150 million barrels of oil equivalent resources. 
I'll show you a regional map in a moment, but one of the things we really like about the play is that we're dealing with a known reservoir. There've been hundreds of successful vertical Wolfcamp producers in this area and there's plenty of existing infrastructure. So although it's still very early days for horizontal activity in the Wolfcamp, 6 horizontal wells have been drilled offset to our acreage with very encouraging results, and we're tracking the current drilling activity in the area. 
We cored and tested one well before we bid on the university leases and although we had some mechanical problems during the completion, we got all the information we needed to confirm the high quality of our lease area relative to the region -- our regional view of the play. 
And then finally, we believe that what we've learned operationally in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford will be directly applicable to the development of the Wolfcamp. 
Let's step back a second and talk about why we targeted the Wolfcamp. Now earlier this year as our Eagle Ford program was moving into the development phase, we took a small position in Crockett County to study and pilot test the Wolfcamp. That recommendation came from our technical team following an extensive review of the Wolfcamp shale across the entire Permian Basin where they literally included thousands of oil logs and production histories over a 13-county study area.  
The map on Slide 26 shows a vertical Wolfcamp and Wolfberry production virtually surrounding our acreage. And not shown on the map, as you move from north to south toward our blocks to Sprayberry above the Wolfcamp actually gets thinner and the Wolfcamp shale gets thicker. In fact, the total upper and lower Wolfcamp shale interval is almost 1,000 feet thick in places. So we're dealing with a known producing reservoir, not just a known source rock. And better yet it's an oil play with upside and all of the traditional vertically stacked Permian Basin oil reservoirs. 
Let we compare and contrast the Wolfcamp shale to other shales. We see a lot of things we like and Table 24 highlights the shale reservoir success factors, and a number of things jump out at you. Shallower depth, so it's going to be cheaper and easier to drill; a very thick section, 400 to 850 foot of net thickness; and clearly we can't horizontally drill and complete a section this thick with one lateral. But having a very thick section creates a possibility of a second phase of horizontal development in the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, which would essentially double the resource potential. 
High organic content, we need organic material to generate hydrocarbons, and a 4% to 15% indicates a very organic rich shale. High porosity with values ranging between 7% and 15%, the Wolfcamp has high oil in place storage capacity. 
And then finally, low clay content. We want shales that have high quartz or carbonate content and low clay content. The quartz and the carbonates form brittle rocks that are easier to hydraulically frac and they tend to be more porous and permeable. We all refer to these source rocks as shales, but what we're really looking for are low clay content shales. So the Wolfcamp has a lot of things to like and I believe it compares very favorably to some of the more established shale plays. 
Now another positive is its relative consistency of the Wolfcamp section across our acreage position. On Slide 28, we showed 2 logs from the northeast to the south -- northwest rather to the southeast across our acreage, spanning roughly 35 miles. Now the laws we've marked, the Sprayberry, the Dean, the upper and lower Wolfcamp sections and when our technical team was doing their original analysis, this consistency is part of what we were targeting for our acreage objectives. The laws will tell us -- the laws tell us that the upper Wolfcamp has very good porosity and high organic content as we've discussed. And as importantly, it shows that this section is very consistent all the way across our acreage position. And that consistency is what led us to build a large acreage position quickly, and allows for the kind of repeatable inventory that can deliver predictable well results and returns that we look for. 
Now we'll obviously experiment with drilling and completion designs, but Slide 29 summarizes our current type well economics. At the midpoints, we've assumed 7,500-foot vertical depths, 5,000-foot laterals, 16 frac stages, 160-acre spacing and completed well costs of about $5 million. We estimate initial producing rates of 250 to 300 equivalent barrels per day, although we've already seen wells offset our block that are much higher than this. And those rates would translate to gross EURs of like 300,000 to 380,000 equivalent barrels. 
Ultimately, the program PVR should be in the 1.25 to 1.35 range, assuming $70 oil and $4.50 gas and the IRR should be in the 20% to 30% range. 
Now again, our model only assumes developing the upper portion of the Wolfcamp with possible upside value from the lower Wolfcamp horizontal development and horizontal development on tighter than 160-acre spacing and then all the other vertically stacked oil zones in the Permian Basin. With all the resource potential on our new leases, we'll hopefully be talking about the Permian Basin for a long time.
Going forward, we plan to spud another well in November and keep that rig active into 2011. The formula we've used in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford has worked well for us, so we intend to mirror that approach. We'll start with one rig and then we'll try different lateral links and numbers of frac stages and then find ways to reduce drilling and completion costs and time. We'll also be spudding wells across our acreage to better understand our position and to improve our long-term plans. One of the great things about having a single very knowledgeable royalty owner is that we can better optimize our development plan and we've already begun the process of unitizing the university lands. By using that approach and given success, you should expect us to ramp up our drilling activity throughout 2011, just as we've done in our other core programs. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Doug for closing comments."

We had a very good quarter operationally. We continue to make progress in executing on our pipeline backlog and not withstanding an anticipated cost overrun on the Ruby pipeline, we expect our growth backlog in total to be within 5% of its original budget. 
In Midstream, we continue to make progress on key projects in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford and are already seeing the benefit of Mark and his team's stewardship of our existing Midstream assets in Altamont and in Haynesville. 
And in E&P, Brent just outlined a great quarter and lots of reasons to be optimistic about the balance of the year, as well as the longer term. 
As we plan for 2011 capital spending in E&P, it's very likely that the bulk of our spending will be in areas that didn't even exist as a possibility 3 years ago. A much larger inventory comprised primarily of large core positions in areas where we're advantaged and have a track record of performance with much more exposure to oil. That constitutes a dramatic shift in the competitive landscape over a very short period of time. 
On the balance sheet side, we expect to have covered off all our financing needs for 2011 in the next 2 months. All of these actions serve to increase our competitiveness even in a low gas price environment, and we're not sitting still. We have more plans for the balance of the year including, as Brent alluded to, the securing of a joint venture partner for our Eagle Ford acreage, allowing us to accelerate development and optimize our own invested capital. 
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning, and now we'd be happy to open it up to your questions."

If you think about where the commission is on returns these days, if you work through just the formulas, the dividend growth formula that they use with proxy groups in the world of low interest rates, you can come up with a little pressure downward on allowed returns. But over the long term, if you look over a 10- to 15-year period, relative to those formulaic prices, the commission has tended to dampen those returns, both on the upside and downside. So that when we think about regulated type returns, we're in the 14% to 15% range pretax return on capital. And we'd expect something like that here."

When we say June, it is highly dependent on weather to the extent we have a benign winter, we can do better than that. And likewise going the other way. So that's the way I'd answer that. I think of the different risks that we face, we are at a formative stage I'd say. We're well underway in construction but with respect to milestones, we're going to know a lot more when we get into, say, February, March; maybe January, February, March. When you think about Ruby construction, you ought to focus on 3 variables. One is winter weather and what that means with respect to construction productivity. A second is where we are on all these cultural clearances. And as I say, we've made some very good headway just in the last few weeks on that and we expect continued progress. And finally, the different biological windows with respect to when you can build and when you can't build to avoid migratory birds and the like. The biggest near-term weather window we have there concerns big game to the extent we have a normal winter. We think that we ought to be able to work through some of those big game windows. And if it were more severe and some of the elk or whatever had to come down and do some grazing on lower areas, we'd have some more issues. But those are the 3 things to look for. But I think you can tell that over the course of the next month or so, we'll know a lot more."

We're varying links, you've seen different links in the horizontal well and different numbers of fracs across the link to the horizontal. And so with 6 wells, we're really early into at least for the southern part of the trend, we're really early into it. Because we've got these university lands, we're able to unitize them.

I think what it says about the near-term is that we think that there's a good chance that natural gas prices are going to stay relatively low for certainly for 2011 and into 2012. And when they rebound in our view is sort of some combination of the recovery of the U.S. economy, so GDP going up for some sustained period of time. The beginning of the impact of old coal retirements and the continued falloff in exports from Canada. And how you assess the timing of that is, I mean, there's a great deal of uncertainty. I looked at 4 or 5 of the big forecasters of just of U.S. production for 2011 and I think by the end of the year, they diverged by about 5 Bcf a day in a kind of a 60 Bcf a day market. So there's a lot of uncertainty. I think what we've tried to do is position ourselves so that we're not losing the optionality that we believe exists on a very favorable macro for gas in the long term. And in the interim, we've got the ability because of the repositioning of our E&P portfolio to take advantage of a favored commodity right now in oil. We think that's the right thing to do."

So I don't think we're going to see any late life truncation much of reserves because we're even late in life, we're going to be less than $0.50 a unit.
