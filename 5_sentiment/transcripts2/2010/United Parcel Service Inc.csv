I'm here this morning with Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, to discuss the company's results for the quarter and our outlook for 2010.Before we begin, however, I'll review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the company's future performance or results of operations. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2008 10-K and 2009 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.In the remarks today, Scott and Kurt will compare results for 2009 and 2008, excluding the effects of adjustments that occurred in both years. Such a comparison is more reflective of UPS's true performance. The adjustments in 2009 that I'm referring to include charges of $258 million during the first half relating to the acceleration of the retirement of aircraft and the remeasurement of certain foreign currency-denominated obligations. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we took impairment charges of $575 million in our UPS Freight unit and in the International segment. A reconciliation of these results is included with our earnings announcement this morning and appears on UPS's IR website in the Financial Information tab.In addition, Kurt will refer to UPS's free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Reconciliation is included with the news announcement this morning and is available on the Investor Relations website. Before I turn the call over to Scott, a reminder. During the question-and-answer period, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Now here's Scott."

Several times over the last year, I shared with you my conviction that UPS has the ability to manage effectively in response to changing market conditions. That certainly proved true in 2009. UPS has emerged from a very difficult year, leaner, more focused and better positioned to take advantage of improving economic trends. Let me illustrate.During 2009, UPS improved operating efficiency through a comprehensive cost management effort. We demonstrated the nimbleness of our International business unit by quickly adjusting our network to match volume levels and ending the year with operating margins that are near historical norms. UPS bolstered our technology leadership with the introduction of new mobile shipping applications and the expansion of our WorldShip platform by adding the ability to ship airfreight as well as small package and LTL. Our investment for growth continued around the world through new construction in China that will facilitate global trade, facility expansions like Worldport that create network efficiencies and acquisitions that strengthen our presence in growing markets. We took our service performance to even higher levels and continue to build upon our environmental commitment, as evidenced last week when we were ranked number nine among the Top 100 global companies on Maplecroft's Climate Innovation Index. Lastly, once again, UPS produced cash flow and margins that are the best in the industry, and we're not standing still. We're in the process of streamlining our U.S. small package structure. This effort is about improving how we go to market and interact with our customers. It's also about being more efficient with our resources to generate better returns in our Domestic business. It will enable us to reduce cost and move market and resources and decision making closer to the customer. This restructuring has been in the planning stages for quite some time. It would have happened regardless of the business environment.Over the last few years, UPS has greatly expanded the breadth and depth of the solutions we offer. Through this new structure, we now have the opportunity to better deliver the value our solutions bring to small and medium-sized customers. That's what's driving this change. It will take some time to see the full impact of our new structure. But in the long run, this may prove to be one of the most significant changes to our Domestic business in quite some time.On a different note, the fourth quarter marked the 10th anniversary of UPS's IPO. Going public has helped the company in a number of ways. It affords us greater financial flexibility, since we no longer have to support a closely-held stock. And the IPO introduced a new voice at the table, outside investors. While it's been a turbulent decade in the stock market, since the IPO, our total return to shareowners has outperformed the S&P 500. And over the last 10 years, our brand has become truly global as we expanded our presence around the world. Before Kurt reviews our fourth quarter results, I want to take a moment to thank UPSers for their flawless execution and can-do spirit during our peak season. Everyone should be proud of what they accomplished. I also want to say that our hearts go out to those suffering from the earthquake in Haiti. UPS has responded. Along with our partners in the Logistics Emergency Team's coalition that supports the UN World Food Program, we are providing transportation and logistics services to help manage the massive recovery effort.Looking to 2010, I'm optimistic about the future. Recovery is underway in many regions of the world, but it will be gradual. I firmly believe global trade will be a major stimulus that powers economic recovery. And UPS is better positioned today than ever before to make that happen. Now let me turn the program over to Kurt."

I'm pleased with the way in which UPS wrapped up the year, but I for one, am glad that the year's over. For the quarter, earnings per share of $0.75 were a substantial increase over our original guidance. That increase was achieved through higher volumes than expected and a well-executed game plan. As Scott said, UPSers did a great job, particularly during the peak holiday season. Other noteworthy highlights, first, tremendous results from the International segment, with a 6% gain in revenue, producing a 19% increase in operating profit. Second, substantial improvements in our U.S. Package segment. Although we have a long way to go, Domestic profit increased over 60% from its low point in the second quarter. And third, despite the worst economic environment in 70 years, UPS's free cash flow for the year was exceptional, $4.1 billion or over $4 per share for only the second time since going public.As you can see from fourth quarter results, the benefits from our cost initiatives are becoming increasingly evident. For example, in the quarter, total compensation and benefits grew at a much slower pace than volume increases. Also of note in the quarter, we saw a clear demonstration of the value inherent in our broad portfolio of services. Unexpected demand for airfreight in Asia exceeded market capacity, squeezing margins in our Forwarding business. However, our International Package segment benefited from the increased volume as UPS customers upgraded into our express network. This is the unique advantage of an integrated portfolio. Now let's start the review with the U.S. Package business.In the fourth quarter, we again saw growth in average daily air volume, with Next Day Air up almost 3% and deferred, up over 4%. Growth declines for ground moderated in the quarter. Revenue per piece was down 5.2%, primarily as a result of lower fuel surcharges. Air and ground fuel surcharges were down year-over-year approximately 16% and 4%, respectively. Weight per piece, down about 5%, had a bit less of an impact than in previous quarters. And base rate pricing, my number one priority heading into 2010, improved sequentially.Typically, operating margin in the fourth quarter is less than in the third. However, this was not the case in 2009. The segment's 10.1% margin was an increase of 260 basis points over our third quarter results and the first time all year that it was in double digits. We experienced reductions in expense per piece as the impact of our initiatives took hold. Although the margin did decline 160 basis points year-over-year, keep in mind that the fourth quarter of 2008 benefited significantly from the timing of fuel surcharges. Now let's turn to the International segment.Average daily volume increased almost 12% with exports up 3%. All regions of the world experienced growth, with Asia and the U.S. leading the way. This clearly exceeded our expectations, as Asia volumes improved when customers upgraded from airfreight to international small package due to the capacity constraints in the freight market and emergency restocking. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased almost 18%. You may recall in the third quarter, we experienced a substantial uptick in this volume due to our acquisition in Turkey. Although that did contribute to the fourth quarter's growth, so did increases in other countries. In fact, excluding Turkey, domestic volume would have increased 7%. This is another advantage of our broad portfolio. We're winning new business and increasing our share from current customers.During the quarter, the positive impact of currency on total revenue was essentially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel surcharges. As a result, the revenue increase of almost 6% was due to strengthening business condition and continued share gains. International operations did an excellent job of controlling cost as evidenced by the improvement in operating margin to 16.7%. This is 180 basis points higher than last year and demonstrates the operating leverage inherent in our international network. The impact from currency was negligible.I would be remiss if I didn't mention peak season, which was strong in both the U.S. and International segments. We experienced eight days of worldwide volume over 22 million packages, two of which were over 24 million. This was stronger than we had expected and necessitated exceptional execution of our peak season plan. Now for the Supply Chain and Freight segment.  Disappointing performance in the forwarding and LTL operations offset another good quarter in Logistics. Logistics revenue increased year-over-year, posting strong operating margins. Business continued to successfully develop and deploy solutions that deepen customer relationships and drive transportation spend. Particular strength was evident in the healthcare and high-tech sectors. In forwarding, a surge in demand in the capacity-constrained Asian market led to rapidly escalating transportation costs. This margin squeeze negatively impacted operating profits. We are working diligently to negotiate customer rates that reflect market conditions. UPS Freight's fourth quarter performance was below expectations. LTL shipments were flat, and weight per shipment declined. As a result, the unit reported a loss in the quarter. We do have a very challenging pricing environment. However, revenue per hundredweight was up 2.8% as we maintained our pricing for value approach in this business. UPS Freight also did see a gain in market share year-over-year. We will continue to optimize the freight network and focus sharply on the middle market. The unit should return to profitability in 2010.Turning now to a distinction that UPS has long enjoyed, our financial strength. Even in one of the worst years and decades for economic activity, UPS generated $4.1 billion in free cash flow through excellent management of working capital and constrained capital expenditures. We also paid $1.8 billion in dividends, invested $1.6 billion in capital expenditures, repurchased a total of 10.9 million shares for $569 million and ended the year with $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.Two years ago, we introduced our funds flow from operations to total debt metric and said we were targeting a range of 50% to 60% by the end of 2009. We ended the year at 58%. Last week, S&P reaffirmed our AA- credit rating, although they changed our outlook from stable to negative. This was based largely on their calculation of funds flow from operation to total debt, which includes pension liabilities as debt. By their calculation, UPS is slightly below their target. We have 18 to 24 months to close the gap, which I'm very confident we can do. Now for our outlook. Because we have more clarity into economic conditions going forward than we did a year ago, we're providing annual guidance for 2010. Diluted earnings per share should be within a range of $2.70 to $3.05, which is an increase of 17% to 32% over 2009 earnings. As Scott indicated, the recovery should be gradual. Therefore, the first quarter will be the most challenging of the year with earnings per share only slightly improved from the first quarter of 2009. In the U.S. Domestic segment, average daily volume should increase in line with GDP with ground improving a little more than air. Volume growth will be more evident as the year progresses. Yields should increases as pricing strengthens and package characteristics improve. In addition, we're reinstituting management compensation increases. We anticipate operating margin for the first quarter will be a little below last year but should expand through 2010.In International, export volume growth is expected to outperform the market. Domestic volume should increase at a mid-teens rate until the third quarter, when we lap the date of our Turkish acquisition. For the year, Domestic volume should increase in the high single digits. Operating profits should grow at an annual mid-teens rate, with margins strengthening over the course of the year. We expect the Supply Chain and Freight segment to achieve a mid- to high single digit revenue growth rate for the year. Operating margin should improve slightly in the first quarter compared to last year, expanding to about 5% for the full year.As I mentioned on our last call, our overall tax rate for 2010 should be between 34% and 35%. Capital expenditures are projected to be $1.8 billion. At less than 4% of revenue, this is significantly below our historical range of 5% to 8%. In fact, CapEx for the next few years will remain well below our historical range. Reduced capital expenditures reflect the fact that many of our current strategic investments are nearing completion. For example, our air fleet is the youngest in the industry. Infrastructure is in place in Asia, with the Shanghai hub opened last year and Shenzhen slated to open this quarter. And the comprehensive expansion of Worldport will be completed this year. We clearly will have the global network that we need to support growth. This year, we will accelerate funding of our new IBT pension plan due to recently released regulations. The funding for 2010 will be approximately $200 million more than last year. This will reduce contributions in 2011 and thereafter. And we expect the IBT plan to be fully funded by 2013.Lastly, the streamlining of our Domestic business will require a one-time charge and provide an ongoing benefit. The amount of the charge will depend on the number of people who accept the company's voluntary retirement offer. We anticipate it could be up to $80 million pretax and will be recorded in the first quarter. Let me remind you, this restructuring will eliminate 1,800 positions. We expect that the voluntary retirement program UPS offered to 1,100 management people will yield many opportunities for the displaced individuals.In 2010, savings from this restructuring will be minimal, since it will be offset by expenses like relocation that are not included in the one-time charge. But in 2011 and beyond, we expect an annual benefit of about $0.10 per share.To conclude, you are seeing the fruits of the hard work that UPSers completed in 2009. Going forward, we will build on today's accomplishments by capitalizing on the operating leverage of our global network, by maintaining disciplined pricing practices and by leveraging the power of our broad portfolio.Thanks for your attention. And now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions."

So they appear to be kind of conservative in first quarter versus what you're looking at for the full year, but it doesn't sound like demand has slowed down versus fourth quarter. So I'm just wondering if there something else on the cost side that hurts you more in first quarter, or is something else we should be considering just in terms of the way the guidance is a little more conservative in first than what the full year looks like?"

Clearly, last year we dropped back and went very specifically to quarterly guidance, because we frankly couldn't see through the fog of war of the economic deterioration. But as we look out over 2010, we see a story of a gradually firming economy, of pricing for UPS continuing to get stronger and stronger, of volume results getting better, of continued improvement on our cost management and ultimately, this restructuring beginning to kick in late in the year. So all of those lead to an upward slope over the year and lead us to produce we think a fairly ambitious goal for our earnings for the year of between 17% and 32% increase. Q1 is a good question and there's a couple of things that air in Q4 that we're a little hesitant to extrapolate. We did have a surprising uptick in December, frankly, as the domestic and international peak season came in strong. I mentioned that we had eight days over 22 million pieces and two days over 24 million pieces. So we're being a little cautious that, that momentum may slow a bit, although we do think that volumes at least will be firm in the U.S. in Q1, probably flat, maybe slightly up. We also saw the incredible squeeze in Asia, with just unprecedented increase in demand which flowed into our package network substantially. Cost to forward are a little bit but it definitely allowed us to produce tremendous results in international, and we're a  little hesitant to extrapolate that. Plus, we are going to be having some of these relocation expenses and training expenses beginning to hit Q1. So you lever all of that together, plus if you note that in Q4, we were still 9% below last year and we are expecting earnings to be up in Q1 over last year, just not at the overall average rate for the year. So we took our best shot at it. If economic conditions, the momentum continues, then certainly  there's upside potential but at least at this point, that's kind of what we think is appropriate."

We do review dividend primarily at our February Board meeting and we'll make some decisions on the dividend policy going forward. As far as the share repurchase, I think, we'll be looking at that hand-in-hand. Clearly, last year, we decided to sustain our dividend and we held off on share repurchases. We did, last year, redistribute to shareowners about 100% of our net income, so we did that through reduced share repurchase but continued dividend.

But that's been hugely accelerated by the economic slowdown. And as we've gone back and looked the past recessions, in the Express business and in the Commercial Ground business, it's very typical that weights move with the economy. On the residential side, that's been more of a steady when that moves beyond cycles. So we are highly confident that weights will begin to improve this year in the commercial arena and in the Express business. And that's highly beneficial to us, because those packages drive modest increases in cost but substantial increases in yield. So we're very confident that will happen. You still may see, long term, some slight declines in weight as goods continue to get smaller, but the big impact right now is the economy."

DHL was significantly lighter on average than the UPS volume. So as we absorbed their volume into our ground and air networks, it did have a negative impact on our average yields year-over-year. On top of that, the average weight of the packages that across the network got lighter as there was less widgets per box with the economy being weak. Fuel surcharges were a headwind in Q4. For example, the air average is about 21% fuel surcharge last year and this year's quarter, it was just a little over 7%. So some pretty big headwinds still year-over-year with fuel surcharges, that will begin to moderate in Q1. So all of those moving parts do have an impact. As we cycle through now, Q1 will be the first quarter really without a significant impact with the DHL overlap. There was some shares shipped in January for the air volumes although the ground really had shifted totally by Q4.

Thanks for joining us today. In a moment, Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO will discuss first quarter results and expectations going forward.
Before they begin, however, I’ll briefly review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2009 Form 10-K report. 
This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.
I want to remind you about three adjustments we made to first quarter results. A $98 million pre-tax restructuring charge related to the reorganization of the U.S. Domestic Package segment. A $38 million pre-tax loss on a sale of the supply chain business and a $76 million, non-cash charge to income tax expense resulting from a change in the tax filing status of a German subsidiary. 
These charges reduced net income by $175 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.18. In addition in last years first quarter there was a $181 million aircraft impairment charge which resulted from the retirement of our DC-8 fleet. The after tax impact of this charge was a $116 million or $0.12 per share. In their remarks today Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS results excluding the impact of these charges.
Since we believe this is a more accurate picture of the company’s performance. A reconciliation of these adjustments to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that companied our earnings news releases this morning. The schedules are also available on the UPS Investors Relations website in the financial section.
In addition during the call we refer to free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A Reconciliation is included in the news announcement this morning and his available on the UPS Investors Relations website. To begin our review of the quarter I will turn the program over to Scott for opening comments.

That we have the ability to manage effectively, in response to changing market conditions. This quarter UPS started to prove it, economies around the world are showing signs of recovery. Experts are providing more UPB forecasts then they were few months ago.
Conditions are slowly starting to improve and UPS’s first quarter results illustrated our ability to take advantage of these trends.
In the quarter, UPS achieved better than expected growth in volume, revenue and profit. In particular, the International Package segment really shined. You’re seeing how our global product portfolio provides benefits to our customers and our share owners alike. Our strong management team quickly capitalized on this growth, while still controlling costs and we saw the operating leverage inherent in the UPS network.
Also in the quarter, two significant infrastructure projects came to fruition. Each strategically enhanced in our network. We opened the second phase of our Worldport expansion ahead of schedule and under budget. This enables UPS to continue to reduce operations in regional air hubs and imply a larger more fuel efficient aircraft.
In addition, we began to operate in our new intra-Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China. This hub allows UPS to better serve our customers by reducing time in transit for 100s of city pairs in the area. These projects required significant capital commitment and will enhance customer service, provide better access to international markets and improve efficiencies for UPS around the globe.
In February, the administration announced the National Export Initiative, which UPS strongly endorses. It has always been our firm belief that increasing global trade is the best way to stimulate economic recovery and to create jobs. We intend to work with the President’s team in any way we can on this new important endeavor. Since the beginning of the year, UPS has received wide ranging recognitions. The company was named most admired in our industry by Fortune’s.
One of the top ten most referable companies by Forbes. One of the hundred best corporate citizens and one of the top ten global companies in Climate Innovation. 
UPS was also recognized for our work with women and minority owned companies. Now where words are gratifying what’s important to us is the scope of what’s being recognized. These accolades are testaments to the UPS culture and benefits all of our stakeholders. They are also a testament to our people and I want to take the moment to commend UPSer’s around the world for their focus during the quarter. Our U.S domestic restructuring is well under way. In the new regional and district structure is operational.
Everyone is doing a tremendous job, managing the business through these changes. Let me also recognize our European and Airline partners for the outstanding work they did over the last two weeks, in response to the challenges caused by the volcanic eruptions in Iceland. Our product portfolio and extensive European air and ground network enabled us to modify operating plans and limit customer inconvenience. This was a job well done. Now I’ll turn the program over Kurt to review the operations.

238570,100781986,57872,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Well it’s certainly enjoyable to have a quarter like this one to discuss with you. Revenue was up 7%, operating profit up 31% and earnings per share up 37% with margin expansion in every segment. The better than expected",1189,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Well it’s certainly enjoyable to have a quarter like this one to discuss with you. Revenue was up 7%, operating profit up 31% and earnings per share up 37% with margin expansion in every segment. The better than expected results stem from stronger operating performance in each segment then we had anticipated yield improvement and operating leverage across the enterprise. 
I’m pleased with our ability to manage costs and increase productivity as volume began to increase. Compensation and benefit expense increased only 1.7%, while our consolidated volume was up 2.7%.
Now, let’s look at the segments, starting with the U.S. domestic package operations. Operating profit jumped 17% on a 2% revenue gain. This increase was driven by higher yields, stabilizing volume, network enhancements and good execution. As a result, operating margin was 9.3%, an increase of 120 basis points.
Our average daily volume increased less than 1%. This was the first quarter, since the end of ’07 with positive year-over-year growth. The increase in U.S. domestic volume was driven entirely by ground, outperforming the air products as expected. The 2% improvement in revenue per piece was the strongest, since the third quarter of 2008. It reflects retention of a greater portion of the general rate increase and higher fuel surcharges.
Base pricing was up in both air and ground and we expect this positive trend to continue through 2010, especially in our air products. Once again, our operations team demonstrated our ability to further optimize our networks by reducing direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours and this was accomplished while going through a significant restructuring within our U.S. operations.
In the quarter, UPS continued using technology to improve efficiency and provide even better customer service with the introduction of UPS Smart Pickup. This industry first application ensures that UPS drivers stop for packages only when a customer actually needs that service. The process is easy, automated and transparent for customer and driver alike and will eliminate an estimated 8 million miles of driving annually. 
Let's turn now to the international business, where operating profit soared 45% to $427 million on an 18% increase in revenue. Operating profit for this segment approached our historical first quarter peak.
In the quarter, UPS experienced balance growth across all geographies and products. A combination of higher volumes from existing customers and new customer wins. Total average daily volume was up 18% with export volume increasing more than 9%. All major regions of the world experienced export volume improvements. Asia led the way up over 20% followed by the U.S. and Europe both of which showed strong year-over-year gains.
During the quarter, we also experienced the lengthening of our trade lanes as inter regional trade picked up. As evidence by the 37% volume increase in our Asia to Europe lane. Yields improved 5% reflecting firm pricing, positive currency impact and increased fuel surcharges. The 24% gain in non-U.S. domestic volumes was helped by our acquisition in Turkey last August. 
However, organic growth was 13% powered by strength in our core European markets. This strong improvement was against the backdrop of a weak euro zone economy.
UPS’s presence in domestic markets outside the U.S. also enables many opportunities to gain export volume. In fact the substantial percent of our non-U.S. domestic customers also use UPS for their export needs, taking advantage of our broad portfolio. 
International operating margins increased 310 basis points, 16.2%. This resulted from leverage due to increased volumes and benefits from network and productivity improvements implemented last year. Good control of both operating and non-operating costs produced leverage in our results.
Now for the Supply Chain & Freight segment. Revenue increased 14% and operating profit more than doubled, the Logistics business was the primary driver of the profit increase, logistics continued to experience strong growth and profitability gains in healthcare and high-tech. 
During the quarter we ware proud that data monitor recognized UPS, as number one in Supply Chain outsourcing for 2009. This award validates the progress that we've made in building our unique Supply Chain management capabilities.
Boarding experienced strong tonnage increases although demand moderated slightly from the fourth quarter, the industry capacity constraints did lessen slightly resulting in sequential improvements in operating margin. We implemented revenue management plans in the quarter which will improve margins going forward. 
On the LTL front, UPS freight remains committed to its strategy at targeted growth in the middle market. As a result revenue per 100 weight increased 10% and LTL revenue was up almost 6%. Even with modest declines in both shipments and tonnage. This business unit showed solid improvement over last year although it still operated a slight loss. We expect it to be profitable for the year.
Now, as I usually do I want to emphasize the very strong financial foundation that supports to UPS. In the quarter we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow even after $630 million in accelerated pension contributions over last year. UPS also invested $280 million in capital expenditures paid dividends of 470 million, reflecting a 4.4% dividend increase and spent $260 million to repurchase over 4 million shares. Lastly we ended the quarter with 3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Because of the strong first quarter and improvement in the global economic outlook we raised our expectations for earnings per share this year to a range of $3.05 to $3.30. This is a 32% to 43% increase over last year’s results. 
The year-over-year change in earning should remain fairly consistent across each quarter, with the fourth quarter showing a lower increase due to a more challenging year-over-year comparison.
Looking at the segments, for the full year U.S. domestic average daily volume should improve gradually with ground out performing air. We expect yields to strengthen as the year progresses, resulting in significant margin expansion for 2010.
Keep in mind now as we continue with the U.S. restructuring we will incur additional costs for relocation and training. Most of which will occur during the second quarter, these items which are included in our guidance will negatively impact earrings by $0.03 to $0.05 in the quarter, constraining margin improvement somewhat.
In our international segment we anticipate UPS export volume to continue outpacing market growth and non- U.S. domestic growth should remain strong but remember we will lap the date of our Turkish acquisition in August.
We expect international operating profit to show strong growth and reflect typical seasonal patterns. Our supply chain and freight segment should generate gradual sequential improvement in operating margins.
With the full year margin of at least 5% on about 10% revenue growth, to summarize we had an excellent quarter in which we successfully transitioned from a recessionary to a recovery environment. 
Going forward we’re determined to sustain the enhancements we’ve made to our cost structure. We will continue to invest for the future while remaining focused on disciplined profitable growth and we’re very confident that our diversified global portfolio will help us capitalize on the many growth opportunities ahead. Thanks for your attention, and now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions.

The big growth areas in general and our other costs are purchase transportation and fuel, which is one related to the lot of expense in our freight forwarding and the other just a commodity cost.
The other expenses has a lot of line items, if you take out the one-time events, it’s probably down about 8%, and that’s things like expense accounts claims as our network runs very efficiently supplies.

One is focused more on conversion sales, then perhaps in the past, we still remain a small player typically 10% to 15% share in most markets. 
So there is tremendous upside for us to help customers migrate over to UPS and we have seen great momentum there. And then the other is to increase our share wallet the advantage of our broad integrated portfolio as customers can move up and down that portfolio and that’s we have also seen that happening as things begin to turn. 
So even with the economies still suspect especially in Europe we are seeing very good organic growth on existing customers as they began to use a greater portion of our portfolio.

Our overall direct labor hours were down 4%, and that’s again slightly improved volumes our miles driven with our network alignments were down 3% and we had almost a 10% reduction in block hours in our domestic network. So a lot of changes, a lot of tightening and so we’re seeing substantial margin improvement even without the tailwind of substantial volume growth, and as Scott mentioned if the U.S. economy continues to firm then that just gives us another tailwind and we are able to leverage some other economies like the wage rate improvement in the growing environment.

We were able to continue to provide pick up and delivery service and reroute it up in place to other parts of Europe that we’re opened during that period. 
And we really are blessed with having an extensive European ground network that allowed us to really continue to provide transporter domestic service which was really minimal delays to our customers. April 21, we actually opened up our Cologne hub and actually had unprecedented volume is above last year’s peak as you would expect trying to catch up for the period where you couldn’t get us into and out of Europe. 
This point in time, we really are now caught up and we’re back on track. So I think we’ve done a very good job, our customers are pleased with the service offerings being able to help them to this period, but it was quite turbulent. Got to say the least, the actual financial impact is too were to tell, we think of somewhat immaterial to the company, but it's how much volume is lost, how much production was lost how much production was lost during in that period of time, I think it going to take us a few weeks to figure that out and only talk about that in the next earnings call. 
The second question the RLA issue, I guess let me start out by saying UPS supports the passage of that FAA reauthorization bills quickly as we possibly can, this bill is important to the entire country. As you know it provides us funding for more than 150,000 jobs and also much needed safety in aviation system modernization initiatives. 
So it's really important that, that we get this thing done for the country. Regarding the RLA amendment, I think this audience clearly knows the two companies, knows UPS, knows Federal Express and knows that our companies provide similar services and provide services to similar customers and do a lot of the same things, there's actually a logical that the two companies should be governed under different labor laws. Our point here clearly is that the expressed divers do the same jobs for both companies, this should be governed under the same law. 
What will happen, of the outcome of this legislation still not clear whether it is going to a conference committee or will be handled differently so through the Congress, certainly we are in this and get this thing done but most important is that we get this FAA reauthorization bill passed.

That’s really the time of which the vast majority of our people that we have repositioned will be relocating substantial amounts of retraining expenses and other realignments and facilities changes.
So that’s why we really pulled out second quarter and said that it would be about a $0.03 to $0.05 headwind in the second quarter. Having said that though we following that the cost will begin to taper down and will not be as material and would not likely not be called out it all and the savings for the third and fourth quarter will significantly offset any remaining expenses.
So it is a big deal for us in Q2 we were very pleased though with the fairly seamless process that happened in Q1, that was one of our areas of concern about our ability to operate through Q1 effectively and in know that there were some discussions about our guidance in Q1, so we have been thrilled with how smooth that went how well our operations continued even with this major change going.
So, Q2 will be the time that we get the majority of knitting done and expenses and then after that we will be in good shape going forward and we do expect for 2011 that it will be give us at least $0.10 share tailwind for our domestic business.

We did indeed add in some block hours, I think as our International block hours are up something like 8% over last year at this time, so that’s a good thing, that was our affiliate revenue and we’re happy to do it.
It’s a combination of some routine routes added back in and also a significant number of extra segments. As we talked about the crunch on demand for air cargo, fortunately, we’ve been able to take advantage of that.

So domestically, it’s clearly a story of operating leverage and the benefits of the big changes we’ve made and frankly we’re waiting for the tailwind of the economy to kick in. We’re looking for modest growth over the course of the year. So that is not betting on the come.
Internationally, it’s a positive. It’s a story of great operating efficiency and tremendous boost from both the economy and share gain across the globe. So we feel very positive, frankly in all of our segments. As you look across every segment of UPS right now, we’ve got good potential for improvements. The domestic business is seeing the benefits of improved productivity and streamlining the international businesses, enjoying strong growth.
Our forwarding business took a little bit of a hit in Q4 with the demand crunch, but we have stabilized that to done some revenue management and that’s in good shape. Our Logistics group is showing great momentum and even the UPS freight, which is in a very tough environment is showing substantial improvements year-over-year and profitability and we do expected it to be profitable this year even with the extreme challenges across that industry. 
So it’s a combination of improving trends or at least lack of economic headwinds and a lot of hard work within the company.

In a moment, Scott Davis our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, will discuss first quarter results and expectations going forward. Before they begin, however, I'll briefly review the Safe Harbor language. 
Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2009 Form 10-K report. This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website. 
I want to remind you about three adjustments we made to first quarter results. The $98 million pretax restructuring charge related to the reorganization of the U.S. Domestic Package segment, a $38 million pretax loss on the sale of a Supply Chain business and the $76 million non-cash charge to income tax expense resulting from a change in the tax filing status of a German subsidiary. These charges reduced net income by $175 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.18. 
In addition, in last year's first quarter, there was $181 million aircraft impairment charge, which resulted from the retirement of our DC-8 fleet. The after-tax impact of this charge was $116 million or $0.12 per share. In their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS results excluding the impact of these charges, since we believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. Reconciliation of these adjustments to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release this morning. The schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the financial section. 
In addition, during the call, we refer to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation is included in the news announcement this morning, and is available on the UPS Investor Relations website. 
To begin our review of the quarter, I'll turn the program over to Scott for opening comments."

Last quarter, I mentioned that UPS was well positioned to take advantage of improving global economic trends, that we had the ability to manage effectively in response to changing market conditions. This quarter,",526,"Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I mentioned that UPS was well positioned to take advantage of improving global economic trends, that we had the ability to manage effectively in response to changing market conditions. This quarter, UPS started to prove it. 
The economies around the world are showing signs of recovery. Experts are providing more upbeat forecasts than they were a few months ago. Conditions are slowly starting to improve, and UPS' first quarter results illustrated our ability to take advantage of these trends.
In the quarter, UPS achieved better-than-expected growth in volume, revenue and profit. In particular, the International Package segment really shined. You're seeing how our global product portfolio provides benefits to our customers and our share owners alike. Our strong management team quickly capitalized on this growth while still controlling cost. And we saw the operating leverage inherent in the UPS network. 
Also in the quarter, two significant infrastructure projects came to fruition. These strategically enhanced in our network. We opened the second phase of our Worldport expansion ahead of schedule and under budget. This enables UPS to continue to reduce operations and regional air hubs and fly larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft.
In addition, we began operating our new intra-Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China. This hub allows UPS to better serve our customers by reducing Time-In-Transit for hundreds of city pairs in the area. These projects require significant capital commitment and will enhance customer service, provide better access to international markets and improve efficiencies for UPS around the globe.
In February, the administration announced the National Export Initiative which UPS strongly endorses. It has always been our firm belief that increasing global trade is the best way to stimulate economic recovery and to create jobs. We intend to work with the presidency in any way we can on this new important endeavor. 
Since the beginning of the year, UPS has received wide range in recognitions. The company was named Most Admired in our industry by FORTUNE, one of the top 10 Most Reputable Companies by Forbes, one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens and one of the top 10 global companies in Climate Innovation. UPS was also recognized for our work with women- and minority-owned companies.
Now while words are gratifying, what's important to us is the scope of what's being recognized. These accolades are testaments to the UPS culture that benefits all our stakeholders. They're also a testament to our people. And I want to take a moment to commend UPSers around the world for their focus during the quarter. Our U.S. domestic restructuring is well underway, and the new region and district structure is operational. Everyone is doing a tremendous job managing the business through these changes. 
Let me also recognize our European and airline partners for the outstanding work they did over the last two weeks, in response to the challenges caused by the volcanic eruptions in Iceland. Our product portfolio and extensive European air and ground network enabled us to modify operating plans and limit customer inconvenience. This was a job well done.
Now I'll turn the program over to Kurt to review the operations."
238570,100781986,57882,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Well, it's certainly enjoyable to have a quarter like this one to discuss with you. Revenue was up 7%, operating profit up 31% and earnings per share up 37%, with margin expansion in every segment. The better-than-expected",1180,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Well, it's certainly enjoyable to have a quarter like this one to discuss with you. Revenue was up 7%, operating profit up 31% and earnings per share up 37%, with margin expansion in every segment. The better-than-expected results stemmed from stronger operating performance in each segment than we'd anticipated, yield improvement and operating leverage across the enterprise. I am pleased with our ability to manage cost and increase productivity as volume began to increase. Compensation and benefit expense increased only 1.7%, while our consolidated volume was up 2.7%.
Now let's look at the segments, starting with the U.S. Domestic Package operations. Operating profit jumped 17% on a 2% revenue gain. This increase was driven by higher yields, stabilizing volume, network enhancement and good execution. As a result, operating margin was 9.3%, an increase of 120 basis points. 
While average daily volume increased less than 1%, this was the first quarter since the end of '07 with positive year-over-year growth. The increase in U.S. domestic volume was driven entirely by Ground, outperforming the Air products as expected. The 2% improvement in revenue per piece was the strongest since the third quarter of 2008. It reflects retention of a greater portion of the general rate increase and higher fuel surcharges. Base pricing was up in both Air and Ground, and we expect this positive trend to continue through 2010, especially in our Air products. Once again, our operations team demonstrated our ability to further optimize our network by reducing direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours. And this was accomplished while going through a significant restructuring within our U.S. operations. 
In the quarter, UPS continued using technology to improve efficiency and provide even better customer service with the introduction of UPS Smart Pickup. This industry-first application ensures that UPS drivers stop for packages only when a customer actually needs that service. The process is easy, automated and transparent for customer and driver alike, and will eliminate an estimated 8 million miles of driving annually.
Let's turn now to the International business, where operating profits soared 45% to $427 million on an 18% increase in revenue. Operating profit for this segment approached our historical first quarter peak. In the quarter, UPS experienced balanced growth across all geographies and products, a combination of higher volumes from existing customers and new customer wins. Total average daily volume was up 18%, with export volume increasing more than 9%. All major regions of the world experienced export volume improvements. Asia led the way, up over 20% followed by the U.S. and Europe, both of which showed strong year-over-year gains. 
During the quarter, we also experienced the lengthening of our trade lanes as interregional trade picked up, as evidenced by the 37% volume increase in our Asia to Europe lane. Yields improved 5%, reflecting firm pricing, positive currency impact and increased fuel surcharges. The 24% gain in non-U.S. domestic volume was helped by our acquisition in Turkey last August. However, organic growth was 13%, powered by strength in our core European markets. This strong improvement was against the backdrop of a weak eurozone economy. UPS' presence in domestic markets outside the U.S. also enables many opportunities to gain export volume. In fact, the substantial percent of our non-U.S. domestic customers also use UPS for their export needs, taking advantage of our broad portfolio.
International operating margins increased 310 basis points to 16.2%. This resulted from leverage due to increased volume and benefits from network and productivity improvements implemented last year. Good control of both operating and non-operating costs produced leverage in our results.
Now for the Supply Chain and Freight segment. Revenue increased 14% and operating profit more than doubled. The Logistics business was the primary driver of the profit increase. Logistics continued to experience strong growth in profitability gains in Healthcare and High Tech. During the quarter, we were proud that Datamonitor recognized UPS as number one in supply chain outsourcing for 2009. This award validates the progress that we've made in building our unique supply chain management capabilities.
Forwarding experienced strong tonnage increases, although demand moderated slightly from the fourth quarter. The industry capacity constraints did lessen slightly, resulting in sequential improvements in operating margin. We implemented revenue management plans in the quarter, which will improve margins going forward. 
On the LTL front, UPS Freight remains committed to its strategy of targeted growth in the middle market. As a result, revenue per hundredweight increased 10% and LTL revenue was up almost 6%, even with modest declines in both shipments and tonnage. This business unit showed solid improvement over last year, although it's still operated at a slight loss. We expect it to be profitable for the year.
Now as I usually do, I want to emphasize the very strong financial foundation that supports UPS. In the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow, even after $630 million in accelerated pension contributions over last year. UPS also invested $280 million in capital expenditures, paid dividends of $470 million, reflecting a 4.4% dividend increase, and spent $260 million to repurchase over 4 million shares. Lastly, we ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Because of the strong first quarter and improvement in the global economic outlook, we raised our expectations for earnings per share this year to a range of $3.05 to $3.30. This is a 32% to 43% increase over last year's results. The year-over-year change in earnings should remain fairly consistent across each quarter, with the fourth quarter showing a lower increase due to a more challenging year-over-year comparison. 
Looking at the segments, for the full year, U.S. domestic average daily volume should improve gradually, with Ground outperforming Air. We expect yields to strengthen as the year progresses, resulting in significant margin expansion for 2010.  Keep in mind though, as we continue with the U.S. restructuring, we will incur additional costs for relocation and training, most of which will occur during the second quarter. These items, which are included in our guidance, will negatively impact earnings by $0.03 to $0.05 in the quarter, constraining margin improvement somewhat.
In our International segment, we anticipate UPS export volume to continue outpacing market growth. Non-U.S. domestic growth should remain strong. But remember, we will lap the date of our Turkish acquisition in August. We expect International operating profit to show strong growth and reflect typical seasonal patterns. Our Supply Chain and Freight segment should generate gradual sequential improvement in operating margin, with the full year margin of at least 5% on about 10% revenue growth.
To summarize, we had an excellent quarter in which we successfully transitioned from a recessionary to a recovery environment. Going forward, we're determined to sustain the enhancements we've made to our cost structure. We'll continue to invest for the future while remaining focused on disciplined profitable growth. And we're very confident that our diversified global portfolio will help us capitalize on the many growth opportunities ahead. 
Thanks for your attention. And now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions."

And so we do feel pretty good that our other expenses are in good shape. Depreciation and amortization is up a little bit as we operationalize Worldport, some of the investments we've got. The big growth areas in general and our other costs are purchase transportation and fuel, which is one related to the lot of expense in our Freight Forwarding and the other just the commodity cost. The other expenses has a lot of line items. If you take out the onetime events, it's probably down about 8%. And that's things like expense accounts, claims, as our network runs very efficiently, supplies. It may not maintain at that level, but we do certainly intend to sustain the reductions we've made and control all those cost items. So that's the balancing act that we're managing right now."

We really are blessed to having an expensive European ground network that allowed us to really continue to provide transport or domestic service with really minimal delays to our customers. April 21, we actually open up our Cologne hub, and actually unprecedented volume that was above last year's peak as you'd expect kind of the catch up for the period. We couldn't get us into and out of Europe.  At this point in time we really are now caught up and we're back on track. So I think we've done a very good job. Our customers are pleased with the service offerings to able to help them through this period. But it was quite turbulent. I got to say the least that the actual financial impact. It's too early to tell. We think it's somewhat immaterial for the company, but it's how much volume is lost, how much production was lost during that period of time. I think it's going to take us a few weeks to figure that out, and so we'll talk about that in the next earnings call. The second question, the RLA issue. I guess let me start with by saying UPS supports the passage of that FAA reauthorization bill as quickly as we possibly can. This bill is important to the entire country. As you know, it provides us funding for more than 150,000 jobs. And also much-needed safety in aviation system modernization initiatives. So it's really important that we get this thing done for the country. Regarding the RLA amendment, I think this audience clearly knows the two companies, knows UPS, knows Federal Express and knows that our companies provide similar services and provide services to the similar customers, and do a lot of the same things. It's actually logical that the two companies should governed under different labor laws. Now our point here clearly is that the Express drivers do the same jobs for both companies. They should be governed under the same law. What will happen will be the outcome of this legislation, it's still not clear with us going to a conference committee or will be handled differently. So through the Congress, certainly, we're optimistic we'll get this thing done, but more important is that we get this FAA pick bill passed."

That's really the time at which the vast majority of our people that we repositioned will be relocating substantial amounts of retraining expenses and other realignments and facilities changes. So that's why we've really pulled out second quarter, and said that it will be about a $0.03 to $0.05 headwind in the second quarter. Having said that though, following that, the cost will begin to taper down. It will not be as material, and would likely not be called out at all and the savings for the third and fourth quarter, we'll significantly offset any remaining expenses. So it is a big deal for us in Q2. We were very pleased though with the fairly seamless process that have been in Q1. That was one of our areas of concern about our ability to operate through Q1 effectively, and I know that there were                      some were some discussions about guidance in Q1.

Although, if I had to pick one, I think it has more to do with the operational changes we've made during the declining time. And now that the economy has at least stabilized, you're starting to see some of the benefits. So domestically, it's clearly a story of operating leverage and the benefits of the big changes we've made. And frankly, we're waiting for the tailwind of the economy to kick in. We're looking for modest growth over the course of the year, so that is not betting on the calm. Internationally, it's a positive-positive. It's a story of great operating efficiency and a tremendous boost from both the economy and share gain across the globe. So we feel very positive, frankly, in all of our segments. As you look across every segment at UPS right now, we've got good potential for improvements. The Domestic business has seen the benefits of improved productivity. And streamlining the International business is enjoying strong growth. Our Forwarding business took a little bit of a hit in Q4 with the demand crunch. But we have stabilized that, done some revenue management, and that's in good shape. Our Logistic group is showing great momentum, and even the UPS Freight, which is in a very tough environment, is showing substantial improvements year-over-year in profitability, and we do expect it to be profitable this year, even with the extreme challenges across that industry. So it's a combination of improving trends or at least lack of economic headwinds and a lot of hard work within the company."

In a moment, Scott Davis our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, will discuss first quarter results and expectations going forward. Before they begin, however, I'll briefly review the Safe Harbor language. 
Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2009 Form 10-K report. This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website. 
I want to remind you about three adjustments we made to first quarter results. The $98 million pretax restructuring charge related to the reorganization of the U.S. Domestic Package segment, a $38 million pretax loss on the sale of a Supply Chain business and the $76 million non-cash charge to income tax expense resulting from a change in the tax filing status of a German subsidiary. These charges reduced net income by $175 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.18. 
In addition, in last year's first quarter, there was $181 million aircraft impairment charge, which resulted from the retirement of our DC-8 fleet. The after-tax impact of this charge was $116 million or $0.12 per share. In their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS results excluding the impact of these charges, since we believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. Reconciliation of these adjustments to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release this morning. The schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the financial section. 
In addition, during the call, we refer to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation is included in the news announcement this morning, and is available on the UPS Investor Relations website. 
To begin our review of the quarter, I'll turn the program over to Scott for opening comments."

Last quarter, I mentioned that UPS was well positioned to take advantage of improving global economic trends, that we had the ability to manage effectively in response to changing market conditions. This quarter,",526,"Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I mentioned that UPS was well positioned to take advantage of improving global economic trends, that we had the ability to manage effectively in response to changing market conditions. This quarter, UPS started to prove it. 
The economies around the world are showing signs of recovery. Experts are providing more upbeat forecasts than they were a few months ago. Conditions are slowly starting to improve, and UPS' first quarter results illustrated our ability to take advantage of these trends.
In the quarter, UPS achieved better-than-expected growth in volume, revenue and profit. In particular, the International Package segment really shined. You're seeing how our global product portfolio provides benefits to our customers and our share owners alike. Our strong management team quickly capitalized on this growth while still controlling cost. And we saw the operating leverage inherent in the UPS network. 
Also in the quarter, two significant infrastructure projects came to fruition. These strategically enhanced in our network. We opened the second phase of our Worldport expansion ahead of schedule and under budget. This enables UPS to continue to reduce operations and regional air hubs and fly larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft.
In addition, we began operating our new intra-Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China. This hub allows UPS to better serve our customers by reducing Time-In-Transit for hundreds of city pairs in the area. These projects require significant capital commitment and will enhance customer service, provide better access to international markets and improve efficiencies for UPS around the globe.
In February, the administration announced the National Export Initiative which UPS strongly endorses. It has always been our firm belief that increasing global trade is the best way to stimulate economic recovery and to create jobs. We intend to work with the presidency in any way we can on this new important endeavor. 
Since the beginning of the year, UPS has received wide range in recognitions. The company was named Most Admired in our industry by FORTUNE, one of the top 10 Most Reputable Companies by Forbes, one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens and one of the top 10 global companies in Climate Innovation. UPS was also recognized for our work with women- and minority-owned companies.
Now while words are gratifying, what's important to us is the scope of what's being recognized. These accolades are testaments to the UPS culture that benefits all our stakeholders. They're also a testament to our people. And I want to take a moment to commend UPSers around the world for their focus during the quarter. Our U.S. domestic restructuring is well underway, and the new region and district structure is operational. Everyone is doing a tremendous job managing the business through these changes. 
Let me also recognize our European and airline partners for the outstanding work they did over the last two weeks, in response to the challenges caused by the volcanic eruptions in Iceland. Our product portfolio and extensive European air and ground network enabled us to modify operating plans and limit customer inconvenience. This was a job well done.
Now I'll turn the program over to Kurt to review the operations."
238570,100781986,61389,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Well, it's certainly enjoyable to have a quarter like this one to discuss with you. Revenue was up 7%, operating profit up 31% and earnings per share up 37%, with margin expansion in every segment. The better-than-expected",1180,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Well, it's certainly enjoyable to have a quarter like this one to discuss with you. Revenue was up 7%, operating profit up 31% and earnings per share up 37%, with margin expansion in every segment. The better-than-expected results stemmed from stronger operating performance in each segment than we'd anticipated, yield improvement and operating leverage across the enterprise. I am pleased with our ability to manage cost and increase productivity as volume began to increase. Compensation and benefit expense increased only 1.7%, while our consolidated volume was up 2.7%.
Now let's look at the segments, starting with the U.S. Domestic Package operations. Operating profit jumped 17% on a 2% revenue gain. This increase was driven by higher yields, stabilizing volume, network enhancement and good execution. As a result, operating margin was 9.3%, an increase of 120 basis points. 
While average daily volume increased less than 1%, this was the first quarter since the end of '07 with positive year-over-year growth. The increase in U.S. domestic volume was driven entirely by Ground, outperforming the Air products as expected. The 2% improvement in revenue per piece was the strongest since the third quarter of 2008. It reflects retention of a greater portion of the general rate increase and higher fuel surcharges. Base pricing was up in both Air and Ground, and we expect this positive trend to continue through 2010, especially in our Air products. Once again, our operations team demonstrated our ability to further optimize our network by reducing direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours. And this was accomplished while going through a significant restructuring within our U.S. operations. 
In the quarter, UPS continued using technology to improve efficiency and provide even better customer service with the introduction of UPS Smart Pickup. This industry-first application ensures that UPS drivers stop for packages only when a customer actually needs that service. The process is easy, automated and transparent for customer and driver alike, and will eliminate an estimated 8 million miles of driving annually.
Let's turn now to the International business, where operating profits soared 45% to $427 million on an 18% increase in revenue. Operating profit for this segment approached our historical first quarter peak. In the quarter, UPS experienced balanced growth across all geographies and products, a combination of higher volumes from existing customers and new customer wins. Total average daily volume was up 18%, with export volume increasing more than 9%. All major regions of the world experienced export volume improvements. Asia led the way, up over 20%, followed by the U.S. and Europe, both of which showed strong year-over-year gains. 
During the quarter, we also experienced the lengthening of our trade lanes as interregional trade picked up, as evidenced by the 37% volume increase in our Asia to Europe lane. Yields improved 5%, reflecting firm pricing, positive currency impact and increased fuel surcharges. The 24% gain in non-U.S. domestic volume was helped by our acquisition in Turkey last August. However, organic growth was 13%, powered by strength in our core European markets. This strong improvement was against the backdrop of a weak eurozone economy. UPS' presence in domestic markets outside the U.S. also enables many opportunities to gain export volume. In fact, the substantial percent of our non-U.S. domestic customers also use UPS for their export needs, taking advantage of our broad portfolio.
International operating margins increased 310 basis points to 16.2%. This resulted from leverage due to increased volume and benefits from network and productivity improvements implemented last year. Good control of both operating and non-operating costs produced leverage in our results.
Now for the Supply Chain & Freight segment. Revenue increased 14% and operating profit more than doubled. The Logistics business was the primary driver of the profit increase. Logistics continued to experience strong growth and profitability gains in Healthcare and High Tech. During the quarter, we were proud that Datamonitor recognized UPS as number one in supply chain outsourcing for 2009. This award validates the progress that we've made in building our unique supply chain management capabilities.
Boarding experienced strong tonnage increases, although demand moderated slightly from the fourth quarter. The industry capacity constraints did lessen slightly, resulting in sequential improvements in operating margin. We implemented revenue management plans in the quarter, which will improve margins going forward. 
On the LTL front, UPS Freight remains committed to its strategy of targeted growth in the middle market. As a result, revenue per hundredweight increased 10%, and LTL revenue was up almost 6%, even with modest declines in both shipments and tonnage. This business unit showed solid improvement over last year, although it's still operated at a slight loss. We expect it to be profitable for the year.
Now as I usually do, I want to emphasize the very strong financial foundation that supports UPS. In the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow, even after $630 million in accelerated pension contributions over last year. UPS also invested $280 million in capital expenditures, paid dividends of $470 million, reflecting a 4.4% dividend increase, and spent $260 million to repurchase over 4 million shares. Lastly, we ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Because of the strong first quarter and improvement in the global economic outlook, we raised our expectations for earnings per share this year to a range of $3.05 to $3.30. This is a 32% to 43% increase over last year's results. The year-over-year change in earnings should remain fairly consistent across each quarter, with the fourth quarter showing a lower increase due to a more challenging year-over-year comparison. 
Looking at the segments, for the full year, U.S. domestic average daily volume should improve gradually, with Ground outperforming Air. We expect yields to strengthen as the year progresses, resulting in significant margin expansion for 2010.  Keep in mind though, as we continue with the U.S. restructuring, we will incur additional costs for relocation and training, most of which will occur during the second quarter. These items, which are included in our guidance, will negatively impact earnings by $0.03 to $0.05 in the quarter, constraining margin improvement somewhat.
In our International segment, we anticipate UPS export volume to continue outpacing market growth. Non-U.S. domestic growth should remain strong. But remember, we will lap the date of our Turkish acquisition in August. We expect International operating profit to show strong growth and reflect typical seasonal patterns. Our Supply Chain & Freight segment should generate gradual sequential improvement in operating margin, with the full year margin of at least 5% on about 10% revenue growth.
To summarize, we had an excellent quarter in which we successfully transitioned from a recessionary to a recovery environment. Going forward, we're determined to sustain the enhancements we've made to our cost structure. We'll continue to invest for the future, while remaining focused on disciplined profitable growth. And we're very confident that our diversified global portfolio will help us capitalize on the many growth opportunities ahead.

We've also seen, in our Next Day Air business, some strengthening on the weights. And typically, our Next Day Air package business is one of the most economically sensitive. So that also should add to the top line yields. But we're continuing with a disciplined process of looking at customers and making sure we're pricing per value, and at the same time, growing the business. So we feel pretty comfortable that the environment on pricing will remain rational. And clearly, we're executing towards that."

The big growth areas, in general, and our other costs are purchase transportation and fuel, which is one related to a lot of expense in our Freight Forwarding and the other just the commodity cost. The other expenses has a lot of line items. If you take out the onetime events, it's probably down about 8%.

It may not maintain at that level, but we do certainly intend to sustain the reductions we've made and control all those cost items. So that's the balancing act that we're managing right now."

We've got new technology in place, operationally. We've got new assets in place. The Worldport has done substantial improvements on our network, and a very strong focus across the company. So we feel pretty confident that with a little bit of tailwind from the economy and our operational changes, we'll see great benefits."

Our overall direct labor hours were down 4%, and that's again slightly improve volumes. Our miles driven with our network alignments were down 3%, and we had almost a 10% reduction in block hours in our domestic network. So a lot of changes, a lot of tightening.

We really are blessed to having an expensive European ground network that allowed us to really continue to provide transport or domestic service with really minimal delays to our customers. April 21, we actually open up our Cologne hub, and actually unprecedented volume that was above last year's peak as you'd expect kind of the catch up for the period. We couldn't get us into and out of Europe.  At this point in time we really are now caught up and we're back on track. So I think we've done a very good job. Our customers are pleased with the service offerings to able to help them through this period. But it was quite turbulent. I got to say the least that the actual financial impact. It's too early to tell. We think it's somewhat immaterial for the company, but it's how much volume is lost, how much production was lost during that period of time. I think it's going to take us a few weeks to figure that out, and so we'll talk about that in the next earnings call. The second question, the RLA issue. I guess let me start with by saying UPS supports the passage of that FAA reauthorization bill as quickly as we possibly can. This bill is important to the entire country. As you know, it provides us funding for more than 150,000 jobs. And also much-needed safety in aviation system modernization initiatives. So it's really important that we get this thing done for the country. Regarding the RLA amendment, I think this audience clearly knows the two companies, knows UPS, knows Federal Express and knows that our companies provide similar services and provide services to the similar customers, and do a lot of the same things. It's actually logical that the two companies should governed under different labor laws. Now our point here clearly is that the Express drivers do the same jobs for both companies. They should be governed under the same law. What will happen will be the outcome of this legislation, it's still not clear with us going to a conference committee or will be handled differently. So through the Congress, certainly, we're optimistic we'll get this thing done, but more important is that we get this FAA pick bill passed."

That's really the time at which the vast majority of our people that we repositioned will be relocating substantial amounts of retraining expenses and other realignments and facilities changes. So that's why we've really pulled out second quarter, and said that it will be about a $0.03 to $0.05 headwind in the second quarter. Having said that though, following that, the cost will begin to taper down. It will not be as material, and would likely not be called out at all and the savings for the third and fourth quarter, we'll significantly offset any remaining expenses. So it is a big deal for us in Q2. We were very pleased though with the fairly seamless process that have been in Q1. That was one of our areas of concern about our ability to operate through Q1 effectively, and I know that there were                      some were some discussions about guidance in Q1.

In a moment, Scott Davis our CEO; and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, will discuss first quarter results and expectations going forward. Before they begin, however, I'll briefly review the Safe Harbor language. 
Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2009 Form 10-K report. This report is available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website. 
I want to remind you about three adjustments we made to first quarter results. The $98 million pretax restructuring charge related to the reorganization of the U.S. Domestic Package segment, a $38 million pretax loss on the sale of a Supply Chain business and the $76 million non-cash charge to income tax expense resulting from a change in the tax filing status of a German subsidiary. These charges reduced net income by $175 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.18. 
In addition, in last year's first quarter, there was $181 million aircraft impairment charge, which resulted from the retirement of our DC-8 fleet. The after-tax impact of this charge was $116 million or $0.12 per share. In their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS results excluding the impact of these charges, since we believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. Reconciliation of these adjustments to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release this morning. The schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the financial section. 
In addition, during the call, we refer to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation is included in the news announcement this morning, and is available on the UPS Investor Relations website. 
To begin our review of the quarter, I'll turn the program over to Scott for opening comments."

Last quarter, I mentioned that UPS was well positioned to take advantage of improving global economic trends, that we had the ability to manage effectively in response to changing market conditions. This quarter,",526,"Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I mentioned that UPS was well positioned to take advantage of improving global economic trends, that we had the ability to manage effectively in response to changing market conditions. This quarter, UPS started to prove it. 
The economies around the world are showing signs of recovery. Experts are providing more upbeat forecasts than they were a few months ago. Conditions are slowly starting to improve, and UPS' first quarter results illustrated our ability to take advantage of these trends.
In the quarter, UPS achieved better-than-expected growth in volume, revenue and profit. In particular, the International Package segment really shined. You're seeing how our global product portfolio provides benefits to our customers and our share owners alike. Our strong management team quickly capitalized on this growth while still controlling cost. And we saw the operating leverage inherent in the UPS network. 
Also in the quarter, two significant infrastructure projects came to fruition. These strategically enhanced in our network. We opened the second phase of our Worldport expansion ahead of schedule and under budget. This enables UPS to continue to reduce operations and regional air hubs and fly larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft.
In addition, we began operating our new intra-Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China. This hub allows UPS to better serve our customers by reducing Time-In-Transit for hundreds of city pairs in the area. These projects require significant capital commitment and will enhance customer service, provide better access to international markets and improve efficiencies for UPS around the globe.
In February, the administration announced the National Export Initiative which UPS strongly endorses. It has always been our firm belief that increasing global trade is the best way to stimulate economic recovery and to create jobs. We intend to work with the presidency in any way we can on this new important endeavor. 
Since the beginning of the year, UPS has received wide range in recognitions. The company was named Most Admired in our industry by FORTUNE, one of the top 10 Most Reputable Companies by Forbes, one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens and one of the top 10 global companies in Climate Innovation. UPS was also recognized for our work with women- and minority-owned companies.
Now while words are gratifying, what's important to us is the scope of what's being recognized. These accolades are testaments to the UPS culture that benefits all our stakeholders. They're also a testament to our people. And I want to take a moment to commend UPSers around the world for their focus during the quarter. Our U.S. domestic restructuring is well underway, and the new region and district structure is operational. Everyone is doing a tremendous job managing the business through these changes. 
Let me also recognize our European and airline partners for the outstanding work they did over the last two weeks, in response to the challenges caused by the volcanic eruptions in Iceland. Our product portfolio and extensive European air and ground network enabled us to modify operating plans and limit customer inconvenience. This was a job well done.
Now I'll turn the program over to Kurt to review the operations."
238570,100781986,66747,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Well, it's certainly enjoyable to have a quarter like this one to discuss with you. Revenue was up 7%, operating profit up 31% and earnings per share up 37%, with margin expansion in every segment. The better-than-expected",1180,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Well, it's certainly enjoyable to have a quarter like this one to discuss with you. Revenue was up 7%, operating profit up 31% and earnings per share up 37%, with margin expansion in every segment. The better-than-expected results stemmed from stronger operating performance in each segment than we'd anticipated, yield improvement and operating leverage across the enterprise. I am pleased with our ability to manage cost and increase productivity as volume began to increase. Compensation and benefit expense increased only 1.7%, while our consolidated volume was up 2.7%.
Now let's look at the segments, starting with the U.S. Domestic Package operations. Operating profit jumped 17% on a 2% revenue gain. This increase was driven by higher yields, stabilizing volume, network enhancement and good execution. As a result, operating margin was 9.3%, an increase of 120 basis points. 
While average daily volume increased less than 1%, this was the first quarter since the end of '07 with positive year-over-year growth. The increase in U.S. domestic volume was driven entirely by Ground, outperforming the Air products as expected. The 2% improvement in revenue per piece was the strongest since the third quarter of 2008. It reflects retention of a greater portion of the general rate increase and higher fuel surcharges. Base pricing was up in both Air and Ground, and we expect this positive trend to continue through 2010, especially in our Air products. Once again, our operations team demonstrated our ability to further optimize our network by reducing direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours. And this was accomplished while going through a significant restructuring within our U.S. operations. 
In the quarter, UPS continued using technology to improve efficiency and provide even better customer service with the introduction of UPS Smart Pickup. This industry-first application ensures that UPS drivers stop for packages only when a customer actually needs that service. The process is easy, automated and transparent for customer and driver alike, and will eliminate an estimated 8 million miles of driving annually.
Let's turn now to the International business, where operating profits soared 45% to $427 million on an 18% increase in revenue. Operating profit for this segment approached our historical first quarter peak. In the quarter, UPS experienced balanced growth across all geographies and products, a combination of higher volumes from existing customers and new customer wins. Total average daily volume was up 18%, with export volume increasing more than 9%. All major regions of the world experienced export volume improvements. Asia led the way, up over 20%, followed by the U.S. and Europe, both of which showed strong year-over-year gains. 
During the quarter, we also experienced the lengthening of our trade lanes as interregional trade picked up, as evidenced by the 37% volume increase in our Asia to Europe lane. Yields improved 5%, reflecting firm pricing, positive currency impact and increased fuel surcharges. The 24% gain in non-U.S. domestic volume was helped by our acquisition in Turkey last August. However, organic growth was 13%, powered by strength in our core European markets. This strong improvement was against the backdrop of a weak eurozone economy. UPS' presence in domestic markets outside the U.S. also enables many opportunities to gain export volume. In fact, the substantial percent of our non-U.S. domestic customers also use UPS for their export needs, taking advantage of our broad portfolio.
International operating margins increased 310 basis points to 16.2%. This resulted from leverage due to increased volume and benefits from network and productivity improvements implemented last year. Good control of both operating and non-operating costs produced leverage in our results.
Now for the Supply Chain & Freight segment. Revenue increased 14% and operating profit more than doubled. The Logistics business was the primary driver of the profit increase. Logistics continued to experience strong growth and profitability gains in Healthcare and High Tech. During the quarter, we were proud that Datamonitor recognized UPS as number one in supply chain outsourcing for 2009. This award validates the progress that we've made in building our unique supply chain management capabilities.
Boarding experienced strong tonnage increases, although demand moderated slightly from the fourth quarter. The industry capacity constraints did lessen slightly, resulting in sequential improvements in operating margin. We implemented revenue management plans in the quarter, which will improve margins going forward. 
On the LTL front, UPS Freight remains committed to its strategy of targeted growth in the middle market. As a result, revenue per hundredweight increased 10%, and LTL revenue was up almost 6%, even with modest declines in both shipments and tonnage. This business unit showed solid improvement over last year, although it's still operated at a slight loss. We expect it to be profitable for the year.
Now as I usually do, I want to emphasize the very strong financial foundation that supports UPS. In the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow, even after $630 million in accelerated pension contributions over last year. UPS also invested $280 million in capital expenditures, paid dividends of $470 million, reflecting a 4.4% dividend increase, and spent $260 million to repurchase over 4 million shares. Lastly, we ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Because of the strong first quarter and improvement in the global economic outlook, we raised our expectations for earnings per share this year to a range of $3.05 to $3.30. This is a 32% to 43% increase over last year's results. The year-over-year change in earnings should remain fairly consistent across each quarter, with the fourth quarter showing a lower increase due to a more challenging year-over-year comparison. 
Looking at the segments, for the full year, U.S. domestic average daily volume should improve gradually, with Ground outperforming Air. We expect yields to strengthen as the year progresses, resulting in significant margin expansion for 2010.  Keep in mind though, as we continue with the U.S. restructuring, we will incur additional costs for relocation and training, most of which will occur during the second quarter. These items, which are included in our guidance, will negatively impact earnings by $0.03 to $0.05 in the quarter, constraining margin improvement somewhat.
In our International segment, we anticipate UPS export volume to continue outpacing market growth. Non-U.S. domestic growth should remain strong. But remember, we will lap the date of our Turkish acquisition in August. We expect International operating profit to show strong growth and reflect typical seasonal patterns. Our Supply Chain & Freight segment should generate gradual sequential improvement in operating margin, with the full year margin of at least 5% on about 10% revenue growth.
To summarize, we had an excellent quarter in which we successfully transitioned from a recessionary to a recovery environment. Going forward, we're determined to sustain the enhancements we've made to our cost structure. We'll continue to invest for the future, while remaining focused on disciplined profitable growth. And we're very confident that our diversified global portfolio will help us capitalize on the many growth opportunities ahead. 
Thanks for your attention. And now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions."

The other expenses has a lot of line items. If you take out the onetime events, it's probably down about 8%.

So there's tremendous upside for us to help customers migrate over to UPS, and we have seen great momentum there. And then the other is to increase our share of wallet. The advantage of our broad integrated portfolio as customers can move up and down that portfolio, and that's -- we've also see that happening as things begin to firm. So even with the economy still suspect, especially in Europe, we are seeing very good organic growth on existing customers as they begin to use a greater portion of our portfolio."

And that's why we saw really the breakthrough results in there. Domestically, there was not as much of a tailwind on the volume side, so we made up for it with productivity and network refinements. Our overall direct labor hours were down 4%, and that's, again, slightly improved volumes. Our miles driven with our network alignments were down 3%, and we had almost a 10% reduction in block hours in our domestic network. So a lot of changes, a lot of tightening. And so we're seeing substantial margin improvement even without the tailwind of substantial volume growth. And as Scott mentioned, if the U.S. economy continues to firm, then that gives us another tailwind and we're able to leverage some other economies, like the wage rate improvement in the growing environment."

And clearly, the period from April 14th to April 20 was quite turbulent as we all know. We were able to continue to provide pickup and delivery service and rerouted open flights to other parts of Europe that were opened during that period. We really are blessed with having an expensive European ground network that allowed us to really continue to provide transport and domestic service with really minimal delays to our customers. April 21, we actually opened up our Cologne hub, and actually unprecedented volume. This was above last year's peak as you'd expect trying to catch up for the period we couldn't get us into and out of Europe.  At this point in time, we really are now caught up and we're back on track. So I think we've done a very good job. Our customers are pleased with the service offerings to be  able to help them through this period. But it was quite turbulent, I got to say the least. The actual financial impact, it's too early to tell. We think it's somewhat immaterial to the company, but it's how much volume is lost, how much production was lost during that period of time. I think it's going to take us a few weeks to figure that out, and so we'll talk about that in the next earnings call. The second question, the RLA issue. I guess let me start by saying UPS supports the passage of that FAA Reauthorization bill as quickly as we possibly can. This bill is important to the entire country. As you know, it provides funding for more than 150,000 jobs. And also much needed safety in aviation system modernization initiatives. So it's really important that we get this thing done for the country. Regarding the RLA amendment, I think this audience clearly knows the two companies, knows UPS, knows Federal Express and knows that our companies provide similar services and provide services to similar customers, and do a lot of the same things. It's actually illogical that the two companies should governed under different labor laws. Now our point here, clearly, is that the Express drivers do the same jobs for both companies, they should be governed under the same law. What will happen with the outcome of this legislation, it's still not clear whether it's going to a conference committee or will be handled differently, through Congress. But certainly, we're optimistic we'll get this thing done, but most important is that we get this FAA reauthorization bill passed."

That's really the time at which the vast majority of our people that we''ve repositioned will be relocating substantial amounts of retraining expenses and other realignments and facilities changes. So that's why we've really pulled out second quarter, and said that it will be about a $0.03 to $0.05 headwind in the second quarter. Having said that though, following that, the cost will begin to taper down. It will not be as material, and would likely not be called out at all and the savings for the third and fourth quarter will significantly offset any remaining expenses. So it is a big deal for us in Q2. We were very pleased though with the fairly seamless process that happened in Q1. That was one of our areas of concern about our ability to operate through Q1 effectively, and I know that there were                      some were some discussions about guidance in Q1. So we've been thrilled with how smooth that went, how well our operations continued, even with this major change going. So Q2 will be the time that we get the majority of the knitting done and expenses, and then after that, we'll be in good shape going forward.

So it's been really a flawless opening, it operated well through peak on about half the added capacity and then in the quarter than we brought it fully up the speed, and now it's able to do over 400,000 pieces an hour, which is just tremendous. And we did spend over $900 million for this expansion. But those benefits paid back very quickly, with reduced aircraft purchases and with reduced operating expenses in the air. So that's been a great investment for us, even in the midst of the worst recession in any of our careers."

Before they begin, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2009 form 10-K and first quarter 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.
I want to remind you of an adjustment we made in the second quarter of 2009 for certain foreign currency obligations which did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The after tax impact of this charge was $48 million or $0.05 per share. In the remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS' second quarter 2009 results excluding the impact of this charge. Additionally, all 2010 full year references and comparisons to 2009 will refer to adjusted results.  We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. 
Reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release this morning. The schedules are also available on the UPS IR website in the Financials section. Finally, during the call, we refer to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation is also included in the news announcement this morning and is available on the UPS Investor Relations website.

UPS earnings jumped 71% on revenue growth of 13% with improvement across all business units.  Now, this was achieved despite the fact that mixed economic signals continue to dominate the headlines. The U.S. is witnessing strong corporate earnings and moderate GDP growth, although employment and housing data remain weak. The debt crisis in Europe has kept everyone's interest, the stock markets around the globe reflecting this uncertainty. Yet, we are pleased that our European business showed solid growth again this quarter.  And Asia continued to experience significant economic expansion. Our export volumes in the region grew over 40%. UPS has exceeded this environment while also investing to further strengthen our global network. 
In the quarter, we enhanced and built new relationships with partners in Asia. UPS expanded the reach for our services through strategic alliances in Vietnam and in Malaysia, providing greater access to customers in these important emerging markets.
In May, UPS announced a significant new partnership in China with Alibaba, the world's largest small business e-commerce company. The agreement benefits UPS by giving us access to small and medium-size wholesalers through their new online marketplace. This platform provides easy use of our services for Chinese suppliers and eventually will be available to users around the globe. Our approach to international expansion, using alliances, service partners and acquisitions, has proved to be successful. The evidence can be seen in the strong international growth UPS has delivered over the years.  We are confident in this strategy. In fact, during the quarter, UPS was recognized as the market leader in Poland by industry trade magazines and the local press, accomplishing this in just five years following our acquisition of Stalicha. [ph] (18:22) Poland has become a key manufacturing center and distribution point for Europe. 
I am equally confident in our U.S. domestic strategy. Our reorganization effort has started to pay dividends. UPSers has embraced the need for change and quickly adapted to the new organizational structure. Through the superb execution of our people, significant network efficiencies have been achieved, and our go-to market strategy is beginning to bear fruit. In the midst of the one of the most substantial changes in our history, the U.S. domestic segment reported 57% improvement in operating profit. We are not yet where we need to be, but we are moving in the right direction. 
Earlier this month, I was honored when President Obama asked me to serve on his Export Council. I look forward to working with administration and other business leaders to help achieve the objective of doubling U.S. experts in the next five years. To support the Export Council Initiative, UPS announced several key undertakings to help U.S. small businesses compete globally. Only 1% of U.S. small and medium-size businesses export products, and most to only one country.  Since 96% of consumers live outside the U.S., it's important that we help our customers expand their businesses and compete in the global marketplace. 
Before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to say that I am encouraged by our performance as we realize the benefits of our efforts. We made the right decisions, took the right actions and are confident of UPS' ability to substantially improve results during this moderate economic recovery.

UPS global revenue was up 13%, with operating profits skyrocketing 57%. This is despite a mixed global economic environment. 
The operating leverage we demonstrated in the first quarter has continued as witnessed by our margin expansion of 320 basis points. For the third quarter in a row, our compensation and benefit expense grew at a slower rate than volume.
The numerous changes that UPS has made and the investments in our global network are paying off. Our progress on these has led us to increase our 2010 earnings guidance. 
Now let's look at the segments, starting with U.S. Domestic Package.  Operating profit is up 57% on a 7% revenue gain. This increase was driven by yield improvements, increased volume, network efficiencies and superb execution. As a result, operating margin was 10.3%, an increase of 330 basis points. 
Average daily volume increased more than 1% with ground up 2%. We are also beginning to see UPS customers trade up to premium services, and that is encouraging. While volume in our Next Day Air was flat overall, we saw solid growth in Next Day Package, although this was offset by a decline in our Letter products. This positive mix shift helped drive our 11% improvement in air yields.
Total Domestic revenue per piece increased 6%, driven by stronger base rates and higher fuel surcharges. Our focus on yield management is clearly showing results. 
The U.S. operations team executed this quarter to near perfection with improved productivity, service and cost management. With an increased volume, UPS direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours were all down. A job well done when you also consider the challenges presented by our U.S. restructuring.
We experienced substantial relocation and training expenses for the restructuring during the quarter. The impact was partially offset by reductions in payroll. As a result, the net effect overall was approximately $0.02.
Now for the International segment, where operating profit soared 78% to $521 million on a 23% jump in revenue. Volume increased 20%, with exports up 15% and non-U.S. domestic up 24%. We've seen international volume exceed 2 million pieces per day for three consecutive quarters, and for the first half of the year, UPS International profits were the best in our history.
During the quarter, UPS experienced strong export growth in all regions, with Asia up more than 40%. Both U.S. and Europe export volumes were up more than 10%. Operating margin climbed to 18.8%, an increase of 580 basis points. The improved margin was driven by higher yields and effective management of our network by the operations team.  For example, during the quarter, our in-country cost per piece declined over 4%. 
Over the past few months, there have been questions about how currency fluctuations will impact UPS results. Due to our hedging positions, currency did not have a material impact during the quarter. This will likely change as the year progresses, and I will talk about that later.
Export yields are up 9% due to stable pricing, fuel surcharges and positive changes in product mix as customers traded up to higher service levels. For example, in our premium product, Worldwide Express, volume growth was more than 20%. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 24% driven by core countries in Europe and Canada. These results are also impacted by our August, 2009 acquisition in Turkey. Organic growth was equally impressive, up 13%.  The value of the domestic and export portfolio continues to resonate with customers. 
Our results in Europe are impressive considering the disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud, and I want to recognize the great effort our team made during the quarter. Our customers told us that UPS saved the day by acting quickly to ensure dependable service. We leveraged our extensive pan-European ground network, and kept their goods moving. UPS technology enabled us to provide accurate and timely visibility throughout this challenging event.  Financially, the impact of the volcano was not material. 
UPS recently announced significant upgrades to several of our international shipping systems. These enhancements improve ease-of-use, visibility and provide importers with greater control of their shipments.  We will continue to introduce innovative products and solutions that help our customers compete in the global marketplace. 
Now for the Supply Chain and Trade segment. Revenue increased 21% on the strength of the Forwarding and Logistics business, with operating margins over 6%.  Keep in mind that last year's operating margin benefited by about 100 basis points from the sale of the International MBE business. Forwarding experienced improved results this quarter, with strong tonnage growth led by high-tech. Industry capacity continues to be constrained putting some pressure on our margins. We remain focused on revenue management, and expect to see margin expansion as the year progresses.
As expected, UPS Freight has returned to profitability this quarter, a result of our targeted growth strategy. Freight revenue per hundred weight increased 9%. This will again be one of the industry's best results. Though we had modest declines in shipments and tonnage, weight per shipment improved. 
Our Logistics business unit continues to experience strong results from the healthcare and high-tech industries. Solutions created within this unit enable us to add value for our customers, benefiting through the alignment of multiple UPS capabilities. This is unmatched in the industry.
Once again, the unique UPS operating model produced significant cash. Year-to-date, we have generated more than $2.5 billion in free cash flow. In addition, we have invested $690 million in capital expenditures, paid dividends of $910 million, reflecting a 4.4% dividend increase, spent $425 million to repurchase approximately $7 million shares, and UPS ended the period with over $4 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
UPS' cash position remains strong. We will continue to follow our current stock repurchase strategy of offsetting the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation. We will consider changing this strategy once the S&P outlet for UPS is modified. I am confident of meeting their targets by the end of this year. 
This quarter, we did mark down certain auction-rate securities to their market value. The write-down was $21 million offset to our investment income.
Now for some comments on our outlook. Looking forward, even when we consider expectations for a slow economic recovery in the U.S. and the uncertain outlook in Europe, we are more confident than we were earlier in the year in UPS' ability to grow and generate substantial profits. This leads us to raise our full year 2010 guidance to an expected range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share. This represents a 45% to 50% increase over last year's results.
Looking at the segments. In the Domestic segment, volume should grow in line with GDP for the remainder of the year. The third quarter will show better results due to easier comps and the way the Fourth of July holiday fell last year. We expect to continue seeing significant year-over-year margin expansion. 
In our International segment, for the second half of the year, we do expect to see export growth rates moderate but still outpace the market. The rate of volume growth will somewhat depend on whether the Asia export market continues to grow at its current lofty pace. Also, year-over-year comps will become more challenging, particularly in the fourth quarter.  We do expect a headwind from currency in the second half of the year of approximately $25 million per quarter. Based on these assumptions, we expect International profits for the remainder of the year to reflect typical seasonal trends with the third quarter lower than the fourth. 
The Supply Chain and Freight segments should produce full-year margins of approximately 6% on revenue growth in the low teens.
All in all, UPS had a tremendous quarter, led by significant margin expansion on strong revenue growth in our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. We are very encouraged by the accelerated growth we're seeing in revenue and profit across all business units. Our ability to generate cash, coupled with an outlook for moderate capital requirements, will ensure that UPS continues to generate significant shareowner value going forward. 
Thanks for your attention. And now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions."

I think right now, there is somewhat of an ocean squeeze. Containers are hard to get. And that, combined with the fact that there were a number of shippers last year that really got stretched late into the holiday season, that's why there was such an explosion in the forwarding activities. So we are seeing, I think, shippers plan ahead a little more, perhaps plan to use a little more air, clearly. The Air Forwarding and our Air Express businesses are growing very rapidly. So in general, my guess is there will be a little heavier concentration of air this year for the holidays."

I mean, that makes great press, but frankly, we're very comfortable with our 747-400 assets. So we can pretty much to go toe-to-toe. The 747 costs 40% to 50% less than a 777 from a capital perspective.

I mean, we want to compete on service and speed and quality. And so that's what makes the market a healthy one. So we see competition continuing normally. We're continuing to reinvest with technology, capacity and merging all of our capabilities. And that's one of the big stories where I think we’re really succeeding these days. It’s all about the pieces of the UPS puzzle coming together. So all in all, we think the competitive environment is very positive. All providers are competing like crazy, but also being rational.

I think one of the areas where we've not seen the operating leverage as much is in the wage arena. Clearly, with us continuing to improve productivity, we've not had a need to add many employees. So we’ve still not yet seen the latent benefits of the labor contract, whereas we began to grow and add employees. We will see lower average wage rates ripple through the network.

Before they begin, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2009 form 10-K and first quarter 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.
I want to remind you of an adjustment we made in the second quarter of 2009 for certain foreign currency obligations which did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The after tax impact of this charge was $48 million or $0.05 per share. In the remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS' second quarter 2009 results excluding the impact of this charge. Additionally, all 2010 full year references and comparisons to 2009 will refer to adjusted results.  We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. 
Reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release this morning. The schedules are also available on the UPS IR website in the Financials section. Finally, during the call, we refer to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation is also included in the news announcement this morning and is available on the UPS Investor Relations website. 
To begin our review of the quarter, I'll turn the program over to Scott.

UPS earnings jumped 71% on revenue growth of 13% with improvement across all business units.  Now, this was achieved despite the fact that mixed economic signals continue to dominate the headlines. The U.S. is witnessing strong corporate earnings and moderate GDP growth, although employment and housing data remain weak. The debt crisis in Europe has kept everyone's interest, the stock markets around the globe reflecting this uncertainty. Yet, we are pleased that our European business showed solid growth again this quarter.  And Asia continued to experience significant economic expansion. Our export volumes in the region grew over 40%. UPS has exceeded this environment while also investing to further strengthen our global network. 
In the quarter, we enhanced and built new relationships with partners in Asia. UPS expanded the reach for our services through strategic alliances in Vietnam and in Malaysia, providing greater access to customers in these important emerging markets.
In May, UPS announced a significant new partnership in China with Alibaba, the world's largest small business e-commerce company. The agreement benefits UPS by giving us access to small and medium-size wholesalers through their new online marketplace. This platform provides easy use of our services for Chinese suppliers and eventually will be available to users around the globe. Our approach to international expansion, using alliances, service partners and acquisitions, has proved to be successful. The evidence can be seen in the strong international growth UPS has delivered over the years.  We are confident in this strategy. In fact, during the quarter, UPS was recognized as the market leader in Poland by industry trade magazines and the local press, accomplishing this in just five years following our acquisition of Stalicha. [ph] (18:22) Poland has become a key manufacturing center and distribution point for Europe. 
I am equally confident in our U.S. domestic strategy. Our reorganization effort has started to pay dividends. UPSers has embraced the need for change and quickly adapted to the new organizational structure. Through the superb execution of our people, significant network efficiencies have been achieved, and our go-to market strategy is beginning to bear fruit. In the midst of the one of the most substantial changes in our history, the U.S. domestic segment reported 57% improvement in operating profit. We are not yet where we need to be, but we are moving in the right direction. 
Earlier this month, I was honored when President Obama asked me to serve on his Export Council. I look forward to working with administration and other business leaders to help achieve the objective of doubling U.S. experts in the next five years. To support the Export Council Initiative, UPS announced several key undertakings to help U.S. small businesses compete globally. Only 1% of U.S. small and medium-size businesses export products, and most to only one country.  Since 96% of consumers live outside the U.S., it's important that we help our customers expand their businesses and compete in the global marketplace. 
Before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to say that I am encouraged by our performance as we realize the benefits of our efforts. We made the right decisions, took the right actions and are confident of UPS' ability to substantially improve results during this moderate economic recovery.
Kurt?

It's good to talk to you today, especially turning in great results like this. UPS global revenue was up 13%, with operating profits skyrocketing 57%. This is despite a mixed global economic environment. The operating le",1374,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. It's good to talk to you today, especially turning in great results like this. UPS global revenue was up 13%, with operating profits skyrocketing 57%. This is despite a mixed global economic environment. 
The operating leverage we demonstrated in the first quarter has continued as witnessed by our margin expansion of 320 basis points. For the third quarter in a row, our compensation and benefit expense grew at a slower rate than volume.
The numerous changes that UPS has made and the investments in our global network are paying off. Our progress on these has led us to increase our 2010 earnings guidance. 
Now let's look at the segments, starting with U.S. Domestic Package.  Operating profit is up 57% on a 7% revenue gain. This increase was driven by yield improvements, increased volume, network efficiencies and superb execution. As a result, operating margin was 10.3%, an increase of 330 basis points. 
Average daily volume increased more than 1% with ground up 2%. We are also beginning to see UPS customers trade up to premium services, and that is encouraging. While volume in our Next Day Air was flat overall, we saw solid growth in Next Day Package, although this was offset by a decline in our Letter products. This positive mix shift helped drive our 11% improvement in air yields.
Total Domestic revenue per piece increased 6%, driven by stronger base rates and higher fuel surcharges. Our focus on yield management is clearly showing results. 
The U.S. operations team executed this quarter to near perfection with improved productivity, service and cost management. With an increased volume, UPS direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours were all down. A job well done when you also consider the challenges presented by our U.S. restructuring.
We experienced substantial relocation and training expenses for the restructuring during the quarter. The impact was partially offset by reductions in payroll. As a result, the net effect overall was approximately $0.02.
Now for the International segment, where operating profit soared 78% to $521 million on a 23% jump in revenue. Volume increased 20%, with exports up 15% and non-U.S. domestic up 24%. We've seen international volume exceed 2 million pieces per day for three consecutive quarters, and for the first half of the year, UPS International profits were the best in our history.
During the quarter, UPS experienced strong export growth in all regions, with Asia up more than 40%. Both U.S. and Europe export volumes were up more than 10%. Operating margin climbed to 18.8%, an increase of 580 basis points. The improved margin was driven by higher yields and effective management of our network by the operations team.  For example, during the quarter, our in-country cost per piece declined over 4%. 
Over the past few months, there have been questions about how currency fluctuations will impact UPS results. Due to our hedging positions, currency did not have a material impact during the quarter. This will likely change as the year progresses, and I will talk about that later.
Export yields are up 9% due to stable pricing, fuel surcharges and positive changes in product mix as customers traded up to higher service levels. For example, in our premium product, Worldwide Express, volume growth was more than 20%. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 24% driven by core countries in Europe and Canada. These results are also impacted by our August, 2009 acquisition in Turkey. Organic growth was equally impressive, up 13%.  The value of the domestic and export portfolio continues to resonate with customers. 
Our results in Europe are impressive considering the disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud, and I want to recognize the great effort our team made during the quarter. Our customers told us that UPS saved the day by acting quickly to ensure dependable service. We leveraged our extensive pan-European ground network, and kept their goods moving. UPS technology enabled us to provide accurate and timely visibility throughout this challenging event.  Financially, the impact of the volcano was not material. 
UPS recently announced significant upgrades to several of our international shipping systems. These enhancements improve ease-of-use, visibility and provide importers with greater control of their shipments.  We will continue to introduce innovative products and solutions that help our customers compete in the global marketplace. 
Now for the Supply Chain and Trade segment. Revenue increased 21% on the strength of the Forwarding and Logistics business, with operating margins over 6%.  Keep in mind that last year's operating margin benefited by about 100 basis points from the sale of the International MBE business. Forwarding experienced improved results this quarter, with strong tonnage growth led by high-tech. Industry capacity continues to be constrained putting some pressure on our margins. We remain focused on revenue management, and expect to see margin expansion as the year progresses.
As expected, UPS Freight has returned to profitability this quarter, a result of our targeted growth strategy. Freight revenue per hundred weight increased 9%. This will again be one of the industry's best results. Though we had modest declines in shipments and tonnage, weight per shipment improved. 
Our Logistics business unit continues to experience strong results from the healthcare and high-tech industries. Solutions created within this unit enable us to add value for our customers, benefiting through the alignment of multiple UPS capabilities. This is unmatched in the industry.
Once again, the unique UPS operating model produced significant cash. Year-to-date, we have generated more than $2.5 billion in free cash flow. In addition, we have invested $690 million in capital expenditures, paid dividends of $910 million, reflecting a 4.4% dividend increase, spent $425 million to repurchase approximately $7 million shares, and UPS ended the period with over $4 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
UPS' cash position remains strong. We will continue to follow our current stock repurchase strategy of offsetting the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation. We will consider changing this strategy once the S&P outlet for UPS is modified. I am confident of meeting their targets by the end of this year. 
This quarter, we did mark down certain auction-rate securities to their market value. The write-down was $21 million offset to our investment income.
Now for some comments on our outlook. Looking forward, even when we consider expectations for a slow economic recovery in the U.S. and the uncertain outlook in Europe, we are more confident than we were earlier in the year in UPS' ability to grow and generate substantial profits. This leads us to raise our full year 2010 guidance to an expected range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share. This represents a 45% to 50% increase over last year's results.
Looking at the segments. In the Domestic segment, volume should grow in line with GDP for the remainder of the year. The third quarter will show better results due to easier comps and the way the Fourth of July holiday fell last year. We expect to continue seeing significant year-over-year margin expansion. 
In our International segment, for the second half of the year, we do expect to see export growth rates moderate but still outpace the market. The rate of volume growth will somewhat depend on whether the Asia export market continues to grow at its current lofty pace. Also, year-over-year comps will become more challenging, particularly in the fourth quarter.  We do expect a headwind from currency in the second half of the year of approximately $25 million per quarter. Based on these assumptions, we expect International profits for the remainder of the year to reflect typical seasonal trends with the third quarter lower than the fourth. 
The Supply Chain and Freight segments should produce full-year margins of approximately 6% on revenue growth in the low teens.
All in all, UPS had a tremendous quarter, led by significant margin expansion on strong revenue growth in our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. We are very encouraged by the accelerated growth we're seeing in revenue and profit across all business units. Our ability to generate cash, coupled with an outlook for moderate capital requirements, will ensure that UPS continues to generate significant shareowner value going forward. 
Thanks for your attention. And now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions.

In reality, I think the outlook for the Euro zone GDP has probably dropped from like a 1.5% growth rate to a 1% growth rate through all of this hoopla on the sovereign debt issue. So I don't think it's changed that dramatically, and certainly our business has been very strong. We talked about the digit growth in our European export products and you saw the growth in European domestic products. So it actually feels pretty good over there. We're going to be watchful and see what happens, but right now it feels pretty good in Europe.

Although, we also were able to get some of the labor savings a little quicker than our plan. So the net impact for Q2 was about a $0.02 headwind overall of cost. That will improve in the third quarter, where the amount of reloads [ph] begin to taper down. So it will be a very modest positive in the third quarter, and then in the fourth quarter, we’ll see more of the benefit. But we do continue to estimate about a $0.10 a share benefit from the Domestic restructuring. That will be manifest for 2011. Clearly, it's one of the things we have going into next year that will be a positive. So the overall restructuring was the net positive $0.02 a share; a little better than, frankly, we’d thought. But on top of that is just the ongoing benefit from the wide array of cost initiatives and network enhancements we’ve made. And that's why we're seeing three quarters in a row now where an aggregate, our comp in benefits, are increasing at a slower rate than our package volume.

In the Freight Forwarding/Logistics world, again, if we find areas that will fortify trade lanes or add capabilities and logistics, we'll take a look at those also.

Before they begin, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2009 form 10-K and first quarter 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.
I want to remind you of an adjustment we made in the second quarter of 2009 for certain foreign currency obligations which did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The after tax impact of this charge was $48 million or $0.05 per share. In the remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS' second quarter 2009 results excluding the impact of this charge. Additionally, all 2010 full year references and comparisons to 2009 will refer to adjusted results. We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. 
Reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release this morning. The schedules are also available on the UPS IR website in the Financials section. Finally, during the call, we refer to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation is also included in the news announcement this morning and is available on the UPS Investor Relations website.

UPS earnings jumped 71% on revenue growth of 13% with improvement across all business units. Now this was achieved despite the fact that mixed economic signals continue to dominate the headlines. The U.S. is witnessing strong corporate earnings and moderate GDP growth, although employment and housing data remain weak. The debt crisis in Europe has kept everyone's interest, with stock markets around the globe reflecting this uncertainty. Yet we are pleased that our European business showed solid growth again this quarter. And Asia continued to experience significant economic expansion. Our export volumes in the region grew over 40%. UPS has succeeded in this environment while also investing to further strengthen our global network. 
In the quarter, we enhanced and built new relationships with partners in Asia. UPS expanded the reach for our services through strategic alliances in Vietnam and in Malaysia, providing greater access to customers in these important emerging markets.
In May, UPS announced a significant new partnership in China with Alibaba, the world's largest small business e-commerce company. The agreement benefits UPS by giving us access to small- and medium-size wholesalers through their new online marketplace. This platform provides easy use of our services for Chinese suppliers and eventually will be available to users around the globe. Our approach to international expansion, using alliances, service partners and acquisitions, has proved to be successful. The evidence can be seen in the strong international growth UPS has delivered over the years. We are confident in this strategy. In fact, during the quarter, UPS was recognized as the market leader in Poland by industry trade magazines and the local press, accomplishing this in just five years following our acquisition of Stolica. Poland has become a key manufacturing center and distribution point for Europe. 
I am equally confident in our U.S. domestic strategy. Our reorganization effort has started to pay dividends. UPSers have embraced the need for change and quickly adapted to the new organizational structure. Through the superb execution of our people, significant network efficiencies have been achieved, and our go-to-market strategy is beginning to bear fruit. In the midst of the one of the most substantial changes in our history, the U.S. domestic segment reported 57% improvement in operating profit. We are not yet where we need to be, but we are moving in the right direction. 
Earlier this month, I was honored when President Obama asked me to serve on his Export Council. I look forward to working with the administration and other business leaders to help achieve the objective of doubling U.S. exports in the next five years. To support the Export Council Initiative, UPS announced several key undertakings to help U.S. small businesses compete globally. Only 1% of U.S. small- and medium-size businesses export products and most to only one country. Since 96% of consumers live outside the U.S., it's important that we help our customers expand their businesses and compete in the global marketplace. 
Before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to say that I am encouraged by our performance as we realize the benefits of our efforts. We made the right decisions, took the right actions and are confident of UPS' ability to substantially improve results during this moderate economic recovery.

It's good to talk to you today, especially after turning in great results like this. UPS global revenue was up 13%, with operating profits skyrocketing 57%. This is despite a mixed global economic environment. The operat",1374,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. It's good to talk to you today, especially after turning in great results like this. UPS global revenue was up 13%, with operating profits skyrocketing 57%. This is despite a mixed global economic environment. 
The operating leverage we demonstrated in the first quarter has continued, as witnessed by our margin expansion of 320 basis points. For the third quarter in a row, our compensation and benefit expense grew at a slower rate than volume.
The numerous changes that UPS has made and the investments in our global network are paying off. Our progress on these has led us to increase our 2010 earnings guidance. 
Now let's look at the segments, starting with U.S. Domestic Package. Operating profit is up 57% on a 7% revenue gain. This increase was driven by yield improvements, increased volume, network efficiencies and superb execution. As a result, operating margin was 10.3%, an increase of 330 basis points. 
Average daily volume increased more than 1% with ground up 2%. We are also beginning to see UPS customers trade up to premium services and that is encouraging. While volume in our Next Day Air was flat overall, we saw solid growth in Next Day Package, although this was offset by a decline in our Letter products. This positive mix shift helped drive our 11% improvement in air yields.
Total Domestic revenue per piece increased 6%, driven by stronger base rates and higher fuel surcharges. Our focus on yield management is clearly showing results. 
The U.S. operations team executed this quarter to near perfection with improved productivity, service and cost management. With an increased volume, UPS direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours were all down. A job well done when you also consider the challenges presented by our U.S. restructuring.
We experienced substantial relocation and training expenses for the restructuring during the quarter. The impact was partially offset by reductions in payroll. As a result, the net effect overall was approximately $0.02.
Now for the International segment, where operating profit soared 78% to $521 million on a 23% jump in revenue. Volume increased 20%, with exports up 15% and non-U.S. domestic up 24%. We've seen international volume exceed 2 million pieces per day for three consecutive quarters, and for the first half of the year, UPS International profits were the best in our history.
During the quarter, UPS experienced strong export growth in all regions, with Asia up more than 40%. Both U.S. and Europe export volumes were up more than 10%. Operating margin climbed to 18.8%, an increase of 580 basis points. The improved margin was driven by higher yields and effective management of our network by the operations team. For example, during the quarter, our in-country cost per piece declined over 4%. 
Over the past few months, there have been questions about how currency fluctuations will impact UPS results. Due to our hedging positions, currency did not have a material impact during the quarter. This will likely change as the year progresses, and I will talk about that later.
Export yields are up 9% due to stable pricing, fuel surcharges and positive changes in product mix as customers traded up to higher service levels. For example, in our premium product, Worldwide Express, volume growth was more than 20%. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 24% driven by core countries in Europe and Canada. These results are also impacted by our August, 2009 acquisition in Turkey. Organic growth was equally impressive, up 13%. The value of the domestic and export portfolio continues to resonate with customers. 
Our results in Europe are impressive considering the disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud, and I want to recognize the great effort our team made during the quarter. Our customers told us that UPS saved the day by acting quickly to ensure dependable service. We leveraged our extensive pan-European ground network, and kept their goods moving. UPS technology enabled us to provide accurate and timely visibility throughout this challenging event. Financially, the impact of the volcano was not material. 
UPS recently announced significant upgrades to several of our international shipping systems. These enhancements improve ease-of-use, visibility and provide importers with greater control of their shipments. We will continue to introduce innovative products and solutions that help our customers compete in the global marketplace. 
Now for the Supply Chain and Trade segment. Revenue increased 21% on the strength of the Forwarding and Logistics business, with operating margins over 6%. Keep in mind that last year's operating margin benefited by about 100 basis points from the sale of the International MBE business. Forwarding experienced improved results this quarter, with strong tonnage growth led by high-tech. Industry capacity continues to be constrained putting some pressure on our margins. We remain focused on revenue management, and expect to see margin expansion as the year progresses.
As expected, UPS Freight has returned to profitability this quarter, a result of our targeted growth strategy. Freight revenue per hundredweight increased 9%. This will again be one of the industry's best results. Though we had modest declines in shipments and tonnage, weight per shipment improved. 
Our Logistics business unit continues to experience strong results from the healthcare and high-tech industries. Solutions created within this unit enable us to add value for our customers, benefiting through the alignment of multiple UPS capabilities. This is unmatched in the industry.
Once again, the unique UPS operating model produced significant cash. Year-to-date, we have generated more than $2.5 billion in free cash flow. In addition, we have invested $690 million in capital expenditures, paid dividends of $910 million, reflecting a 4.4% dividend increase, spent $425 million to repurchase approximately $7 million shares, and UPS ended the period with over $4 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
UPS' cash position remains strong. We will continue to follow our current stock repurchase strategy of offsetting the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation. We will consider changing this strategy once the S&P outlet for UPS is modified. I am confident of meeting their targets by the end of this year. 
This quarter, we did mark down certain auction-rate securities to their market value. The write-down was $21 million offset to our investment income.
Now for some comments on our outlook. Looking forward, even when we consider expectations for a slow economic recovery in the U.S. and the uncertain outlook in Europe, we are more confident than we were earlier in the year in UPS' ability to grow and generate substantial profits. This leads us to raise our full year 2010 guidance to an expected range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share. This represents a 45% to 50% increase over last year's results.
Looking at the segments. In the Domestic segment, volume should grow in line with GDP for the remainder of the year. The third quarter will show better results due to easier comps and the way the Fourth of July holiday fell last year. We expect to continue seeing significant year-over-year margin expansion. 
In our International segment, for the second half of the year, we do expect to see export growth rates moderate but still outpace the market. The rate of volume growth will somewhat depend on whether the Asia export market continues to grow at its current lofty pace. Also, year-over-year comps will become more challenging, particularly in the fourth quarter. We do expect a headwind from currency in the second half of the year of approximately $25 million per quarter. Based on these assumptions, we expect International profits for the remainder of the year to reflect typical seasonal trends with the third quarter lower than the fourth. 
The Supply Chain and Freight segments should produce full-year margins of approximately 6% on revenue growth in the low teens.
All in all, UPS had a tremendous quarter, led by significant margin expansion on strong revenue growth in our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. We are very encouraged by the accelerated growth we're seeing in revenue and profit across all business units. Our ability to generate cash, coupled with an outlook for moderate capital requirements, will ensure that UPS continues to generate significant shareowner value going forward. 
Thanks for your attention. And now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions."

So the net impact for Q2 was about a $0.02 headwind overall of cost. That will improve in the third quarter, where the amount of relos [relocations] begin to taper down. So it will be a very modest positive in the third quarter, and then in the fourth quarter, we’ll see more of the benefit. But we do continue to estimate about a $0.10 a share benefit from the Domestic restructuring. That will be manifest for 2011. Clearly, it's one of the things we have going into next year that will be a positive. So the overall restructuring was the net positive $0.02 a share, a little better than, frankly, we’d thought.

Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2009 form 10-K and 2010 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website, or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on the UPS Investor Relations website.
In our earnings announcement today, you'll notice that we recognized a gain of $109 million on the sale of real estate. This provided an after-tax benefit of $61 million, or $0.06 per share. Excluding this transaction, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.93. In their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS's third quarter 2010 results, excluding the impact of this gain. Additionally, all 2010 full-year references and comparisons to 2009 will refer to adjusted results. We believe this is the most accurate picture of the company's performance.
Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures and free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, are explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release. The schedules are also available on the UPS Investor Relations website in the financial section.

The results that UPS announced today are another step in getting back to peak earnings and historical margins. Considering the slow growth economic environment that exists, I find it extremely encouraging to see our three segments hitting on all cylinders. UPS has run the top of their game, generating significant operating profit improvement. This validates our comprehensive supply chain strategy. 
As for the economy, over the past few months, experts have reduced expectations for fourth quarter economic output. Including their outlook for U.S. GEP where modest growth is still expected. When it comes to inventory levels, there is a lot of debate. Some inventory building has occurred this year, but due to the low inventory-to-sales ratios and other indices, it appears there may still be room for additional restocking.
During the quarter, we announced a new global communications platform. Given the complexities of today's marketplace, we designed our advertising campaign to spotlight the power of Logistics. Our experience of worldwide capabilities make UPS uniquely qualified to provide solutions to our customers throughout their supply chain.
We don't just talk about global trade, we make it happen. UPS provides new tools to customers that help them expand their business like UPS Import Control, a solution that allows them to better manage inbound shipments. In addition, we continue to enhance our paperless invoice technology. UPS introduced this to the market more than two years ahead of the competition. This tool now provides expedited customs clearance in 92 countries, more than any competitor. Not only have we added tools to help businesses compete on a global basis, but we are growing our footprint so they can grow theirs. 
UPS continues to expand in important emerging markets, announcing a joint venture in Indonesia with J&E this quarter. And that's on the heels of the alliances announced earlier this year in Malaysia and Vietnam.
In the U.S., to help our customers better manage returns, we now offer a UPS Returns Flexible Access, a low-cost, high-quality service that provides unmatched alternatives to customers. As you can see, UPS is never standing still. In fact, just this month, we opened our first Olympic Logistics center in London. This gives UPS an excellent opportunity to showcase our capabilities to the world.
As the official Logistics provider for the 2012 Olympics, UPS will ensure the world's largest Logistics event goes off without a hitch. Now I would like to take a moment to talk about the UPS team.
During the quarter, we suffered the loss of two UPSers in a tragic plane crash. On behalf of the UPS employees around the world, I wish to extend our deepest sympathy to their families.
I also want to personally thank UPS employees for providing the best service in the industry, going the extra mile to ensure our customers continue to trust UPS with their business. No matter where I go, people comment on how they appreciate the professionalism of UPSers around the world and the quality of our service.
Many times, customers talk about our drivers as an extension of their company. Let me tell you, that makes me very proud of the great team we have here at UPS. Not only our UPSers committed to providing great service, they are also dedicated to their communities.
In July, the United Way recognized UPS and our employees as the first company ever with donations of more than $1 billion. This generosity of our active and retired employees is unmatched. Overall, another great quarter for UPS. We continue to achieve results that exceed expectations. Even though our operating margin is the best in the industry, we are not satisfied. I am confident in our ability to return them to pre-recession levels. We are on the right track. Now let me turn it over to Kurt."
238570,114463999,80802,"United Parcel Service, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","United Parcel Service, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and good morning.

Revenue continued to reflect strong growth, up 9% over last year, even with one less working day. These are impressive results, considering the slow pace of the economic recovery.
UPS's operating margin expanded 410 basis points to 12.4%, continuing our rebound towards historic levels. Keep in mind, current margins do reflect reinstated merit increases and growth in incentive compensation that's due to solid business performance.
For the quarter, total comp and benefits increased only 1% on volume growth to 3.3%. This clearly reflects the impact of greater volume, productivity improvements, network enhancements and the U.S. restructuring announced earlier this year. Now let's start our review of the segments, beginning with U.S. Domestic.
Total revenue increased 6.2% to $7.3 billion on average daily volume growth of 3.6%. Daily volume comparisons did benefit somewhat from the 4th of July operating schedule. Ground volume increased 3.9% per day, and UPS Next Day Air was up 3.2%. This is the third consecutive quarter of domestic volume growth, each quarter showing greater year-over-year improvement.
Total revenue per piece grew 4%, with UPS Next Day Air up 7% and Ground improving 3.2%. Yields benefited from our ability to retain a greater portion of the general rate increase and rising fuel surcharges.  Air products also benefited from a more favorable package- to-letter mix and weight per piece, which has continued to improve and is in the latter stages of recovery. 
Operating margin was 12.5%, an increase of 500 basis points due to volume growth, yield gains and significant productivity improvements across the UPS network. Expense was held in check due to effective management of direct labor hours, miles driven, block hours and non-op expense, all in all, a great job by our UPS team.
In July, UPS issued our most recent sustainability report and announced an ambitious new target for increasing the fuel efficiency of our U.S. automotive fleet by 20%. In September, we purchased an additional 130 hybrid electric vehicles to help us reach that goal. This brings UPS's fleet of alternative fuel vehicles to over 2,000, one of the largest private fleets.  And when it comes to our air fleet, it remains one of the most fuel-efficient in the industry, more than 10 years ahead of any U.S. competitor. 
Now for the International segment, where operating profit climbed 34% to $419 million on 11% growth in revenue.  This profit is within $9 million of our highest third quarter in UPS history in what is typically our most challenging quarter due to the European summer holidays. Total package volume per day improved over 13%, with exports up 12.5% and non-U.S. domestic up 14%. Domestic growth slowed from the previous quarter’s pace as a result of lapping last year's acquisition in Turkey. However, organic growth still remained robust at 11%.
Export volume growth remained strong in all regions, with Asia once again leading the way with 34% growth. In addition, European export daily volume continued to perform well, increasing 12.5% with balanced growth to all regions of the world.  Export yields improved about 1% as the positive impact of base rate increases and higher fuel surcharges were offset by currency. On a currency neutral basis, export rates improved over 3%.
In-country operations cost per piece declined 2.5% as a result of greater scale, improved productivity and density improvements. Overall, operating margin increased to 15.7%, up 280 basis points. Although the euro-to-dollar relationship was a slight drag.
During the quarter, in our growth through global trade seminars, UPS worked to help small- and medium-size enterprises grow their business and expand their footprint through exports. Now for the Supply Chain and Freight segment, where UPS had a great quarter, hitting a new high in both operating margin and operating profit for this developing segment of our business.
Revenue increased 19%, led by 23% growth in Forwarding and Logistics and continued growth in UPS Freight. Driven primarily by our Forwarding and Logistics businesses, operating profit jumped over 70% to $177 million, with margins reaching 8%, an increase of 250 basis points. The power of our broad portfolio was once again demonstrated in our forwarding unit. The revenue management initiatives and block space agreements we've put in place continue to provide benefits.  We experienced strong revenue growth as we help customers manage their supply chains, offering solutions that include both air freight and small package. 
Margins in the Logistics business approached double digits as a result of our global capabilities, technology and the strength of the UPS brand.  Logistics revenue benefited from high single-digit growth in healthcare and high-tech. 
UPS Freight continued to make progress, with more than 14% increase in revenue. Growth in revenue per hundredweight was again one of the highest in the industry.
During the quarter, we also saw improvements in gross weight hold, weight per shipment and shipments per day. In the ocean freight area of the Forwarding business, we introduced UPS Preferred Less Than Container Loads service. This service provides up to 20% improvement in Time-In-Transit for our customers. Early reaction from the marketplace has been positive.
You know a key strength of the UPS operating model is the ability to generate significant cash. For the first nine months of 2010, our free cash flow was $3.5 billion, this after UPS invested $1 billion in capital expenditures and made pension contributions of more than $1 billion. We also paid dividends of $1.36 billion, reflecting a 4.4% increase, and spent $589 million to repurchase 9.3 million shares.
As a testament to our strong financial performance, S&P recently reaffirmed our rating and revised their outlook for UPS to stable. This enables greater flexibility as we develop our capital allocation strategy. It goes without saying that our first priority is to invest in the business, followed by a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We will also consider accelerated contribution to UPS's pension plans. 
Regarding share repurchases, by the end of the third quarter, we had reached our original target of offsetting the dilution of stock-based compensation. We do intend to go beyond that target, and will continue to purchase stock in the fourth quarter.
For 2011, our plan is to ramp up share repurchases as we increase distributions to shareowners. We will provide more details on expectations for next year during our fourth quarter earnings call. While I'm on the topic of 2011, as a result of our continued momentum, yesterday we announced to our employees that next year, UPS will reinstate our 401(k) match. 
Next, I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter guidance. Expectations for economic output have declined from where they were three months ago, but modest growth is still expected. Looking towards peak season, customer sentiment is mixed but leaning towards cautious optimism.
For the U.S. Domestic segment, we expect the revenue year-over-year growth rate to be slightly better than what we saw in the third quarter. Year-over-year volume trends, however, will be muted by one more working day between Christmas and New Year’s compared to last year. As a result, we expect average daily volume growth in the fourth quarter of about 1.5% to 2%.
We anticipate that the fourth quarter operating margin will remain strong, at or above the third quarter. In the International segment, we expect volume growth rates to outpace the market, although they will moderate somewhat. 
Last year, if you recall, peak season capacity in the air freight market was extremely tight coming out of Asia, benefiting our International segment in both profit and volume growth.
Against these year-over-year comparisons, we expect high single-digit growth in top line revenue and an operating margin approaching 18%. We do expect a slight currency headwind.
In the Supply Chain and Freight segment, we anticipate the pace of revenue growth to slow due to comparisons to the strong air freight market conditions that existed last year. But margins will remain strong, approaching 7% for the quarter.
Based on our continued momentum, we have raised our full-year 2010 guidance, from the previous range of $3.35 to $3.45, up to a new range of $3.48 to $3.54 per share. This represents more than a 50% increase over last year's results. As you can see, UPS is on our way back to the high levels of profitability that we have demonstrated in the past.

But what we are seeing basically is the work we've done to create highly aligned capabilities across all modes and across activities is really paying dividends. Year-to-date, this is the most profitable period we've had for Supply Chain and Freight. Actually, it's also that case for International. We were helped certainly in the Forwarding arena with strong demand and also moderating rates. So we reverse some of the margin squeeze that we saw earlier in the year, so that was a great sign. We're also seeing good momentum in our ocean freight. We mentioned the launch of this less-than-container-load service and all of those pieces together really gave us some good capabilities. Logistics really is hitting its stride with us finding those unique services we can bring to high-tech and healthcare. And then UPS Freight had a good solid quarter. Clearly, it's not up to the margins we'd like, but it continues to generate strong revenue growth and great yields. So we're seeing improvement on all fronts."

The volume got a bit of a boost from the way the 4th of July fell last year was unfavorable. But in general, seeing solid growth back in the network, we have substantial operating leverage and on a unit basis, that definitely helps us lower the cost. We're also beginning to see the emerging benefits of the restructuring. If you recall in the second quarter, we had substantial added expenses for relocations and training, still a little bit of that going on in the third quarter but that's beginning to mitigate. And then, I guess, some of the network changes we've made, the maximization of volume flowing through Worldport, all of those things have begun to help. But the growth is certainly the big one.

Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2009 form 10-K and 2010 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website, or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on the UPS Investor Relations website.
In our earnings announcement today, you'll notice that we recognized a gain of $109 million on the sale of real estate. This provided an after-tax benefit of $61 million, or $0.06 per share. Excluding this transaction, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.93. In their remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS's third quarter 2010 results, excluding the impact of this gain. Additionally, all 2010 full-year references and comparisons to 2009 will refer to adjusted results. We believe this is the most accurate picture of the company's performance.

The results that UPS announced today are another step in getting back to peak earnings and historical margins. Considering the slow growth economic environment that exists, I find it extremely encouraging to see our three segments hitting on all cylinders. UPS has run the top of their game, generating significant operating profit improvement. This validates our comprehensive supply chain strategy. 
As for the economy, over the past few months, experts have reduced expectations for fourth quarter economic output. Including their outlook for U.S. GEP where modest growth is still expected. When it comes to inventory levels, there is a lot of debate. Some inventory building has occurred this year, but due to the low inventory-to-sales ratios and other indices, it appears there may still be room for additional restocking.
During the quarter, we announced a new global communications platform. Given the complexities of today's marketplace, we designed our advertising campaign to spotlight the power of Logistics. Our experience of worldwide capabilities make UPS uniquely qualified to provide solutions to our customers throughout their supply chain.
We don't just talk about global trade, we make it happen. UPS provides new tools to customers that help them expand their business like UPS Import Control, a solution that allows them to better manage inbound shipments. In addition, we continue to enhance our paperless invoice technology. UPS introduced this to the market more than two years ahead of the competition. This tool now provides expedited customs clearance in 92 countries, more than any competitor. Not only have we added tools to help businesses compete on a global basis, but we are growing our footprint so they can grow theirs. 
UPS continues to expand in important emerging markets, announcing a joint venture in Indonesia with J&E this quarter. And that's on the heels of the alliances announced earlier this year in Malaysia and Vietnam.
In the U.S., to help our customers better manage returns, we now offer a UPS Returns Flexible Access, a low-cost, high-quality service that provides unmatched alternatives to customers. As you can see, UPS is never standing still. In fact, just this month, we opened our first Olympic Logistics center in London. This gives UPS an excellent opportunity to showcase our capabilities to the world.
As the official Logistics provider for the 2012 Olympics, UPS will ensure the world's largest Logistics event goes off without a hitch. Now I would like to take a moment to talk about the UPS team.
During the quarter, we suffered the loss of two UPSers in a tragic plane crash. On behalf of the UPS employees around the world, I wish to extend our deepest sympathy to their families.
I also want to personally thank UPS employees for providing the best service in the industry, going the extra mile to ensure our customers continue to trust UPS with their business. No matter where I go, people comment on how they appreciate the professionalism of UPSers around the world and the quality of our service.
Many times, customers talk about our drivers as an extension of their company. Let me tell you, that makes me very proud of the great team we have here at UPS. Not only our UPSers committed to providing great service, they are also dedicated to their communities.
In July, the United Way recognized UPS and our employees as the first company ever with donations of more than $1 billion. This generosity of our active and retired employees is unmatched. Overall, another great quarter for UPS. We continue to achieve results that exceed expectations. Even though our operating margin is the best in the industry, we are not satisfied. I am confident in our ability to return them to pre-recession levels. We are on the right track. Now let me turn it over to Kurt."

For the quarter, total comp and benefits increased only 1% on volume growth to 3.3%. This clearly reflects the impact of greater volume, productivity improvements, network enhancements and the U.S. restructuring announced earlier this year. Now let's start our review of the segments, beginning with U.S. Domestic.
Total revenue increased 6.2% to $7.3 billion on average daily volume growth of 3.6%. Daily volume comparisons did benefit somewhat from the 4th of July operating schedule. Ground volume increased 3.9% per day, and UPS Next Day Air was up 3.2%. This is the third consecutive quarter of domestic volume growth, each quarter showing greater year-over-year improvement.
Total revenue per piece grew 4%, with UPS Next Day Air up 7% and Ground improving 3.2%. Yields benefited from our ability to retain a greater portion of the general rate increase and rising fuel surcharges.  Air products also benefited from a more favorable package- to-letter mix and weight per piece, which has continued to improve and is in the latter stages of recovery. 
Operating margin was 12.5%, an increase of 500 basis points due to volume growth, yield gains and significant productivity improvements across the UPS network. Expense was held in check due to effective management of direct labor hours, miles driven, block hours and non-op expense, all in all, a great job by our UPS team.
In July, UPS issued our most recent sustainability report and announced an ambitious new target for increasing the fuel efficiency of our U.S. automotive fleet by 20%. In September, we purchased an additional 130 hybrid electric vehicles to help us reach that goal. This brings UPS's fleet of alternative fuel vehicles to over 2,000, one of the largest private fleets.  And when it comes to our air fleet, it remains one of the most fuel-efficient in the industry, more than 10 years ahead of any U.S. competitor. 
Now for the International segment, where operating profit climbed 34% to $419 million on 11% growth in revenue.  This profit is within $9 million of our highest third quarter in UPS history in what is typically our most challenging quarter due to the European summer holidays. Total package volume per day improved over 13%, with exports up 12.5% and non-U.S. domestic up 14%. Domestic growth slowed from the previous quarter’s pace as a result of lapping last year's acquisition in Turkey. However, organic growth still remained robust at 11%.
Export volume growth remained strong in all regions, with Asia once again leading the way with 34% growth. In addition, European export daily volume continued to perform well, increasing 12.5% with balanced growth to all regions of the world.  Export yields improved about 1% as the positive impact of base rate increases and higher fuel surcharges were offset by currency. On a currency neutral basis, export rates improved over 3%.
In-country operations cost per piece declined 2.5% as a result of greater scale, improved productivity and density improvements. Overall, operating margin increased to 15.7%, up 280 basis points. Although the euro-to-dollar relationship was a slight drag.
During the quarter, in our growth through global trade seminars, UPS worked to help small- and medium-size enterprises grow their business and expand their footprint through exports. Now for the Supply Chain and Freight segment, where UPS had a great quarter, hitting a new high in both operating margin and operating profit for this developing segment of our business.
Revenue increased 19%, led by 23% growth in Forwarding and Logistics and continued growth in UPS Freight. Driven primarily by our Forwarding and Logistics businesses, operating profit jumped over 70% to $177 million, with margins reaching 8%, an increase of 250 basis points. The power of our broad portfolio was once again demonstrated in our forwarding unit. The revenue management initiatives and block space agreements we've put in place continue to provide benefits.  We experienced strong revenue growth as we help customers manage their supply chains, offering solutions that include both air freight and small package. 
Margins in the Logistics business approached double digits as a result of our global capabilities, technology and the strength of the UPS brand.  Logistics revenue benefited from high single-digit growth in healthcare and high-tech. 
UPS Freight continued to make progress, with more than 14% increase in revenue. Growth in revenue per hundredweight was again one of the highest in the industry.
During the quarter, we also saw improvements in gross weight hold, weight per shipment and shipments per day. In the ocean freight area of the Forwarding business, we introduced UPS Preferred Less Than Container Loads service. This service provides up to 20% improvement in Time-In-Transit for our customers. Early reaction from the marketplace has been positive.
You know a key strength of the UPS operating model is the ability to generate significant cash. For the first nine months of 2010, our free cash flow was $3.5 billion, this after UPS invested $1 billion in capital expenditures and made pension contributions of more than $1 billion. We also paid dividends of $1.36 billion, reflecting a 4.4% increase, and spent $589 million to repurchase 9.3 million shares.
As a testament to our strong financial performance, S&P recently reaffirmed our rating and revised their outlook for UPS to stable. This enables greater flexibility as we develop our capital allocation strategy. It goes without saying that our first priority is to invest in the business, followed by a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We will also consider accelerated contribution to UPS's pension plans. 
Regarding share repurchases, by the end of the third quarter, we had reached our original target of offsetting the dilution of stock-based compensation. We do intend to go beyond that target, and will continue to purchase stock in the fourth quarter.
For 2011, our plan is to ramp up share repurchases as we increase distributions to shareowners. We will provide more details on expectations for next year during our fourth quarter earnings call. While I'm on the topic of 2011, as a result of our continued momentum, yesterday we announced to our employees that next year, UPS will reinstate our 401(k) match. 
Next, I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter guidance. Expectations for economic output have declined from where they were three months ago, but modest growth is still expected. Looking towards peak season, customer sentiment is mixed but leaning towards cautious optimism.
For the U.S. Domestic segment, we expect the revenue year-over-year growth rate to be slightly better than what we saw in the third quarter. Year-over-year volume trends, however, will be muted by one more working day between Christmas and New Year’s compared to last year. As a result, we expect average daily volume growth in the fourth quarter of about 1.5% to 2%.
We anticipate that the fourth quarter operating margin will remain strong, at or above the third quarter. In the International segment, we expect volume growth rates to outpace the market, although they will moderate somewhat. 
Last year, if you recall, peak season capacity in the air freight market was extremely tight coming out of Asia, benefiting our International segment in both profit and volume growth.
Against these year-over-year comparisons, we expect high single-digit growth in top line revenue and an operating margin approaching 18%. We do expect a slight currency headwind.
In the Supply Chain and Freight segment, we anticipate the pace of revenue growth to slow due to comparisons to the strong air freight market conditions that existed last year. But margins will remain strong, approaching 7% for the quarter.
Based on our continued momentum, we have raised our full-year 2010 guidance, from the previous range of $3.35 to $3.45, up to a new range of $3.48 to $3.54 per share. This represents more than a 50% increase over last year's results. As you can see, UPS is on our way back to the high levels of profitability that we have demonstrated in the past. The goals and long-term strategies that we have put in place will further widen the gap between UPS and the rest of the competition.
Thanks for your attention, and now Scott and I will be happy to answer your questions."

But what we are seeing basically is the work we've done to create highly aligned capabilities across all modes and across activities is really paying dividends. Year-to-date, this is the most profitable period we've had for Supply Chain and Freight. Actually, it's also that case for International. We were helped certainly in the Forwarding arena with strong demand and also moderating rates. So we reverse some of the margin squeeze that we saw earlier in the year, so that was a great sign. We're also seeing good momentum in our ocean freight. We mentioned the launch of this less-than-container-load service and all of those pieces together really gave us some good capabilities. Logistics really is hitting its stride with us finding those unique services we can bring to high-tech and healthcare. And then UPS Freight had a good solid quarter. Clearly, it's not up to the margins we'd like, but it continues to generate strong revenue growth and great yields. So we're seeing improvement on all fronts."
