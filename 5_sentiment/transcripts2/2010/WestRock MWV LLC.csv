We set a course to manage through a challenging and uncertain economic period, and we executed on those plans. We improved earnings and increased shareholder value by focusing on sound strategies. Strategies that worked and will enhance our overall competitiveness. This work continue. We have made choices about marketplace participation that have both increased our earnings and positioned us for greater profitability going forward. We have made improvements to our business model with a badly-needed [ph] impact on bottom line results and importantly, that will provide us greater operating leverage as demand eventually improves. And we have preserved and strengthened our sound financial position, making us standout as a stable and reliable partner to our customers in an uncertain environment, while also giving us the flexibility to invest in future growth or/and with those customers.  Continued progress in unique areas in 2010 is a high priority.  In a few moments, Jim will talk about our strong operational performance during the fourth quarter and the dynamics we see in our markets. And then Mark will highlight some of the financial metrics and outline our financial priorities as we move into 2010.Before turning to them, I want to elaborate briefly on a few aspects of our fourth quarter performance that punctuate the progress we've made on our value creation strategies during the year. First, we continue to strengthen partnerships with customers and they capitalize on our strengths to win business with new customers. We're helping major beverage customers take advantage of a growing market, from multipack packaging in Asia, and we added new customers during the quarter from Shellpak, Natralock, MWare and other innovative offerings across our marketplace.Second, our aggressive cost and productivity initiatives have resulted in a more competitive business model. We extended margins in each of our businesses during the fourth quarter, capping off the year where MWV's overall operating profitability improved significantly. This has been a dedicated and determined effort across the company. We reached our immediate targets and have set our sights on additional improvements going forward.Finally, our financial strength continues to be a valuable asset for all of our businesses, and has allowed us to meet our commitments to both customers and shareholders through a very uncertain year. We added more cash to our balance sheet during the fourth quarter, and we're gratified that we've preserved and increased shareholder value during this tremendously difficult period. As we look forward, we're expecting a continuation of the same challenges we've been facing. An increasingly stable but still weak economy, as [indiscernible] consumers and cautious customers and public policies that may stifle rather than stimulate economic growth. Despite the still uncertain market outlook, we're confident, however, that we're focused on the right things. MWV's strategy for 2010 is built on the principles that grow of our positive results in 2009. We're already working hard on another series of deliberate actions that will further strengthen our business, including a priority emphasis on growth and development geographies, especially Brazil; organic growth on most attractive end markets, particularly healthcare packaging; and additional reductions in our cost structure and refinements to our overall market participation. With continued vigilance in these areas and many more, we'll build on our recent performance record and generate additional positive momentum in 2010. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard to talk about our business results in the fourth quarter before Mark discusses our financial metrics, and a more detailed outlook for the first quarter as well. Jim?"

I'm pleased to say that the tremendous work we put in on both our operational performance and commercial strategies this year delivered strong results. We've taken significant steps toward our goal of world-class cost and productivity per",1959,"Thank you, John. I'm pleased to say that the tremendous work we put in on both our operational performance and commercial strategies this year delivered strong results. We've taken significant steps toward our goal of world-class cost and productivity performance, and we're demonstrating the market knowledge and commercial excellence that will be required to turn the operating leverage we've created into dramatically-improved earning results as markets improve.Our progress this year has been apparent, even in this difficult economic environment. Sales were down about 9% across the company for the year and yet, we've increased earnings from our business segments by 24% compared to 2008. We're beginning to see some early positive signs from customers. No one expects a dramatic recovery in the near future. However, many of our markets have stabilized, and we're seeing some year-over-year improvement in order patterns. As we've noted throughout the year, our business in consumer staples such as food, beverage, healthcare and home and garden has held up as well as you might expect during this economic downturn. Whereas the luxury and consumer discretionary categories have seen more protracted declines, including personal care, fragrance and entertainment.The commercial organization we've built over the past year continues to provide improved visibility into these market dynamics. And our value-based assessment at each of our businesses has its focus on the right strategic opportunities in the most attractive end markets for our products and services. As these trends continue and our markets gain momentum, we are positioned to capitalize on our improved operating leverage. In anticipation of the severe economic challenges, we took steps to speed up and resize our strategic cost management program. We've exceeded our targets for overhead cost savings in 2009, adding together overhead cost savings, capacity actions and ongoing plant productivity initiatives, the total impact from our cost management program was more than $275 million this year. And in 2010, we expect to deliver an additional 3% to 4% of operating productivity improvement.Let me share some detail about the impact of our commercial strategies and operating productivity actions on each of our businesses and consumer packaging markets. As always, you'll find additional information in the slide presentation that accompanies this call.In the Packaging Resources business, segment profits were down only slightly during the fourth quarter despite volume decreases due to the economy, inventory control and our decision to exit certain low return business. Pricing was up year-over-year, and we experienced a modest cost deflation. However, this was offset by the impact of lost volumes. As a result, profits were down about 11% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Given the very difficult year in 2009, this was a great effort by our team. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, shipments of SBS were down 16%, but were essentially flat versus the third quarter. CNK volumes were down 9% compared to last year as several beverage customers delayed taking shipments in order to balance year-end inventories.We're gaining market share in key value-added paperboard markets, especially commercial print, tobacco in China and Japan and aseptic liquid packaging across Asia. We've also had good traction with the recent launch of our MWare line of food service products, and new business from our effort to work with brand owners to specify our products for their offerings in food markets. In addition, Rigesa continues to maintain its profitability with strong productivity gains. Our business in Brazil rebounded more quickly than elsewhere in the world. And we expect the recovery we've seen over the past several months to continue. These trends should be a tailwind for Rigesa in 2010.The Consumer Solutions segment had another strong quarter to finish a much-improved year. Profits doubled in this business during the fourth quarter, from $11 million in 2008 to $22 million in 2009, and profits for the year were up 70%. The team has done a good job reducing costs, illuminating unprofitable products and seeking out of opportunities to win with our customers in an environment that still saw a 10% overall decline in sales for the year. The rate of decline moderated in the fourth quarter, and even markets have stabilized and some of our customers are beginning to sound more optimistic about demand in 2010.Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business to give you a sense of the performance in the quarter. Our Global Beverage business, sales and earnings increased again during the fourth quarter, part thanks to new business in Asia, as well as outstanding productivity at our operating facilities. Our business in China was up 50% this year, and our customers are firmly focused on this region for their future growth. We are pursuing additional opportunities to grow with these customers by helping them win with our proprietary products and machinery, both in traditional multipack markets as well as new and adjacent categories. Meanwhile, trends in the beer and soft drink business in North America and Europe have remained relatively stable. We're still seeing resiliency for beer in North America. We've even had a small increase in volume for carbonated soft drinks, which has generally been declining for the past few quarters.In our healthcare business, sales and earnings were up for the year. The focus of this business continues to be on our Shellpak solution and other adherence packaging, as well as valuable pumps for pharmaceuticals requiring nasal or oral applications. We increased our Shellpak volumes from about 3 million units per month at the beginning of the year to more than 7 million units per month in the fourth quarter, by adding new drugs for Wal-Mart's generic prescription program and adding new branded and generic pharmaceutical customers. There's also been some moderate improvement in the market for our preservative-free pumps in Europe. As customers restock inventory and concern for the benefits of this innovative application. We've added a new customer for this solution as well during the quarter, including our first few customers in India. These innovative products, as well as the recently launched Med-Easy package that we've introduced in Europe and North America, will be the central focus of our growing healthcare business in 2010.We've begun to see a small amount of progress in the global markets for personal care. Sales were up during the fourth quarter compared to last year. And the bottom really fell out of the luxury products sector, and they are beginning to emerge from a very difficult year in this business with some positive momentum. We've heard from some fragrance customers who are beginning to restock inventories as well as considering new launches for their product pipelines. And we continue to benefit from an increased emphasis on healthy habits involving hand soaps and sanitizers. We remain excited about opportunities for our innovative airless pump dispensers, a solution that helps customers lower their costs and manage their supply chains by avoiding the need to add preservatives to their formula. As in our other businesses, we've taken aggressive action to reduce costs, resize our manufacturing footprint and increase productivity in the personal care business, which has helped improved margins and raised profits during the fourth quarter and the entire year.In home and garden, activity remains positive in advance of the all-important lawn and garden maintenance season in the United States. Sales and earnings were about even in the fourth quarter, and profitability was up significantly for the entire year. We benefited from an upward trend in home and hard surface cleaning solutions this year, and recently secured an extended contract for the pre-fresh[ph] trigger sprayer we provide for Procter & Gamble's popular, the Breeze product. As I've noted before, we are actively managing our media and entertainment business with maximum cash generation, and doing so very successfully. Sales continue to decline in this business, especially for printed media and specialty packaging, and we've taken actions to rationalize capacity and costs as a result. Sales are still relatively strong for plastic injection-molded products, including our popular EcoLite DVD and Blu-Ray cases, as we've emerged as one of the media's [ph] small handful of suppliers to the major distributors[ph]. We also continue to make inroads into consumer electronics and other markets with our Natralock security packaging. The team was recently at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas, and announced several new customers with this innovative packaging, including Kodak and Swiss Army. This business should continue to expand nicely in 2010.Turning to our non-packaging businesses, our positive earnings momentum has continued in both the Consumer & Office Products and Specialty Chemicals segments. Coming off with some historic lows last year, the Consumer & Office Products segment had another solid performance in the fourth quarter to finish a very good year. We continue to benefit from strong placement and sell-through of proprietary branded consumer and office products at leading North American retailers and distributors. Our alignment and collaboration with these winning retailers led to volume increases for the all-important back-to-school and year-end planning seasons in this business. Along with some significant productivity improvements, these volume gains contribute to a strong increase in profitability for the Consumer & Office Products segment during both the quarter and the year. While the Brazilian back-to-school season is just underway, we had good initial placement for Tilibra and Grafons, whose high-end stationery products we acquired to extend our reach in the attractive Brazilian market. The integration of Grafons is well underway and is expected to contribute to earnings in 2010.Sales increased slightly in the Specialty Chemicals segment, and the business posted another increase in earnings compared to weak fourth quarter in 2008. Despite the difficult economy, we recorded strong sales in several markets, including asphalt, printing ink, adhesives and a [indiscernible] technologies for water treatment, which set a record for sales in the year. Our Auto Carbon business was also stronger than expected as North American manufacturers increased production slightly and sales in Asia nearly reached an all-time high. We continue to see momentum for our asphalt paving products around the world, including commitments in China to use Evotherm for cold weather paving.Market conditions for the Community Development & Land Management segment continued as they have throughout 2009. The overall real estate market was soft but there were some momentum in our current area of emphasis, small real [ph] land tracts. We closed 11 of these smaller transactions during the quarter, with an average price per acre of more than $2,100. Similar to last quarter ,we also closed a larger forestland [ph] sale in South Carolina, more than 10,000 acres for a total of $18 million. In total, land sales during the quarter were more than $23 million, and was a primary contributor to segment earnings of $20 million. We continue to make progress in our development activities as well. We unveiled the master plan for our large East Edisto property which was met with a very positive reaction from the community in South Carolina. We're already working with local governments on long-term development agreements and infrastructure plans, and we expect that work to continue through 2010.We also signed the previously-announced lease agreement with the tenant for our industrial and distribution park joint venture with the Rockefeller Group serving the Port of Charleston. We're actively pursuing prospective tenants for a second site on this property, as well as other industrial and development projects. The long-term dynamics for these properties are very strong, especially with the recent announcement that Boeing will open a second assembly plant for their Dreamliner aircraft in the North Charleston area, and bring as many as 10 to 15 suppliers to the region along with them. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter. Mark?"
314312,83703244,47138,"MeadWestvaco Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2010",2010-01-27,"Earnings Calls","WestRock MWV, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jim. During the fourth quarter, we continue to execute the game plan we laid out at the beginning of 2009 to improve our business model and strengthen our financial position. We had a strong finish to what was a year of substantial progress. As a",909,"Thanks, Jim. During the fourth quarter, we continue to execute the game plan we laid out at the beginning of 2009 to improve our business model and strengthen our financial position. We had a strong finish to what was a year of substantial progress. As a result, we delivered increased earnings in cash flow in both the fourth quarter and full year. More importantly, the improvement that we've made to our cost structure and financial flexibility provide us with an excellent foundation on which to build in 2010. Consider these highlights from 2009. We expanded operating margins in each of our businesses, resulting in 170 basis point improvement in the company's operating margins year-over-year. We permanently eliminated more than $150 million of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs, and we continue to make our cost structure more competitive. And we generated over $870 million of operating cash flow and added about $300 million of cash to our balance sheet. We achieved this during one of the most difficult economic environments ever.  This is a record of accomplishment of which we are proud, but not satisfied. Our plans for 2010, build on this progress in momentum. Let's take a closer look at these areas of our performance. We expanded our gross margin in each of our businesses. On an adjusted basis, we saw a total gross margin improvement of 360 basis points and 240 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. This margin improvement reflects both the significant cost savings we generated from our overhead and manufacturing capacity actions, as well as the enhanced product mix we achieved for more focused market participation strategies that emphasize higher margin products.Much of our success during the year was driven by determined effort to implement our strategic cost management program. During the fourth quarter, we generated an additional $64 million of savings from the reduction of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs. For the year, total cost savings were $154 million, which we achieved by closing or restructuring 16 facilities and eliminating almost 3,000 positions, which is 13% of our global workforce. As a result of this progress and ongoing work to further reduce overhead costs, we continue to expect at least $250 million of run rate savings by the middle of this year.In the fourth quarter, our SG&A spend was reduced $35 million related to our overhead cost savings. This represents a 20% reduction compared to the previous year, and we will continue to benefit from these savings going forward. These reductions, however, were more than offset by higher performance-based compensation as a substantial portion of these full-year costs were accrued in the fourth quarter.Higher earnings and our ongoing working capital discipline contributed to an excellent year of cash flow generation. Excluding the impact from the alternative fuel credits and other special items, cash flow from operations was about $640 million. That's an improvement of almost 50% over 2008. Free cash flow, which is cash after CapEx and dividends, was $258 million, and we had $850 million of cash on hand at the end of 2009, also a substantial improvement.In record [ph], the strong cash performance with actions to further improve our liquidity, and financial flexibility. In 2009, we reduced outstanding debt by over $200 million, exiting the year with a total debt to capital ratio of 39%. We also took advantage of the improved credit markets to greatly increase our overall financial flexibility by optimizing our debt maturity schedule and renewing our $600 million credit facility. Our financial strength has been a clear advantage in a tough environment. We've continued to invest in innovation, we've won business with new customers looking for reliability and stability in their supply chains and of course, we were able to maintain our industry-leading dividend for our shareholders.As we look ahead to 2010, we expect another challenging year with an uneven global economic recovery. While we expect continued steady growth in Brazil, China and India, high unemployment, ongoing tight credit, a weak housing market and rising saving levels are likely to continue to depress U.S. economic growth this year. While demand has stabilized at current levels and in some markets is beginning to pick up from the lows we experienced in 2009, resiliency and trajectory of these trends through this year remains unclear. As such, we are continuing to focus on the key controllables in maintaining the priorities that drove our success in 2009, improving our business model, enhancing our financial strength and selectively investing capital to profitably grow our business.Turning to the first quarter outlook, we expect our businesses to experience typical seasonality. But we are seeing some favorable volume trends as we begin to compare to the severe declines we saw at this time last year. Backlogs at the mills are stronger and customer tone in other key packaging markets has become more positive. As a result, we expect volumes to improve modestly year-over-year. We also expect our results in the first quarter to benefit from the full run rate of the overhead and fixed manufacturing cost savings we achieved in 2009, as well as some moderation of input costs compared to last year's first quarter.Taking into account all of these factors, we expect higher year-over-year earnings in each of our business segments, with the exception of our Community Development and Land Management business which benefited last year from a single large land sale. With that, John, I'll turn it back to you."

Nothing definitive yet but they're beginning to see opportunities to grow their business. Other areas within personal care continue to be positive year-over-year. And then we're also seeing obviously the benefit, I think, of some our innovative packaging solutions. In the healthcare markets, we're seeing good opportunities there.

We set a course to manage through a challenging and uncertain economic period, and we executed on those plans. We improved earnings and increased shareholder value by focusing on sound strategies. Strategies that worked and will enhance our overall competitiveness. This work continue. We have made choices about marketplace participation that have both increased our earnings and positioned us for greater profitability going forward. We have made improvements to our business model with a badly-needed impact on bottom line results and importantly, that will provide us greater operating leverage as demand eventually improves. And we have preserved and strengthened our sound financial position, making us standout as a stable and reliable partner to our customers in an uncertain environment, while also giving us the flexibility to invest in future growth or/and with those customers.  Continued progress in unique areas in 2010 is a high priority.  In a few moments, Jim will talk about our strong operational performance during the fourth quarter and the dynamics we see in our markets. And then Mark will highlight some of the financial metrics and outline our financial priorities as we move into 2010.Before turning to them, I want to elaborate briefly on a few aspects of our fourth quarter performance that punctuate the progress we've made on our value creation strategies during the year. First, we continue to strengthen partnerships with customers and they capitalize on our strengths to win business with new customers. We're helping major beverage customers take advantage of a growing market, from multipack packaging in Asia, and we added new customers during the quarter from Shellpak, Natralock, MWare and other innovative offerings across our marketplace.Second, our aggressive cost and productivity initiatives have resulted in a more competitive business model. We extended margins in each of our businesses during the fourth quarter, capping off the year where MWV's overall operating profitability improved significantly. This has been a dedicated and determined effort across the company. We reached our immediate targets and have set our sights on additional improvements going forward.Finally, our financial strength continues to be a valuable asset for all of our businesses, and has allowed us to meet our commitments to both customers and shareholders through a very uncertain year. We added more cash to our balance sheet during the fourth quarter, and we're gratified that we've preserved and increased shareholder value during this tremendously difficult period. As we look forward, we're expecting a continuation of the same challenges we've been facing. An increasingly stable but still weak economy, as [indiscernible] consumers and cautious customers and public policies that may stifle rather than stimulate economic growth. Despite the still uncertain market outlook, we're confident, however, that we're focused on the right things. MWV's strategy for 2010 is built on the principles that grow of our positive results in 2009. We're already working hard on another series of deliberate actions that will further strengthen our business, including a priority emphasis on growth and development geographies, especially Brazil; organic growth on most attractive end markets, particularly healthcare packaging; and additional reductions in our cost structure and refinements to our overall market participation. With continued vigilance in these areas and many more, we'll build on our recent performance record and generate additional positive momentum in 2010. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard to talk about our business results in the fourth quarter before Mark discusses our financial metrics, and a more detailed outlook for the first quarter as well. Jim?"

I'm pleased to say that the tremendous work we put in on both our operational performance and commercial strategies this year delivered strong results. We've taken significant steps toward our goal of world-class cost and productivity per",1959,"Thank you, John. I'm pleased to say that the tremendous work we put in on both our operational performance and commercial strategies this year delivered strong results. We've taken significant steps toward our goal of world-class cost and productivity performance, and we're demonstrating the market knowledge and commercial excellence that will be required to turn the operating leverage we've created into dramatically-improved earning results as markets improve.Our progress this year has been apparent, even in this difficult economic environment. Sales were down about 9% across the company for the year and yet, we've increased earnings from our business segments by 24% compared to 2008. We're beginning to see some early positive signs from customers. No one expects a dramatic recovery in the near future. However, many of our markets have stabilized, and we're seeing some year-over-year improvement in order patterns. As we've noted throughout the year, our business in consumer staples such as food, beverage, healthcare and home and garden has held up as well as you might expect during this economic downturn. Whereas the luxury and consumer discretionary categories have seen more protracted declines, including personal care, fragrance and entertainment.The commercial organization we've built over the past year continues to provide improved visibility into these market dynamics. And our value-based assessment at each of our businesses has its focus on the right strategic opportunities in the most attractive end markets for our products and services. As these trends continue and our markets gain momentum, we are positioned to capitalize on our improved operating leverage. In anticipation of the severe economic challenges, we took steps to speed up and resize our strategic cost management program. We've exceeded our targets for overhead cost savings in 2009, adding together overhead cost savings, capacity actions and ongoing plant productivity initiatives, the total impact from our cost management program was more than $275 million this year. And in 2010, we expect to deliver an additional 3% to 4% of operating productivity improvement.Let me share some detail about the impact of our commercial strategies and operating productivity actions on each of our businesses and consumer packaging markets. As always, you'll find additional information in the slide presentation that accompanies this call.In the Packaging Resources business, segment profits were down only slightly during the fourth quarter despite volume decreases due to the economy, inventory control and our decision to exit certain low return business. Pricing was up year-over-year, and we experienced a modest cost deflation. However, this was offset by the impact of lost volumes. As a result, profits were down about 11% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Given the very difficult year in 2009, this was a great effort by our team. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, shipments of SBS were down 16%, but were essentially flat versus the third quarter. CNK volumes were down 9% compared to last year as several beverage customers delayed taking shipments in order to balance year-end inventories.We're gaining market share in key value-added paperboard markets, especially commercial print, tobacco in China and Japan and aseptic liquid packaging across Asia. We've also had good traction with the recent launch of our MWare line of food service products, and new business from our effort to work with brand owners to specify our products for their offerings in food markets. In addition, Rigesa continues to maintain its profitability with strong productivity gains. Our business in Brazil rebounded more quickly than elsewhere in the world. And we expect the recovery we've seen over the past several months to continue. These trends should be a tailwind for Rigesa in 2010.The Consumer Solutions segment had another strong quarter to finish a much-improved year. Profits doubled in this business during the fourth quarter, from $11 million in 2008 to $22 million in 2009, and profits for the year were up 70%. The team has done a good job reducing costs, illuminating unprofitable products and seeking out of opportunities to win with our customers in an environment that still saw a 10% overall decline in sales for the year. The rate of decline moderated in the fourth quarter, and even markets have stabilized and some of our customers are beginning to sound more optimistic about demand in 2010.Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business to give you a sense of the performance in the quarter. Our Global Beverage business, sales and earnings increased again during the fourth quarter, part thanks to new business in Asia, as well as outstanding productivity at our operating facilities. Our business in China was up 50% this year, and our customers are firmly focused on this region for their future growth. We are pursuing additional opportunities to grow with these customers by helping them win with our proprietary products and machinery, both in traditional multipack markets as well as new and adjacent categories. Meanwhile, trends in the beer and soft drink business in North America and Europe have remained relatively stable. We're still seeing resiliency for beer in North America. We've even had a small increase in volume for carbonated soft drinks, which has generally been declining for the past few quarters.In our healthcare business, sales and earnings were up for the year. The focus of this business continues to be on our Shellpak solution and other adherence packaging, as well as valuable pumps for pharmaceuticals requiring nasal or oral applications. We increased our Shellpak volumes from about 3 million units per month at the beginning of the year to more than 7 million units per month in the fourth quarter, by adding new drugs for Wal-Mart's generic prescription program and adding new branded and generic pharmaceutical customers. There's also been some moderate improvement in the market for our preservative-free pumps in Europe. As customers restock inventory and concern for the benefits of this innovative application. We've added a new customer for this solution as well during the quarter, including our first few customers in India. These innovative products, as well as the recently launched Med-Easy package that we've introduced in Europe and North America, will be the central focus of our growing healthcare business in 2010.We've begun to see a small amount of progress in the global markets for personal care. Sales were up during the fourth quarter compared to last year. And the bottom really fell out of the luxury products sector, and they are beginning to emerge from a very difficult year in this business with some positive momentum. We've heard from some fragrance customers who are beginning to restock inventories as well as considering new launches for their product pipelines. And we continue to benefit from an increased emphasis on healthy habits involving hand soaps and sanitizers. We remain excited about opportunities for our innovative airless pump dispensers, a solution that helps customers lower their costs and manage their supply chains by avoiding the need to add preservatives to their formula. As in our other businesses, we've taken aggressive action to reduce costs, resize our manufacturing footprint and increase productivity in the personal care business, which has helped improved margins and raised profits during the fourth quarter and the entire year.In home and garden, activity remains positive in advance of the all-important lawn and garden maintenance season in the United States. Sales and earnings were about even in the fourth quarter, and profitability was up significantly for the entire year. We benefited from an upward trend in home and hard surface cleaning solutions this year, and recently secured an extended contract for the pre-fresh[ph] trigger sprayer we provide for Procter & Gamble's popular, the Breeze product. As I've noted before, we are actively managing our media and entertainment business with maximum cash generation, and doing so very successfully. Sales continue to decline in this business, especially for printed media and specialty packaging, and we've taken actions to rationalize capacity and costs as a result. Sales are still relatively strong for plastic injection-molded products, including our popular EcoLite DVD and Blu-Ray cases, as we've emerged as one of the media's [ph] small handful of suppliers to the major distributors[ph]. We also continue to make inroads into consumer electronics and other markets with our Natralock security packaging. The team was recently at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas, and announced several new customers with this innovative packaging, including Kodak and Swiss Army. This business should continue to expand nicely in 2010.Turning to our non-packaging businesses, our positive earnings momentum has continued in both the Consumer & Office Products and Specialty Chemicals segments. Coming off with some historic lows last year, the Consumer & Office Products segment had another solid performance in the fourth quarter to finish a very good year. We continue to benefit from strong placement and sell-through of proprietary branded consumer and office products at leading North American retailers and distributors. Our alignment and collaboration with these winning retailers led to volume increases for the all-important back-to-school and year-end planning seasons in this business. Along with some significant productivity improvements, these volume gains contribute to a strong increase in profitability for the Consumer & Office Products segment during both the quarter and the year. While the Brazilian back-to-school season is just underway, we had good initial placement for Tilibra and Grafons, whose high-end stationery products we acquired to extend our reach in the attractive Brazilian market. The integration of Grafons is well underway and is expected to contribute to earnings in 2010.Sales increased slightly in the Specialty Chemicals segment, and the business posted another increase in earnings compared to weak fourth quarter in 2008. Despite the difficult economy, we recorded strong sales in several markets, including asphalt, printing ink, adhesives and a [indiscernible] technologies for water treatment, which set a record for sales in the year. Our Auto Carbon business was also stronger than expected as North American manufacturers increased production slightly and sales in Asia nearly reached an all-time high. We continue to see momentum for our asphalt paving products around the world, including commitments in China to use Evotherm for cold weather paving.Market conditions for the Community Development & Land Management segment continued as they have throughout 2009. The overall real estate market was soft but there were some momentum in our current area of emphasis, small real [ph] land tracts. We closed 11 of these smaller transactions during the quarter, with an average price per acre of more than $2,100. Similar to last quarter ,we also closed a larger forest land sale in South Carolina, more than 10,000 acres for a total of $18 million. In total, land sales during the quarter were more than $23 million, and was a primary contributor to segment earnings of $20 million. We continue to make progress in our development activities as well. We unveiled the master plan for our large East Edisto property which was met with a very positive reaction from the community in South Carolina. We're already working with local governments on long-term development agreements and infrastructure plans, and we expect that work to continue through 2010.We also signed the previously-announced lease agreement with the tenant for our industrial and distribution park joint venture with the Rockefeller Group serving the Port of Charleston. We're actively pursuing prospective tenants for a second site on this property, as well as other industrial and development projects. The long-term dynamics for these properties are very strong, especially with the recent announcement that Boeing will open a second assembly plant for their Dreamliner aircraft in the North Charleston area, and bring as many as 10 to 15 suppliers to the region along with them. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter. Mark?"

During the fourth quarter, we continue to execute the game plan we laid out at the beginning of 2009 to improve our business model and strengthen our financial position. We had a strong finish to what was a year of substantial progress. As a result, we delivered increased earnings in cash flow in both the fourth quarter and full year. More importantly, the improvement that we've made to our cost structure and financial flexibility provide us with an excellent foundation on which to build in 2010. Consider these highlights from 2009. We expanded operating margins in each of our businesses, resulting in 170 basis point improvement in the company's operating margins year-over-year. We permanently eliminated more than $150 million of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs, and we continue to make our cost structure more competitive. And we generated over $870 million of operating cash flow and added about $300 million of cash to our balance sheet. We achieved this during one of the most difficult economic environments ever.  This is a record of accomplishment of which we are proud, but not satisfied. Our plans for 2010, build on this progress in momentum. Let's take a closer look at these areas of our performance. We expanded our gross margin in each of our businesses. On an adjusted basis, we saw a total gross margin improvement of 360 basis points and 240 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. This margin improvement reflects both the significant cost savings we generated from our overhead and manufacturing capacity actions, as well as the enhanced product mix we achieved for more focused market participation strategies that emphasize higher margin products.Much of our success during the year was driven by determined effort to implement our strategic cost management program. During the fourth quarter, we generated an additional $64 million of savings from the reduction of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs. For the year, total cost savings were $154 million, which we achieved by closing or restructuring 16 facilities and eliminating almost 3,000 positions, which is 13% of our global workforce. As a result of this progress and ongoing work to further reduce overhead costs, we continue to expect at least $250 million of run rate savings by the middle of this year.In the fourth quarter, our SG&A spend was reduced $35 million related to our overhead cost savings. This represents a 20% reduction compared to the previous year, and we will continue to benefit from these savings going forward. These reductions, however, were more than offset by higher performance-based compensation as a substantial portion of these full-year costs were accrued in the fourth quarter.Higher earnings and our ongoing working capital discipline contributed to an excellent year of cash flow generation. Excluding the impact from the alternative fuel credits and other special items, cash flow from operations was about $640 million. That's an improvement of almost 50% over 2008. Free cash flow, which is cash after CapEx and dividends, was $258 million, and we had $850 million of cash on hand at the end of 2009, also a substantial improvement.In record [ph], the strong cash performance with actions to further improve our liquidity, and financial flexibility. In 2009, we reduced outstanding debt by over $200 million, exiting the year with a total debt to capital ratio of 39%. We also took advantage of the improved credit markets to greatly increase our overall financial flexibility by optimizing our debt maturity schedule and renewing our $600 million credit facility. Our financial strength has been a clear advantage in a tough environment. We've continued to invest in innovation, we've won business with new customers looking for reliability and stability in their supply chains and of course, we were able to maintain our industry-leading dividend for our shareholders.As we look ahead to 2010, we expect another challenging year with an uneven global economic recovery. While we expect continued steady growth in Brazil, China and India, high unemployment, ongoing tight credit, a weak housing market and rising saving levels are likely to continue to depress U.S. economic growth this year. While demand has stabilized at current levels and in some markets is beginning to pick up from the lows we experienced in 2009, resiliency and trajectory of these trends through this year remains unclear. As such, we are continuing to focus on the key controllables in maintaining the priorities that drove our success in 2009, improving our business model, enhancing our financial strength and selectively investing capital to profitably grow our business.Turning to the first quarter outlook, we expect our businesses to experience typical seasonality. But we are seeing some favorable volume trends as we begin to compare to the severe declines we saw at this time last year. Backlogs at the mills are stronger and customer tone in other key packaging markets has become more positive. As a result, we expect volumes to improve modestly year-over-year. We also expect our results in the first quarter to benefit from the full run rate of the overhead and fixed manufacturing cost savings we achieved in 2009, as well as some moderation of input costs compared to last year's first quarter.Taking into account all of these factors, we expect higher year-over-year earnings in each of our business segments, with the exception of our Community Development and Land Management business which benefited last year from a single large land sale. With that, John, I'll turn it back to you."

And then more broadly, we still have a series of initiatives underway, not limited to the East Edisto project, which is substantial in its own right to develop similar master plans around which we can build understandings through community engagement and support.

We set a course to manage through a challenging and uncertain economic period, and we executed on those plans. We improved earnings and increased shareholder value by focusing on sound strategies. Strategies that worked and will enhance our overall competitiveness. This work continue. We have made choices about marketplace participation that have both increased our earnings and positioned us for greater profitability going forward. We have made improvements to our business model with a badly-needed impact on bottom line results and importantly, that will provide us greater operating leverage as demand eventually improves. And we have preserved and strengthened our sound financial position, making us standout as a stable and reliable partner to our customers in an uncertain environment, while also giving us the flexibility to invest in future growth or/and with those customers.  Continued progress in unique areas in 2010 is a high priority.  In a few moments, Jim will talk about our strong operational performance during the fourth quarter and the dynamics we see in our markets. And then Mark will highlight some of the financial metrics and outline our financial priorities as we move into 2010.Before turning to them, I want to elaborate briefly on a few aspects of our fourth quarter performance that punctuate the progress we've made on our value creation strategies during the year. First, we continue to strengthen partnerships with customers and they capitalize on our strengths to win business with new customers. We're helping major beverage customers take advantage of a growing market, from multipack packaging in Asia, and we added new customers during the quarter from Shellpak, Natralock, MWare and other innovative offerings across our marketplace.Second, our aggressive cost and productivity initiatives have resulted in a more competitive business model. We extended margins in each of our businesses during the fourth quarter, capping off the year where MWV's overall operating profitability improved significantly. This has been a dedicated and determined effort across the company. We reached our immediate targets and have set our sights on additional improvements going forward.Finally, our financial strength continues to be a valuable asset for all of our businesses, and has allowed us to meet our commitments to both customers and shareholders through a very uncertain year. We added more cash to our balance sheet during the fourth quarter, and we're gratified that we've preserved and increased shareholder value during this tremendously difficult period. As we look forward, we're expecting a continuation of the same challenges we've been facing. An increasingly stable but still weak economy, as [indiscernible] consumers and cautious customers and public policies that may stifle rather than stimulate economic growth. Despite the still uncertain market outlook, we're confident, however, that we're focused on the right things. MWV's strategy for 2010 is built on the principles that grow of our positive results in 2009. We're already working hard on another series of deliberate actions that will further strengthen our business, including a priority emphasis on growth and development geographies, especially Brazil; organic growth on most attractive end markets, particularly healthcare packaging; and additional reductions in our cost structure and refinements to our overall market participation. With continued vigilance in these areas and many more, we'll build on our recent performance record and generate additional positive momentum in 2010. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard to talk about our business results in the fourth quarter before Mark discusses our financial metrics, and a more detailed outlook for the first quarter as well. Jim?"

I'm pleased to say that the tremendous work we put in on both our operational performance and commercial strategies this year delivered strong results. We've taken significant steps toward our goal of world-class cost and productivity per",1959,"Thank you, John. I'm pleased to say that the tremendous work we put in on both our operational performance and commercial strategies this year delivered strong results. We've taken significant steps toward our goal of world-class cost and productivity performance, and we're demonstrating the market knowledge and commercial excellence that will be required to turn the operating leverage we've created into dramatically-improved earning results as markets improve.Our progress this year has been apparent, even in this difficult economic environment. Sales were down about 9% across the company for the year and yet, we've increased earnings from our business segments by 24% compared to 2008. We're beginning to see some early positive signs from customers. No one expects a dramatic recovery in the near future. However, many of our markets have stabilized, and we're seeing some year-over-year improvement in order patterns. As we've noted throughout the year, our business in consumer staples such as food, beverage, healthcare and home and garden has held up as well as you might expect during this economic downturn. Whereas the luxury and consumer discretionary categories have seen more protracted declines, including personal care, fragrance and entertainment.The commercial organization we've built over the past year continues to provide improved visibility into these market dynamics. And our value-based assessment at each of our businesses has its focus on the right strategic opportunities in the most attractive end markets for our products and services. As these trends continue and our markets gain momentum, we are positioned to capitalize on our improved operating leverage. In anticipation of the severe economic challenges, we took steps to speed up and resize our strategic cost management program. We've exceeded our targets for overhead cost savings in 2009, adding together overhead cost savings, capacity actions and ongoing plant productivity initiatives, the total impact from our cost management program was more than $275 million this year. And in 2010, we expect to deliver an additional 3% to 4% of operating productivity improvement.Let me share some detail about the impact of our commercial strategies and operating productivity actions on each of our businesses and consumer packaging markets. As always, you'll find additional information in the slide presentation that accompanies this call.In the Packaging Resources business, segment profits were down only slightly during the fourth quarter despite volume decreases due to the economy, inventory control and our decision to exit certain low return business. Pricing was up year-over-year, and we experienced a modest cost deflation. However, this was offset by the impact of lost volumes. As a result, profits were down about 11% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Given the very difficult year in 2009, this was a great effort by our team. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, shipments of SBS were down 16%, but were essentially flat versus the third quarter. CNK volumes were down 9% compared to last year as several beverage customers delayed taking shipments in order to balance year-end inventories.We're gaining market share in key value-added paperboard markets, especially commercial print, tobacco in China and Japan and aseptic liquid packaging across Asia. We've also had good traction with the recent launch of our MWare line of food service products, and new business from our effort to work with brand owners to specify our products for their offerings in food markets. In addition, Rigesa continues to maintain its profitability with strong productivity gains. Our business in Brazil rebounded more quickly than elsewhere in the world. And we expect the recovery we've seen over the past several months to continue. These trends should be a tailwind for Rigesa in 2010.The Consumer Solutions segment had another strong quarter to finish a much-improved year. Profits doubled in this business during the fourth quarter, from $11 million in 2008 to $22 million in 2009, and profits for the year were up 70%. The team has done a good job reducing costs, illuminating unprofitable products and seeking out of opportunities to win with our customers in an environment that still saw a 10% overall decline in sales for the year. The rate of decline moderated in the fourth quarter, and even markets have stabilized and some of our customers are beginning to sound more optimistic about demand in 2010.Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business to give you a sense of the performance in the quarter. Our Global Beverage business, sales and earnings increased again during the fourth quarter, part thanks to new business in Asia, as well as outstanding productivity at our operating facilities. Our business in China was up 50% this year, and our customers are firmly focused on this region for their future growth. We are pursuing additional opportunities to grow with these customers by helping them win with our proprietary products and machinery, both in traditional multipack markets as well as new and adjacent categories. Meanwhile, trends in the beer and soft drink business in North America and Europe have remained relatively stable. We're still seeing resiliency for beer in North America. We've even had a small increase in volume for carbonated soft drinks, which has generally been declining for the past few quarters.In our healthcare business, sales and earnings were up for the year. The focus of this business continues to be on our Shellpak solution and other adherence packaging, as well as valuable pumps for pharmaceuticals requiring nasal or oral applications. We increased our Shellpak volumes from about 3 million units per month at the beginning of the year to more than 7 million units per month in the fourth quarter, by adding new drugs for Wal-Mart's generic prescription program and adding new branded and generic pharmaceutical customers. There's also been some moderate improvement in the market for our preservative-free pumps in Europe. As customers restock inventory and concern for the benefits of this innovative application. We've added a new customer for this solution as well during the quarter, including our first few customers in India. These innovative products, as well as the recently launched Med-Easy package that we've introduced in Europe and North America, will be the central focus of our growing healthcare business in 2010.We've begun to see a small amount of progress in the global markets for personal care. Sales were up during the fourth quarter compared to last year. And the bottom really fell out of the luxury products sector, and they are beginning to emerge from a very difficult year in this business with some positive momentum. We've heard from some fragrance customers who are beginning to restock inventories as well as considering new launches for their product pipelines. And we continue to benefit from an increased emphasis on healthy habits involving hand soaps and sanitizers. We remain excited about opportunities for our innovative airless pump dispensers, a solution that helps customers lower their costs and manage their supply chains by avoiding the need to add preservatives to their formula. As in our other businesses, we've taken aggressive action to reduce costs, resize our manufacturing footprint and increase productivity in the personal care business, which has helped improved margins and raised profits during the fourth quarter and the entire year.In home and garden, activity remains positive in advance of the all-important lawn and garden maintenance season in the United States. Sales and earnings were about even in the fourth quarter, and profitability was up significantly for the entire year. We benefited from an upward trend in home and hard surface cleaning solutions this year, and recently secured an extended contract for the pre-fresh[ph] trigger sprayer we provide for Procter & Gamble's popular, the Breeze product. As I've noted before, we are actively managing our media and entertainment business with maximum cash generation, and doing so very successfully. Sales continue to decline in this business, especially for printed media and specialty packaging, and we've taken actions to rationalize capacity and costs as a result. Sales are still relatively strong for plastic injection-molded products, including our popular EcoLite DVD and Blu-Ray cases, as we've emerged as one of the media's [ph] small handful of suppliers to the major distributors[ph]. We also continue to make inroads into consumer electronics and other markets with our Natralock security packaging. The team was recently at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas, and announced several new customers with this innovative packaging, including Kodak and Swiss Army. This business should continue to expand nicely in 2010.Turning to our non-packaging businesses, our positive earnings momentum has continued in both the Consumer & Office Products and Specialty Chemicals segments. Coming off with some historic lows last year, the Consumer & Office Products segment had another solid performance in the fourth quarter to finish a very good year. We continue to benefit from strong placement and sell-through of proprietary branded consumer and office products at leading North American retailers and distributors. Our alignment and collaboration with these winning retailers led to volume increases for the all-important back-to-school and year-end planning seasons in this business. Along with some significant productivity improvements, these volume gains contribute to a strong increase in profitability for the Consumer & Office Products segment during both the quarter and the year. While the Brazilian back-to-school season is just underway, we had good initial placement for Tilibra and Grafons, whose high-end stationery products we acquired to extend our reach in the attractive Brazilian market. The integration of Grafons is well underway and is expected to contribute to earnings in 2010.Sales increased slightly in the Specialty Chemicals segment, and the business posted another increase in earnings compared to weak fourth quarter in 2008. Despite the difficult economy, we recorded strong sales in several markets, including asphalt, printing ink, adhesives and a [indiscernible] technologies for water treatment, which set a record for sales in the year. Our Auto Carbon business was also stronger than expected as North American manufacturers increased production slightly and sales in Asia nearly reached an all-time high. We continue to see momentum for our asphalt paving products around the world, including commitments in China to use Evotherm for cold weather paving.Market conditions for the Community Development & Land Management segment continued as they have throughout 2009. The overall real estate market was soft but there were some momentum in our current area of emphasis, small real [ph] land tracts. We closed 11 of these smaller transactions during the quarter, with an average price per acre of more than $2,100. Similar to last quarter ,we also closed a larger forest land sale in South Carolina, more than 10,000 acres for a total of $18 million. In total, land sales during the quarter were more than $23 million, and was a primary contributor to segment earnings of $20 million. We continue to make progress in our development activities as well. We unveiled the master plan for our large East Edisto property which was met with a very positive reaction from the community in South Carolina. We're already working with local governments on long-term development agreements and infrastructure plans, and we expect that work to continue through 2010.We also signed the previously-announced lease agreement with the tenant for our industrial and distribution park joint venture with the Rockefeller Group serving the Port of Charleston. We're actively pursuing prospective tenants for a second site on this property, as well as other industrial and development projects. The long-term dynamics for these properties are very strong, especially with the recent announcement that Boeing will open a second assembly plant for their Dreamliner aircraft in the North Charleston area, and bring as many as 10 to 15 suppliers to the region along with them. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the fourth quarter. Mark?"
314312,83703244,47245,"MeadWestvaco Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2010",2010-01-27,"Earnings Calls","WestRock MWV, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jim. During the fourth quarter, we continue to execute the game plan we laid out at the beginning of 2009 to improve our business model and strengthen our financial position. We had a strong finish to what was a year of substantial progress. As a",909,"Thanks, Jim. During the fourth quarter, we continue to execute the game plan we laid out at the beginning of 2009 to improve our business model and strengthen our financial position. We had a strong finish to what was a year of substantial progress. As a result, we delivered increased earnings in cash flow in both the fourth quarter and full year. More importantly, the improvement that we've made to our cost structure and financial flexibility provide us with an excellent foundation on which to build in 2010. Consider these highlights from 2009. We expanded operating margins in each of our businesses, resulting in 170 basis point improvement in the company's operating margins year-over-year. We permanently eliminated more than $150 million of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs, and we continue to make our cost structure more competitive. And we generated over $870 million of operating cash flow and added about $300 million of cash to our balance sheet. We achieved this during one of the most difficult economic environments ever.  This is a record of accomplishment of which we are proud, but not satisfied. Our plans for 2010, build on this progress in momentum. Let's take a closer look at these areas of our performance. We expanded our gross margin in each of our businesses. On an adjusted basis, we saw a total gross margin improvement of 360 basis points and 240 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. This margin improvement reflects both the significant cost savings we generated from our overhead and manufacturing capacity actions, as well as the enhanced product mix we achieved for more focused market participation strategies that emphasize higher margin products.Much of our success during the year was driven by determined effort to implement our strategic cost management program. During the fourth quarter, we generated an additional $64 million of savings from the reduction of overhead and fixed manufacturing costs. For the year, total cost savings were $154 million, which we achieved by closing or restructuring 16 facilities and eliminating almost 3,000 positions, which is 13% of our global workforce. As a result of this progress and ongoing work to further reduce overhead costs, we continue to expect at least $250 million of run rate savings by the middle of this year.In the fourth quarter, our SG&A spend was reduced $35 million related to our overhead cost savings. This represents a 20% reduction compared to the previous year, and we will continue to benefit from these savings going forward. These reductions, however, were more than offset by higher performance-based compensation as a substantial portion of these full-year costs were accrued in the fourth quarter.Higher earnings and our ongoing working capital discipline contributed to an excellent year of cash flow generation. Excluding the impact from the alternative fuel credits and other special items, cash flow from operations was about $640 million. That's an improvement of almost 50% over 2008. Free cash flow, which is cash after CapEx and dividends, was $258 million, and we had $850 million of cash on hand at the end of 2009, also a substantial improvement.In record [ph], the strong cash performance with actions to further improve our liquidity, and financial flexibility. In 2009, we reduced outstanding debt by over $200 million, exiting the year with a total debt to capital ratio of 39%. We also took advantage of the improved credit markets to greatly increase our overall financial flexibility by optimizing our debt maturity schedule and renewing our $600 million credit facility. Our financial strength has been a clear advantage in a tough environment. We've continued to invest in innovation, we've won business with new customers looking for reliability and stability in their supply chains and of course, we were able to maintain our industry-leading dividend for our shareholders.As we look ahead to 2010, we expect another challenging year with an uneven global economic recovery. While we expect continued steady growth in Brazil, China and India, high unemployment, ongoing tight credit, a weak housing market and rising saving levels are likely to continue to depress U.S. economic growth this year. While demand has stabilized at current levels and in some markets is beginning to pick up from the lows we experienced in 2009, resiliency and trajectory of these trends through this year remains unclear. As such, we are continuing to focus on the key controllables in maintaining the priorities that drove our success in 2009, improving our business model, enhancing our financial strength and selectively investing capital to profitably grow our business.Turning to the first quarter outlook, we expect our businesses to experience typical seasonality. But we are seeing some favorable volume trends as we begin to compare to the severe declines we saw at this time last year. Backlogs at the mills are stronger and customer tone in other key packaging markets has become more positive. As a result, we expect volumes to improve modestly year-over-year. We also expect our results in the first quarter to benefit from the full run rate of the overhead and fixed manufacturing cost savings we achieved in 2009, as well as some moderation of input costs compared to last year's first quarter.Taking into account all of these factors, we expect higher year-over-year earnings in each of our business segments, with the exception of our Community Development and Land Management business which benefited last year from a single large land sale. With that, John, I'll turn it back to you."

Our positive earnings performance outpaced not only last year’s first quarter but also the same pre-recession period in 2008 and 2007. It represents a fourth consecutive quarter of earnings growth directly attributable to our market participation and business model improvement strategies demonstrating that we are on the right track and are continuing to create a fundamentally more profitable company capable of generating consistent higher returns for shareholders. 
It is these areas of strategic focus that will position us for greater profitability in the near term, well in advance of any full economics recoveries. With these strategies and some modest improvement and demand in the first quarter we increased volume compared to last year including both share gains and increased orders in many of our targeted markets. We increased sales for our higher value solutions for personal care, health care and home and garden packaging and we captured share gains with paper board in the food service tobacco and commercial print markets. We are also making significant gains in many of our specialty chemicals and consumer and office products markets. And Jim will provide more details in just a moment about these and other highlights across the company.
With the operating leverage we’ve created over the past year, having eliminated more than $185 million of structural cost, this improvement in volume had a beneficial impact on earnings performance during the quarter. The progress we have driven is gratifying and the underlying signs of market improvement compared to a year ago are welcome. That said, general market demand still remains well below peak 2007 levels and it remains uncertain whether the present improvement trend is durable or just temporary. While we hope that the current trajectory continues, we are continuing to plan for sustained softness. In either of that, we will continue to execute the strategy that has helped us deliver successful results throughout this challenging economic environment. 
Specifically, we will continue to shape and execute our market participation strategies to ensure that we are driving our own destiny, creating opportunities for profitable growth with innovative products like MWare, Promina and Shell pack with investment in enhanced strategies in emerging markets like Brazil and China and with continued emphasis on overhead cost reductions and manufacturing productivity.
With still limited visibility into what economic and market conditions maybe in the second half of this year, these areas of emphasis will continue to be the biggest contributors to our success. Across MWV today, we have significant positive momentum and are moving forward with pace and purpose. We’re more profitable due to our discipline strategies to improve our revenue mix, exit low return business and close on profitable facilities. We are more competitive in targeted markets having launched innovative new products and expanded in the right geographies. We are more efficient and effective having reduced cost, significantly improve manufacturing productivity and augmented our organization with new talent and capabilities. 
And our financial strength is both sound and continues to build. We remain on the right path to make MWV a fundamentally more profitable company and a more valuable investment, both in today’s still soft and uncertain economy and in more prosperous times ahead.
I’d now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard to talk about our business results in the first quarter before Mark discusses our financial metrics and provides more detailed outlook for the second quarter. Jim?

This was one of our strongest quarters to start the year in recent memory as we often report a small loss in the seasonally slow period.

This was one of our strongest quarters to start the year in recent memory as we often report a small loss in the seasonally slow period. Compared to the first quarter last year, we’ve extended our positive earnings momentum with a significantly improved cost structure from ongoing actions, increased operating productivity to their facilities, share gains with targeted products and some increase in demand in key markets. These are things we’ve been focused on each of businesses for more than a year and the impact continues to show in our overall results. During the quarter, we generated important commercial momentum for our participations strategies, gaining shares with targeted products and growing our positions in emerging markets. And for the first time since economic crisis began, demand trends turned upward in certain of our markets. I'll highlight some of the specific trends in each of our businesses in just a moment. 
But overall, the result was a 5% increase in volume across the company. Along with the impact of our ongoing cost reduction and productivity actions, this top line growth helped derive adjusted EBIT up 97% for the first quarter. We edit more than $30 million of additional cost savings during the first quarter to the $154 million we completed to the end of 2009. With this leverage and a sequential growth trends we experienced in the first quarter, we believe our earning progress can continue in the second quarter and the positive impact should be even greater as demand grows. 
Let me share some detail about the commercial trends and operating highlights in each of our businesses and consumer packaging markets. As always, you’ll find additional information in the slide presentation that accompanies this call. In the packaging resources business, segment profitable is higher than last year as volume recovered and pricing gains and productivity actions at our mills drove an increase in earnings. 
This came during the difficult quarter for our operations due to adverse weather conditions, unseasonably cold and wet weather reduced fiber availability across the industry which resulted in significantly higher input costs and lost productivity. Despite these challenges which head about a $25 million negative impact in our results, the segment earned $30 million during the quarter. This was almost 60% higher than last year and nearly as much as the first quarter of 2008.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, shipments of SBS were up 3%. We outperformed the broader market in key segments including commercial prints, tobacco and food service grades. Our Mware line of paper board for recyclable and compostable food service applications such as cups and plates has been particularly strong. CNK’s volumes were up 5% compared to last year as demand began to recover for both beverage and food packaging around the world and as we continue to make gains with recently added food customers.
Volumes are also up in Brazil as the economy there has shown a solid recovery. As a result, Rigesa generated a strong profit growth with higher sales and improved productivity. Overall paperboard demands and packaging resources remain strong as we began the second quarter with backlogs currently between five and six weeks. The consumer solution segment had another strong quarter, its fifth straight period of year-over-year earnings growth.
Profits rose to $21 million during the quarter, more than a 50% increase compared to last year due to productivity improvements, a stronger mix of high return products and gains in targeted packaging markets. The actions we took to eliminate some low return business from our portfolio brought overall sales down slightly compared to last year.
Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business to give you a sense of the performance in the quarter. In our global beverage business, sales and earnings were modestly lower with an unfavorable impact related to further realignments of our manufacturing footprint in Western Europe and North America. As these initiatives come to a close, we expect to see added productivity benefits as we move through 2010. Lower beverage volumes in the first quarter were primarily due to unseasonably cool weather in North America in January and February. We partially offset this impact with double digit growth in the Asia Pacific region led by our major customers by increased volumes in Australia and New Zealand. More recent sales to Rigesa improved notably. 
Seasonally stronger volumes are running above a year ago levels at major beer and carbonated soft drink customers in the United States and Europe, part of what we are seeing is pipeline billing from very low year ago levels. We are also seeing more regular and larger orders suggesting some demand stabilization for the near term. We also continue to see good volume trajectory in Asia with major customers and will begin the benefit from new winds with yoghurt customers in China. This is an area we’ve recently targeted for portfolio growth and are expecting increasing contributions to our business as we move through the year. In our health care business, earnings increased during the first quarter primarily because of the choices we’ve made to emphasize Shell pack and other herein solutions and from strong productivity improvement. 
In the first quarter last year, we produced about 13 million units for Wal-Mart’s prescription drug program. This year that number is up to almost 25 million. They are currently 12 drugs being sold in shell pack at Wal-Mart’s pharmacy counters and we expect that to grow this year as well. Sales are also steady for our oral and nasal pumps in the health care market with growth in the over the counter market as well as our for our specialty preservative free pumps that address a specific regulatory need in Europe.
The personal care markets continue to improve and as a result, our business increase sales and earnings substantially configure particularly week first quarter last year when our customers aggressively de-stocked inventory. Our customers are now sounding more confident and that has translated into stronger orders for higher value fragrance dispensers, skincare airless products and luxury secondary packaging in Europe. We are gaining share in each of these categories by adding new customers as well as by adding to our business with existing customers line P&G, Unilever, L’Oreal and J&J. With these improving demand trends we expect to continue our positive trajectory through the current quarter as this market rebound from historic lows last year.
Volumes are good for our targeted products in the home and garden market primarily in United States especially the more profitable custom applicators for a long and garden maintenance and trigger sprayers for surface cleansers. The important spring garden season is off to a strong start with retailers reporting increased traffic and good sell through to the higher promotional activity by the branded industry leaders. And we are seeing solid growth for our next generation aerosol trigger with a new and existing customers.
Overall, sales and earnings were down slightly despite this market progress in home and garden. As we get eliminated some of our offerings to focus on profitable products and were impacted by higher resin costs that we expect to recoup through contractual pass through over the next quarter or two.
In the media business, sales earnings were lower than last year, we are managing to generate as much cash we possibly can from this business and doing so successfully by continue to drive productivity improvements and aggressively targeting categories and customers that are still profitable.
Turning to our non packaging businesses, our positive earnings momentum continued in the first quarter for both consumer office products and specialty chemicals segments. The consumer office product segments had one of its best first quarter performances, earning $6 million in a quarter that traditionally loses money as we build through the North American back to school season later in the year. Sales of time management and other consumer products were hired to a retail and commercial partners and good so through for school supplies in Brazil where led the stronger replenishment order linked to in the first quarter. Sales in the quarter were up 7% and it could benefits from last year’s acquisition of Grapohs. 
Productivity across all this segments business especially in the United States coupled with a stronger volumes led the solid year-over-over earnings improvement. Sales increased significantly in a specialty chemical segment compared to a very weak quarter last year. And the business posted strong earnings of $25 million for the first quarter. This segment saw volumes recover strongly across key product lines in both pine chemicals and activated carbon.
We had strong performances in adhesives and oil field services continue to grow the asphalt additives business especially in China and Brazil. And so our rebound and carbon volume due to an increase in auto production in North America. These volumes increase help to improve asset utilization rates and along with that, overall segment earnings. The  community development and land management segment earned $23 million in the first quarter including $17 million from 21 real estate transactions that closed during the first three months of the year. And with volume and pricing entire for pulp wood and saw timber, during the quarter, our four tree operations earned an additional $6 million. 
While conditions in the real estate sector are still very difficult, we had some positive trends for both our rural land tracks and industrial and development sites. We completed a number of rural land transactions in the Charleston and South Carolina area and this mix of properties contributed to a higher per acre value during the quarter of about $4300.
In addition, to an uptake in the number of sales during the quarter, the volume and quality of enquiries for these rural tracks was higher on a retail land website. And having recently unveiled the master plan for East Edisto, we are in negotiation with two potentials tenants for the commerce park that is part of the first phase of development.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the first quarter.

In t",1345,"Thank Jim. The momentum on our market participation in business model strategies that john and Jim are helping us a fundamentally more profitable company that we believe can continue to generate sustainable performance improvement over the long term. In the first quarter, our progress was clearly reflected in many of our financial metrics including the following highlights.
Overall sales grew 4% with volume increases driven by our new products, share gains in targeted markets and continued strong growth in emerging markets. Our operating profit essentially doubled due to the combination of our improved cost structure and successful growth strategies. And we have a strong balance sheet with the total debt to capital ratio below 40% and substantial cash reserves that enable us to continue to profitably grow our business and provide strong returns to our shareholders.
Let me provide a bit more detail on each of these measures of our progress during the first quarter. On the top-line, our over sales growth was 4%. Excluding the large land sale last year and product line exits related to our market participation strategies, comparable first quarter sales increased to approximately 10% consisting of about 5% of volume improvement and 5% of FX benefits and other items. Our overall volume benefited modestly from the demand improvement we experienced in the quarter well more than half the increase came from the success we are seeing with our growth strategies. 
New products in the quarter accounted for over 16% of total first quarter revenue including a strong rebound in demand for recently launched fragrance and airless dispensing products as well as continued strength in our shell pack product for prescription drugs. We also saw share gains in higher value paper board grades like commercial print and in our specialty chemicals markets. In the 22% sales increase from emerging markets we saw in the quarter was driven by recovering volumes in Brazil and continued strong growth for beverage packaging and asphalt additives in China. 
Increased sales in the continued benefit of our productivity and overhead cost actions resulted in year-over-year improvement of 250 basis points in our operating profit. First quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes almost doubled versus last year to $73 million. Our strong performance is being driven by the ongoing execution of strategies to fundamentally improve the company’s underlying profitability. Importantly we expect to further leverage our improved cost base and expand margins as we continue to profitability grow our business. 
Taking a closer look at the key performance drivers, both adjusted gross margin and SG&A saw continued solid year-over-year improvement.
First quarter adjusted gross margin improved by almost 100 basis points versus the first quarter of 2009 to 17.5%. This includes absorbing approximately 190 basis points of negative weather related impacts at the mills during the quarter. Adjusted SG&A decreased 9% on an absolute basis versus the prior year and was 12.5% of sales, an improvement of a 170 basis points versus the year ago quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet, our financial position and flexibility remain excellent. At the end of the quarter, total cash was $731 million. Our net debt to capital ratio was 30% and our pension plan was more than 140% funded. Cash flow used by operations was approximately $8 million in the quarter. Significant cash earnings in a 2.5 day improvement in our cash-to-cash cycle were more than offset by incentive compensation payments.
As we move through the year, we expect cash flow from operations to significantly improve. And for the full year, we expect to achieve another year of positive free cash flow which we define as cash flow from operations after CapEx and dividends. With respect to deploying our cash recourses, we will continue to remain our balanced approach. Over the past three years, we’ve generated about $3 billion of discretionary cash flow from operation and assets sales. Over this period, we have reinvested about a third of this cash back into the business. We’ve returned about a third to shareholders through a strong dividend and periodic share re-purchases and we have used the third to repay debt and build up our cash resources during the economic crisis. 
These priorities remain the same as we move forward. Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We saw improving demand trends during the first quarter and given current order rates and back logs, we expect these trends to continue through the second quarter. Beyond that however, there is less certainty as order pattern into the second half of the year will depend on retail, sell through levels which are subject to risks related to continued high levels of unemployment and shifts in consumer confidents. That said, we are continuing to position all businesses to capture growth and bring more of it to the bottom line. 
Our commercial strategies are working, we have good confidence in our more competitive business model and we are continuing to selectively re-invest in profitable growth opportunities across our businesses. We will however be watching commodity inflation which we expect will pick up through the year and could accelerate if demand trends mover higher than the current trajectory. But we will off course continue to seek pricing to offset these impacts. With that as context, I'll now provide some segment specific comments for the second quarter, starting with package and resources. We’re expecting segment profit to be solidly above last year. 
  
Backlogs at the mills are currently running well above year ago levels and the combination of better demand with an improved product mix and higher productivity levels are the main drivers of our positive outlook. In addition, we expect continued profit growth at Rigesa. Rising input cost will partially offset these positive factors in the near term including lingering fiber inflation trends from the weather related issues in the first quarter as well as inflation for some commodity chemicals in outbound freight.
We are however continuing to implement pricing actions to offset the negative impacts from cost inflation. In the consumer solutions group, segment profit is expected to be solidly above year-ago levels. Improved results will be driven by continue demand recovery through the current quarter for targeted products across our personal care, homing garden and health care packaging businesses as well as seasonal strength in beverage which we started to see in March. We also expect to see higher pricing to recapture resin inflation as well as continued productivity gains.
Turning to the consumer and office product segment, we are expecting another solid overall back to school season. We are however expecting profit to be modestly lower than last years very strong second quarter performance while the business will continue to benefit from strong productivity gains and cost reductions as is the case with this business, the timing of selling and the ultimate sell through to the consumer of the segment’s back-to-school products can significantly impact the level of revenues and profits during the quarter.
In specialty chemicals, we expect another strong quarter with significant year-over-year improvement. Benefits from continued demand recovery across pine chemical can activate carbon markets and higher productivity levels are expected to drive substantially improved earnings. However, inflation in certain raw material and freight costs will partially offset these positive factors in the near term. Finally in the community development and land management segment, the timing of land sales which is the key near term driver of results remains difficult to forecast. However, we do expect modestly improved segment profit versus the year ago quarter.
The level of improvement will continue to depend on the amount, timing and mix of the land we sell in the quarter. In summary, during the second quarter, we expect to extend our record solid year-over-year earnings growth and margin improvement. While demand trends are improving its important to keep in mind that in most cases, our volumes are still well off peak 2007 levels. The improvements were driving are largely the result of continued execution of our strategies to improve our business model. With that, I will turn it back over to John.

At the present time as we announced among other things, we are evaluating the potential to add capacity to our mill in Tres Barras that would all be designed to have more adequately and efficiently utilize infrastructure that we largely have in place and in the process, reintegrate our corrugated business which is growing nicely in the local market. The market strength there over the past few years has been particularly good and with the strength that Brazil almost uniquely has in the world today, we are seeing good growth particularly for the profitable differentiated products that we produce now and projected over time. 
So we are looking hard at what the future opportunities for us in Brazil can and should be both strategically and opportunistically but at the core of that right now is the evaluation of the capacity addition at the Tres Barras mill. We are in the early stages of that while the work is very, very good. We are on schedule to hopefully meet the target that we have broadly set for completing this analysis at the end of this calendar year.

Our positive earnings performance outpaced not only last year's first quarter but also the same pre-recession periods in 2008 and 2007. It represents a fourth consecutive quarter of earnings growth directly attributable to our market participation and business model improvement strategies, demonstrating that we are on the right track and are continuing to create a fundamentally more profitable company, capable of generating consistent higher returns for shareholders.
It is these areas of strategic focus that will position us for greater profitability in the near term, well in advance of any full economic recovery. With these strategies and some modest improvement in demand in the first quarter, we increased volume compared to last year, including both share gains and increased orders in many of our targeted markets. We increased sales for our higher value solutions for Personal Care, Healthcare and Home and Garden Packaging, and we captured share gains with paperboard and the food service, tobacco and commercial print markets. 
We are also making significant gains in many of our Specialty Chemicals and Consumer & Office Products markets, and Jim will provide more detail in just a moment about these and other highlights across the company.
With the operating leverage we've created over the past year, having eliminated more than $185 million of structural costs, this improvement in volume had a beneficial impact on our earnings performance during the quarter. The progress we have driven is gratifying, and the underlying signs of market improvement compared to a year ago are welcome. That said, general market demand still remains well below peak 2007 levels, and it remains uncertain whether the present improvement trend is durable or just temporary. 
While we hope that the current trajectory continues, we are continuing to plan for sustained softness. In either of that, we will continue to execute the strategy that has helped us deliver successful results throughout this challenging economic environment. Specifically, we will continue to shape and execute our market participation strategies to ensure that we are driving our own destiny, creating opportunities for profitable growth with innovative products like MWare, Promina and Shellpak, with investments and enhanced strategies in emerging markets like Brazil and China, and with continued emphasis on overhead cost reductions and manufacturing productivity.
With still limited visibility into what economic and market conditions may be in the second half of this year, these areas of emphasis will continue to be the biggest contributors to our success. Across MWV today, we have significant positive momentum and are moving forward with pace and purpose. We're more profitable due to our disciplined strategist to improve our revenue mix, exit low-return business and close unprofitable facilities. 
We're more competitive in targeted markets, having launched innovative new products and expanded in the right geographies. We're more efficient and effective, having reduced costs, significantly improved manufacturing productivity and augmented our organization with new talent and capabilities, and our financial strength is both sound and continues to build. We remain on the right path to make MW be a fundamentally more profitable company and a more valuable investment, both in today's still soft and uncertain economy and in more prosperous times ahead.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard, to talk about our business results in the first quarter, before Mark discusses our financial metrics and provides a more detailed outlook for the second quarter. Jim?"

This was one of our strongest quarters to start the year in recent memory, as we often report a small loss in the seasonally slow period.
Compared to the first quarter last year, we've extended our positive earnings momentum with a significantly improved cost structure from ongoing actions, increased operating productivity in our facilities, share gains with targeted products and some increase in demand in key markets. These are the things we've been focused on in each of our businesses for more than a year, and the impact continues to show in our overall results.
During the quarter, we generated important commercial momentum from our participation strategies, gaining share with targeted products and growing our positions in emerging markets. And for the first time since economic crisis began, demand trends turn upward in certain of our markets. I'll highlight some of the specific trends in each of our businesses in just a moment. But overall, the result was a 5% increase in volume across the company.
Along with the impact of our ongoing cost reduction and productivity actions, this top line growth helped drive adjusted EBIT, up 97% for the first quarter. We added more than $30 million of additional cost savings during the first quarter, to the $154 million we completed to the end of 2009. With this leverage and a sequential growth trends we experienced through the first quarter, we believe our earnings progress can continue in the second quarter and the positive impact should be even greater as demand grows.
Let me share some detail about the commercial trends and operating highlights in each of our businesses in consumer packaging markets. As always, you'll find additional information in the slide presentation that accompanies this call.
In the Packaging Resources business, segment profit was higher than last year, as volumes recovered and pricing gains and productivity actions at our mills drove an increase in earnings. This came during a difficult quarter for our operations due to adverse weather conditions. Unseasonably cold and wet weather reduced fiber availability across the industry, which resulted in significantly higher input costs and lost productivity. Despite these challenges, which had about a $25 million negative impact in our results, the segment earned $30 million during the quarter. This was almost 60% higher than last year and nearly as much as the first quarter of 2008.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, shipments of SBS were up to 3%. We outperformed the broader market in key segments including commercial prints, tobacco, and food service grades. Our MWare line of paperboard for recyclable and compostable food-service applications, such as cups and plates, has been particularly strong. CNK volumes were up 5% compared to last year, as demand began to recover for both beverage and food packaging around the world, and as we continued to make gains with recently added food customers.
Volume was also up in Brazil, as the economy there has shown a solid recovery. As a result, we're Rigesa generated a strong profit growth with higher sales and improved productivity. Overall, paperboard demand in Packaging Resources remain strong as we began the second quarter, with backlogs currently between five and six weeks.
The Consumer Solutions segment had another strong quarter, its fifth straight period of year-over-year earnings growth. Profits rose to $21 million during the quarter, more than a 50% increase compared to last year due to productivity improvements, a stronger mix of high-return products and gains in targeted packaging markets. The actions we took to eliminate some low-return business from our portfolio brought overall sales down slightly compared to last year.
Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business to give you a sense of the performance in the quarter. In Our Global Beverage business, sales and earnings were modestly lower, with an unfavorable impact related to further realignment of our manufacturing footprint in Western Europe and North America. As these initiatives come to a close, we expect to see added productivity benefits as we move through 2010.
Lower beverage volumes in the first quarter were primarily due to unseasonably cool weather in North America in January and February. We've partially offset this impact with double-digit growth in the Asia-Pacific region, led by our major beer customers, and by increased volumes in Australia and New Zealand.
More recent sales trends have improved notably. Seasonally stronger volumes are running above year-ago levels at major beer and carbonated soft drink customers in the United States and Europe. Part of what we're seeing is pipeline billing from very low a year ago levels, were also seeing more regular and larger orders, suggesting some demand stabilization for the near term.
We also continue to see good volume trajectory in Asia with major customers, and we'll begin to benefit from new wins with yogurt customers in China. This is an area we've recently targeted for portfolio growth and are expecting increase in contributions to our business as we move through the year.
In our Healthcare business, earnings increased during the first quarter, primarily because of the choices we've made to emphasize Shellpak and other adherence solutions, and from strong productivity improvement. In the first quarter last year, we produced about $13 million units for Wal-Mart prescription drug program. This year, that number is up to almost $25 million. There are currently 12 drugs being sold in Shellpak at Wal-Mart pharmacy counters and we expect that to grow this year as well.
Sales were also steady for our oral and nasal pumps in the Healthcare market, with growth in the over-the-counter market, as well as for our specialty preservative free pumps that addresses specific regulatory need in Europe. 
The personal care markets continue to improve, and as a result, our business increased sales and earnings substantially compared to a particularly weak first quarter last year, when our customers aggressively destocked inventory. Our customers are now sounding more confident, and that has translated into stronger orders for higher value fragrance dispensers, skincare airless products and luxury secondary packaging in Europe. We are gaining share in each of these categories by adding new customers, as well as by adding to our business with existing customers like P&G, Unilever, L'Oreal and J&J.
With this improving demand trends, we expect to continue our positive trajectory through the third quarter, as this market rebound from historical lows last year. 
Volumes are good for our targeted products in the home and garden market, primarily in the United States, especially the more profitable custom applicators for lawn and garden maintenance, and trigger sprayer for surface cleansers. The important spring garden season is off to a strong start, with retailers reporting increased traffic and good sell-through to the higher promotional activity by the branded industry leaders. And we're seeing solid growth for our next generation aerosol trigger, with the new and existing customers.
Overall, sales and earnings were down slightly despite this market progress in home and garden, as we again eliminated some of our offerings to focus more profitable products, and were impacted by higher resin costs that we expect to recoup through contractual pass throughs over the next quarter or two. 
In the Media business, sales and earnings were lower than last year. We're managing to generate as much cash we possibly can from this business, and doing so successfully, by continuing to drive productivity improvements and aggressively targeting categories and customers that are still profitable.
Turning to our non-packaging businesses, our positive earnings momentum continued in the first quarter for both the Consumer & Office Products and Specialty Chemicals segment. The Consumer & Office Products segment had one of its best first quarter performances, earning $6 million in the quarter that traditionally loses money, as we build toward the North American back-to-school season later in the year. Sales of time management and other consumer products were higher to our retail and commercial partners, and good sell through for school supplies in Brazil by the stronger replenishment orders late in the first quarter. Sales in the quarter were up 7% and included benefits from last year's acquisition of Grafon’s. Productivity across all of this segment's businesses, especially in the United States, coupled with the stronger volume led to solid year-over-year earnings improvement. 
Sales increased significantly on Specialty Chemicals segment compared to a very weak quarter last year, and the business posted strong earnings of $25 million for the first quarter. This segment saw volume recover strongly across key product lines, in both pine chemicals and activated carbon. We had strong performances in adhesives and oil field services, continue to grow the Asphalt Additives business, especially in China and Brazil, and saw a rebound in carbon volume due to an increase in auto production in North America.
This volume increases helped improve asset utilization rates, and along with that, overall segment earnings. The Community Development and Land Management segment earned $23 million in the first quarter, including $17 million from 21 real estate transactions that closed during the first three months of the year. 
And with volume and pricing higher for pulpwood and sawtimber during the quarter, our forestry operations earned an additional $6 million. While conditions in the real estate sector are still very difficult, we have some positive trends for both our rural land tracts and industrial and development sites. We completed a number of rural land tract transaction in the Charleston, South Carolina area. And these mix of properties contributed to a higher per acre value during the quarter of about $4,300. 
In addition to an uptick in the number of sales during the quarter, the volume and quality of inquiries for these rural tracts was higher on our retail land website. And having recently unveiled the master plan for East Edisto, we are in negotiation with two potential tenants for the commerce part that is part of the first phase of development. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the first quarter. Mark?"

The momentum on our market participation and business model strategies that John and Jim have described is helping us create a fundamentally more profitable company that we believe can continue to generate sustainable performance improvement",1331,"Thanks, Jim. The momentum on our market participation and business model strategies that John and Jim have described is helping us create a fundamentally more profitable company that we believe can continue to generate sustainable performance improvement over the long term. In the first quarter, our progress was clearly reflected in many of our financial metrics, including the following highlights.
Overall, sales grew 4% with volume increases driven by our new products, share gains in targeted markets and continued strong growth in emerging markets. Our operating profit essentially doubled due to the combination of our improved cost structure and successful growth strategies. We have a strong balance sheet with a total debt-to-capital ratio of below 40% and substantial cash reserves, that enable us to continue to profitably grow our business and provide strong returns to our shareholders.
Let me provide a bit more detail on each of these measures of our progress during the first quarter. On the top line, our overall sales growth was 4%, excluding the large land sale last year and product line exits related to our market participation strategies, comparable first quarter sales increased approximately 10%, consisting of about 5% of volume improvement and 5% of FX benefits in other items.
While overall volume benefited modestly from the demand improvement we experienced in the quarter, well more than half the increase came from the success we are seeing with our growth strategies. New products in the quarter accounted for over 16% of total first quarter revenue, including a strong rebound in demand for recently launched fragrance and airless dispensing products, as well as continued strength in our Shellpak product for prescription drugs. We also saw share gains in higher value paperboard grades like commercial print and in our Specialty Chemicals market. 
In the 22% sales increase from emerging markets we saw in the quarter was driven by recovery in volumes in Brazil and continued strong growth for beverage packaging and asphalt additives in China.
Increased sales and the continued benefit of our productivity and overhead cost actions resulted in year-over-year improvement of 250 basis points in our operating profit. First quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes almost doubled versus last year to $73 million. Our strong performance is being driven by the ongoing execution of strategies to fundamentally improve the company's underlying profitability. Importantly, we expect to further leverage our improved cost base and expand margins as we continue to profitably grow our business.
Taking a closer look at the key performance drivers, both adjusted gross margin and SG&A saw a continued solid year-over-year improvement. First quarter adjusted gross margin improved by almost 100 basis points versus the first quarter of 2009 to 17.5%. This includes absorbing approximately 190 basis points of negative, weather-related impacts at the mills during the quarter.
Adjusted SG&A decreased 9% on an absolute basis versus the prior year and was 12.5% of sales, an improvement of 170 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. Moving to the balance sheet, our financial position and flexibility remain excellent. At the end of the quarter, total cash was $731 million. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 30% and our pension plan was a more than 140% funded.
Cash flow used by operations was approximately $8 million in the quarter. Significant cash earnings in a 2.5 day improvement in our cash-to-cash cycle were more than offset by incentive compensation payments. As we move through the year, we expect cash flow from operations to significantly improve. And for the full year, we expect to achieve another year of positive free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations, after CapEx and dividends.
With respect to deploying our cash resources, we will continue to made our balanced approach. Over the past three years, we've generated about $3 billion of discretionary cash flow from operations and asset sales. Over this period, we have reinvested about a third of this cash back into the business. We've returned about a third to shareholders through a strong dividend in periodic share repurchases. And we have used a third to repay debt and build up our cash resources during the economic crisis. These priorities remain the same as we move forward. 
Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We saw improving demand trends during the first quarter, and given current order rates and backlogs, we expect these trends to continue through the second quarter. Beyond that however, there is less certainty as order patterns into the second half of the year will depend on retail sell-through levels, which are subject to the risk related to continued high levels of unemployment and shifts in consumer confidence. 
That said, we are continuing to position our businesses to capture growth and bring more of it to the bottom line. Our commercial strategies are working. We have good confidence in our more competitive business model, and we are continuing to selectively reinvest profitable growth opportunities across our businesses.
We will, however, be watching commodity inflation, which we expect will tick up through the year and could accelerate if demand trends move higher than the current trajectory. But we will, of course, continue to seek pricing to offset these impacts.
With that as context, I'll now provide some segment-specific comments for the second quarter, starting with Packaging Resources. We're expecting segment profit to be solidly above last year. Backlogs at the mills are currently running well above year-ago levels and the combination of better demand with an improved product mix and higher productivity levels are the main drivers of our positive outlook. In addition, we expect continued profit growth at Rigesa. Rising input costs will partially offset these positive factors in the near term, including lingering fiber inflation trends from the weather-related issues in the first quarter, as well as inflation for some commodity chemicals and outbound freight. We are however, continuing to implement pricing actions to offset the negative impacts from cost inflation.
In the Consumer Solutions group, segment profit is expected to be solidly above year-ago levels. Improved results will be driven by a continued demand recovery through the current quarter for targeted products across our Personal Care, Home and Garden and Healthcare Packaging businesses as well as seasonal strength in beverage, which we started to see in March. We also expect to see higher pricing to recapture resin inflation, as well as continued productivity gains.
Turning to the Consumer & Office Products segment, we are expecting another solid overall back-to-school season. We are, however, expecting profit to be modestly lower than last year's very strong second quarter performance. While the business will continue to benefit from strong productivity gains and cost reductions, as is the case with this business, the timing of selling and the ultimate sell through to the consumer of the segment back-to-school products can significantly impact the level of revenues and profits during the quarter.
In Specialty Chemicals, we expect another strong quarter with significant year-over-year improvement. Benefits from continued demand recovery across pine chemical and activated carbon markets and higher productivity levels are expected to drive substantially improved earnings. However, inflation in certain raw materials and freight cost will partially offset these positive factors in the near term.
Finally, in the Community Development and Land Management segment, the timing of land sales, which is the key near-term driver results, remains difficult to forecast. However, we do expect modestly improved segment profit versus the year-ago quarter. The level of improvement will continue to depend on the amount, timing and mix of the land we sell in the quarter.
In summary, during the second quarter, we expect to extend our record solid year-over-year earnings growth and margin improvement. While demand trends are improving, it's important to keep in mind that in most cases, our volumes are still well off peak 2007 levels. The improvements we're driving are largely the result of continued execution of our strategies to improve our business model. With that, I'll turn it back over to John."

Our positive earnings performance outpaced not only last year's first quarter but also the same pre-recession periods in 2008 and 2007. It represents a fourth consecutive quarter of earnings growth directly attributable to our market participation and business model improvement strategies, demonstrating that we are on the right track and are continuing to create a fundamentally more profitable company, capable of generating consistent higher returns for shareholders.
It is these areas of strategic focus that will position us for greater profitability in the near term, well in advance of any full economic recovery. With these strategies and some modest improvement in demand in the first quarter, we increased volume compared to last year, including both share gains and increased orders in many of our targeted markets. We increased sales for our higher value solutions for Personal Care, Healthcare and Home and Garden Packaging, and we captured share gains with paperboard and the food service, tobacco and commercial print markets. 
We are also making significant gains in many of our Specialty Chemicals and Consumer & Office Products markets, and Jim will provide more detail in just a moment about these and other highlights across the company.
With the operating leverage we've created over the past year, having eliminated more than $185 million of structural costs, this improvement in volume had a beneficial impact on our earnings performance during the quarter. The progress we have driven is gratifying, and the underlying signs of market improvement compared to a year ago are welcome. That said, general market demand still remains well below peak 2007 levels, and it remains uncertain whether the present improvement trend is durable or just temporary. 
While we hope that the current trajectory continues, we are continuing to plan for sustained softness. In either of that, we will continue to execute the strategy that has helped us deliver successful results throughout this challenging economic environment. Specifically, we will continue to shape and execute our market participation strategies to ensure that we are driving our own destiny, creating opportunities for profitable growth with innovative products like MWare, Promina and Shellpak, with investments and enhanced strategies in emerging markets like Brazil and China, and with continued emphasis on overhead cost reductions and manufacturing productivity.
With still limited visibility into what economic and market conditions may be in the second half of this year, these areas of emphasis will continue to be the biggest contributors to our success. Across MWV today, we have significant positive momentum and are moving forward with pace and purpose. We're more profitable due to our disciplined strategist to improve our revenue mix, exit low-return business and close unprofitable facilities. 
We're more competitive in targeted markets, having launched innovative new products and expanded in the right geographies. We're more efficient and effective, having reduced costs, significantly improved manufacturing productivity and augmented our organization with new talent and capabilities, and our financial strength is both sound and continues to build. We remain on the right path to make MW be a fundamentally more profitable company and a more valuable investment, both in today's still soft and uncertain economy and in more prosperous times ahead.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard, to talk about our business results in the first quarter, before Mark discusses our financial metrics and provides a more detailed outlook for the second quarter. Jim?"

This was one of our strongest quarters to start the year in recent memory, as we often report a small loss in the seasonally slow period.
Compared to the first quarter last year, we've extended our positive earnings momentum with a significantly improved cost structure from ongoing actions, increased operating productivity in our facilities, share gains with targeted products and some increase in demand in key markets. These are the things we've been focused on in each of our businesses for more than a year, and the impact continues to show in our overall results.
During the quarter, we generated important commercial momentum from our participation strategies, gaining share with targeted products and growing our positions in emerging markets. And for the first time since economic crisis began, demand trends turn upward in certain of our markets. I'll highlight some of the specific trends in each of our businesses in just a moment. But overall, the result was a 5% increase in volume across the company.
Along with the impact of our ongoing cost reduction and productivity actions, this top line growth helped drive adjusted EBIT, up 97% for the first quarter. We added more than $30 million of additional cost savings during the first quarter, to the $154 million we completed to the end of 2009. With this leverage and a sequential growth trends we experienced through the first quarter, we believe our earnings progress can continue in the second quarter and the positive impact should be even greater as demand grows.
Let me share some detail about the commercial trends and operating highlights in each of our businesses in consumer packaging markets. As always, you'll find additional information in the slide presentation that accompanies this call.
In the Packaging Resources business, segment profit was higher than last year, as volumes recovered and pricing gains and productivity actions at our mills drove an increase in earnings. This came during a difficult quarter for our operations due to adverse weather conditions. Unseasonably cold and wet weather reduced fiber availability across the industry, which resulted in significantly higher input costs and lost productivity. Despite these challenges, which had about a $25 million negative impact in our results, the segment earned $30 million during the quarter. This was almost 60% higher than last year and nearly as much as the first quarter of 2008.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, shipments of SBS were up to 3%. We outperformed the broader market in key segments including commercial prints, tobacco, and food service grades. Our MWare line of paperboard for recyclable and compostable food-service applications, such as cups and plates, has been particularly strong. CNK volumes were up 5% compared to last year, as demand began to recover for both beverage and food packaging around the world, and as we continued to make gains with recently added food customers.
Volume was also up in Brazil, as the economy there has shown a solid recovery. As a result, we're Rigesa generated a strong profit growth with higher sales and improved productivity. Overall, paperboard demand in Packaging Resources remain strong as we began the second quarter, with backlogs currently between five and six weeks.
The Consumer Solutions segment had another strong quarter, its fifth straight period of year-over-year earnings growth. Profits rose to $21 million during the quarter, more than a 50% increase compared to last year due to productivity improvements, a stronger mix of high-return products and gains in targeted packaging markets. The actions we took to eliminate some low-return business from our portfolio brought overall sales down slightly compared to last year.
Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business to give you a sense of the performance in the quarter. In Our Global Beverage business, sales and earnings were modestly lower, with an unfavorable impact related to further realignment of our manufacturing footprint in Western Europe and North America. As these initiatives come to a close, we expect to see added productivity benefits as we move through 2010.
Lower beverage volumes in the first quarter were primarily due to unseasonably cool weather in North America in January and February. We've partially offset this impact with double-digit growth in the Asia-Pacific region, led by our major beer customers, and by increased volumes in Australia and New Zealand.
More recent sales trends have improved notably. Seasonally stronger volumes are running above year-ago levels at major beer and carbonated soft drink customers in the United States and Europe. Part of what we're seeing is pipeline billing from very low a year ago levels, were also seeing more regular and larger orders, suggesting some demand stabilization for the near term.
We also continue to see good volume trajectory in Asia with major customers, and we'll begin to benefit from new wins with yogurt customers in China. This is an area we've recently targeted for portfolio growth and are expecting increase in contributions to our business as we move through the year.
In our Healthcare business, earnings increased during the first quarter, primarily because of the choices we've made to emphasize Shellpak and other adherence solutions, and from strong productivity improvement. In the first quarter last year, we produced about $13 million units for Wal-Mart prescription drug program. This year, that number is up to almost $25 million. There are currently 12 drugs being sold in Shellpak at Wal-Mart pharmacy counters and we expect that to grow this year as well.
Sales were also steady for our oral and nasal pumps in the Healthcare market, with growth in the over-the-counter market, as well as for our specialty preservative free pumps that addresses specific regulatory need in Europe. 
The personal care markets continue to improve, and as a result, our business increased sales and earnings substantially compared to a particularly weak first quarter last year, when our customers aggressively destocked inventory. Our customers are now sounding more confident, and that has translated into stronger orders for higher value fragrance dispensers, skincare airless products and luxury secondary packaging in Europe. We are gaining share in each of these categories by adding new customers, as well as by adding to our business with existing customers like P&G, Unilever, L'Oreal and J&J.
With this improving demand trends, we expect to continue our positive trajectory through the third quarter, as this market rebound from historical lows last year. 
Volumes are good for our targeted products in the home and garden market, primarily in the United States, especially the more profitable custom applicators for lawn and garden maintenance, and trigger sprayer for surface cleansers. The important spring garden season is off to a strong start, with retailers reporting increased traffic and good sell-through to the higher promotional activity by the branded industry leaders. And we're seeing solid growth for our next generation aerosol trigger, with the new and existing customers.
Overall, sales and earnings were down slightly despite this market progress in home and garden, as we again eliminated some of our offerings to focus more profitable products, and were impacted by higher resin costs that we expect to recoup through contractual pass throughs over the next quarter or two. 
In the Media business, sales and earnings were lower than last year. We're managing to generate as much cash we possibly can from this business, and doing so successfully, by continuing to drive productivity improvements and aggressively targeting categories and customers that are still profitable.
Turning to our non-packaging businesses, our positive earnings momentum continued in the first quarter for both the Consumer & Office Products and Specialty Chemicals segment. The Consumer & Office Products segment had one of its best first quarter performances, earning $6 million in the quarter that traditionally loses money, as we build toward the North American back-to-school season later in the year. Sales of time management and other consumer products were higher to our retail and commercial partners, and good sell through for school supplies in Brazil by the stronger replenishment orders late in the first quarter. Sales in the quarter were up 7% and included benefits from last year's acquisition of Grafon’s. Productivity across all of this segment's businesses, especially in the United States, coupled with the stronger volume led to solid year-over-year earnings improvement. 
Sales increased significantly on Specialty Chemicals segment compared to a very weak quarter last year, and the business posted strong earnings of $25 million for the first quarter. This segment saw volume recover strongly across key product lines, in both pine chemicals and activated carbon. We had strong performances in adhesives and oil field services, continue to grow the Asphalt Additives business, especially in China and Brazil, and saw a rebound in carbon volume due to an increase in auto production in North America.
This volume increases helped improve asset utilization rates, and along with that, overall segment earnings. The Community Development and Land Management segment earned $23 million in the first quarter, including $17 million from 21 real estate transactions that closed during the first three months of the year. 
And with volume and pricing higher for pulpwood and sawtimber during the quarter, our forestry operations earned an additional $6 million. While conditions in the real estate sector are still very difficult, we have some positive trends for both our rural land tracts and industrial and development sites. We completed a number of rural land tract transaction in the Charleston, South Carolina area. And these mix of properties contributed to a higher per acre value during the quarter of about $4,300. 
In addition to an uptick in the number of sales during the quarter, the volume and quality of inquiries for these rural tracts was higher on our retail land website. And having recently unveiled the master plan for East Edisto, we are in negotiation with two potential tenants for the commerce part that is part of the first phase of development. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the first quarter. Mark?"

The momentum on our market participation and business model strategies that John and Jim have described is helping us create a fundamentally more profitable company that we believe can continue to generate sustainable performance improvement",1331,"Thanks, Jim. The momentum on our market participation and business model strategies that John and Jim have described is helping us create a fundamentally more profitable company that we believe can continue to generate sustainable performance improvement over the long term. In the first quarter, our progress was clearly reflected in many of our financial metrics, including the following highlights.
Overall, sales grew 4% with volume increases driven by our new products, share gains in targeted markets and continued strong growth in emerging markets. Our operating profit essentially doubled due to the combination of our improved cost structure and successful growth strategies. We have a strong balance sheet with a total debt-to-capital ratio of below 40% and substantial cash reserves, that enable us to continue to profitably grow our business and provide strong returns to our shareholders.
Let me provide a bit more detail on each of these measures of our progress during the first quarter. On the top line, our overall sales growth was 4%, excluding the large land sale last year and product line exits related to our market participation strategies, comparable first quarter sales increased approximately 10%, consisting of about 5% of volume improvement and 5% of FX benefits in other items.
While overall volume benefited modestly from the demand improvement we experienced in the quarter, well more than half the increase came from the success we are seeing with our growth strategies. New products in the quarter accounted for over 16% of total first quarter revenue, including a strong rebound in demand for recently launched fragrance and airless dispensing products, as well as continued strength in our Shellpak product for prescription drugs. We also saw share gains in higher value paperboard grades like commercial print and in our Specialty Chemicals market. 
In the 22% sales increase from emerging markets we saw in the quarter was driven by recovery in volumes in Brazil and continued strong growth for beverage packaging and asphalt additives in China.
Increased sales and the continued benefit of our productivity and overhead cost actions resulted in year-over-year improvement of 250 basis points in our operating profit. First quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes almost doubled versus last year to $73 million. Our strong performance is being driven by the ongoing execution of strategies to fundamentally improve the company's underlying profitability. Importantly, we expect to further leverage our improved cost base and expand margins as we continue to profitably grow our business.
Taking a closer look at the key performance drivers, both adjusted gross margin and SG&A saw a continued solid year-over-year improvement. First quarter adjusted gross margin improved by almost 100 basis points versus the first quarter of 2009 to 17.5%. This includes absorbing approximately 190 basis points of negative, weather-related impacts at the mills during the quarter.
Adjusted SG&A decreased 9% on an absolute basis versus the prior year and was 12.5% of sales, an improvement of 170 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. Moving to the balance sheet, our financial position and flexibility remain excellent. At the end of the quarter, total cash was $731 million. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 30% and our pension plan was a more than 140% funded.
Cash flow used by operations was approximately $8 million in the quarter. Significant cash earnings in a 2.5 day improvement in our cash-to-cash cycle were more than offset by incentive compensation payments. As we move through the year, we expect cash flow from operations to significantly improve. And for the full year, we expect to achieve another year of positive free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations, after CapEx and dividends.
With respect to deploying our cash resources, we will continue to made our balanced approach. Over the past three years, we've generated about $3 billion of discretionary cash flow from operations and asset sales. Over this period, we have reinvested about a third of this cash back into the business. We've returned about a third to shareholders through a strong dividend in periodic share repurchases. And we have used a third to repay debt and build up our cash resources during the economic crisis. These priorities remain the same as we move forward. 
Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We saw improving demand trends during the first quarter, and given current order rates and backlogs, we expect these trends to continue through the second quarter. Beyond that however, there is less certainty as order patterns into the second half of the year will depend on retail sell-through levels, which are subject to the risk related to continued high levels of unemployment and shifts in consumer confidence. 
That said, we are continuing to position our businesses to capture growth and bring more of it to the bottom line. Our commercial strategies are working. We have good confidence in our more competitive business model, and we are continuing to selectively reinvest profitable growth opportunities across our businesses.
We will, however, be watching commodity inflation, which we expect will tick up through the year and could accelerate if demand trends move higher than the current trajectory. But we will, of course, continue to seek pricing to offset these impacts.
With that as context, I'll now provide some segment-specific comments for the second quarter, starting with Packaging Resources. We're expecting segment profit to be solidly above last year. Backlogs at the mills are currently running well above year-ago levels and the combination of better demand with an improved product mix and higher productivity levels are the main drivers of our positive outlook. In addition, we expect continued profit growth at Rigesa. Rising input costs will partially offset these positive factors in the near term, including lingering fiber inflation trends from the weather-related issues in the first quarter, as well as inflation for some commodity chemicals and outbound freight. We are however, continuing to implement pricing actions to offset the negative impacts from cost inflation.
In the Consumer Solutions group, segment profit is expected to be solidly above year-ago levels. Improved results will be driven by a continued demand recovery through the current quarter for targeted products across our Personal Care, Home and Garden and Healthcare Packaging businesses as well as seasonal strength in beverage, which we started to see in March. We also expect to see higher pricing to recapture resin inflation, as well as continued productivity gains.
Turning to the Consumer & Office Products segment, we are expecting another solid overall back-to-school season. We are, however, expecting profit to be modestly lower than last year's very strong second quarter performance. While the business will continue to benefit from strong productivity gains and cost reductions, as is the case with this business, the timing of selling and the ultimate sell through to the consumer of the segment back-to-school products can significantly impact the level of revenues and profits during the quarter.
In Specialty Chemicals, we expect another strong quarter with significant year-over-year improvement. Benefits from continued demand recovery across pine chemical and activated carbon markets and higher productivity levels are expected to drive substantially improved earnings. However, inflation in certain raw materials and freight cost will partially offset these positive factors in the near term.
Finally, in the Community Development and Land Management segment, the timing of land sales, which is the key near-term driver results, remains difficult to forecast. However, we do expect modestly improved segment profit versus the year-ago quarter. The level of improvement will continue to depend on the amount, timing and mix of the land we sell in the quarter.
In summary, during the second quarter, we expect to extend our record solid year-over-year earnings growth and margin improvement. While demand trends are improving, it's important to keep in mind that in most cases, our volumes are still well off peak 2007 levels. The improvements we're driving are largely the result of continued execution of our strategies to improve our business model. With that, I'll turn it back over to John."

It represents a fourth consecu",576,"Thanks, Jason, and good morning. MWV had another solid performance in the first quarter. Our positive earnings performance outpaced not only last year's first quarter but also the same pre-recession periods in 2008 and 2007. It represents a fourth consecutive quarter of earnings growth directly attributable to our market participation and business model improvement strategies, demonstrating that we are on the right track and are continuing to create a fundamentally more profitable company, capable of generating consistent higher returns for shareholders.
It is these areas of strategic focus that will position us for greater profitability in the near term, well in advance of any full economic recovery. With these strategies and some modest improvement in demand in the first quarter, we increased volume compared to last year, including both share gains and increased orders in many of our targeted markets. We increased sales for our higher value solutions for Personal Care, Healthcare and Home and Garden Packaging, and we captured share gains with paperboard and the food service, tobacco and commercial print markets. 
We are also making significant gains in many of our Specialty Chemicals and Consumer & Office Products markets, and Jim will provide more detail in just a moment about these and other highlights across the company.
With the operating leverage we've created over the past year, having eliminated more than $185 million of structural costs, this improvement in volume had a beneficial impact on our earnings performance during the quarter. The progress we have driven is gratifying, and the underlying signs of market improvement compared to a year ago are welcome. That said, general market demand still remains well below peak 2007 levels, and it remains uncertain whether the present improvement trend is durable or just temporary. 
While we hope that the current trajectory continues, we are continuing to plan for sustained softness. In either of that, we will continue to execute the strategy that has helped us deliver successful results throughout this challenging economic environment. Specifically, we will continue to shape and execute our market participation strategies to ensure that we are driving our own destiny, creating opportunities for profitable growth with innovative products like MWare, Promina and Shellpak, with investments and enhanced strategies in emerging markets like Brazil and China, and with continued emphasis on overhead cost reductions and manufacturing productivity.
With still limited visibility into what economic and market conditions may be in the second half of this year, these areas of emphasis will continue to be the biggest contributors to our success. Across MWV today, we have significant positive momentum and are moving forward with pace and purpose. We're more profitable due to our disciplined strategist to improve our revenue mix, exit low-return business and close unprofitable facilities. 
We're more competitive in targeted markets, having launched innovative new products and expanded in the right geographies. We're more efficient and effective, having reduced costs, significantly improved manufacturing productivity and augmented our organization with new talent and capabilities, and our financial strength is both sound and continues to build. We remain on the right path to make MW be a fundamentally more profitable company and a more valuable investment, both in today's still soft and uncertain economy and in more prosperous times ahead.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Buzzard, to talk about our business results in the first quarter, before Mark discusses our financial metrics and provides a more detailed outlook for the second quarter. Jim?"
314312,100163317,61203,"MeadWestvaco Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","WestRock MWV, LLC","Executives","Thanks, John.

This was one of our strongest quarters to start the year in recent memory, as we often report a small loss in the seasonally slow period.
Compared to the first quarter last year, we've extended our positive earnings momentum with a significantly improved cost structure from ongoing actions, increased operating productivity in our facilities, share gains with targeted products and some increase in demand in key markets. These are the things we've been focused on in each of our businesses for more than a year, and the impact continues to show in our overall results.
During the quarter, we generated important commercial momentum from our participation strategies, gaining share with targeted products and growing our positions in emerging markets. And for the first time since economic crisis began, demand trends turn upward in certain of our markets. I'll highlight some of the specific trends in each of our businesses in just a moment. But overall, the result was a 5% increase in volume across the company.
Along with the impact of our ongoing cost reduction and productivity actions, this top line growth helped drive adjusted EBIT, up 97% for the first quarter. We added more than $30 million of additional cost savings during the first quarter, to the $154 million we completed to the end of 2009. With this leverage and a sequential growth trends we experienced through the first quarter, we believe our earnings progress can continue in the second quarter and the positive impact should be even greater as demand grows.
Let me share some detail about the commercial trends and operating highlights in each of our businesses in consumer packaging markets. As always, you'll find additional information in the slide presentation that accompanies this call.
In the Packaging Resources business, segment profit was higher than last year, as volumes recovered and pricing gains and productivity actions at our mills drove an increase in earnings. This came during a difficult quarter for our operations due to adverse weather conditions. Unseasonably cold and wet weather reduced fiber availability across the industry, which resulted in significantly higher input costs and lost productivity. Despite these challenges, which had about a $25 million negative impact in our results, the segment earned $30 million during the quarter. This was almost 60% higher than last year and nearly as much as the first quarter of 2008.
Compared to the first quarter last year, shipments of SBS were up 3%. We outperformed the broader market in key segments including commercial prints, tobacco, and food service grades. Our MWare line of paperboard for recyclable and compostable food-service applications, such as cups and plates, has been particularly strong. CNK volumes were up 5% compared to last year, as demand began to recover for both beverage and food packaging around the world, and as we continued to make gains with recently added food customers.
Volume was also up in Brazil, as the economy there has shown a solid recovery. As a result, Rigesa generated a strong profit growth with higher sales and improved productivity. Overall, paperboard demand in Packaging Resources remain strong as we began the second quarter, with backlogs currently between five and six weeks.
The Consumer Solutions segment had another strong quarter, its fifth straight period of year-over-year earnings growth. Profits rose to $21 million during the quarter, more than a 50% increase compared to last year due to productivity improvements, a stronger mix of high-return products and gains in targeted packaging markets. The actions we took to eliminate some low-return business from our portfolio brought overall sales down slightly compared to last year.
Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business to give you a sense of the performance in the quarter. In our Global Beverage business, sales and earnings were modestly lower, with an unfavorable impact related to further realignment of our manufacturing footprint in Western Europe and North America. As these initiatives come to a close, we expect to see added productivity benefits as we move through 2010.
Lower beverage volumes in the first quarter were primarily due to unseasonably cool weather in North America in January and February. We've partially offset this impact with double-digit growth in the Asia-Pacific region, led by our major beer customers, and by increased volumes in Australia and New Zealand.
More recent sales trends have improved notably. Seasonally stronger volumes are running above year-ago levels at major beer and carbonated soft drink customers in the United States and Europe. Part of what we're seeing is pipeline billing from very low year-ago levels. We're also seeing more regular and larger orders, suggesting some demand stabilization for the near term.
We also continue to see good volume trajectory in Asia with major customers, and we'll begin to benefit from new wins with yogurt customers in China. This is an area we've recently targeted for portfolio growth and are expecting increase in contributions to our business as we move through the year.
In our Healthcare business, earnings increased during the first quarter, primarily because of the choices we've made to emphasize Shellpak and other adherence solutions, and from strong productivity improvement. In the first quarter last year, we produced about 13 million units for Wal-Mart's prescription drug program. This year, that number is up to almost 25 million. There are currently 12 drugs being sold in Shellpak at Wal-Mart's pharmacy counters and we expect that to grow this year as well.
Sales were also steady for our oral and nasal pumps in the healthcare market, with growth in the over-the-counter market, as well as for our specialty preservative free pumps that addresses specific regulatory need in Europe. 
The personal care markets continue to improve, and as a result, our business increased sales and earnings substantially compared to a particularly weak first quarter last year, when our customers aggressively destocked inventory. Our customers are now sounding more confident, and that has translated into stronger orders for higher value fragrance dispensers, skin care airless products and luxury secondary packaging in Europe. We are gaining share in each of these categories by adding new customers, as well as by adding to our business with existing customers like P&G, Unilever, L'Oreal and J&J.
With these improving demand trends, we expect to continue our positive trajectory through the third quarter, as this market rebound from historical lows last year. 
Volumes are good for our targeted products in the home and garden market, primarily in the United States, especially the more profitable custom applicators for lawn and garden maintenance, and trigger sprayer for surface cleansers. The important spring garden season is off to a strong start, with retailers reporting increased traffic and good sell-through to the higher promotional activity by the branded industry leaders. And we're seeing solid growth for our next generation aerosol trigger, with the new and existing customers.
Overall, sales and earnings were down slightly despite this market progress in home and garden, as we again eliminated some of our offerings to focus more profitable products, and were impacted by higher resin costs that we expect to recoup through contractual pass throughs over the next quarter or two. 
In the Media business, sales and earnings were lower than last year. We're managing to generate as much cash we possibly can from this business, and doing so successfully, by continuing to drive productivity improvements and aggressively targeting categories and customers that are still profitable.
Turning to our non-packaging businesses, our positive earnings momentum continued in the first quarter for both the Consumer & Office Products and Specialty Chemicals segment. The Consumer & Office Products segment had one of its best first quarter performances, earning $6 million in the quarter that traditionally loses money, as we build toward the North American back-to-school season later in the year. Sales of time management and other consumer products were higher to our retail and commercial partners, and good sell through for school supplies in Brazil by the stronger replenishment orders late in the first quarter. Sales in the quarter were up 7% and included benefits from last year's acquisition of Grafon’s. Productivity across all of this segment's businesses, especially in the United States, coupled with the stronger volume led to solid year-over-year earnings improvement. 
Sales increased significantly on Specialty Chemicals segment compared to a very weak quarter last year, and the business posted strong earnings of $25 million for the first quarter. This segment saw volume recover strongly across key product lines, in both pine chemicals and activated carbon. We had strong performances in adhesives and oil field services, continue to grow the Asphalt Additives business, especially in China and Brazil, and saw a rebound in carbon volume due to an increase in auto production in North America.
This volume increases helped improve asset utilization rates, and along with that, overall segment earnings. The Community Development and Land Management segment earned $23 million in the first quarter, including $17 million from 21 real estate transactions that closed during the first three months of the year. 
And with volume and pricing higher for pulpwood and sawtimber during the quarter, our forestry operations earned an additional $6 million. While conditions in the real estate sector are still very difficult, we have some positive trends for both our rural land tracts and industrial and development sites. We completed a number of rural land tract transaction in the Charleston, South Carolina area. And these mix of properties contributed to a higher per acre value during the quarter of about $4,300. 
In addition to an uptick in the number of sales during the quarter, the volume and quality of inquiries for these rural tracts was higher on our retail land website.

The momentum on our market participation and business model strategies that John and Jim have described is helping us create a fundamentally more profitable company that we believe can continue to generate sustainable performance improvement",1331,"Thanks, Jim. The momentum on our market participation and business model strategies that John and Jim have described is helping us create a fundamentally more profitable company that we believe can continue to generate sustainable performance improvement over the long term. In the first quarter, our progress was clearly reflected in many of our financial metrics, including the following highlights.
Overall, sales grew 4% with volume increases driven by our new products, share gains in targeted markets and continued strong growth in emerging markets. Our operating profit essentially doubled due to the combination of our improved cost structure and successful growth strategies. We have a strong balance sheet with a total debt-to-capital ratio below 40% and substantial cash reserves, that enable us to continue to profitably grow our business and provide strong returns to our shareholders.
Let me provide a bit more detail on each of these measures of our progress during the first quarter. On the top line, our overall sales growth was 4%, excluding the large land sale last year and product line exits related to our market participation strategies, comparable first quarter sales increased approximately 10%, consisting of about 5% of volume improvement and 5% of FX benefits in other items.
While overall volume benefited modestly from the demand improvement we experienced in the quarter, well more than half the increase came from the success we are seeing with our growth strategies. New products in the quarter accounted for over 16% of total first quarter revenue, including a strong rebound in demand for recently launched fragrance and airless dispensing products, as well as continued strength in our Shellpak product for prescription drugs. We also saw share gains in higher value paperboard grades like commercial print and in our specialty chemicals markets. And the 22% sales increase from emerging markets we saw in the quarter was driven by recovering volumes in Brazil and continued strong growth for beverage packaging and asphalt additives in China.
Increased sales and the continued benefit of our productivity and overhead cost actions resulted in year-over-year improvement of 250 basis points in our operating profit. First quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes almost doubled versus last year to $73 million. Our strong performance is being driven by the ongoing execution of strategies to fundamentally improve the company's underlying profitability. Importantly, we expect to further leverage our improved cost base and expand margins as we continue to profitably grow our business.
Taking a closer look at the key performance drivers, both adjusted gross margin and SG&A saw a continued solid year-over-year improvement. First quarter adjusted gross margin improved by almost 100 basis points versus the first quarter of 2009 to 17.5%. This includes absorbing approximately 190 basis points of negative, weather-related impacts at the mills during the quarter.
Adjusted SG&A decreased 9% on an absolute basis versus the prior year and was 12.5% of sales, an improvement of 170 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. Moving to the balance sheet, our financial position and flexibility remain excellent. At the end of the quarter, total cash was $731 million. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 30% and our pension plan was a more than 140% funded.
Cash flow used by operations was approximately $8 million in the quarter. Significant cash earnings in a 2.5 day improvement in our cash-to-cash cycle were more than offset by incentive compensation payments. As we move through the year, we expect cash flow from operations to significantly improve. And for the full year, we expect to achieve another year of positive free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations, after CapEx and dividends.
With respect to deploying our cash resources, we will continue to main [ph] our balanced approach. Over the past three years, we've generated about $3 billion of discretionary cash flow from operations and asset sales. Over this period, we have reinvested about a third of this cash back into the business. We've returned about a third to shareholders through a strong dividend in periodic share repurchases. And we have used a third to repay debt and build up our cash resources during the economic crisis. These priorities remain the same as we move forward. 
Now, turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We saw improving demand trends during the first quarter, and given current order rates and backlogs, we expect these trends to continue through the second quarter. Beyond that, however, there is less certainty as order patterns into the second half of the year will depend on retail sell-through levels, which are subject to the risk related to continued high levels of unemployment and shifts in consumer confidence. 
That said, we are continuing to position our businesses to capture growth and bring more of it to the bottom line. Our commercial strategies are working. We have good confidence in our more competitive business model, and we are continuing to selectively reinvest in profitable growth opportunities across our businesses.
We will, however, be watching commodity inflation, which we expect will tick up through the year and could accelerate if demand trends move higher than the current trajectory. But we will, of course, continue to seek pricing to offset these impacts.
With that as context, I'll now provide some segment-specific comments for the second quarter, starting with Packaging Resources. We're expecting segment profit to be solidly above last year. Backlogs at the mills are currently running well above year-ago levels and the combination of better demand with an improved product mix and higher productivity levels are the main drivers of our positive outlook. In addition, we expect continued profit growth at Rigesa. Rising input costs will partially offset these positive factors in the near term, including lingering fiber inflation trends from the weather-related issues in the first quarter, as well as inflation for some commodity chemicals and outbound freight. We are however, continuing to implement pricing actions to offset the negative impacts from cost inflation.
In the Consumer Solutions group, segment profit is expected to be solidly above year-ago levels. Improved results will be driven by a continued demand recovery through the current quarter for targeted products across our Personal Care, Home and Garden and Healthcare Packaging businesses as well as seasonal strength in beverage, which we started to see in March. We also expect to see higher pricing to recapture resin inflation, as well as continued productivity gains.
Turning to the Consumer & Office Products segment, we are expecting another solid overall back-to-school season. We are, however, expecting profit to be modestly lower than last year's very strong second quarter performance. While the business will continue to benefit from strong productivity gains and cost reductions, as is the case with this business, the timing of selling and the ultimate sell through to the consumer of the segment back-to-school products can significantly impact the level of revenues and profits during the quarter.
In Specialty Chemicals, we expect another strong quarter with significant year-over-year improvement. Benefits from continued demand recovery across pine chemical and activated carbon markets and higher productivity levels are expected to drive substantially improved earnings. However, inflation in certain raw materials and freight cost will partially offset these positive factors in the near term.
Finally, in the Community Development and Land Management segment, the timing of land sales, which is the key near-term driver results, remains difficult to forecast. However, we do expect modestly improved segment profit versus the year-ago quarter. The level of improvement will continue to depend on the amount, timing and mix of the land we sell in the quarter.
In summary, during the second quarter, we expect to extend our record solid year-over-year earnings growth and margin improvement. While demand trends are improving, it's important to keep in mind that in most cases, our volumes are still well off peak 2007 levels. The improvements we're driving are largely the result of continued execution of our strategies to improve our business model. With that, I'll turn it back over to John."

MWV's financial performance during the second quarter builds on the forward momentum we have established from our deliberate transformation strategies. In this most recent period, we recorded another quarter of strong improvement across key profitability metrics, gained share in targeted end markets in each of our businesses, generated double-digit growth in our largest and most important emerging markets, Brazil and China, and delivered strong flow-through of our hard-earned cost savings and productivity gains. The result was a near doubling of our operating profit, and we further strengthened our already sound financial position. 
This performance demonstrates the strategies we are executing in each of our businesses to enhance our market participation and reduce cost are improving the fundamental profitability of our company. We continue to pursue these strategies with both diligence and confidence. We expect that they will enable MWV to continue to perform well in the present economy, will bolster relative performance should there be an economic downturn and will generate superior returns in a more robust economy.
In a moment, Jim will provide you with greater detail on our strategy execution. Mark will follow with an in-depth look at the impact of our overall financial performance. First though, I wanted to further emphasize the focused set of strategies that now characterize MWV's more profitable business model. Each of our segments is providing demonstrable and differentiated value to our customers, delivering more profitability to the bottom line and pursuing profitable growth that we are able to invest in due to the solid financial foundation we have established and maintained throughout this difficult period. 
In short, MWV today is a stronger company. Our transformation into a market-focused company is providing us sustainable competitive advantages with an enriched product mix, a growing pipeline of new products and strong positions in the most promising emerging markets. As examples, we have doubled the volume of our innovative airless dispensing products for beauty and personal care applications, a direct result of relationships we formed with our major consumer packaged goods customers to deliver solutions that are helping them win in both developed and rapidly growing emerging markets, such as China. 
We also continue to expand Shellpak's position as a leading product in the healthcare market, as it has been scientifically proven to increase patient adherence to the schedule and dosage of their prescription medicine. We have produced meaningful growth and market share gains for our bleached paperboard, in many cases, earning business when brand owners specify the use of our paperboard for their highest-value products, just as they have in the food and tobacco markets. 
Similarly, we have turned meaningful customer engagement efforts into growth for our MWare line of paperboard for products in the food service market. We are very encouraged by our continuing progress in Brazil, where Rigesa's differentiated product offerings and value-based selling continue to generate strong volume growth and returns for the company. As our investors are aware, we are evaluating the possibility of additional investments in Brazil that would further extend our advantages in that attractive and growing marketplace.
And our Specialty Chemical business is continuing to exploit growing global demand for infrastructure and energy. The improved performance they demonstrate to customers with their proprietary additives is generating growth for asphalt solutions in the United States, China and other countries throughout Asia. 
More innovative products like MWare paperboard, airless dispensers and Evotherm asphalt additive; deeper customer partnerships, such as those with food brand owners and large retailers competing in the market for generic prescriptions using adherence packaging; and intense focus on the right opportunities for growth in emerging markets where our business grew by 17% during the second quarter. When these examples and more are added to our relentless discipline for cost reduction and productivity improvements, our ongoing transformation is the key to the earnings improvement we have delivered.
Our outlook for demand beyond the third quarter is uncertain, and our customers remain cautious about consumer spending and business investments. However, we expect to further improve our performance by executing the same strategy that has helped us deliver successful results throughout this challenging economic environment. Sharper, more focused market participation, improved cost structure and productivity and a stronger financial position to fuel profitable growth. This course will provide a sustainable advantage for MWV as we work to further increase the value we deliver to shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim Buzzard to talk about our business results in the second quarter before Mark discusses our financial metrics and provides a more detailed outlook for the third quarter. Jim?"

We executed our strategies very well during the second quarter and generated strong earnings results for each of our business segments and for the company as a whole. Across our businesses, we made gains in targeted markets and delivered further improvements as part of our strategic cost management program. The result is a more competitive set of businesses that are generating profitable growth for MWV and that are pursuing additional opportunities in the most attractive markets. 
Overall sales were up 8% during the second quarter compared to last year, reflecting a determined focus to grow in our targeted global markets. We increased sales of higher value, differentiated products during the quarter and also saw some year-over-year improvement in our markets. With growing demand for MWV's richer portfolio of products and solutions, we also had substantial bottom-line contribution from price and mix during the quarter.
We also are maintaining the intensity of our cost reduction program, achieving an additional $27 million of capacity and overhead cost savings during the quarter on top of another strong productivity performance across our operations.  With continued progress in these important areas during the second quarter, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and special items increased 81%. 
Let me share details about the performance and trends in each of our businesses and consumer packaging markets. As always, you'll find additional information in the slide presentation that accompanies this call.
In the Packaging Resources business, segment profit was up by 47%, with increased sales volumes of higher-value products and improvements in our manufacturing productivity, driving our earnings. We achieved this solid improvement despite some operating challenges, including significantly higher inflation driven by the lingering impact of severe weather on our fiber costs at the mills and freight cost increases. 
Sales were up 10% during the quarter. Shipments of bleached paperboard and Coated Natural Kraft were each 3% higher than last year, continuing the trend of increases since the beginning of 2010. We achieved strong pricing and mix gains as we focused on our participation in the highest-value paperboard markets we serve. We continue to run full at our mills, with order backlogs of five to six weeks at low inventories, and we expect to continue to produce at capacity for the remainder of the year. 
Many of the market participation strategies that John highlighted had a measurable impact on our performance in the Packaging Resources Group. We continue to gain market share in commercial print by using on-press comparisons to demonstrate the value of our Tango Advantage product to customers. We're accomplishing the same thing in the market for frozen food where performance characteristics, such as freeze-thaw strength and printability, are essential for demanding retail food brand owners around the world. And our innovative MWare line of paperboard for renewable cups in the food service market is growing rapidly as we leverage growth with key quick-serve restaurant customers. 
We also continue to see excellent results in Rigesa, where earnings were up strongly for the quarter, driven by solid volume growth and contributions from improved pricing and productivity. Rigesa's outstanding performance and operating record continues to make a very positive contribution to the Packaging Resources segment. And as a platform, we may look to grow, as we've mentioned, with our ongoing evaluation of a new paper machine.
The Consumer Solutions segment increased profits to $27 million during the quarter compared to $25 million last year. These better results were driven by strong volume increases and market share gains for higher-value packaging products in the personal care, healthcare and home and garden markets, as well as higher operating productivity. And the improvement was partially offset by $3 million of costs associated with the closure of a beverage packaging facility in France and negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Sales in Consumer Solutions were about the same as last year, having exited certain lower margin business, we replaced nearly all of these volumes with sales of higher margin core products and solutions, improving the profitability of our revenue mix and contributing to the better performance in this segment.
Let me go through each of the consumer packaging markets we serve in this business to highlight some of the impact of our market participation strategies. In our Global Beverage business, sales were higher but earnings were down compared to a very strong second quarter last year. During the quarter, we incurred a $3 million in cost as we completed the process to close our facility in France, and we incurred unfavorable foreign exchange. The facility closure will have an immediate impact on our productivity and results going forward, and we have successfully transitioned production to other locations and retained the customer base previously served by this beverage packaging plant. 
The increase in beverage sales reflects above-market performance in Asia and North America and steady volumes in Europe. We won business in the U.S. by converting AB InBev corrugated volume to our paperboard solution for 18- and 20-count glass packs, and also earned some small share gains from key carbonated soft drink customers. We did not, however, gain a large amount of volume from recent promotional activities in the soft drink market. We continue to see very strong growth in Asia, where our business is up about 30% compared to last year and is maintaining a strong and steady growth trajectory with customers who continue to develop new multipack markets.
In our Healthcare business, sales and earnings were down slightly during the quarter. We had a drop-off in sales for our paperboard adherence solutions in this market and also exited from unprofitable segments of our Folding Carton business. However, Shellpak volume is up more than 50% compared to last year as the number of prescription drugs and the number of customers continues to grow. We are in discussions with another large retailer to make Shellpak a central piece of their strategy to compete in the large and growing market for low-cost generic prescription drugs. Sales were also steady for both standard oral and nasal pumps, as well as our high-value, preservative-free pumps in Europe.
The personal care markets continue to rebound from the lows we experienced last year. As a result, our business increased earnings again during the second quarter. Sales of our airless dispensers for skincare doubled compared to last year, as we gained market share with the biggest customers in the category. We also had very strong sales for fragrance dispensers, including our NoC pump that was recently awarded a patent in the United States and has helped us gain market share with key customers. 
The Home and Garden business had strong sales and earnings during the second quarter. We had good performance in North America towards lawn maintenance and home surface cleaning, where we continue to grow with the market and see good adoption of our next generation aerosol dispenser. Sales have increased for this innovative product in the Home Care category, and we see potential to expand into other applications as well.
We want our share of titles and projects for the upcoming busy season in the Media business, an important indicator of our competitive position. But the overall dynamics in this market continue to be very challenging. Sales and earnings were down as the market continues to decline, and we were impacted, as we were in our Other Plastics businesses, by higher prices for resin.
Turning to our Non-Packaging businesses, the Consumer & Office Products segment had earnings equal to last year even with a slight decline in sales as some retailers planned their back-to-school category closer to pulling a sell-through to the consumer in the third quarter. This business has had steady year-over-year earnings improvement over the past few quarters, and we did well to perform in line with a very strong second quarter last year, in large part due to continued productivity actions. 
In the quarter, the segment sold a somewhat weaker mix of products for back-to-school season in the U.S., as the timing of shipments of our proprietary branded products shifted into the third quarter. Sales of envelopes continued to decline, while there was a small uptick in sales of early-season time management and other office products. With the integration of Grafon's completed, we expect a solid back-to-school season in Brazil starting in the third and fourth quarters.
Again, sales and earnings increased significantly in the Specialty Chemicals segment. Strong profit of $36 million and sales of $180 million were driven by volume growth and share gains in higher-value performance chemicals and the rebounding demand for our carbon solutions due to increased auto production. 
Sales from emerging markets more than doubled, due in part to continued market penetration of the company's innovative asphalt solutions. These wins highlight the value of our formulation and application-based products have with our customers through the positive performance impact on varying products. The result is a more stable customer relationships and a rich product mix in growing markets.
The Community and Land Management segment earned $12 million in the second quarter compared to just $3 million last year during a specially difficult period for the real estate market. The rural track land sales program continued with a good base of attractive deals, including $15 million of gross proceeds from 19 transactions that closed during the second quarter for an average price per acre of just under $2,600. The pace and value of transactions this year is holding steady, and there's been a measurable increase in interest for our properties and the number and quality of inquiries on our website. 
We also continue to make progress on entitlements and improvements on our various development properties, including ongoing negotiations with Charleston, Dorchester Counties in South Carolina for East Edisto, preparations for another site at our distribution facility joint venture with the Rockefeller Group and the next phase of our master plan for The Parks of Berkeley development. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the second quarter. Mark?"

We delivered another quarter of strong improvement across all key financial measures. Continued momentum in the execution of our market participation and business model strategies has enabled us to create a fundamentally more profitable company that we believe will provide sustainable performance improvement and deliver higher returns over the long term. The hard work to improve our competitive position in key end markets and enhance our product mix through better market participation choices were important drivers to our significant year-over-year profit growth.
We also had solid cash performance, achieving good balance between maintaining our excellent financial strength, supporting our current sales gains and funding growth initiatives. Some financial highlights from our second quarter performance include volume growth of 8% in our core product segments, 360 basis points of improvement in adjusted operating margins and a 42% improvement in adjusted net cash flow from operations. I'll now provide more detail on each of these measures of our financial progress during the second quarter.
Our overall sales growth in the second quarter was 8%. Volume improvement of 8% in our core products, price and mix benefits of 1.5% and modestly favorable foreign exchange were partially offset by the exit from lower-return product lines. As we continue to leverage investments we've made in new product innovation, a greater mix of our revenue is now coming from higher-value new products and customers. 
During the second quarter, revenues from new products continued to grow as a percentage of our overall sales. Significant contributors include our innovative dispensing solutions for global beauty and personal care markets, our higher-value paperboard for commercial print and food service markets, our performance chemicals for global energy and infrastructure markets and continued success from our Shellpak product line.
We also had a very strong contribution to growth from emerging markets. A 17% sales increase in the second quarter continues to be driven by our solid positions in China and Brazil. At current growth rates, emerging markets revenue is on track to reach approximately 25% of our annual consolidated sales in 2010.
Improved product mix and the continued benefit of our productivity and overhead cost actions resulted in year-over-year improvement of 360 basis points in our operating margins. We're seeing clear evidence of the operating leverage we've created with our leaner cost structure. During the quarter, we achieved an additional $27 million in overhead and capacity savings, bringing the total for our strategic cost management programs to approximately $215 million to date, on track to achieve our $250 million target.
This leverage and the mix benefits from our market participation strategies drove 230 basis points of adjusted gross margin improvement to 20.5%. Our SG&A cost continued to decline, primarily from ongoing overhead cost reductions. Our efforts to hold the line on variable cost while continuing to fund profitable revenue growth reduced adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales by 130 basis points to 11.8%. 
Second quarter net cash flow from operations, which excludes the cash portion of restructuring and the fuel credits received in 2009, improved approximately $25 million or 42% over the prior year, driven by higher earnings. Despite increased levels of investment to grow our business, we continue to drive improvement in working capital efficiency, reducing our cash-to-cash cycle by five days versus the second quarter of last year. 
CapEx in the second quarter was modestly lower versus the prior year as we continue to maintain our flexibility. While we do not intend to spend ahead of the economic recovery, we do have growth investments planned in the second half of the year that are better focused on building out our new product pipeline and augmenting our strong positions in emerging markets. For the full year, we expect to generate solid positive free cash flow, which we define as cash after CapEx and dividends.
We continue to retain flexibility on our balance sheet, which we believe is prudent given the continued unsettled global economic climate. In the near term, we expect to maintain our current cash levels, and we'll continue with our balanced approach to reinvesting in our business, returning value to shareholders through our strong dividend and opportunistically reducing debt.
Our outlook for the third quarter is cautiously optimistic. We believe that the improved demand trends across our targeted businesses and markets will remain stable, at least in the short term. With that, and the continued benefits from executing on our market participation and business model improvement strategies, we expect year-over-year earnings improvement for the third quarter. 
Nevertheless, we do remain cautious about longer-term demand fundamentals given the ongoing macroeconomic challenges facing key markets and geographies, particularly in North America and Europe. As such, the degree of our improvement in the third quarter and beyond will be influenced by these factors.
A more specific outlook for each of our business segments is as follows: We're expecting segment profit for Packaging Resources to be solidly above last year's level. Backlogs at our mills in the U.S. remain strong, between five and six weeks. The combination of strong demand, improving product mix and price, as well as ongoing productivity gains, will be the main drivers of higher earnings. We also expect continued improved profitability from Rigesa. Partially offsetting these factors will be a planned outage at our Covington mill, as well as modestly higher input cost for freight and certain raw materials. 
In the Consumer Solutions Group, segment profit is expected to be modestly above year-ago levels. Stable demand in personal care and home and garden markets and continued growth in Shellpak healthcare packaging, as well as steady beverage volumes and productivity improvement will drive improved results. We expect these gains to be partially offset by the negative exchange impact of a weaker euro. 
In the Consumer & Office Products segment, we're expecting another solid back-to-school season with profits flattish compared to last year's very strong third quarter performance. In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we expect profits to be up strongly over the year-ago quarter, and we expect continued strong demand across key product lines and improved product mix and productivity gains to be partially offset by modestly higher raw materials costs. 
Finally, in the Community Development and Land Management business, sales of small tracks of land will continue to be the main driver of results. We expect segment profit to be at level similar to the second quarter. However, earnings will continue to be subject to the timing of our land sales. Now I'll turn it back to John."

Claudia, in really building on the work we've been doing over the last several quarters is leading to the strong performance. As I said in my prepared comments, clearly, some of the infrastructure projects around the globe have helped in the Asphalt business. We have a very, very strong position in emerging markets, and so the growth there is delivering top line improvement for us. We have seen a rebound in the Automotive business in North America, certainly not back to the levels that we would have seen three and four years ago but better than 2009, and that's contributed to the top line. In terms of the profit improvement, it's driven by, with the really high value-added products that add real value to our customers and our ability to capture those, as well as an ongoing productivity program and all those things that come together to help drive the growth. And the last thing is we have made capital investments in this business. We expanded our refinery in DeRidder in 2008.

In the third quarter, the MWV organization's execution of our value-based strategy continued to deliver stronger, more sustainable earnings performance from each of our businesses. This progress is particularly apparent in our market-focused strategic business units for Packaging, whose revenues represent the principal output of our efficient paperboard converging and injection molding manufacturing system. 
With these market-focused business units, we're building new and deeper partnerships with customers, improving the overall mix of high-value products and packaging solutions and achieving share gains in targeted, attractive end markets and geographies. This progress is the foundation for MWV's continuing transformation and is contributing soundly to the company's improved performance and our very strong prospects for profitable growth, just as our similar strategies in our Specialty Chemicals, Consumer & Office Products and Community Development and Land Management businesses. 
Some highlights from the quarter include adjusted earnings per share of $0.63, a 4% volume growth from core products, a 28% increase in earnings from our Packaging businesses, a remarkable 83% profit increase from our Specialty Chemicals business and the sale of our Media Packaging business. 
With those highlights in mind, let me provide some details on the progress we're making in each of our packaging end markets, progress that we expect will continue to drive improvement across our packaging platform. 
Turning first to the beverage market. In the global beverage markets, trends are flat to slightly down in the mature markets of North America and Europe but the opportunities are very large in emerging markets, especially across Asia and Latin America. Our beverage packaging business has outpaced these trends for several quarters, with sales volume roughly the same year-over-year in North America and Europe and double-digit growth in emerging markets. 
We are leveraging our global footprint and systems value proposition to grow along with customers in emerging markets by offering better speed-to-market, increased productivity for their operations and more product flexibility, and our pipeline for both innovation and high-end machinery solutions in this business is very strong. 
In the large global food and food services markets, our business team is working directly with brand owners and retailers to specify MWV paperboard solutions for frozen food packaging, ready-to-eat meals and hot drink cups. Our focus on these demanding applications help generate strong double-digit sales and profit growth in these markets during the quarter. 
Looking forward, the beneficial environmental features of our new MWare line of paperboard for compostable cups and other food service products have generated excellent potential for participation in global quick serve restaurant chains. And we recently launched a new product called Captivate. Captivate is a shelf-ready and a shopper-friendly packaging solution for canned goods, pet food, frozen juice, yogurt and other consumer goods. It delivers benefits for the brand owner, the retail operator and the shopper, with a billboard effect on crowded store shelves, supply-chain efficiencies and shrinkage or theft reduction benefits and a better overall shopping experience for consumers. Captivate is a great example of the way we are using brand and consumer insights to develop innovation in packaging. And in addition to applications in the retail food market, it has strong potential in the beverage and healthcare markets as well. 
Turning to our Healthcare business, we're focused on extending our leading position in value-added adherence packaging. Demand for Shellpak was steady in the third quarter, and we are adding a new drug to the program with our biggest customer, Wal-Mart, that will increase volume by about 15% beginning this December. 
We are also beginning a partnership with Kroger on an initial launch of Shellpak for its Health Matters prescription drug program. This partnership with Kroger will include educational materials for pharmacists and patients, as well as in-store promotions, and we expect to be able to demonstrate significant sales lift with the switch to Shellpak for many of its generic prescription offerings. 
In the beauty and personal care market, we had another increase in overall revenues during the third quarter as we gained share for both our airless dispensers and fragrance pumps. We doubled volumes of our airless dispensers for skin care during the quarter and had a 45% growth in the fragrance product sales. There, we launched a one-of-a-kind customized product for the new Voyage d'Hermès fragrance line, a sustainability solution that we developed in partnership with one of the world's most admired luxury brands. 
As the home and garden busy season came to a close, we posted very strong performance for our core trigger sprayers and custom applicators. We're very pleased with the continued strength of our next-generation aerosol sprayers as we're capturing a larger share of business from key global customers such as Procter & Gamble, Unilever and SC Johnson. And we have strategic initiatives underway in this business that will strengthen our position for further growth in Europe and emerging markets. 
In the global tobacco market, our strategy is to focus on the premium and ultra premium categories, and our sales continue to increase in several markets around the world, even as they decline here in the United States. Our global customer base increasingly recognizes and rewards us for the value of our new prominent tobacco paperboard solution, which delivers a unique combination of the paper's characteristics and performance consistency, along with environmental or sustainability benefits. Beyond this, we continue to help customers develop packaging solutions for growing categories such as smokeless tobacco products. 
We are also participating extensively across a number of markets in Brazil, served primarily by Rigesa. We've seen robust growth in that country that reflects the expansion and increased buying power of the middle class. We increased sales in Brazil during the quarter compared to the prior year, with especially strong double-digit growth in packaging for frozen meat, fresh produce and other food products. Rigesa's integrated corrugated packaging business continues to be a source of real competitive advantage. And the positive trajectory of Brazil's economy represents very good opportunity for all of our Packaging businesses, as well as for our market-leading school and office products. 
As I hope you can see, our organized approach to participating in targeted packaging markets through our strategic business units has contributed significantly to our current progress while also identifying new opportunities for future profitable growth. We have a disciplined focus on attractive, faster-growing and profitable global end markets where we can successfully leverage our knowledge and capabilities to develop deeper partnerships with customers based on industry-leading insight into consumer behavior, brand value and innovation and this is generating real progress and benefit. I'll now turn to Jim who will report on our operation and segment performance, and Mark will follow with a review of our financial metrics, as well as an outlook for the remaining months of this year. After that, we will turn to your questions. Jim?"
314312,113677532,82282,"MeadWestvaco Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","WestRock MWV, LLC","Executives","Thank you, John. We continue to have success with our market participation strategies, and we continue to translate that success into improved operating results and financial performance.

We continue to have success with our market participation strategies, and we continue to translate that success into improved operating results and financial performance. Overall, sales were up 3% during the third quarter compared to last year, with core volume up 4% as John mentioned. 
Over the past year, we have significantly changed our business mix, and our greatest gains were at the high-value products and solutions we've emphasized in our most profitable markets. Along with the widespread progress from our market participation strategy, we've also continued with an intense focus on cost reductions and operating and sourcing productivity across our manufacturing platform. That includes our paperboard mills, converting plants, injection molding facilities and chemical refineries. 
As part of the strategic cost management plan we've been executing, we achieved an additional $22 million in savings during the third quarter. We expect to reach the $250 million run rate target we set during the fourth quarter, along with the ongoing benefits of our sourcing initiatives and operating excellence program, these savings have been important contributors to our overall margin expansion. 
Overall, the transformation of our business model through execution of our value-added strategies drove adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and special items up 11% to a record $171 million. With those headlines in mind, representative of progress that we've made across our markets, I'd like to provide some quick details for each of our segments. Additional information is available on our press release and the slides that accompany this call. 
In the Packaging Resources segment, as John noted, our brand engagement strategy has improved performance, with overall sales up 12% across our market-focused strategic business units. Shipments of bleached board were the same as last year, though we only ran five machines this quarter after shutting down the machine at our Evadale mill last year. And shipments of Coated Natural Kraft were up 14%, reflecting gains in retail food packaging and a return to more normal beverage ordering patterns compared with a weak third quarter in 2009. 
Segment profit was up by 23% to $91 million in the quarter, with higher sales and a richer product mix, as well as improved productivity despite a planned outage at our Covington mill that we did not have during the third quarter of 2009. We continue to run full at our mills, with order backlogs of five to six weeks while maintaining low inventory levels. 
In the Consumer Solutions segment, we are pleased with the step change in profitability we are achieving with our strengthened business model as segment operating profit increased 41% to $38 million or 8.3% of sales. Benefits of our improving business mix were visible with the completion of the sale of our Media Packaging business, and we continue to have better overall productivity performance in this segment. 
On the sales side, we made good progress during the quarter in many of the markets we serve in Consumer Solutions, several of which John has already identified. Even with this good volume growth, the impact of strategic business exits and unfavorable foreign currency exchange resulted in modestly slower sales in this segment. 
In the Consumer & Office Products segment, the back-to-school season in North America was in line with our expectations. There was good sell-through of our leading branded products, including increases for our new Early Learning line. Overall however, there was not as much retail promotional activity for this category compared to last year and envelope sales continued to decline. So overall sales were down about 5% and earnings in this segment were essentially unchanged at $50 million. Looking ahead, order volume has been good in Brazil heading into what we believe will be a solid back-to-school season there. 
In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we continued to capitalize on the advantages we've created through timely investments in emerging markets, capacity expansion and new product development. We had strong sales of more profitable products for markets such as oil field chemicals and asphalt additives, especially in emerging markets and a rebound in auto carbons as well, as global auto production has increased. As a result, it was another record quarter, with sales up 22% and earnings up 83% to $44 million in this segment. 
In Community Development and Land Management, we continue to progress nicely with development activities at our industrial and commercial sites. We remain on time and on budget with the first industrial warehouse as part of our joint venture with the Rockefeller Group, and we expect TBC Corporation to take occupancy of the completed building in January. 
In a very difficult market for rural land sales, we maintained a disciplined approach to extracting value from our select properties, with a strong average price per acre during the quarter of over $2,800. Renewed economic concerns during the quarter delayed some closings, and as a result, our sales and earnings in the segment were lower than expected compared to a very strong performance last year. As the confidence of individual buyers increases, we expect a higher close rate on real properties. 
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the third quarter. Mark?"

Across the board, our third quarter operating results were very strong and reflect a more robust business model we've created for our company. We achieved record adjusted operating profit in the quarter, pushing our total through the first ni",1165,"Thanks, Jim. Across the board, our third quarter operating results were very strong and reflect a more robust business model we've created for our company. We achieved record adjusted operating profit in the quarter, pushing our total through the first nine months, well past what we achieved for all of 2009. 
Some highlights from the quarter include: significantly improved price and mix contribution to both our top and bottom line. This is the result of strong commercial execution in our targeted end markets; solid margin and profit growth, a continued benefit of our more competitive cost structure; excellent cash performance with cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $270 million; and balanced and disciplined cash deployment as we opportunistically repurchased stock and debt and continued to invest to profitably grow our businesses. 
I'll now provide more detail on our progress in these areas and then share our outlook for the fourth quarter. We generated 4% growth from our core products, where volumes improved 4%, and price and mix contributed an additional 5%, driven largely by strong performance in our packaging platform. This improvement was partially offset by the exit of lower-return product lines, unfavorable foreign exchange and lower land sales. 
Key revenue drivers during the third quarter were increased sales of higher-margin products, particularly in the global food market, home and garden market, targeted personal care products as well as in healthcare packaging. Sales from emerging markets were also a significant contributor. Rigesa's strong performance in Brazil in our airless dispenser and leveraging packaging in Asia drove 13% emerging markets sales growth across our Packaging businesses. Emerging markets now comprise more than a quarter of our total packaging sales. 
Continued momentum from new product innovation and commercialization was a key factor in our third quarter revenue growth, with contributions from Shellpak, our NoC fragrance and airless dispenser products, MWare compostable food service paperboard, Promina tobacco paperboard and Tango Advantage for the Commercial Print market. Our improved product mix, higher prices and leaner cost structure drove higher operating margin rates across our Packaging Businesses, as well as in Specialty Chemicals and Consumer & Office Products. The result is third quarter adjusted operating profit growth of 11% to $171 million and an adjusted operating margin of 11%, both new high watermarks for MWV. 
SG&A as a percentage of sales was up modestly over the prior year. This is the result of a couple of factors. The first is for investments associated with new systems and processes to realign our European operations consistent with our focus around end markets. Second factor is related to investments we are making to accelerate profitable growth, including opportunities we have in emerging markets to continue to drive the very strong growth we're generating today, as well as investments in innovative new products and our commercial organization. 
Our all-in tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of 2% due to a number of discrete items required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to be recorded in the quarter. As a result and on this basis, we now expect the annual effective tax rate for the year to be 20%. However, from an operational perspective, which excludes all special and discrete items, we expect the normalized tax rate to be approximately 28% for the year. 
Our cash performance during the third quarter was excellent. Cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $270 million was driven by higher earnings and continued improvement in working capital efficiency. During the quarter, we generated $125 million of free cash flow, defined as cash after CapEx and dividends. We ended the quarter with $774 million of cash, which is an increase of $115 million from the last quarter. We maintained our disciplined and balanced approach to cash deployment. We repurchased about $100 million of our 2012 debentures, leaving us with maturities of about $220 million. 
We also repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock for $60 million in the open market. These actions were funded by the proceeds from the sale of the Media business and existing cash reserves. We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic with our cash resources, including bolt-on acquisition opportunities to augment positions in growing global markets with attractive businesses. 
Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Across our markets, we see generally stable demand trends but at levels that are below what we saw before the global recession. We continue to build momentum in our markets and gain confidence in our ability to drive performance improvement as we continue to focus on high-return products and markets and deliver cost savings to the bottom line. 
The share gains we've earned for our higher-margin products, our investments in emerging markets in recent as well as future new product launches, position us well for continued profitable growth in our Packaging business going forward. Current macroeconomic trends, particularly in North America and Europe, remain challenging. However, at current levels of demand, we expect to continue our strong year-over-year margin and earnings improvement trajectory in the fourth quarter. 
Taking a closer look at our segments and starting with the Packaging Resources segment, earnings will be well above the year-ago fourth quarter. Backlogs remain above normal seasonal levels at five to six weeks, with demand remaining solid in food, food service, tobacco and beverage markets, as well as in key markets in Brazil. Continued mix and price improvement, productivity gains, increased profitability from Rigesa will be the main drivers of the segment's expected stronger performance. Partially offsetting these factors will be higher year-over-year input costs, particularly for freight and certain key raw materials such as fiber and OCC. 
In the Consumer Solutions segment, profit is expected to be well above year-ago levels. Demand remains stable across our key markets, including personal care, home and garden and beverage, and we will see some volume growth for Shellpak with the addition of a new drug and new customers during the fourth quarter. There'll also be a positive impact from improved productivity in this segment during the fourth quarter. 
In the Consumer & Office Products business, the planning and calendar season will be solid and the initial back-to-school selling in Brazil has gotten off to a good start. As such, segment profits will be comparable to last year's very strong results. 
In the Specialty Chemicals segment, profits will be well above the year-ago fourth quarter. Continued strong demand across all product lines and productivity gains will be the main drivers of the improvement. 
In our Community Development and Land Management business, market conditions for rural land sales remain weak, and the ultimate level of sales and earnings are difficult to forecast. However, we do expect a more normal level of sales in the fourth quarter based on the current pipeline of transactions. We continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunities in both our rural land program, as well as the excellent progress we're making in our industrial and commercial development properties. 
With that, I'll turn it back to John."

Certain markets like asphalt, you know, paving those go down. So we will be stronger year-on-year but sequentially weaker than the third quarter. In addition, we've got two outages in the third quarter at major facilities so that will impact us as well. But we expect a solid improvement year-on-year. As we look to next year, as John said, we believe that the results we're seeing are sustainable. They're being driven by productivity, by the globalization of the business as we move particularly in the emerging markets and really our innovation in new products. And what's been driving the performance of this business for the last two years are those three things, and we think that will certainly continue to go into next year."

We would expect with opportunities we're evaluating in Brazil to grow that platform and to ride the curve and indeed leave the curve of the tremendous growth that is underway in Brazil today, with the good economic leadership that we're seeing in that country and how it's being specifically manifest in the growth of the middle class in that country. More broadly, as we look at the so-called Rigesa platform, we see an opportunity in the nearer term to use it and its brand franchise to team up with the MWV brand franchise to participate much more broadly in the growth of a series of packaging markets that we have participated in, in a modest fashion but we would expect to do so more broadly, whether it's beauty and personal care, food market, beverage markets among others.

I think as Mark Rajkowski indicated in his prepared comments, we have a bias towards smaller bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions. And as we look at those things, we can extend, stay ahead of the growth but participate in a manner that ensures that we are able to keep our eye first on providing the solutions that our customers value, thus ensuring that we keep our eye on expanding those margins that the first part of your question spoke to. And we are going to be very disciplined in how we do that. So it's less about scale than it is looking for ways in a disciplined and sustained fashion to capitalize on this very significant profitable growth opportunities that exist. With respect to the part of your question that dealt with would we move into new areas. One, it would certainly, we'd look hard at new geographies, the countries I mentioned earlier among others. And where the opportunities for a profitable participation, again, in the targeted end markets that we've reviewed with you, I'll point to potentials with other materials to round out the breadth of capabilities that we can bring to our customers. We will look at those as well. But our focus in packaging, you can be sure, will not stray from the end markets that we really worked to understand and where we see very significant growth potential."

So there's a bit of a balanced view that we're seeing with our customers. Nonetheless, what we are seeing is a recognition that investing in their brand is the most important way that they can insurance they are growing profitably and capturing that all-important share relative to their competition. So there is good investment in the brands and when that occurs, there is logical good investment in the importance of Packaging and Packaging Solutions to support those brands, and that's what we're focused on."

As you noted, and I think you've seen, we have invested in recent years in the back end of the facility.

In the third quarter, the MWV organization's execution of our value-based strategy continued to deliver stronger, more sustainable earnings performance from each of our businesses. This progress is particularly apparent in our market-focused strategic business units for Packaging, whose revenues represent the principal output of our efficient paperboard converting and injection molding manufacturing system. 
With these market-focused business units, we're building new and deeper partnerships with customers, improving the overall mix of high-value products and packaging solutions and achieving share gains in targeted, attractive end markets and geographies. This progress is the foundation for MWV's continuing transformation and is contributing soundly to the company's improved performance and our very strong prospects for profitable growth, just as our similar strategies in our Specialty Chemicals, Consumer & Office Products and Community Development and Land Management businesses. 
Some highlights from the quarter include adjusted earnings per share of $0.63, a 4% volume growth from core products, a 28% increase in earnings from our Packaging businesses, a remarkable 83% profit increase from our Specialty Chemicals business and the sale of our Media Packaging business. 
With those highlights in mind, let me provide some details on the progress we're making in each of our packaging end markets, progress that we expect will continue to drive improvement across our packaging platform. 
Turning first to the beverage market. In the global beverage markets, trends are flat to slightly down in the mature markets of North America and Europe but the opportunities are very large in emerging markets, especially across Asia and Latin America. Our beverage packaging business has outpaced these trends for several quarters, with sales volume roughly the same year-over-year in North America and Europe and double-digit growth in emerging markets. 
We are leveraging our global footprint and systems value proposition to grow along with customers in emerging markets by offering better speed-to-market, increased productivity for their operations and more product flexibility, and our pipeline for both innovation and high-end machinery solutions in this business is very strong. 
In the large global food and food services markets, our business team is working directly with brand owners and retailers to specify MWV paperboard solutions for frozen food packaging, ready-to-eat meals and hot drink cups. Our focus on these demanding applications help generate strong double-digit sales and profit growth in these markets during the quarter. 
Looking forward, the beneficial environmental features of our new MWare line of paperboard for compostable cups and other food service products have generated excellent potential for participation in global quick serve restaurant chains. And we recently launched a new product called Captivate. Captivate is a shelf-ready and shopper-friendly packaging solution for canned goods, pet food, frozen juice, yogurt and other consumer goods. It delivers benefits for the brand owner, the retail operator and the shopper, with a billboard effect on crowded store shelves, supply-chain efficiencies and shrinkage or theft reduction benefits and a better overall shopping experience for consumers. Captivate is a great example of the way we are using brand and consumer insights to develop innovation in packaging. And in addition to applications in the retail food market, it has strong potential in the beverage and healthcare markets as well. 
Turning to our Healthcare business, we're focused on extending our leading position in value-added adherence packaging. Demand for Shellpak was steady in the third quarter, and we are adding a new drug to the program with our biggest customer, Wal-Mart, that will increase volume by about 15% beginning this December. 
We are also beginning a partnership with Kroger on an initial launch of Shellpak for its Health Matters prescription drug program. This partnership with Kroger will include educational materials for pharmacists and patients, as well as in-store promotions, and we expect to be able to demonstrate significant sales lift with the switch to Shellpak for many of its generic prescription offerings. 
In the beauty and personal care market, we had another increase in overall revenues during the third quarter as we gained share for both our airless dispensers and fragrance pumps. We doubled volumes of our airless dispensers for skin care during the quarter and had a 45% growth in the fragrance product sales. There, we launched a one-of-a-kind customized product for the new Voyage d'Hermès fragrance line, a sustainability solution that we developed in partnership with one of the world's most admired luxury brands. 
As the home and garden busy season came to a close, we posted very strong performance for our core trigger sprayers and custom applicators. We're very pleased with the continued strength of our next-generation aerosol sprayers as we're capturing a larger share of business from key global customers such as Procter & Gamble, Unilever and SC Johnson. And we have strategic initiatives underway in this business that will strengthen our position for further growth in Europe and emerging markets. 
In the global tobacco market, our strategy is to focus on the premium and ultra premium categories, and our sales continue to increase in several markets around the world, even as they decline here in the United States. Our global customer base increasingly recognizes and rewards us for the value of our new prominent tobacco paperboard solution, which delivers a unique combination of appearance, characteristics and performance consistency, along with environmental or sustainability benefits. Beyond this, we continue to help customers develop packaging solutions for growing categories such as smokeless tobacco products. 
We are also participating extensively across a number of markets in Brazil, served primarily by Rigesa. We've seen robust growth in that country that reflects the expansion and increased buying power of the middle class. We increased sales in Brazil during the quarter compared to the prior year, with especially strong double-digit growth in packaging for frozen meat, fresh produce and other food products. Rigesa's integrated corrugated packaging business continues to be a source of real competitive advantage. And the positive trajectory of Brazil's economy represents very good opportunity for all of our Packaging businesses, as well as for our market-leading school and office products. 
As I hope you can see, our organized approach to participating in targeted packaging markets through our strategic business units has contributed significantly to our current progress while also identifying new opportunities for future profitable growth. We have a disciplined focus on attractive, faster-growing and profitable global end markets where we can successfully leverage our knowledge and capabilities to develop deeper partnerships with customers based on industry-leading insights into consumer behavior, brand value and innovation and this is generating real progress and benefit. I'll now turn to Jim who will report on our operational and segment performance, and Mark will follow with a review of our financial metrics, as well as an outlook for the remaining months of this year. After that, we will turn to your questions. Jim?"

We continue to have success with our market participation strategies, and we continue to translate that success into improved operating results and financial performance. Overall, sales were up 3% during the third quarter compared to last",867,"Thank you, John. We continue to have success with our market participation strategies, and we continue to translate that success into improved operating results and financial performance. Overall, sales were up 3% during the third quarter compared to last year, with core volume up 4% as John mentioned. 
Over the past year, we have significantly changed our business mix, and our greatest gains were at the high-value products and solutions we've emphasized in our most profitable markets. Along with the widespread progress from our market participation strategy, we've also continued with an intense focus on cost reductions and operating and sourcing productivity across our manufacturing platform. That includes our paperboard mills, converting plants, injection molding facilities and chemical refineries. 
As part of the strategic cost management plan we've been executing, we achieved an additional $22 million in savings during the third quarter. We expect to reach the $250 million run rate target we set during the fourth quarter, along with the ongoing benefits of our sourcing initiatives and operating excellence program, these savings have been important contributors to our overall margin expansion. 
Overall, the transformation of our business model through execution of our value-added strategies drove adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and special items up 11% to a record $171 million. With those headlines in mind, representative of progress that we've made across our markets, I'd like to provide some quick details for each of our segments. Additional information is available on our press release and the slides that accompany this call. 
In the Packaging Resources segment, as John noted, our brand order engagement strategy has improved performance, with overall sales up 12% across our market-focused strategic business units. Shipments of bleached board were the same as last year, though we only ran five machines this quarter after shutting down the machine at our Evadale mill last year. And shipments of Coated Natural Kraft were up 14%, reflecting gains in retail food packaging and a return to more normal beverage ordering patterns compared with a weak third quarter in 2009. 
Segment profit was up by 23% to $91 million in the quarter, with higher sales and a richer product mix, as well as improved productivity despite a planned outage at our Covington mill that we did not have during the third quarter of 2009. We continue to run full at our mills, with order backlogs of five to six weeks while maintaining low inventory levels. 
In the Consumer Solutions segment, we are pleased with the step change in profitability we are achieving with our strengthened business model as segment operating profit increased 41% to $38 million or 8.3% of sales. Benefits of our improving business mix were visible with the completion of the sale of our Media Packaging business, and we continue to have better overall productivity performance in this segment. 
On the sales side, we made good progress during the quarter in many of the markets we serve in Consumer Solutions, several of which John has already identified. Even with this good volume growth, the impact of strategic business exits and unfavorable foreign currency exchange resulted in modestly slower sales in this segment. 
In the Consumer & Office Products segment, the back-to-school season in North America was in line with our expectations. There was good sell-through of our leading branded products, including increases for our new Early Learning line. Overall however, there was not as much retailer promotional activity for this category compared to last year and envelope sales continued to decline. So overall sales were down about 5% and earnings in this segment were essentially unchanged at $50 million. Looking ahead, order volume has been good in Brazil heading into what we believe will be a solid back-to-school season there. 
In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we continued to capitalize on the advantages we've created through timely investments in emerging markets, capacity expansion and new product development. We had strong sales of more profitable products for markets such as oil field chemicals and asphalt additives, especially in emerging markets and a rebound in auto carbons as well, as global auto production has increased. As a result, it was another record quarter, with sales up 22% and earnings up 83% to $44 million in this segment. 
In Community Development and Land Management, we continue to progress nicely with development activities at our industrial and commercial sites. We remain on time and on budget with the first industrial warehouse as part of our joint venture with the Rockefeller Group, and we expect TBC Corporation to take occupancy of the completed building in January. 
In a very difficult market for rural land sales, we maintained a disciplined approach to extracting value from our select properties, with a strong average price per acre during the quarter of over $2,800. Renewed economic concerns during the quarter delayed some closings, and as a result, our sales and earnings in the segment were lower than expected compared to a very strong performance last year. As the confidence of individual buyers increases, we expect a higher close rate on rural properties. 
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the third quarter. Mark?"
314312,113677532,82307,"MeadWestvaco Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","WestRock MWV, LLC","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Across the board, our third quarter operating results were very strong and reflect a more robust business model we've created for our company. We achieved record adjusted operating profit in the quarter, pushing our total through the first ni",1166,"Thanks, Jim. Across the board, our third quarter operating results were very strong and reflect a more robust business model we've created for our company. We achieved record adjusted operating profit in the quarter, pushing our total through the first nine months, well past what we achieved for all of 2009. 
Some highlights from the quarter include: significantly improved price and mix contribution to both our top and bottom line. This is the result of strong commercial execution in our targeted end markets; solid margin and profit growth, a continued benefit of our more competitive cost structure; excellent cash performance with cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $270 million; and balanced and disciplined cash deployment as we opportunistically repurchased stock and debt and continued to invest to profitably grow our businesses. 
I'll now provide more detail on our progress in these areas and then share our outlook for the fourth quarter. We generated 4% growth from our core products, where volumes improved 4%, and price and mix contributed an additional 5%, driven largely by strong performance in our packaging platform. This improvement was partially offset by the exit of lower-return product lines, unfavorable foreign exchange and lower land sales. 
Key revenue drivers during the third quarter were increased sales of higher-margin products, particularly in the global food market, home and garden market, targeted personal care products as well as in healthcare packaging. Sales from emerging markets were also a significant contributor. Rigesa's strong performance in Brazil and our airless dispenser and leveraging packaging in Asia drove 13% emerging markets sales growth across our Packaging businesses. Emerging markets now comprise more than a quarter of our total packaging sales. 
Continued momentum from new product innovation and commercialization was a key factor in our third quarter revenue growth, with contributions from Shellpak, our NoC fragrance and airless dispenser products, MWare compostable food service paperboard, Promina tobacco paperboard and Tango Advantage for the Commercial Print market. Our improved product mix, higher prices and leaner cost structure drove higher operating margin rates across our Packaging Businesses, as well as in Specialty Chemicals and Consumer & Office Products. The result is third quarter adjusted operating profit growth of 11% to $171 million and an adjusted operating margin of 11%, both new high watermarks for MWV. 
SG&A as a percentage of sales was up modestly over the prior year. This is the result of a couple of factors. The first is for investments associated with new systems and processes to realign our European operations consistent with our focus around end markets. Second factor is related to investments we are making to accelerate profitable growth, including opportunities we have in emerging markets to continue to drive the very strong growth we're generating today, as well as investments in innovative new products and our commercial organization. 
Our all-in tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of 2% due to a number of discrete items required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to be recorded in the quarter. As a result and on this basis, we now expect the annual effective tax rate for the year to be 20%. However, from an operational perspective, which excludes all special and discrete items, we expect the normalized tax rate to be approximately 28% for the year. 
Our cash performance during the third quarter was excellent. Cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $270 million was driven by higher earnings and continued improvement in working capital efficiency. During the quarter, we generated $125 million of free cash flow, defined as cash after CapEx and dividends. We ended the quarter with $774 million of cash, which is an increase of $115 million from the last quarter. We maintained our disciplined and balanced approach to cash deployment. We repurchased about $100 million of our 2012 debentures, leaving us with maturities of about $220 million. 
We also repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock for $60 million in the open market. These actions were funded by the proceeds from the sale of the Media business and existing cash reserves. We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic with our cash resources, including bolt-on acquisition opportunities to augment positions in growing global markets with attractive businesses. 
Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Across our markets, we see generally stable demand trends but at levels that are below what we saw before the global recession. We continue to build momentum in our markets and gain confidence in our ability to drive performance improvement as we continue to focus on high-return products and markets and deliver cost savings to the bottom line. 
The share gains we've earned for our higher-margin products, our investments in emerging markets in recent as well as future new product launches, position us well for continued profitable growth in our Packaging business going forward. Current macroeconomic trends, particularly in North America and Europe, remain challenging. However, at current levels of demand, we expect to continue our strong year-over-year margin and earnings improvement trajectory in the fourth quarter. 
Taking a closer look at our segments and starting with the Packaging Resources segment, earnings will be well above the year-ago fourth quarter. Backlogs remain above normal seasonal levels at five to six weeks, with demand remaining solid in food, food service, tobacco and beverage markets, as well as in key markets in Brazil. Continued mix and price improvement, productivity gains, increased profitability from Rigesa will be the main drivers of the segment's expected stronger performance. Partially offsetting these factors will be higher year-over-year input costs, particularly for freight and certain key raw materials such as fiber and OCC. 
In the Consumer Solutions segment, profit is expected to be well above year-ago levels. Demand remains stable across our key markets, including personal care, home and garden and beverage, and we will see some volume growth for Shellpak with the addition of a new drug and new customers during the fourth quarter. There'll also be a positive impact from improved productivity in this segment during the fourth quarter. 
In the Consumer & Office Products business, the planning and calendar season will be solid and the initial back-to-school selling in Brazil has gotten off to a good start. As such, segment profits will be comparable to last year's very strong results. 
In the Specialty Chemicals segment, profits will be well above the year-ago fourth quarter. Continued strong demand across all product lines and productivity gains will be the main drivers of the improvement. 
In our Community Development and Land Management business, market conditions for rural land sales remain weak, and the ultimate level of sales and earnings are difficult to forecast. However, we do expect a more normal level of sales in the fourth quarter based on the current pipeline of transactions. We continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunities in both our rural land program, as well as the excellent progress we're making in our industrial and commercial development properties. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

It's, without question, the market leader in Brazil and has provided us huge and sustained advantage, and with that, a platform for growth. We would expect with opportunities we're evaluating in Brazil to grow that platform and to ride the curve and indeed leave the curve of the tremendous growth that is underway in Brazil today, with the good economic leadership that we're seeing in that country and how it's being specifically manifest in the growth of the middle class in that country. More broadly, as we look at the so-called Rigesa platform, we see an opportunity in the nearer term to use it and its brand franchise to team up with the MWV brand franchise to participate much more broadly in the growth of a series of packaging markets that we have participated in, in a modest fashion but we would expect to do so more broadly, whether it's beauty and personal care, food market, beverage markets among others. So we see a strong brand franchise, a very profitable strong business and a country that is growing very nicely. We also see, just to round out the story, the opportunity now and over time for that business as we continue to expand it. In doing so, I would underscore, with a real disciplined eye on profitability, to be a leading participant in the export markets, not only within South America but quite possibly outside of South America."

So our interest in Brazil today predates and our interest in expanding in Brazil today predates some of the hot growth that we're seeing right now. Our thinking really cuts through the trajectory, recognizing that there's some hot stuff going on in that country and looks at the fundamentals and gives us good opportunity to leverage knowledge of the market, people, excellent team that we have there and the opportunities to grow with a sustained long-term bias in mind. So Brazil is definitely high on our list.

With the important market-based strategic work we've had underway with the growth and with the progress we're achieving in the growth opportunities we see, we are, as you would expect, actively evaluating on a continuing basis a range of opportunities to grow in the markets that we have targeted, both here in North America as well as around the world, all of which offer very attractive, profitable growth prospects. I think as Mark Rajkowski indicated in his prepared comments, we have a bias towards smaller bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions. And as we look at those things, we can extend, stay ahead of the growth but participate in a manner that ensures that we are able to keep our eye first on providing the solutions that our customers value, thus ensuring that we keep our eye on expanding those margins that the first part of your question spoke to. And we are going to be very disciplined in how we do that. So it's less about scale than it is looking for ways in a disciplined and sustained fashion to capitalize on the very significant profitable growth opportunities that exist.

In the third quarter, the MWV organization's execution of our value-based strategy continued to deliver stronger, more sustainable earnings performance from each of our businesses. This progress is particularly apparent in our market-focused strategic business units for Packaging, whose revenues represent the principal output of our efficient paperboard converting and injection molding manufacturing system. 
With these market-focused business units, we're building new and deeper partnerships with customers, improving the overall mix of high-value products and packaging solutions and achieving share gains in targeted, attractive end markets and geographies. This progress is the foundation for MWV's continuing transformation and is contributing soundly to the company's improved performance and our very strong prospects for profitable growth, just as our similar strategies in our Specialty Chemicals, Consumer & Office Products and Community Development and Land Management businesses. 
Some highlights from the quarter include adjusted earnings per share of $0.63, a 4% volume growth from core products, a 28% increase in earnings from our Packaging businesses, a remarkable 83% profit increase from our Specialty Chemicals business and the sale of our Media Packaging business. 
With those highlights in mind, let me provide some details on the progress we're making in each of our packaging end markets, progress that we expect will continue to drive improvement across our packaging platform. 
Turning first to the beverage market. In the global beverage markets, trends are flat to slightly down in the mature markets of North America and Europe but the opportunities are very large in emerging markets, especially across Asia and Latin America. Our beverage packaging business has outpaced these trends for several quarters, with sales volume roughly the same year-over-year in North America and Europe and double-digit growth in emerging markets. 
We are leveraging our global footprint and systems value proposition to grow along with customers in emerging markets by offering better speed-to-market, increased productivity for their operations and more product flexibility, and our pipeline for both innovation and high-end machinery solutions in this business is very strong. 
In the large global food and food services markets, our business team is working directly with brand owners and retailers to specify MWV paperboard solutions for frozen food packaging, ready-to-eat meals and hot drink cups. Our focus on these demanding applications help generate strong double-digit sales and profit growth in these markets during the quarter. 
Looking forward, the beneficial environmental features of our new MWare line of paperboard for compostable cups and other food service products have generated excellent potential for participation in global quick serve restaurant chains. And we recently launched a new product called Captivate. Captivate is a shelf-ready and shopper-friendly packaging solution for canned goods, pet food, frozen juice, yogurt and other consumer goods. It delivers benefits for the brand owner, the retail operator and the shopper, with a billboard effect on crowded store shelves, supply-chain efficiencies and shrinkage or theft reduction benefits and a better overall shopping experience for consumers. Captivate is a great example of the way we are using brand and consumer insights to develop innovation in packaging. And in addition to applications in the retail food market, it has strong potential in the beverage and healthcare markets as well. 
Turning to our Healthcare business, we're focused on extending our leading position in value-added adherence packaging. Demand for Shellpak was steady in the third quarter, and we are adding a new drug to the program with our biggest customer, Wal-Mart, that will increase volume by about 15% beginning this December. 
We are also beginning a partnership with Kroger on an initial launch of Shellpak for its Health Matters prescription drug program. This partnership with Kroger will include educational materials for pharmacists and patients, as well as in-store promotions, and we expect to be able to demonstrate significant sales lift with the switch to Shellpak for many of its generic prescription offerings. 
In the beauty and personal care market, we had another increase in overall revenues during the third quarter as we gained share for both our airless dispensers and fragrance pumps. We doubled volumes of our airless dispensers for skin care during the quarter and had a 45% growth in the fragrance product sales. There, we launched a one-of-a-kind customized product for the new Voyage d'Hermès fragrance line, a sustainability solution that we developed in partnership with one of the world's most admired luxury brands. 
As the home and garden busy season came to a close, we posted very strong performance for our core trigger sprayers and custom applicators. We're very pleased with the continued strength of our next-generation aerosol sprayers as we're capturing a larger share of business from key global customers such as Procter & Gamble, Unilever and SC Johnson. And we have strategic initiatives underway in this business that will strengthen our position for further growth in Europe and emerging markets. 
In the global tobacco market, our strategy is to focus on the premium and ultra premium categories, and our sales continue to increase in several markets around the world, even as they decline here in the United States. Our global customer base increasingly recognizes and rewards us for the value of our new prominent tobacco paperboard solution, which delivers a unique combination of appearance, characteristics and performance consistency, along with environmental or sustainability benefits. Beyond this, we continue to help customers develop packaging solutions for growing categories such as smokeless tobacco products. 
We are also participating extensively across a number of markets in Brazil, served primarily by Rigesa. We've seen robust growth in that country that reflects the expansion and increased buying power of the middle class. We increased sales in Brazil during the quarter compared to the prior year, with especially strong double-digit growth in packaging for frozen meat, fresh produce and other food products. Rigesa's integrated corrugated packaging business continues to be a source of real competitive advantage. And the positive trajectory of Brazil's economy represents very good opportunity for all of our Packaging businesses, as well as for our market-leading school and office products. 
As I hope you can see, our organized approach to participating in targeted packaging markets through our strategic business units has contributed significantly to our current progress while also identifying new opportunities for future profitable growth. We have a disciplined focus on attractive, faster-growing and profitable global end markets where we can successfully leverage our knowledge and capabilities to develop deeper partnerships with customers based on industry-leading insights into consumer behavior, brand value and innovation and this is generating real progress and benefit. I'll now turn to Jim who will report on our operational and segment performance, and Mark will follow with a review of our financial metrics, as well as an outlook for the remaining months of this year. After that, we will turn to your questions. Jim?

We continue to have success with our market participation strategies, and we continue to translate that success into improved operating results and financial performance. Overall, sales were up 3% during the third quarter compared to last year, with core volume up 4% as John mentioned. 
Over the past year, we have significantly changed our business mix, and our greatest gains were at the high-value products and solutions we've emphasized in our most profitable markets. Along with the widespread progress from our market participation strategy, we've also continued with an intense focus on cost reductions and operating and sourcing productivity across our manufacturing platform. That includes our paperboard mills, converting plants, injection molding facilities and chemical refineries. 
As part of the strategic cost management plan we've been executing, we achieved an additional $22 million in savings during the third quarter. We expect to reach the $250 million run rate target we set during the fourth quarter, along with the ongoing benefits of our sourcing initiatives and operating excellence program, these savings have been important contributors to our overall margin expansion. 
Overall, the transformation of our business model through execution of our value-added strategies drove adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and special items up 11% to a record $171 million. With those headlines in mind, representative of progress that we've made across our markets, I'd like to provide some quick details for each of our segments. Additional information is available on our press release and the slides that accompany this call. 
In the Packaging Resources segment, as John noted, our brand order engagement strategy has improved performance, with overall sales up 12% across our market-focused strategic business units. Shipments of bleached board were the same as last year, though we only ran five machines this quarter after shutting down the machine at our Evadale mill last year. And shipments of Coated Natural Kraft were up 14%, reflecting gains in retail food packaging and a return to more normal beverage ordering patterns compared with a weak third quarter in 2009. 
Segment profit was up by 23% to $91 million in the quarter, with higher sales and a richer product mix, as well as improved productivity despite a planned outage at our Covington mill that we did not have during the third quarter of 2009. We continue to run full at our mills, with order backlogs of five to six weeks while maintaining low inventory levels. 
In the Consumer Solutions segment, we are pleased with the step change in profitability we are achieving with our strengthened business model as segment operating profit increased 41% to $38 million or 8.3% of sales. Benefits of our improving business mix were visible with the completion of the sale of our Media Packaging business, and we continue to have better overall productivity performance in this segment. 
On the sales side, we made good progress during the quarter in many of the markets we serve in Consumer Solutions, several of which John has already identified. Even with this good volume growth, the impact of strategic business exits and unfavorable foreign currency exchange resulted in modestly slower sales in this segment. 
In the Consumer & Office Products segment, the back-to-school season in North America was in line with our expectations. There was good sell-through of our leading branded products, including increases for our new Early Learning line. Overall however, there was not as much retailer promotional activity for this category compared to last year and envelope sales continued to decline. So overall sales were down about 5% and earnings in this segment were essentially unchanged at $50 million. Looking ahead, order volume has been good in Brazil heading into what we believe will be a solid back-to-school season there. 
In the Specialty Chemicals segment, we continued to capitalize on the advantages we've created through timely investments in emerging markets, capacity expansion and new product development. We had strong sales of more profitable products for markets such as oil field chemicals and asphalt additives, especially in emerging markets and a rebound in auto carbons as well, as global auto production has increased. As a result, it was another record quarter, with sales up 22% and earnings up 83% to $44 million in this segment. 
In Community Development and Land Management, we continue to progress nicely with development activities at our industrial and commercial sites. We remain on time and on budget with the first industrial warehouse as part of our joint venture with the Rockefeller Group, and we expect TBC Corporation to take occupancy of the completed building in January. 
In a very difficult market for rural land sales, we maintained a disciplined approach to extracting value from our select properties, with a strong average price per acre during the quarter of over $2,800. Renewed economic concerns during the quarter delayed some closings, and as a result, our sales and earnings in the segment were lower than expected compared to a very strong performance last year. As the confidence of individual buyers increases, we expect a higher close rate on rural properties. 
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss some of our financial metrics for the third quarter. Mark?

Across the board, our third quarter operating results were very strong and reflect a more robust business model we've created for our company. We achieved record adjusted operating profit in the quarter, pushing our total through the first ni",1166,"Thanks, Jim. Across the board, our third quarter operating results were very strong and reflect a more robust business model we've created for our company. We achieved record adjusted operating profit in the quarter, pushing our total through the first nine months, well past what we achieved for all of 2009. 
Some highlights from the quarter include: significantly improved price and mix contribution to both our top and bottom line. This is the result of strong commercial execution in our targeted end markets; solid margin and profit growth, a continued benefit of our more competitive cost structure; excellent cash performance with cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $270 million; and balanced and disciplined cash deployment as we opportunistically repurchased stock and debt and continued to invest to profitably grow our businesses. 
I'll now provide more detail on our progress in these areas and then share our outlook for the fourth quarter. We generated 4% growth from our core products, where volumes improved 4%, and price and mix contributed an additional 5%, driven largely by strong performance in our packaging platform. This improvement was partially offset by the exit of lower-return product lines, unfavorable foreign exchange and lower land sales. 
Key revenue drivers during the third quarter were increased sales of higher-margin products, particularly in the global food market, home and garden market, targeted personal care products as well as in healthcare packaging. Sales from emerging markets were also a significant contributor. Rigesa's strong performance in Brazil and our airless dispenser and leveraging packaging in Asia drove 13% emerging markets sales growth across our Packaging businesses. Emerging markets now comprise more than a quarter of our total packaging sales. 
Continued momentum from new product innovation and commercialization was a key factor in our third quarter revenue growth, with contributions from Shellpak, our NoC fragrance and airless dispenser products, MWare compostable food service paperboard, Promina tobacco paperboard and Tango Advantage for the Commercial Print market. Our improved product mix, higher prices and leaner cost structure drove higher operating margin rates across our Packaging Businesses, as well as in Specialty Chemicals and Consumer & Office Products. The result is third quarter adjusted operating profit growth of 11% to $171 million and an adjusted operating margin of 11%, both new high watermarks for MWV. 
SG&A as a percentage of sales was up modestly over the prior year. This is the result of a couple of factors. The first is for investments associated with new systems and processes to realign our European operations consistent with our focus around end markets. Second factor is related to investments we are making to accelerate profitable growth, including opportunities we have in emerging markets to continue to drive the very strong growth we're generating today, as well as investments in innovative new products and our commercial organization. 
Our all-in tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of 2% due to a number of discrete items required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to be recorded in the quarter. As a result and on this basis, we now expect the annual effective tax rate for the year to be 20%. However, from an operational perspective, which excludes all special and discrete items, we expect the normalized tax rate to be approximately 28% for the year. 
Our cash performance during the third quarter was excellent. Cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $270 million was driven by higher earnings and continued improvement in working capital efficiency. During the quarter, we generated $125 million of free cash flow, defined as cash after CapEx and dividends. We ended the quarter with $774 million of cash, which is an increase of $115 million from the last quarter. We maintained our disciplined and balanced approach to cash deployment. We repurchased about $100 million of our 2012 debentures, leaving us with maturities of about $220 million. 
We also repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of common stock for $60 million in the open market. These actions were funded by the proceeds from the sale of the Media business and existing cash reserves. We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic with our cash resources, including bolt-on acquisition opportunities to augment positions in growing global markets with attractive businesses. 
Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Across our markets, we see generally stable demand trends but at levels that are below what we saw before the global recession. We continue to build momentum in our markets and gain confidence in our ability to drive performance improvement as we continue to focus on high-return products and markets and deliver cost savings to the bottom line. 
The share gains we've earned for our higher-margin products, our investments in emerging markets in recent as well as future new product launches, position us well for continued profitable growth in our Packaging business going forward. Current macroeconomic trends, particularly in North America and Europe, remain challenging. However, at current levels of demand, we expect to continue our strong year-over-year margin and earnings improvement trajectory in the fourth quarter. 
Taking a closer look at our segments and starting with the Packaging Resources segment, earnings will be well above the year-ago fourth quarter. Backlogs remain above normal seasonal levels at five to six weeks, with demand remaining solid in food, food service, tobacco and beverage markets, as well as in key markets in Brazil. Continued mix and price improvement, productivity gains, increased profitability from Rigesa will be the main drivers of the segment's expected stronger performance. Partially offsetting these factors will be higher year-over-year input costs, particularly for freight and certain key raw materials such as fiber and OCC. 
In the Consumer Solutions segment, profit is expected to be well above year-ago levels. Demand remains stable across our key markets, including personal care, home and garden and beverage, and we will see some volume growth for Shellpak with the addition of a new drug and new customers during the fourth quarter. There'll also be a positive impact from improved productivity in this segment during the fourth quarter. 
In the Consumer & Office Products business, the planning and calendar season will be solid and the initial back-to-school selling in Brazil has gotten off to a good start. As such, segment profits will be comparable to last year's very strong results. 
In the Specialty Chemicals segment, profits will be well above the year-ago fourth quarter. Continued strong demand across all product lines and productivity gains will be the main drivers of the improvement. 
In our Community Development and Land Management business, market conditions for rural land sales remain weak, and the ultimate level of sales and earnings are difficult to forecast. However, we do expect a more normal level of sales in the fourth quarter based on the current pipeline of transactions. We continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunities in both our rural land program, as well as the excellent progress we're making in our industrial and commercial development properties. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.

To summarize, MWV's performance during the third quarter reflects the significant momentum we have generated by focusing on our participation in targeted end markets and the directly-related execution of our value-based strategy. But the changes we have made are bigger and more sustainable than any single quarter's results. What you've seen from MWV over the last almost two years is the direct result of an ongoing transformation in our business model and in the way we do business, backed up by a list of marketplace successes and earnings performances that bear out that approach. 
Recognizing that uncertainties continue to exist in the global economy, MWV shareholders can have confidence as we do, that we will continue to capitalize on the strengths we've built with our value-based market participation strategies and that we can sustain and bolster our relative performance as a global packaging leader. 
We'll now be happy to address whatever questions you have this morning.

In other words, was there something unusually good this year that we might not see next year?

Rigesa's been a great business for us for a good many years. And as I emphasized in my prepared comments, it's integrated strategy from the forest [forestland] right through the high-quality corrugated Packaging business. It's, without question, the market leader in Brazil and has provided us huge and sustained advantage, and with that, a platform for growth. We would expect with opportunities we're evaluating in Brazil to grow that platform and to ride the curve and indeed leave the curve of the tremendous growth that is underway in Brazil today, with the good economic leadership that we're seeing in that country and how it's being specifically manifest in the growth of the middle class in that country. More broadly, as we look at the so-called Rigesa platform, we see an opportunity in the nearer term to use it and its brand franchise to team up with the MWV brand franchise to participate much more broadly in the growth of a series of packaging markets that we have participated in, in a modest fashion but we would expect to do so more broadly, whether it's beauty and personal care, food market, beverage markets among others. So we see a strong brand franchise, a very profitable strong business and a country that is growing very nicely. We also see, just to round out the story, the opportunity now and over time for that business as we continue to expand it. In doing so, I would underscore, with a real disciplined eye on profitability, to be a leading participant in the export markets, not only within South America but quite possibly outside of South America.

We understand when things are good and when things aren't so good. So our interest in Brazil today predates and our interest in expanding in Brazil today predates some of the hot growth that we're seeing right now. Our thinking really cuts through the trajectory, recognizing that there's some hot stuff going on in that country and looks at the fundamentals and gives us good opportunity to leverage knowledge of the market, people, excellent team that we have there and the opportunities to grow with a sustained long-term bias in mind.

China is obviously a market that's important to us. But India holds a very attractive appeal as well, and we've invested in building some modest positions there and importantly, in understanding market developments in that country as well.

With the important market-based strategic work we've had underway with the growth and with the progress we're achieving in the growth opportunities we see, we are, as you would expect, actively evaluating on a continuing basis a range of opportunities to grow in the markets that we have targeted, both here in North America as well as around the world, all of which offer very attractive, profitable growth prospects. I think as Mark Rajkowski indicated in his prepared comments, we have a bias towards smaller bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions. And as we look at those things, we can extend, stay ahead of the growth but participate in a manner that ensures that we are able to keep our eye first on providing the solutions that our customers value, thus ensuring that we keep our eye on expanding those margins that the first part of your question spoke to. And we are going to be very disciplined in how we do that. So it's less about scale than it is looking for ways in a disciplined and sustained fashion to capitalize on the very significant profitable growth opportunities that exist. With respect to the part of your question that dealt with would we move into new areas. One, it would certainly, we'd look hard at new geographies, the countries I mentioned earlier among others. And where the opportunities for a profitable participation, again, in the targeted end markets that we've reviewed with you, I'll point to potentials with other materials to round out the breadth of capabilities that we can bring to our customers. We will look at those as well. But our focus in packaging, you can be sure, will not stray from the end markets that we really worked to understand and where we see very significant growth potential.

So there's a bit of a balanced view that we're seeing with our customers. Nonetheless, what we are seeing is a recognition that investing in their brand is the most important way that they can insure that they are growing profitably and capturing that all-important share relative to their competition. So there is good investment in the brands and when that occurs, there is logical good investment in the importance of Packaging and Packaging Solutions to support those brands, and that's what we're focused on.

So if we do decide to proceed with the expansion that we've talked about, the infrastructure, clearly, is very much in place to support that.
