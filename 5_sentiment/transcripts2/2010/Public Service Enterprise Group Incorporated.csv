As you are aware, we did release our fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings statements earlier this morning. The release and attachments are posted on our website at pseg.com, under the Investors section. We also posted a series of slides that would be available to you that detail operating results by company for the quarter.Our 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2009, is expected to be filed next week, probably by mid to late week. I am not going to read the full disclaimer statement or the comments we have on the difference between operating earnings and GAAP results, but I please ask that you read those comments contained in our slides and on our website. The disclaimer statement regards forward-looking statements, detailing the number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made therein. And although we may elect to update forward-looking statements from time to time, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimate changes, unless required by applicable Securities laws.As you know, we also present a commentary with regard to the difference between operating earnings and net income reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States. PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of operating earnings provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of metrics to help shareholders understand performance trends. I'm now going to turn the call over to Ralph Izzo, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Public Service Enterprise Group. Joining Ralph on the call is Caroline Dorsa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of their remarks, there will be time for your questions. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Thank you."

Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share, which is the same as what we earned in the year ago period. The result",731,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning and thanks everyone for joining us today on this call. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share, which is the same as what we earned in the year ago period. The results for the quarter brought operating earnings for 2009 to $3.12 per share. This is to be compared to $3.03 per share earned in 2008. The full year results fell in the middle of the earnings guidance to $3 to $3.25 per share we set for 2009. These results were achieved in the face of what can only be characterized as very challenging markets. A weak economy and abnormal weather affected demand in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. In PSEG Power, our nuclear and combined cycle fleet of generating assets produced at record levels at 2009. Their strong performance and availability helped offset the impact of lower power prices on our earnings. Earnings were also aided by our employees' response to weaker-than-anticipated demand with the reduction in expenses. At PSEG Energy Holdings, we were able to take advantage of the financing environment to negotiate the termination of 12 cross-border leases, including two in the fourth quarter. These deals substantially reduced our potential tax and financial risk. Clearly, our 2009 results demonstrate the importance of a balanced portfolio of asset. The credit for our results, however, belongs to our employees. It is worth repeating. Their commitment to the our shared goal of operational excellence and their responsiveness to a call to control costs was a major contributor to our result. Cost-reduction programs implemented throughout the organization, including support from our union membership, will continue to be an important contributions to our operating result. For 2010, we are forecasting operating earnings will fall within a range of $3 to $3.25 per share. At the moment, we are not providing you with a breakdown of operating earnings by subsidiary as has been our custom in prior years. We intend to provide that guidance at the conclusion of PSE&G's distribution rate case. Now let me take a step back for a moment to assess the business environment. The providers of energy in today's market face many challenges in light of changing fuel prices and the need to meet increased governmental mandates. I am confident that PSEG can meet the challenges of today's demanding market. We are working toward improving on our operationally excellent, low-carbon integrated business model that provides energies to customers in a cost-efficient way and meet our shareholder requirements for attractive return. PSEG's capital commitments are focused on maintaining the availability of critical generating units in constrained markets, expanding our investment in renewable solar energy projects at attractive risk-adjusted returns and increasing our nuclear footprint through upgrades of existing capacity as we also improve the reliability and functionality of our distribution and transmission infrastructure. We are well down this path. Regulatory approvals received by PSE&G in 2009 support the investment of $1.4 billion to improve reliability, help customers save energy and expand the use of solar energy. These approvals provide us with prompt cost recovery and a reasonable return. Also, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities' recent decision on our $750 million investment in the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line will improve reliability in the northern part of New Jersey. We hope our past results and our ongoing passion help you to understand our commitment to providing excellence in operations into the future. The Board of Directors recently approved a 3% increase in the quarterly common dividend rate to $0.3425 per share for the first quarter, which represents an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.37 per share. The Board's action represents the seventh consecutive annual increase in the dividend and the continuation of a 103-year history of paying an annual dividend to shareholders. We are committed to improving returns on operations, investing at levels that support our long-term growth and then sharing this return. We look forward to seeing many of you at our annual conference for the financial community on February 26. As we have in the past, we will discuss the strategic drivers of our business, public policy that matters to our industry, our strategy to position PSEG for a changing energy environment, as well as the specific market and cost factors that influence us. And now I'll turn the call over to Caroline."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share versus operating earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $3.12 per share versus operating earnings for 2008 of $3.03 per share. Just to remind you, our operating earnings exclude the impact of the change in value in our NDT investments and obligations, as well as other charges related to the future decommissioning, and any changes in the value of transactions related to our generating assets that don't qualify for hedge accounting, that is their mark-to-market. We also exclude the impact of adjustments to lease reserves, which I'll come back to later in the discussion.  As we've also done throughout the year, we've adjusted the prior-year numbers to make your comparisons easy to follow.  Slide 4 provides a reconciliation of operating incomes to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 10, PSEG Power provides the largest contribution to earnings. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.47 per share compared with $0.49 per share last year. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.13 per share compared to $0.15 per share last year. PSEG Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $0.03 per share compared with a marginal contribution in the year-ago quarter. The parent company reported a loss of $0.01 a share compared with a loss of $0.02 per share in last year's quarter. We have provided you with the waterfall charts on Slides 12 and 13 that take you through the net changes in the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year operating earnings comparisons by major business. But now I'd like to review each company in a little more detail.Starting with Power, as shown on Slide 15, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.47 per share compared with $0.49 per share a year ago. Please note that Power's results for the quarter, the year and the results for the year-ago period now reflect the impact of the October 1 transfer of the Texas gas-fired assets from Holdings to Power. Power's operating earnings for the quarter brought 2009's full year operating earnings to $1.2 billion in line with our guidance. The operating environment, as Ralph said, in the quarter, continue to be challenged by low power prices, as well as the weak economy, although not as challenging as what we experienced in the third quarter when as you recall, weather compounded our difficulties. Power's results for the fourth quarter were affected by those weak power prices, which more than offset an 8% increase in generation. The decline in margin was experienced in the Texas and New York, New England market, $0.02 a share in each market. Margins in PJM, however, increased $0.02 a share, a 3.5% increase quarter-over-quarter. The PJM assets continue to benefit from higher hedge-related prices and a 2% increase in nuclear generation, which together helped to offset a decline in BGS-related volume. The weak economy continued to affect the level of demand, which reduced earnings by an estimated $0.01 per share. The decline in BGS' volumes also reflects the effect of customer migration, which we estimate reduced earnings by $0.02 per share in the quarter. And for the year, we estimate customer migration away from BGS cost us about $0.08 per share.  The earnings impact for the full year reflects a small impact for the first half of the year, or $0.02 per share over that first full six-month period for migration, the third quarter impact of $0.04 per share that we spoke about on the third quarter call and the fourth quarter impact of $0.02 per share.  Despite all of these factors across the year, PGM margins were still up 9% for the year, reflecting our dispatch flexibility and hedging strategies, which offset a decline in demand. Earnings comparisons were also affected by an increase in O&M, depreciation and other miscellaneous items for $0.03 per share. But note that for the full year, Power's O&M expense was, in fact, 2% lower than a year ago. As anticipated, we earned $0.01 per share on trading activities, and coupled with gains this quarter associated with contracting activities, including Power's participation in full requirement auction, these activities together increased earnings by $0.03 per share. As I mentioned, Generation increased 8% during the quarter. Power's nuclear and combined cycle fleet each experienced record levels of output. Generation from the combined cycle fleet, including Texas, increased 29.8% in the quarter. Excluding Texas, output from the combined cycle units in New York and New Jersey increased 47%. The nuclear fleet operated at 92% capacity factor in the quarter versus 91.3% in last year's fourth quarter, bringing the capacity factor for the full year to 93.4%, record performance for the year and in line with our expectations as outlined on the third quarter earnings call.Generation from Power's New Jersey coal units increased during the fourth quarter as compared to earlier in the year as an increase in the cost of gas relative to coal improved the economic dispatch of these units. On an annual basis, as you can see on the slide, coal-fired generation was still below last year's level of output. The increase in generation from the coal-fired stations this quarter, coupled with low pricing, reduced average gross margins for the PJM's New York and New England fleet to $51 per megawatt hour in the quarter from $55 per megawatt hour in last year's quarter, again in line with our expectations. The average gross margin earned on the Texas combined cycle generation declined to $7 per megawatt hour in the quarter from $16 per megawatt hour last year as a result of the decline spark spreads, which we've talked about before. The growth in output during the fourth quarter brought outputs for the full year to 59.8 terawatt hours, 5% decline from 2008's level of generation. Nuclear fleet provided approximately 51% of Power's total generation. The strong performance from nuclear, coupled with lower gas costs, reported annual average gross margins on the PJM's New York and New England fleet of $60 per megawatt hour for the year, slightly higher than the $58 per megawatt hour we were forecasting at the start of the year. To summarize these drivers, we estimate Powers' earnings for the full year were hurt by weak economic conditions, about $0.03 per share; cooler-than-normal weather during the important summer months, about $0.02 per share; and as we said earlier, customer migration at about $0.08 per share. On the other side, we contracting and that dispatch flexibility of the PJM fleet helped results by about $0.08 per share. Now I'll turn to PSE&G.PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.13 per share compared with $0.15 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008, as shown on Slide 22. PSE&G's full year 2009 operating earnings were $321 million, also in line with our guidance. Gas margins declined in the fourth quarter by about $0.01 per share. The results were affected by warmer-than-normal weather in this year's fourth quarter compared with colder-than-normal weather experienced in the prior year. The reduction in gas margin was offset by an increase in transmission rates and higher appliance service margin, which together, added about $0.01 per share to earnings. Earnings comparisons were also hurt by an increase in pension expense, which more than offset a reduction in other operation and maintenance expenses and a lower tax rate. These items combined to reduce PSE&G's fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. Abnormal weather conditions and a weak economy hurt demand in 2009. During the fourth quarter, weather normalized electric demand declined 3.2%, resulting in a 2.5% decline in demand for the full year. Within that total, weather normalized demand from residential electric customers declined by 0.8% for the fourth quarter and 0.9% for the full year. For gas, weather normalized demand increased 1.1% in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 0.7% decline in sales for the full year. Trends in employment and housing tend to be pretty good barometers of the New Jersey economic condition, both are at multi-year lows, although we may not be experiencing a decline as fast as we did earlier in the year, we've not experienced just yet any uptick in growth.Another key developments at the utility, as you're probably aware, the regulatory calendar is full. PSE&G implemented a $23 million increase in transmission revenues effective January 1 as part of its formula rate treatment on increased investment. The New Jersey BPU approved PSE&G's $750 million investment in the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line on February 11 of this year. The BPU's decision represents a critical milestone in the regulatory approval process. PSE&G also updated its filing with the BPU for an increase in electric and gas revenues, totaling $222 million. This updated request reflects actual results for 12 months ended December 31 of 2009. The update represents an increase in electric revenues of $14 million and a reduction in gas revenues of $23 million from the May 2009 rate filings. PSE&G's request is based on an 11.25% return on equity and a 51.2% equity ratio. Following the normal process for this request, the BPU would be expected to issue a decision in May or June of this year with rates effective midyear. For 2009, for reference, operating earnings provided an earned return on equity of about 8% for our Distribution business and about 11% for our Transmission business.Next, let me turn to PSEG Energy Holdings. Energy Holdings reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.03 per share compared to operating earnings of about $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Holdings quarterly earnings were aided by the recognition of gains on the successful termination of two cross-border leases, which amounted to $0.02 per share. This growth also benefited from a reduction in O&M expenses and lower interest expense, which added $0.02 per share to earnings. A reduction in the value of our remaining international generation assets lowered earnings by $0.01 a share, and reduced our investment in that asset to a nominal level. The termination of the two leases in the fourth quarter brings the number of leases terminated to 13, 12 in 2009 and one in 2008. Our activity reduced our potential cash tax liability to $660 million. As we've discussed before, if we had not terminated any leases, our potential liability would have risen to more than $1.3 billion. So we have, in fact, cut our risk in half, and as we've said before, we've been using the proceeds from counterparties from those terminations to accomplish this risk reduction.In addition, we still have $320 million on deposit with the IRS to meet any potential tax liability, so think of that as an offset to the $660 million exposure. Also, we have reduced our reserve for lease exposures by $29 million after tax based on a reassessment of risks following the outcome of the favorable court decision late in 2009 for another utility. The net after-tax gain of $29 million is reflected in earnings from continuing operations, but not on operating earnings. In terms of 2010 outlook, as Ralph mentioned, we are providing operating earnings guidance for 2010 of $3 to $3.25 per share. We won't be providing operating earnings guidance by subsidiary until the conclusion of PSE&G's distribution rate case. Overall, our guidance is based on expectations of a modest improvement in demand and normal weather versus the very weak conditions experienced in 2009. We estimate the combination of abnormal weather conditions and a weak economy reduced our 2009 earnings by $0.08 per share at Power and PSE&G. However, 2009's operating earnings also benefited from the $0.13 per share of gains on the termination of leases, which we don't expect to see duplicated in the current year. Remember, we have only five leases less left and we do continue to actively manage them. Our ability to control growth and expenses and operate at top quartile levels of performance in many areas of our business provide support for our 2010 earnings guidance. We estimate our O&M, excluding the impact of regulatory recovery clauses for our company as a whole, will be flat year-over-year as it was for the company as a whole for 2009. Finally, a brief comment on financing activity, as you probably are aware, we remained fairly active in the fourth quarter. We eliminated the last piece of long-term debt at the parent with the redemption of $49 million of debt. PSE&G was able to take advantage of attractive debt markets to prefinance the portion of it's 2010 capital needs through the issuance of $250 million of 30-year medium-term notes at a rate of 5.375%. PSE&G also made an early redemption of $44 million of debt. And as I said, we continue to reduce our potential lease-related tax liability with proceeds from the termination of leases. To sum up then at year end, a simple calculation of debt to capital will reveal a reduction in debt to capital to 45% from 49% at the end of 2008, so the balance sheet continues to be strong. That concludes my remarks. And now we look forward to taking your questions."

In terms of our thinking about migration on a year-over-year basis, again, we're not giving detailed aspects of guidance, but I would not expect migration to be a higher impact year-over-year. So I wouldn't expect to see, at this point, delta's year-over-year migration from the level that we have in 2009. And the reason for that is, think about some of what happened in 2009, in the summer quarter, which is our highest demand quarter, there were some very unusual weather conditions, as you may recall, that led to some of the lowest prices we've seen in power during the year we're seeing in the summer quarter. While at the same time, the BGS price had its summer premium. So the differential or the headroom or the opportunity for migration was the largest in the summer. Still, what we've seen, and we mentioned on the third quarter call, was migration of about 11%. That has increased, but at a much slower rate to about 15% of our total load, has migrated. But at the same time, keep in mind that, that differential, that price differential, has moderated very significantly. So the opportunity or impact to us from migration is very different right now in our expectations for normal weather and therefore, more normal pricing next year than what we experienced in 2009. Again, those were assumptions and estimates, we'll have to see how that plays out over time. And also given the results of the current BGS auction, we'll have some slightly lower pricing in the summer as BGS rolled in with a new auction in June and there's a bit of a moderation in the way that summer premium will be calculated in '10. Again, that will affect that headroom calculation. So year-over-year, we don't see a material impact on a year-over-year basis from migration."

Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share, which is the same as what we earned in the year ago period. The result",731,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning and thanks everyone for joining us today on this call. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share, which is the same as what we earned in the year ago period. The results for the quarter brought operating earnings for 2009 to $3.12 per share. This is to be compared to $3.03 per share earned in 2008. The full year results fell in the middle of the earnings guidance to $3 to $3.25 per share we set for 2009. These results were achieved in the face of what can only be characterized as very challenging markets. A weak economy and abnormal weather affected demand in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. In PSEG Power, our nuclear and combined cycle fleet of generating assets produced at record levels at 2009. Their strong performance and availability helped offset the impact of lower power prices on our earnings. Earnings were also aided by our employees' response to weaker-than-anticipated demand with the reduction in expenses. At PSEG Energy Holdings, we were able to take advantage of the financing environment to negotiate the termination of 12 cross-border leases, including two in the fourth quarter. These deals substantially reduced our potential tax and financial risk. Clearly, our 2009 results demonstrate the importance of a balanced portfolio of asset. The credit for our results, however, belongs to our employees. It is worth repeating. Their commitment to the our shared goal of operational excellence and their responsiveness to a call to control costs was a major contributor to our result. Cost-reduction programs implemented throughout the organization, including support from our union membership, will continue to be an important contributions to our operating result. For 2010, we are forecasting operating earnings will fall within a range of $3 to $3.25 per share. At the moment, we are not providing you with a breakdown of operating earnings by subsidiary as has been our custom in prior years. We intend to provide that guidance at the conclusion of PSE&G's distribution rate case. Now let me take a step back for a moment to assess the business environment. The providers of energy in today's market face many challenges in light of changing fuel prices and the need to meet increased governmental mandates. I am confident that PSEG can meet the challenges of today's demanding market. We are working toward improving on our operationally excellent, low-carbon integrated business model that provides energies to customers in a cost-efficient way and meet our shareholder requirements for attractive return. PSEG's capital commitments are focused on maintaining the availability of critical generating units in constrained markets, expanding our investment in renewable solar energy projects at attractive risk-adjusted returns and increasing our nuclear footprint through upgrades of existing capacity as we also improve the reliability and functionality of our distribution and transmission infrastructure. We are well down this path. Regulatory approvals received by PSE&G in 2009 support the investment of $1.4 billion to improve reliability, help customers save energy and expand the use of solar energy. These approvals provide us with prompt cost recovery and a reasonable return. Also, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities' recent decision on our $750 million investment in the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line will improve reliability in the northern part of New Jersey. We hope our past results and our ongoing passion help you to understand our commitment to providing excellence in operations into the future. The Board of Directors recently approved a 3% increase in the quarterly common dividend rate to $0.3425 per share for the first quarter, which represents an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.37 per share. The Board's action represents the seventh consecutive annual increase in the dividend and the continuation of a 103-year history of paying an annual dividend to shareholders. We are committed to improving returns on operations, investing at levels that support our long-term growth and then sharing this return. We look forward to seeing many of you at our annual conference for the financial community on February 26. As we have in the past, we will discuss the strategic drivers of our business, public policy that matters to our industry, our strategy to position PSEG for a changing energy environment, as well as the specific market and cost factors that influence us. And now I'll turn the call over to Caroline."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share versus operating earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $3.12 per share versus operating earnings for 2008 of $3.03 per share. Just to remind you, our operating earnings exclude the impact of the change in value in our NDT investments and obligations, as well as other charges related to the future decommissioning, and any changes in the value of transactions related to our generating assets that don't qualify for hedge accounting, that is their mark-to-market. We also exclude the impact of adjustments to lease reserves, which I'll come back to later in the discussion.  As we've also done throughout the year, we've adjusted the prior-year numbers to make your comparisons easy to follow.  Slide 4 provides a reconciliation of operating incomes to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 10, PSEG Power provides the largest contribution to earnings. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.47 per share compared with $0.49 per share last year. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.13 per share compared to $0.15 per share last year. PSEG Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $0.03 per share compared with a marginal contribution in the year-ago quarter. The parent company reported a loss of $0.01 a share compared with a loss of $0.02 per share in last year's quarter. We have provided you with the waterfall charts on Slides 12 and 13 that take you through the net changes in the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year operating earnings comparisons by major business. But now I'd like to review each company in a little more detail.Starting with Power, as shown on Slide 15, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.47 per share compared with $0.49 per share a year ago. Please note that Power's results for the quarter, the year and the results for the year-ago period now reflect the impact of the October 1 transfer of the Texas gas-fired assets from Holdings to Power. Power's operating earnings for the quarter brought 2009's full year operating earnings to $1.2 billion in line with our guidance. The operating environment, as Ralph said, in the quarter, continue to be challenged by low power prices, as well as the weak economy, although not as challenging as what we experienced in the third quarter when as you recall, weather compounded our difficulties. Power's results for the fourth quarter were affected by those weak power prices, which more than offset an 8% increase in generation. The decline in margin was experienced in the Texas and New York, New England market, $0.02 a share in each market. Margins in PJM, however, increased $0.02 a share, a 3.5% increase quarter-over-quarter. The PJM assets continue to benefit from higher hedge-related prices and a 2% increase in nuclear generation, which together helped to offset a decline in BGS-related volume. The weak economy continued to affect the level of demand, which reduced earnings by an estimated $0.01 per share. The decline in BGS' volumes also reflects the effect of customer migration, which we estimate reduced earnings by $0.02 per share in the quarter. And for the year, we estimate customer migration away from BGS cost us about $0.08 per share.  The earnings impact for the full year reflects a small impact for the first half of the year, or $0.02 per share over that first full six-month period for migration, the third quarter impact of $0.04 per share that we spoke about on the third quarter call and the fourth quarter impact of $0.02 per share.  Despite all of these factors across the year, PGM margins were still up 9% for the year, reflecting our dispatch flexibility and hedging strategies, which offset a decline in demand. Earnings comparisons were also affected by an increase in O&M, depreciation and other miscellaneous items for $0.03 per share. But note that for the full year, Power's O&M expense was, in fact, 2% lower than a year ago. As anticipated, we earned $0.01 per share on trading activities, and coupled with gains this quarter associated with contracting activities, including Power's participation in full requirement auction, these activities together increased earnings by $0.03 per share. As I mentioned, Generation increased 8% during the quarter. Power's nuclear and combined cycle fleet each experienced record levels of output. Generation from the combined cycle fleet, including Texas, increased 29.8% in the quarter. Excluding Texas, output from the combined cycle units in New York and New Jersey increased 47%. The nuclear fleet operated at 92% capacity factor in the quarter versus 91.3% in last year's fourth quarter, bringing the capacity factor for the full year to 93.4%, record performance for the year and in line with our expectations as outlined on the third quarter earnings call.Generation from Power's New Jersey coal units increased during the fourth quarter as compared to earlier in the year as an increase in the cost of gas relative to coal improved the economic dispatch of these units. On an annual basis, as you can see on the slide, coal-fired generation was still below last year's level of output. The increase in generation from the coal-fired stations this quarter, coupled with low pricing, reduced average gross margins for the PJM's New York and New England fleet to $51 per megawatt hour in the quarter from $55 per megawatt hour in last year's quarter, again in line with our expectations. The average gross margin earned on the Texas combined cycle generation declined to $7 per megawatt hour in the quarter from $16 per megawatt hour last year as a result of the decline spark spreads, which we've talked about before. The growth in output during the fourth quarter brought outputs for the full year to 59.8 terawatt hours, 5% decline from 2008's level of generation. Nuclear fleet provided approximately 51% of Power's total generation. The strong performance from nuclear, coupled with lower gas costs, reported annual average gross margins on the PJM's New York and New England fleet of $60 per megawatt hour for the year, slightly higher than the $58 per megawatt hour we were forecasting at the start of the year. To summarize these drivers, we estimate Powers' earnings for the full year were hurt by weak economic conditions, about $0.03 per share; cooler-than-normal weather during the important summer months, about $0.02 per share; and as we said earlier, customer migration at about $0.08 per share. On the other side, we contracting and that dispatch flexibility of the PJM fleet helped results by about $0.08 per share. Now I'll turn to PSE&G.PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.13 per share compared with $0.15 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008, as shown on Slide 22. PSE&G's full year 2009 operating earnings were $321 million, also in line with our guidance. Gas margins declined in the fourth quarter by about $0.01 per share. The results were affected by warmer-than-normal weather in this year's fourth quarter compared with colder-than-normal weather experienced in the prior year. The reduction in gas margin was offset by an increase in transmission rates and higher appliance service margin, which together, added about $0.01 per share to earnings. Earnings comparisons were also hurt by an increase in pension expense, which more than offset a reduction in other operation and maintenance expenses and a lower tax rate. These items combined to reduce PSE&G's fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. Abnormal weather conditions and a weak economy hurt demand in 2009. During the fourth quarter, weather normalized electric demand declined 3.2%, resulting in a 2.5% decline in demand for the full year. Within that total, weather normalized demand from residential electric customers declined by 0.8% for the fourth quarter and 0.9% for the full year. For gas, weather normalized demand increased 1.1% in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 0.7% decline in sales for the full year. Trends in employment and housing tend to be pretty good barometers of the New Jersey economic condition, both are at multi-year lows, although we may not be experiencing a decline as fast as we did earlier in the year, we've not experienced just yet any uptick in growth.Another key developments at the utility, as you're probably aware, the regulatory calendar is full. PSE&G implemented a $23 million increase in transmission revenues effective January 1 as part of its formula rate treatment on increased investment. The New Jersey BPU approved PSE&G's $750 million investment in the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line on February 11 of this year. The BPU's decision represents a critical milestone in the regulatory approval process. PSE&G also updated its filing with the BPU for an increase in electric and gas revenues, totaling $222 million. This updated request reflects actual results for 12 months ended December 31 of 2009. The update represents an increase in electric revenues of $14 million and a reduction in gas revenues of $23 million from the May 2009 rate filings. PSE&G's request is based on an 11.25% return on equity and a 51.2% equity ratio. Following the normal process for this request, the BPU would be expected to issue a decision in May or June of this year with rates effective midyear. For 2009, for reference, operating earnings provided an earned return on equity of about 8% for our Distribution business and about 11% for our Transmission business.Next, let me turn to PSEG Energy Holdings. Energy Holdings reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.03 per share compared to operating earnings of about $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Holdings quarterly earnings were aided by the recognition of gains on the successful termination of two cross-border leases, which amounted to $0.02 per share. This growth also benefited from a reduction in O&M expenses and lower interest expense, which added $0.02 per share to earnings. A reduction in the value of our remaining international generation assets lowered earnings by $0.01 a share, and reduced our investment in that asset to a nominal level. The termination of the two leases in the fourth quarter brings the number of leases terminated to 13, 12 in 2009 and one in 2008. Our activity reduced our potential cash tax liability to $660 million. As we've discussed before, if we had not terminated any leases, our potential liability would have risen to more than $1.3 billion. So we have, in fact, cut our risk in half, and as we've said before, we've been using the proceeds from counterparties from those terminations to accomplish this risk reduction.In addition, we still have $320 million on deposit with the IRS to meet any potential tax liability, so think of that as an offset to the $660 million exposure. Also, we have reduced our reserve for lease exposures by $29 million after tax based on a reassessment of risks following the outcome of the favorable court decision late in 2009 for another utility. The net after-tax gain of $29 million is reflected in earnings from continuing operations, but not on operating earnings. In terms of 2010 outlook, as Ralph mentioned, we are providing operating earnings guidance for 2010 of $3 to $3.25 per share. We won't be providing operating earnings guidance by subsidiary until the conclusion of PSE&G's distribution rate case. Overall, our guidance is based on expectations of a modest improvement in demand and normal weather versus the very weak conditions experienced in 2009. We estimate the combination of abnormal weather conditions and a weak economy reduced our 2009 earnings by $0.08 per share at Power and PSE&G. However, 2009's operating earnings also benefited from the $0.13 per share of gains on the termination of leases, which we don't expect to see duplicated in the current year. Remember, we have only five leases less left and we do continue to actively manage them. Our ability to control growth and expenses and operate at top quartile levels of performance in many areas of our business provide support for our 2010 earnings guidance. We estimate our O&M, excluding the impact of regulatory recovery clauses for our company as a whole, will be flat year-over-year as it was for the company as a whole for 2009. Finally, a brief comment on financing activity, as you probably are aware, we remained fairly active in the fourth quarter. We eliminated the last piece of long-term debt at the parent with the redemption of $49 million of debt. PSE&G was able to take advantage of attractive debt markets to prefinance the portion of it's 2010 capital needs through the issuance of $250 million of 30-year medium-term notes at a rate of 5.375%. PSE&G also made an early redemption of $44 million of debt. And as I said, we continue to reduce our potential lease-related tax liability with proceeds from the termination of leases. To sum up then at year end, a simple calculation of debt to capital will reveal a reduction in debt to capital to 45% from 49% at the end of 2008, so the balance sheet continues to be strong. That concludes my remarks. And now we look forward to taking your questions."

In terms of our thinking about migration on a year-over-year basis, again, we're not giving detailed aspects of guidance, but I would not expect migration to be a higher impact year-over-year. So I wouldn't expect to see, at this point, delta's year-over-year migration from the level that we have in 2009. And the reason for that is, think about some of what happened in 2009, in the summer quarter, which is our highest demand quarter, there were some very unusual weather conditions, as you may recall, that led to some of the lowest prices we've seen in power during the year we're seeing in the summer quarter. While at the same time, the BGS price had its summer premium. So the differential or the headroom or the opportunity for migration was the largest in the summer. Still, what we've seen, and we mentioned on the third quarter call, was migration of about 11%. That has increased, but at a much slower rate to about 15% of our total load, has migrated. But at the same time, keep in mind that, that differential, that price differential, has moderated very significantly. So the opportunity or impact to us from migration is very different right now in our expectations for normal weather and therefore, more normal pricing next year than what we experienced in 2009. Again, those were assumptions and estimates, we'll have to see how that plays out over time. And also given the results of the current BGS auction, we'll have some slightly lower pricing in the summer as BGS rolled in with a new auction in June and there's a bit of a moderation in the way that summer premium will be calculated in '10. Again, that will affect that headroom calculation. So year-over-year, we don't see a material impact on a year-over-year basis from migration."

Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share, which is the same as what we earned in the year ago period. The result",731,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning and thanks everyone for joining us today on this call. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share, which is the same as what we earned in the year ago period. The results for the quarter brought operating earnings for 2009 to $3.12 per share. This is to be compared to $3.03 per share earned in 2008. The full year results fell in the middle of the earnings guidance to $3 to $3.25 per share we set for 2009. These results were achieved in the face of what can only be characterized as very challenging markets. A weak economy and abnormal weather affected demand in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. In PSEG Power, our nuclear and combined cycle fleet of generating assets produced at record levels at 2009. Their strong performance and availability helped offset the impact of lower power prices on our earnings. Earnings were also aided by our employees' response to weaker-than-anticipated demand with the reduction in expenses. At PSEG Energy Holdings, we were able to take advantage of the financing environment to negotiate the termination of 12 cross-border leases, including two in the fourth quarter. These deals substantially reduced our potential tax and financial risk. Clearly, our 2009 results demonstrate the importance of a balanced portfolio of asset. The credit for our results, however, belongs to our employees. It is worth repeating. Their commitment to the our shared goal of operational excellence and their responsiveness to a call to control costs was a major contributor to our result. Cost-reduction programs implemented throughout the organization, including support from our union membership, will continue to be an important contributions to our operating result. For 2010, we are forecasting operating earnings will fall within a range of $3 to $3.25 per share. At the moment, we are not providing you with a breakdown of operating earnings by subsidiary as has been our custom in prior years. We intend to provide that guidance at the conclusion of PSE&G's distribution rate case. Now let me take a step back for a moment to assess the business environment. The providers of energy in today's market face many challenges in light of changing fuel prices and the need to meet increased governmental mandates. I am confident that PSEG can meet the challenges of today's demanding market. We are working toward improving on our operationally excellent, low-carbon integrated business model that provides energies to customers in a cost-efficient way and meet our shareholder requirements for attractive return. PSEG's capital commitments are focused on maintaining the availability of critical generating units in constrained markets, expanding our investment in renewable solar energy projects at attractive risk-adjusted returns and increasing our nuclear footprint through upgrades of existing capacity as we also improve the reliability and functionality of our distribution and transmission infrastructure. We are well down this path. Regulatory approvals received by PSE&G in 2009 support the investment of $1.4 billion to improve reliability, help customers save energy and expand the use of solar energy. These approvals provide us with prompt cost recovery and a reasonable return. Also, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities' recent decision on our $750 million investment in the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line will improve reliability in the northern part of New Jersey. We hope our past results and our ongoing passion help you to understand our commitment to providing excellence in operations into the future. The Board of Directors recently approved a 3% increase in the quarterly common dividend rate to $0.3425 per share for the first quarter, which represents an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.37 per share. The Board's action represents the seventh consecutive annual increase in the dividend and the continuation of a 103-year history of paying an annual dividend to shareholders. We are committed to improving returns on operations, investing at levels that support our long-term growth and then sharing this return. We look forward to seeing many of you at our annual conference for the financial community on February 26. As we have in the past, we will discuss the strategic drivers of our business, public policy that matters to our industry, our strategy to position PSEG for a changing energy environment, as well as the specific market and cost factors that influence us. And now I'll turn the call over to Caroline."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share versus operating earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's fourth quarter.

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share versus operating earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $3.12 per share versus operating earnings for 2008 of $3.03 per share. Just to remind you, our operating earnings exclude the impact of the change in value in our NDT investments and obligations, as well as other charges related to the future decommissioning, and any changes in the value of transactions related to our generating assets that don't qualify for hedge accounting, that is their mark-to-market. We also exclude the impact of adjustments to lease reserves, which I'll come back to later in the discussion.  As we've also done throughout the year, we've adjusted the prior-year numbers to make your comparisons easy to follow.  Slide 4 provides a reconciliation of operating incomes to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 10, PSEG Power provides the largest contribution to earnings. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.47 per share compared with $0.49 per share last year. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.13 per share compared to $0.15 per share last year. PSEG Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $0.03 per share compared with a marginal contribution in the year-ago quarter. The parent company reported a loss of $0.01 a share compared with a loss of $0.02 per share in last year's quarter. We have provided you with the waterfall charts on Slides 12 and 13 that take you through the net changes in the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year operating earnings comparisons by major business. But now I'd like to review each company in a little more detail.Starting with Power, as shown on Slide 15, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.47 per share compared with $0.49 per share a year ago. Please note that Power's results for the quarter, the year and the results for the year-ago period now reflect the impact of the October 1 transfer of the Texas gas-fired assets from Holdings to Power. Power's operating earnings for the quarter brought 2009's full year operating earnings to $1.2 billion in line with our guidance. The operating environment, as Ralph said, in the quarter, continue to be challenged by low power prices, as well as the weak economy, although not as challenging as what we experienced in the third quarter when as you recall, weather compounded our difficulties. Power's results for the fourth quarter were affected by those weak power prices, which more than offset an 8% increase in generation. The decline in margin was experienced in the Texas and New York, New England market, $0.02 a share in each market. Margins in PJM, however, increased $0.02 a share, a 3.5% increase quarter-over-quarter. The PJM assets continue to benefit from higher hedge-related prices and a 2% increase in nuclear generation, which together helped to offset a decline in BGS-related volume. The weak economy continued to affect the level of demand, which reduced earnings by an estimated $0.01 per share. The decline in BGS' volumes also reflects the effect of customer migration, which we estimate reduced earnings by $0.02 per share in the quarter. And for the year, we estimate customer migration away from BGS cost us about $0.08 per share.  The earnings impact for the full year reflects a small impact for the first half of the year, or $0.02 per share over that first full six-month period for migration, the third quarter impact of $0.04 per share that we spoke about on the third quarter call and the fourth quarter impact of $0.02 per share.  Despite all of these factors across the year, PGM margins were still up 9% for the year, reflecting our dispatch flexibility and hedging strategies, which offset a decline in demand. Earnings comparisons were also affected by an increase in O&M, depreciation and other miscellaneous items for $0.03 per share. But note that for the full year, Power's O&M expense was, in fact, 2% lower than a year ago. As anticipated, we earned $0.01 per share on trading activities, and coupled with gains this quarter associated with contracting activities, including Power's participation in full requirement auction, these activities together increased earnings by $0.03 per share. As I mentioned, Generation increased 8% during the quarter. Power's nuclear and combined cycle fleet each experienced record levels of output. Generation from the combined cycle fleet, including Texas, increased 29.8% in the quarter. Excluding Texas, output from the combined cycle units in New York and New Jersey increased 47%. The nuclear fleet operated at 92% capacity factor in the quarter versus 91.3% in last year's fourth quarter, bringing the capacity factor for the full year to 93.4%, record performance for the year and in line with our expectations as outlined on the third quarter earnings call.Generation from Power's New Jersey coal units increased during the fourth quarter as compared to earlier in the year as an increase in the cost of gas relative to coal improved the economic dispatch of these units. On an annual basis, as you can see on the slide, coal-fired generation was still below last year's level of output. The increase in generation from the coal-fired stations this quarter, coupled with low pricing, reduced average gross margins for the PJM's New York and New England fleet to $51 per megawatt hour in the quarter from $55 per megawatt hour in last year's quarter, again in line with our expectations. The average gross margin earned on the Texas combined cycle generation declined to $7 per megawatt hour in the quarter from $16 per megawatt hour last year as a result of the decline spark spreads, which we've talked about before. The growth in output during the fourth quarter brought outputs for the full year to 59.8 terawatt hours, 5% decline from 2008's level of generation. Nuclear fleet provided approximately 51% of Power's total generation. The strong performance from nuclear, coupled with lower gas costs, reported annual average gross margins on the PJM's New York and New England fleet of $60 per megawatt hour for the year, slightly higher than the $58 per megawatt hour we were forecasting at the start of the year. To summarize these drivers, we estimate Powers' earnings for the full year were hurt by weak economic conditions, about $0.03 per share; cooler-than-normal weather during the important summer months, about $0.02 per share; and as we said earlier, customer migration at about $0.08 per share. On the other side, we contracting and that dispatch flexibility of the PJM fleet helped results by about $0.08 per share. Now I'll turn to PSE&G.PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.13 per share compared with $0.15 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008, as shown on Slide 22. PSE&G's full year 2009 operating earnings were $321 million, also in line with our guidance. Gas margins declined in the fourth quarter by about $0.01 per share. The results were affected by warmer-than-normal weather in this year's fourth quarter compared with colder-than-normal weather experienced in the prior year. The reduction in gas margin was offset by an increase in transmission rates and higher appliance service margin, which together, added about $0.01 per share to earnings. Earnings comparisons were also hurt by an increase in pension expense, which more than offset a reduction in other operation and maintenance expenses and a lower tax rate. These items combined to reduce PSE&G's fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. Abnormal weather conditions and a weak economy hurt demand in 2009. During the fourth quarter, weather normalized electric demand declined 3.2%, resulting in a 2.5% decline in demand for the full year. Within that total, weather normalized demand from residential electric customers declined by 0.8% for the fourth quarter and 0.9% for the full year. For gas, weather normalized demand increased 1.1% in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 0.7% decline in sales for the full year. Trends in employment and housing tend to be pretty good barometers of the New Jersey economic condition, both are at multi-year lows, although we may not be experiencing a decline as fast as we did earlier in the year, we've not experienced just yet any uptick in growth.Another key developments at the utility, as you're probably aware, the regulatory calendar is full. PSE&G implemented a $23 million increase in transmission revenues effective January 1 as part of its formula rate treatment on increased investment. The New Jersey BPU approved PSE&G's $750 million investment in the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line on February 11 of this year. The BPU's decision represents a critical milestone in the regulatory approval process. PSE&G also updated its filing with the BPU for an increase in electric and gas revenues, totaling $222 million. This updated request reflects actual results for 12 months ended December 31 of 2009. The update represents an increase in electric revenues of $14 million and a reduction in gas revenues of $23 million from the May 2009 rate filings. PSE&G's request is based on an 11.25% return on equity and a 51.2% equity ratio. Following the normal process for this request, the BPU would be expected to issue a decision in May or June of this year with rates effective midyear. For 2009, for reference, operating earnings provided an earned return on equity of about 8% for our Distribution business and about 11% for our Transmission business.Next, let me turn to PSEG Energy Holdings. Energy Holdings reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.03 per share compared to operating earnings of about $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Holdings quarterly earnings were aided by the recognition of gains on the successful termination of two cross-border leases, which amounted to $0.02 per share. This growth also benefited from a reduction in O&M expenses and lower interest expense, which added $0.02 per share to earnings. A reduction in the value of our remaining international generation assets lowered earnings by $0.01 a share, and reduced our investment in that asset to a nominal level. The termination of the two leases in the fourth quarter brings the number of leases terminated to 13, 12 in 2009 and one in 2008. Our activity reduced our potential cash tax liability to $660 million. As we've discussed before, if we had not terminated any leases, our potential liability would have risen to more than $1.3 billion. So we have, in fact, cut our risk in half, and as we've said before, we've been using the proceeds from counterparties from those terminations to accomplish this risk reduction.In addition, we still have $320 million on deposit with the IRS to meet any potential tax liability, so think of that as an offset to the $660 million exposure. Also, we have reduced our reserve for lease exposures by $29 million after tax based on a reassessment of risks following the outcome of the favorable court decision late in 2009 for another utility. The net after-tax gain of $29 million is reflected in earnings from continuing operations, but not on operating earnings. In terms of 2010 outlook, as Ralph mentioned, we are providing operating earnings guidance for 2010 of $3 to $3.25 per share. We won't be providing operating earnings guidance by subsidiary until the conclusion of PSE&G's distribution rate case. Overall, our guidance is based on expectations of a modest improvement in demand and normal weather versus the very weak conditions experienced in 2009. We estimate the combination of abnormal weather conditions and a weak economy reduced our 2009 earnings by $0.08 per share at Power and PSE&G. However, 2009's operating earnings also benefited from the $0.13 per share of gains on the termination of leases, which we don't expect to see duplicated in the current year. Remember, we have only five leases less left and we do continue to actively manage them. Our ability to control growth and expenses and operate at top quartile levels of performance in many areas of our business provide support for our 2010 earnings guidance. We estimate our O&M, excluding the impact of regulatory recovery clauses for our company as a whole, will be flat year-over-year as it was for the company as a whole for 2009. Finally, a brief comment on financing activity, as you probably are aware, we remained fairly active in the fourth quarter. We eliminated the last piece of long-term debt at the parent with the redemption of $49 million of debt. PSE&G was able to take advantage of attractive debt markets to prefinance the portion of it's 2010 capital needs through the issuance of $250 million of 30-year medium-term notes at a rate of 5.375%. PSE&G also made an early redemption of $44 million of debt. And as I said, we continue to reduce our potential lease-related tax liability with proceeds from the termination of leases. To sum up then at year end, a simple calculation of debt to capital will reveal a reduction in debt to capital to 45% from 49% at the end of 2008, so the balance sheet continues to be strong. That concludes my remarks. And now we look forward to taking your questions."

In terms of our thinking about migration on a year-over-year basis, again, we're not giving detailed aspects of guidance, but I would not expect migration to be a higher impact year-over-year. So I wouldn't expect to see, at this point, delta's year-over-year migration from the level that we have in 2009. And the reason for that is, think about some of what happened in 2009, in the summer quarter, which is our highest demand quarter, there were some very unusual weather conditions, as you may recall, that led to some of the lowest prices we've seen in power during the year we're seeing in the summer quarter. While at the same time, the BGS price had its summer premium. So the differential or the headroom or the opportunity for migration was the largest in the summer. Still, what we've seen, and we mentioned on the third quarter call, was migration of about 11%. That has increased, but at a much slower rate to about 15% of our total load, has migrated. But at the same time, keep in mind that, that differential, that price differential, has moderated very significantly. So the opportunity or impact to us from migration is very different right now in our expectations for normal weather and therefore, more normal pricing next year than what we experienced in 2009. Again, those were assumptions and estimates, we'll have to see how that plays out over time. And also given the results of the current BGS auction, we'll have some slightly lower pricing in the summer as BGS rolled in with a new auction in June and there's a bit of a moderation in the way that summer premium will be calculated in '10. Again, that will affect that headroom calculation. So year-over-year, we don't see a material impact on a year-over-year basis from migration."

Good morning and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on this call. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share, which is the same as what we earned in the year ago period. The results for the quarter brought operating earnings for 2009 to $3.12 per share. This is to be compared to $3.03 per share earned in 2008. The full year results fell in the middle of the earnings guidance of $3 to $3.25 per share we set for 2009. These results were achieved in the face of what can only be characterized as very challenging markets. A weak economy and abnormal weather affected demand in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. In PSEG Power, our nuclear and combined cycle fleet of generating assets produced at record levels in 2009. Their strong performance and availability helped offset the impact of lower power prices on our earnings. Earnings were also aided by our employees' response to weaker-than-anticipated demand with a reduction in expenses. At PSEG Energy Holdings, we were able to take advantage of the financing environment to negotiate the termination of 12 cross-border leases, including two in the fourth quarter. These deals substantially reduced our potential tax and financial risk. Clearly, our 2009 results demonstrate the importance of a balanced portfolio of assets. The credit for our results, however, belongs to our employees. It is worth repeating. Their commitment to our shared goal of operational excellence and their responsiveness to a call to control costs was a major contributor to our result. Cost-reduction programs implemented throughout the organization, including support from our union membership, will continue to be an important contributions to our operating result. For 2010, we are forecasting operating earnings will fall within a range of $3 to $3.25 per share. At the moment, we are not providing you with a breakdown of operating earnings by subsidiary as has been our custom in prior years. We intend to provide that guidance at the conclusion of PSE&G's distribution rate case. Now let me take a step back for a moment to assess the business environment. The providers of energy in today's market face many challenges in light of changing fuel prices and the need to meet increased governmental mandates. I am confident that PSEG can meet the challenges of today's demanding market. We are working toward improving on our operationally excellent, low-carbon integrated business model that provides energies to customers in a cost-efficient way and meets our shareholder requirements for attractive return. PSEG's capital commitments are focused on maintaining the availability of critical generating units in constrained markets, expanding our investment in renewable solar energy projects at attractive risk-adjusted returns and increasing our nuclear footprint through upgrades of existing capacity as we also improve the reliability and functionality of our distribution and transmission infrastructure. We are well down this path. Regulatory approvals received by PSE&G in 2009 support the investment of $1.4 billion to improve reliability, help customers save energy and expand the use of solar energy. These approvals provide us with prompt cost recovery and a reasonable return. Also, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities' recent decision on our $750 million investment in the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line will improve reliability in the northern part of New Jersey. We hope our past results and our ongoing passion help you to understand our commitment to providing excellence in operations into the future. The Board of Directors recently approved a 3% increase in the quarterly common dividend rate to $0.3425 per share for the first quarter, which represents an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.37 per share. The Board's action represents the seventh consecutive annual increase in the dividend and the continuation of a 103-year history of paying an annual dividend to shareholders. We are committed to improving returns on operations, investing at levels that support our long-term growth and then sharing this return. We look forward to seeing many of you at our annual conference for the financial community on February 26. As we have in the past, we will discuss the strategic drivers of our business, public policy that matters to our industry, our strategy to position PSEG for a changing energy environment, as well as the specific market and cost factors that influence us. And now I'll turn the call over to Caroline."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share versus operating earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $3.12 per share versus operating earnings for 2008 of $3.03 per share. Just to remind you, our operating earnings exclude the impact of the change in value in our NDT investments and obligations, as well as other charges related to the future decommissioning, and any changes in the value of transactions related to our generating assets that don't qualify for hedge accounting, that is their mark-to-market. We also exclude the impact of adjustments to lease reserves, which I'll come back to later in the discussion.  As we've also done throughout the year, we've adjusted the prior-year numbers to make your comparisons easy to follow.  Slide 4 provides a reconciliation of operating incomes to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 10, PSEG Power provides the largest contribution to earnings. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.47 per share compared with $0.49 per share last year. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.13 per share compared to $0.15 per share last year. PSEG Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $0.03 per share compared with a marginal contribution in the year-ago quarter. The parent company reported a loss of $0.01 a share compared with a loss of $0.02 per share in last year's quarter. We have provided you with the waterfall charts on Slides 12 and 13 that take you through the net changes in the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year operating earnings comparisons by major business. But now I'd like to review each company in a little more detail.Starting with Power, as shown on Slide 15, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.47 per share compared with $0.49 per share a year ago. Please note that Power's results for the quarter, the year and the results for the year-ago period now reflect the impact of the October 1 transfer of the Texas gas-fired assets from Holdings to Power. Power's operating earnings for the quarter brought 2009's full year operating earnings to $1.2 billion in line with our guidance. The operating environment, as Ralph said, in the quarter, continue to be challenged by low power prices, as well as the weak economy, although not as challenging as what we experienced in the third quarter when as you recall, weather compounded our difficulties. Power's results for the fourth quarter were affected by those weak power prices, which more than offset an 8% increase in generation. The decline in margin was experienced in the Texas and New York, New England market, $0.02 a share in each market. Margins in PJM, however, increased $0.02 a share, a 3.5% increase quarter-over-quarter. The PJM assets continue to benefit from higher hedge-related prices and a 2% increase in nuclear generation, which together helped to offset a decline in BGS-related volume. The weak economy continued to affect the level of demand, which reduced earnings by an estimated $0.01 per share. The decline in BGS' volumes also reflects the effect of customer migration, which we estimate reduced earnings by $0.02 per share in the quarter. And for the year, we estimate customer migration away from BGS cost us about $0.08 per share.  The earnings impact for the full year reflects a small impact for the first half of the year, or $0.02 per share over that first full six-month period for migration, the third quarter impact of $0.04 per share that we spoke about on the third quarter call and the fourth quarter impact of $0.02 per share.  Despite all of these factors across the year, PGM margins were still up 9% for the year, reflecting our dispatch flexibility and hedging strategies, which offset a decline in demand. Earnings comparisons were also affected by an increase in O&M, depreciation and other miscellaneous items for $0.03 per share. But note that for the full year, Power's O&M expense was, in fact, 2% lower than a year ago. As anticipated, we earned $0.01 per share on trading activities, and coupled with gains this quarter associated with contracting activities, including Power's participation in full requirement auction, these activities together increased earnings by $0.03 per share. As I mentioned, Generation increased 8% during the quarter. Power's nuclear and combined cycle fleet each experienced record levels of output. Generation from the combined cycle fleet, including Texas, increased 29.8% in the quarter. Excluding Texas, output from the combined cycle units in New York and New Jersey increased 47%. The nuclear fleet operated at 92% capacity factor in the quarter versus 91.3% in last year's fourth quarter, bringing the capacity factor for the full year to 93.4%, record performance for the year and in line with our expectations as outlined on the third quarter earnings call.Generation from Power's New Jersey coal units increased during the fourth quarter as compared to earlier in the year as an increase in the cost of gas relative to coal improved the economic dispatch of these units. On an annual basis, as you can see on the slide, coal-fired generation was still below last year's level of output. The increase in generation from the coal-fired stations this quarter, coupled with low pricing, reduced average gross margins for the PJM's New York and New England fleet to $51 per megawatt hour in the quarter from $55 per megawatt hour in last year's quarter, again in line with our expectations. The average gross margin earned on the Texas combined cycle generation declined to $7 per megawatt hour in the quarter from $16 per megawatt hour last year as a result of the decline spark spreads, which we've talked about before. The growth in output during the fourth quarter brought outputs for the full year to 59.8 terawatt hours, 5% decline from 2008's level of generation. Nuclear fleet provided approximately 51% of Power's total generation. The strong performance from nuclear, coupled with lower gas costs, reported annual average gross margins on the PJM's New York and New England fleet of $60 per megawatt hour for the year, slightly higher than the $58 per megawatt hour we were forecasting at the start of the year. To summarize these drivers, we estimate Powers' earnings for the full year were hurt by weak economic conditions, about $0.03 per share; cooler-than-normal weather during the important summer months, about $0.02 per share; and as we said earlier, customer migration at about $0.08 per share. On the other side, we contracting and that dispatch flexibility of the PJM fleet helped results by about $0.08 per share. Now I'll turn to PSE&G.PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.13 per share compared with $0.15 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008, as shown on Slide 22. PSE&G's full year 2009 operating earnings were $321 million, also in line with our guidance. Gas margins declined in the fourth quarter by about $0.01 per share. The results were affected by warmer-than-normal weather in this year's fourth quarter compared with colder-than-normal weather experienced in the prior year. The reduction in gas margin was offset by an increase in transmission rates and higher appliance service margin, which together, added about $0.01 per share to earnings. Earnings comparisons were also hurt by an increase in pension expense, which more than offset a reduction in other operation and maintenance expenses and a lower tax rate. These items combined to reduce PSE&G's fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. Abnormal weather conditions and a weak economy hurt demand in 2009. During the fourth quarter, weather normalized electric demand declined 3.2%, resulting in a 2.5% decline in demand for the full year. Within that total, weather normalized demand from residential electric customers declined by 0.8% for the fourth quarter and 0.9% for the full year. For gas, weather normalized demand increased 1.1% in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 0.7% decline in sales for the full year. Trends in employment and housing tend to be pretty good barometers of the New Jersey economic condition, both are at multi-year lows, although we may not be experiencing a decline as fast as we did earlier in the year, we've not experienced just yet any uptick in growth.Another key developments at the utility, as you're probably aware, the regulatory calendar is full. PSE&G implemented a $23 million increase in transmission revenues effective January 1 as part of its formula rate treatment on increased investment. The New Jersey BPU approved PSE&G's $750 million investment in the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line on February 11 of this year. The BPU's decision represents a critical milestone in the regulatory approval process. PSE&G also updated its filing with the BPU for an increase in electric and gas revenues totaling $222 million. This updated request reflects the actual results for 12 months ended December 31 of 2009. The update represents an increase in electric revenues of $14 million and a reduction in gas revenues of $23 million from the May 2009 rate filing. PSE&G's request is based on an 11.25% return on equity and a 51.2% equity ratio. Following the normal process for this request, the BPU would be expected to issue a decision in May or June of this year with rates effective midyear. For 2009, for reference, operating earnings provided an earned return on equity of about 8% for our Distribution business and about 11% for our Transmission business.Next, let me turn to PSEG Energy Holdings. Energy Holdings reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.03 per share compared to operating earnings of about $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Holdings quarterly earnings were aided by the recognition of gains on the successful termination of two cross-border leases, which amounted to $0.02 per share. Results also benefited from a reduction in O&M expenses and lower interest expense, which added $0.02 per share to earnings. A reduction in the value of our remaining international generation assets lowered earnings by $0.01 a share, and reduced our investment in that asset to a nominal level. The termination of the two leases in the fourth quarter brings the number of leases terminated to 13, 12 in 2009 and one in 2008. Our activity reduced our potential cash tax liability to $660 million. As we've discussed before, if we had not terminated any leases, our potential liability would have risen to more than $1.3 billion. So we have, in fact, cut our risk in half, and as we've said before, we've been using the proceeds from counterparties from those terminations to accomplish this risk reduction.In addition, we still have $320 million on deposit with the IRS to meet any potential tax liability, so think of that as an offset to the $660 million exposure. Also, we have reduced our reserve for lease exposures by $29 million after tax based on a reassessment of risk following the outcome of the favorable court decision late in 2009 for another utility. The net after-tax gain of $29 million is reflected in earnings from continuing operations, but not in operating earnings. In terms of 2010 outlook, as Ralph mentioned, we are providing operating earnings guidance for 2010 of $3 to $3.25 per share. We won't be providing operating earnings guidance by subsidiary until the conclusion of PSE&G's distribution rate case. Overall, our guidance is based on expectations of a modest improvement in demand and normal weather versus the very weak conditions experienced in 2009. We estimate the combination of abnormal weather conditions and a weak economy reduced our 2009 earnings by $0.08 per share at Power and PSE&G. However, 2009's operating earnings also benefited from the $0.13 per share of gains on the termination of leases, which we don't expect to see duplicated in the current year. Remember, we have only five leases left and we do continue to actively manage them. Our ability to control growth and expenses and operate at top quartile levels of performance in many areas of our business provide support for our 2010 earnings guidance. We estimate our O&M, excluding the impact of regulatory recovery clauses for our company as a whole, will be flat year-over-year as it was for the company as a whole for 2009. Finally, a brief comment on financing activity, as you probably are aware, we remained fairly active in the fourth quarter. We eliminated the last piece of long-term debt at the parent with the redemption of $49 million of debt. PSE&G was able to take advantage of attractive debt markets to pre-finance the portion of its 2010 capital needs through the issuance of $250 million of 30-year medium-term notes at a rate of 5.375%. PSE&G also made an early redemption of $44 million of debt. And as I said, we continue to reduce our potential lease-related tax liability with proceeds from the termination of leases. To sum up then at year end, a simple calculation of debt to capital will reveal a reduction in debt to capital to 45% from 49% at the end of 2008, so the balance sheet continues to be strong. That concludes my remarks. And now we look forward to taking your questions."

In terms of our thinking about migration on a year-over-year basis, again, we're not giving detailed aspects of guidance, but I would not expect migration to be a higher impact year-over-year. So I wouldn't expect to see, at this point, delta's year-over-year migration from the level that we have in 2009. And the reason for that is, think about some of what happened in 2009, in the summer quarter, which is our highest demand quarter, there were some very unusual weather conditions, as you may recall, that led to some of the lowest prices we've seen in power during the year were seen in the summer quarter. While at the same time, the BGS price had its summer premium. So the differential or the headroom or the opportunity for migration was the largest in the summer. So what we've seen and we mentioned on the third quarter call was migration of about 11%. That has increased, but at a much slower rate to about 15% of our total load has migrated. But at the same time, keep in mind that, that differential, that price differential, has moderated very significantly. So the opportunity or impact to us from migration is very different right now in our expectations for normal weather and therefore more normal pricing next year than what we experienced in 2009. Again, those were assumptions and estimates, we'll have to see how that plays out over time. And also given the results of the current BGS auction, we'll have some slightly lower pricing in the summer as BGS rolls in with a new auction in June and there's a bit of a moderation in the way the summer premium will be calculated in '10. Again, that will affect that headroom calculation. So year-over-year, we don't see a material impact on a year-over-year basis from migration."

Good morning and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on this call. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share, which is the same as what we earned in the year ago period. The results for the quarter brought operating earnings for 2009 to $3.12 per share. This is to be compared to $3.03 per share earned in 2008. The full year results fell in the middle of the earnings guidance of $3 to $3.25 per share we set for 2009. These results were achieved in the face of what can only be characterized as very challenging markets. A weak economy and abnormal weather affected demand in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. In PSEG Power, our nuclear and combined cycle fleet of generating assets produced at record levels in 2009. Their strong performance and availability helped offset the impact of lower power prices on our earnings. Earnings were also aided by our employees' response to weaker-than-anticipated demand with a reduction in expenses. At PSEG Energy Holdings, we were able to take advantage of the financing environment to negotiate the termination of 12 cross-border leases, including two in the fourth quarter. These deals substantially reduced our potential tax and financial risk. Clearly, our 2009 results demonstrate the importance of a balanced portfolio of assets. The credit for our results, however, belongs to our employees. It is worth repeating. Their commitment to our shared goal of operational excellence and their responsiveness to a call to control costs was a major contributor to our result. Cost-reduction programs implemented throughout the organization, including support from our union membership, will continue to be an important contributions to our operating result. For 2010, we are forecasting operating earnings will fall within a range of $3 to $3.25 per share. At the moment, we are not providing you with a breakdown of operating earnings by subsidiary as has been our custom in prior years. We intend to provide that guidance at the conclusion of PSE&G's distribution rate case. Now let me take a step back for a moment to assess the business environment. The providers of energy in today's market face many challenges in light of changing fuel prices and the need to meet increased governmental mandates. I am confident that PSEG can meet the challenges of today's demanding market. We are working toward improving on our operationally excellent, low-carbon integrated business model that provides energies to customers in a cost-efficient way and meets our shareholder requirements for attractive return. PSEG's capital commitments are focused on maintaining the availability of critical generating units in constrained markets, expanding our investment in renewable solar energy projects at attractive risk-adjusted returns and increasing our nuclear footprint through upgrades of existing capacity as we also improve the reliability and functionality of our distribution and transmission infrastructure. We are well down this path. Regulatory approvals received by PSE&G in 2009 support the investment of $1.4 billion to improve reliability, help customers save energy and expand the use of solar energy. These approvals provide us with prompt cost recovery and a reasonable return. Also, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities' recent decision on our $750 million investment in the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line will improve reliability in the northern part of New Jersey. We hope our past results and our ongoing passion help you to understand our commitment to providing excellence in operations into the future. The Board of Directors recently approved a 3% increase in the quarterly common dividend rate to $0.3425 per share for the first quarter, which represents an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.37 per share. The Board's action represents the seventh consecutive annual increase in the dividend and the continuation of a 103-year history of paying an annual dividend to shareholders. We are committed to improving returns on operations, investing at levels that support our long-term growth and then sharing this return. We look forward to seeing many of you at our annual conference for the financial community on February 26. As we have in the past, we will discuss the strategic drivers of our business, public policy that matters to our industry, our strategy to position PSEG for a changing energy environment, as well as the specific market and cost factors that influence us. And now I'll turn the call over to Caroline."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings in the fourth quarter of $0.62 per share versus operating earnings of $0.62 per share in last year's fourth quarter. Our earnings for the fourth quarter brought operating earnings for the full year to $3.12 per share versus operating earnings for 2008 of $3.03 per share. Just to remind you, our operating earnings exclude the impact of the change in value in our NDT investments and obligations, as well as other charges related to the future decommissioning, and any changes in the value of transactions related to our generating assets that don't qualify for hedge accounting, that is their mark-to-market. We also exclude the impact of adjustments to lease reserves, which I'll come back to later in the discussion.  As we've also done throughout the year, we've adjusted the prior-year numbers to make your comparisons easy to follow.  Slide 4 provides a reconciliation of operating incomes to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 10, PSEG Power provides the largest contribution to earnings. For the quarter, Power reported operating earnings of $0.47 per share compared with $0.49 per share last year. PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.13 per share compared to $0.15 per share last year. PSEG Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $0.03 per share compared with a marginal contribution in the year-ago quarter. The parent company reported a loss of $0.01 a share compared with a loss of $0.02 per share in last year's quarter. We have provided you with the waterfall charts on Slides 12 and 13 that take you through the net changes in the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year operating earnings comparisons by major business. But now I'd like to review each company in a little more detail.Starting with Power, as shown on Slide 15, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.47 per share compared with $0.49 per share a year ago. Please note that Power's results for the quarter, the year and the results for the year-ago period now reflect the impact of the October 1 transfer of the Texas gas-fired assets from Holdings to Power. Power's operating earnings for the quarter brought 2009's full year operating earnings to $1.2 billion in line with our guidance. The operating environment, as Ralph said, in the quarter, continue to be challenged by low power prices, as well as the weak economy, although not as challenging as what we experienced in the third quarter when as you recall, weather compounded our difficulties. Power's results for the fourth quarter were affected by those weak power prices, which more than offset an 8% increase in generation. The decline in margin was experienced in the Texas and New York, New England market, $0.02 a share in each market. Margins in PJM, however, increased $0.02 a share, a 3.5% increase quarter-over-quarter. The PJM assets continue to benefit from higher hedge-related prices and a 2% increase in nuclear generation, which together helped to offset a decline in BGS-related volume. The weak economy continued to affect the level of demand, which reduced earnings by an estimated $0.01 per share. The decline in BGS' volumes also reflects the effect of customer migration, which we estimate reduced earnings by $0.02 per share in the quarter. And for the year, we estimate customer migration away from BGS cost us about $0.08 per share.  The earnings impact for the full year reflects a small impact for the first half of the year, or $0.02 per share over that first full six-month period for migration, the third quarter impact of $0.04 per share that we spoke about on the third quarter call and the fourth quarter impact of $0.02 per share.  Despite all of these factors across the year, PGM margins were still up 9% for the year, reflecting our dispatch flexibility and hedging strategies, which offset a decline in demand. Earnings comparisons were also affected by an increase in O&M, depreciation and other miscellaneous items for $0.03 per share. But note that for the full year, Power's O&M expense was, in fact, 2% lower than a year ago. As anticipated, we earned $0.01 per share on trading activities, and coupled with gains this quarter associated with contracting activities, including Power's participation in full requirement auction, these activities together increased earnings by $0.03 per share. As I mentioned, Generation increased 8% during the quarter. Power's nuclear and combined cycle fleet each experienced record levels of output. Generation from the combined cycle fleet, including Texas, increased 29.8% in the quarter. Excluding Texas, output from the combined cycle units in New York and New Jersey increased 47%. The nuclear fleet operated at 92% capacity factor in the quarter versus 91.3% in last year's fourth quarter, bringing the capacity factor for the full year to 93.4%, record performance for the year and in line with our expectations as outlined on the third quarter earnings call.Generation from Power's New Jersey coal units increased during the fourth quarter as compared to earlier in the year as an increase in the cost of gas relative to coal improved the economic dispatch of these units. On an annual basis, as you can see on the slide, coal-fired generation was still below last year's level of output. The increase in generation from the coal-fired stations this quarter, coupled with low pricing, reduced average gross margins for the PJM's New York and New England fleet to $51 per megawatt hour in the quarter from $55 per megawatt hour in last year's quarter, again in line with our expectations. The average gross margin earned on the Texas combined cycle generation declined to $7 per megawatt hour in the quarter from $16 per megawatt hour last year as a result of the decline spark spreads, which we've talked about before. The growth in output during the fourth quarter brought outputs for the full year to 59.8 terawatt hours, 5% decline from 2008's level of generation. Nuclear fleet provided approximately 51% of Power's total generation. The strong performance from nuclear, coupled with lower gas costs, reported annual average gross margins on the PJM's New York and New England fleet of $60 per megawatt hour for the year, slightly higher than the $58 per megawatt hour we were forecasting at the start of the year. To summarize these drivers, we estimate Powers' earnings for the full year were hurt by weak economic conditions, about $0.03 per share; cooler-than-normal weather during the important summer months, about $0.02 per share; and as we said earlier, customer migration at about $0.08 per share. On the other side, we contracting and that dispatch flexibility of the PJM fleet helped results by about $0.08 per share. Now I'll turn to PSE&G.PSE&G reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.13 per share compared with $0.15 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008, as shown on Slide 22. PSE&G's full year 2009 operating earnings were $321 million, also in line with our guidance. Gas margins declined in the fourth quarter by about $0.01 per share. The results were affected by warmer-than-normal weather in this year's fourth quarter compared with colder-than-normal weather experienced in the prior year. The reduction in gas margin was offset by an increase in transmission rates and higher appliance service margin, which together, added about $0.01 per share to earnings. Earnings comparisons were also hurt by an increase in pension expense, which more than offset a reduction in other operation and maintenance expenses and a lower tax rate. These items combined to reduce PSE&G's fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share. Abnormal weather conditions and a weak economy hurt demand in 2009. During the fourth quarter, weather normalized electric demand declined 3.2%, resulting in a 2.5% decline in demand for the full year. Within that total, weather normalized demand from residential electric customers declined by 0.8% for the fourth quarter and 0.9% for the full year. For gas, weather normalized demand increased 1.1% in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 0.7% decline in sales for the full year. Trends in employment and housing tend to be pretty good barometers of the New Jersey economic condition, both are at multi-year lows, although we may not be experiencing a decline as fast as we did earlier in the year, we've not experienced just yet any uptick in growth.Another key developments at the utility, as you're probably aware, the regulatory calendar is full. PSE&G implemented a $23 million increase in transmission revenues effective January 1 as part of its formula rate treatment on increased investment. The New Jersey BPU approved PSE&G's $750 million investment in the Susquehanna to Roseland transmission line on February 11 of this year. The BPU's decision represents a critical milestone in the regulatory approval process. PSE&G also updated its filing with the BPU for an increase in electric and gas revenues totaling $222 million. This updated request reflects the actual results for 12 months ended December 31 of 2009. The update represents an increase in electric revenues of $14 million and a reduction in gas revenues of $23 million from the May 2009 rate filing. PSE&G's request is based on an 11.25% return on equity and a 51.2% equity ratio. Following the normal process for this request, the BPU would be expected to issue a decision in May or June of this year with rates effective midyear. For 2009, for reference, operating earnings provided an earned return on equity of about 8% for our Distribution business and about 11% for our Transmission business.Next, let me turn to PSEG Energy Holdings. Energy Holdings reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $0.03 per share compared to operating earnings of about $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Holdings quarterly earnings were aided by the recognition of gains on the successful termination of two cross-border leases, which amounted to $0.02 per share. Results also benefited from a reduction in O&M expenses and lower interest expense, which added $0.02 per share to earnings. A reduction in the value of our remaining international generation assets lowered earnings by $0.01 a share, and reduced our investment in that asset to a nominal level. The termination of the two leases in the fourth quarter brings the number of leases terminated to 13, 12 in 2009 and one in 2008. Our activity reduced our potential cash tax liability to $660 million. As we've discussed before, if we had not terminated any leases, our potential liability would have risen to more than $1.3 billion. So we have, in fact, cut our risk in half, and as we've said before, we've been using the proceeds from counterparties from those terminations to accomplish this risk reduction.In addition, we still have $320 million on deposit with the IRS to meet any potential tax liability, so think of that as an offset to the $660 million exposure. Also, we have reduced our reserve for lease exposures by $29 million after tax based on a reassessment of risk following the outcome of the favorable court decision late in 2009 for another utility. The net after-tax gain of $29 million is reflected in earnings from continuing operations, but not in operating earnings. In terms of 2010 outlook, as Ralph mentioned, we are providing operating earnings guidance for 2010 of $3 to $3.25 per share. We won't be providing operating earnings guidance by subsidiary until the conclusion of PSE&G's distribution rate case. Overall, our guidance is based on expectations of a modest improvement in demand and normal weather versus the very weak conditions experienced in 2009. We estimate the combination of abnormal weather conditions and a weak economy reduced our 2009 earnings by $0.08 per share at Power and PSE&G. However, 2009's operating earnings also benefited from the $0.13 per share of gains on the termination of leases, which we don't expect to see duplicated in the current year. Remember, we have only five leases left and we do continue to actively manage them. Our ability to control growth and expenses and operate at top quartile levels of performance in many areas of our business provide support for our 2010 earnings guidance. We estimate our O&M, excluding the impact of regulatory recovery clauses for our company as a whole, will be flat year-over-year as it was for the company as a whole for 2009. Finally, a brief comment on financing activity, as you probably are aware, we remained fairly active in the fourth quarter. We eliminated the last piece of long-term debt at the parent with the redemption of $49 million of debt. PSE&G was able to take advantage of attractive debt markets to pre-finance the portion of its 2010 capital needs through the issuance of $250 million of 30-year medium-term notes at a rate of 5.375%. PSE&G also made an early redemption of $44 million of debt. And as I said, we continue to reduce our potential lease-related tax liability with proceeds from the termination of leases. To sum up then at year end, a simple calculation of debt to capital will reveal a reduction in debt to capital to 45% from 49% at the end of 2008, so the balance sheet continues to be strong. That concludes my remarks. And now we look forward to taking your questions."

In terms of our thinking about migration on a year-over-year basis, again, we're not giving detailed aspects of guidance, but I would not expect migration to be a higher impact year-over-year. So I wouldn't expect to see, at this point, delta's year-over-year migration from the level that we have in 2009. And the reason for that is, think about some of what happened in 2009, in the summer quarter, which is our highest demand quarter, there were some very unusual weather conditions, as you may recall, that led to some of the lowest prices we've seen in power during the year were seen in the summer quarter. While at the same time, the BGS price had its summer premium. So the differential or the headroom or the opportunity for migration was the largest in the summer. So what we've seen and we mentioned on the third quarter call was migration of about 11%. That has increased, but at a much slower rate to about 15% of our total load has migrated. But at the same time, keep in mind that, that differential, that price differential, has moderated very significantly. So the opportunity or impact to us from migration is very different right now in our expectations for normal weather and therefore more normal pricing next year than what we experienced in 2009. Again, those were assumptions and estimates, we'll have to see how that plays out over time. And also given the results of the current BGS auction, we'll have some slightly lower pricing in the summer as BGS rolls in with a new auction in June and there's a bit of a moderation in the way the summer premium will be calculated in '10. Again, that will affect that headroom calculation. So year-over-year, we don't see a material impact on a year-over-year basis from migration."

But given that and Power's cash flow, our intention is to keep that kind of debt-to-cap ratio and the kind of FFO to debt that we run at Power trim. So within the context of its business needs, we'll finance it. But you're not going to see it change in terms of its capital structure in any meaningful way because it's obviously critical for us to keep Power well situated as credit rating."

298482,109954499,70928,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2010 of $0.65 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.63 per share earned in 2009’s second quarter.",1059,"Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2010 of $0.65 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.63 per share earned in 2009’s second quarter.
Our operating earnings for the quarter include $0.04 per share of somewhat unusual charges at PSE&G and Power, which Caroline will discuss in greater detail.
Overall, operating earnings in the quarter benefited from extremely warm weather conditions and the availability of our generating facilities to respond to the change in demand. Notwithstanding national GDP growth statistics, the economy does appear to be in a trough.
We experienced the small increase in weather normalized electric sales, but as you know from my constant harping on this issue, weather normalized sales data is as much art as it is science, so it’s too early to be excited about growth.
I do want to recognize the important contribution made by our employees to our results. Their focus on cost control and operational efficiency provides significant support to our earnings.
O&M levels at PSE&G, excluding the one-time charge in the quarter and those of Power, were lower than a year ago as our employees continued to perform at the top of their field. Perhaps the most significant development in the second quarter was that we reached a settlement of PSE&G’s rate case with an increase in rates effective before the start of the critical summer period for electric demand.
The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the settlement of our electric and gas rate case, which provided PSE&G with an annual increase in revenue of $100 million. The agreement provides for a 10.3% return on equity and a 51.2% common equity ratio. The return agreed upon in this case will also be applied to the capital programs approved in 2009 for contemporaneous returns. Those were the capital stimulus, Solar 4 All, and energy efficiency programs, all of which are still underway.
As part of the settlement, we agreed to refund $122 million to electric customers over a 24-month period to resolve an issue held over from electric fee regulation. The rate agreement didn’t provide for the trackers on capital and pension costs, that were part of our request, but the agreement represents a reasonable balance of our needs for an improvement in return and the desire by our customers for a limit on price increases during a still difficult economic period.
We intend to operate within the parameters of the rate agreement, we’ll more closely align our capital and O&M budgets with revenue to ensure our ability to earn the authorized return. As a result, PSE&G will be reducing its distribution related capital expenditures, the portion that is subject to the usual regulatory lag by $140 million a year over 2010, ‘11 and ‘12.
On the transmission front, we notified PJM that the in-service date for the eastern portion of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line will be delayed by two years to mid 2014, given a delay in the receipt of needed environmental permit.
Given this delay in permitting the in-service date for the western portion of the line is also expected to be delayed until mid 2015. We are committed to meeting the long-term reliability requirements of the electric grid in partnership with our regulators and PJM. At this time, we are still assessing the cost and schedule effects on our construction program and it is too soon to provide you with the revised forecast.
Now, with regard to our other major capital programs, we remain on track to complete the construction of the back-end technology projects on our Hudson and Mercer generating units by year end 2010.
The installation of this equipment on these coal facilities will conclude a major upgrade that places PSEG Power in a very good position to meet more restrictive environmental requirements, including EPA’s recently proposed Clean Air Transport Rule. As part of the upgrade of our generating fleet, we are also investing in new peaking generation.
Favorable pricing in the recently concluded RPM auction for the 2013 and 2014 year supported Power’s bid to construct 89 megawatts of peaking capacity at the Kearny Station that will be in service in June of 2013. This is in addition to the 178 megawatts of new peaking capacity that will be placed into service at Kearny in June of 2012. These units will replace older, less efficient capacity.
On a separate matter, but one I suspect you are all following. Markets have steadied over the past month in response to strong weather-related demand, but natural gas pricing remains low in the forward markets and without significant change will affect margins given our base load hedge position beyond 2010 and our continuing hedging program consistent with our established practice. We are responding by controlling the growth in our cost structure without sacrificing the reliability, which is so important to our customers
In conclusion, the location or value of our generating assets was reaffirmed in the last RPM auction and our distribution rate case has been finalized. Our financial position remained strong. Investments at PSE&G are expected to provide for organic growth at returns in line with authorized levels.
We continue to reduce the potential tax risk associated with our lease portfolio. Only three leases remain in our lease portfolio, our LILO, SILO lease portfolio after Holdings terminated one additional lease this quarter.
The results for the first half of the year coupled with the implementation of an increase in electric and gas rates support reaffirmation of our operating earnings guidance for 2010 of $3 to $3.25 per share. Over the long term, we remain advantaged by the location of our assets, the configuration of our fleet of assets, our environmental position and our financial strength.
Now before I turn the call over the Caroline, I would like to say that I was honored and gratified to recently accept on behalf of PSEG’s employees, the 2010 EEI Edison Award. The award represents recognition of the dedication of all 10,000 plus employees to operational excellence, disciplined investment and financial strength. Although, the award acknowledges past accomplishments, the foundation is in place at PSEG to support our goals for improving shareholder value as we work toward protecting the environment and maintaining reliability.
Now, Caroline will review our operating results in further detail.

298482,109954499,70928,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. I’ll now review our quarterly operating earnings, as well as the outlook for full year operating results by subsidiary company. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2010",2669,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. I’ll now review our quarterly operating earnings, as well as the outlook for full year operating results by subsidiary company. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2010 of $0.65 per share versus operating earnings of $0.63 per share in last year’s second quarter.
Slide #4 our deck provides a reconciliation of operating income to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter. As you can see on Slide #9, PSEG Power continues to provide the largest contribution to earnings. Power reported operating earnings of $0.47 per share compared with $0.50 per share last year.
PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.15 per share compared with $0.09 per share last year. Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $0.02 per share compared with $0.04 per share a year ago and the parent company reported earnings of $0.01 per share compared with a negligible contribution to earnings a year ago.
We’ve provided you with a waterfall chart on Slide #11 that takes you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter operating earnings by major business. So now I’ll review each Company in more detail starting with Power.
As shown on Slide #14, Power reported operating earnings for the second quarter of $0.47 per share compared with $0.50 per share a year ago. Please note that Power’s results for the quarter have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the October 1, 2009 transfer of the Texas gas-fired assets from Holdings to Power. As we did in the last quarter, we’ve adjusted the prior-year quarter to include the results from Texas so that you have meaningful year-on-year comparisons.
The operating environment in the quarter benefited from extremely warm weather conditions, sharp contrast to the operating environment of the year ago. A 20% increase in generation volume during the quarter improved Power’s earnings by $0.05 per share.
This increase in volume more than offset the impact of lower power prices, which reduced Power’s quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. The decline in pricing includes the impact of customer migrations away from BGS, which amounted to approximately $0.01 per share, so the net effect of price and volume is an increase of $0.02 per share this quarter.
Just a few words on migration; the impact of migration on Power’s results is slightly higher than our forecast. Although the absolute level of migration, as measured by volume, is in fact in line with our expectations, the base energy price is lower than expected, causing the margin loss from migration to be higher than our previous forecast.
You may recall that we had said that expected margin erosion from migration in 2010 would be no greater than the $0.08 per share impact on earnings experienced during 2009.In other words, we didn’t expect the further decline in year-on-year earnings due to migration. This was based upon the assumption that an increase in customer migration to a level of about 22% to 24% by this quarter would be offset by a smaller pricing differential between BGS and market prices versus last year.
Estimated migration volumes are consistent with our forecast through the second quarter, however, while the differential between BGS and market prices is lower than it was last year, it’s still a wider gap than we expected. So, should the market dynamics continue as they have in the first half of the year, we could experience incremental loss in earnings from the impact of migration for the full year of about $0.02 per share to $0.04 per share, including the $0.01 per share that we reported this quarter.
The increase in volume and lower average prices resulted in gross margins for the quarter of $51 per megawatt hour compared with $63 per megawatt hour during the second quarter of 2009. Power’s gross margins in the quarter were significantly influenced by an increase in generation from its coal-fired fleet and a higher cost of fuel compared with a year ago level and this relationship is shown on Slide #18.
In general, we would not expect to see gross margins on a per megawatt hour basis in 2010 like we saw last year. Margin rates in 2009, a large part reflected extremely low weather-related demand, declining economic activity and comparatively low gas prices relative to cost of coal resulting in a reduced dispatch of our full fleet.
If we look back to the second quarter of 2008, when Power’s fleet dispatch was more similar to the experience we have in 2010, gross margin of $51 per megawatt hour for the second quarter of this year compare well to $50 per megawatt hour for the second quarter of 2008. The decline in Power pricing over the past two years is largely being matched by a decline in fuel cost.
Earnings comparisons and margins in 2010 also reflect an impairment of excess sulfur dioxide emission allowances, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. This was one of the expense items included in operating earnings that Ralph referred to earlier in his comment. The recent release of the EPA’s Transport Rule has had an impact on the trading and value of these allowances.
Half of the total impairment value or about $0.01 per share reduced the gross margin for the assets in PJM in the second quarter results. A decline in margin associated with other trading related activity reduced Power’s earnings during the quarter by $0.02 per share. This represents the mark-to-market of an estimated decline in value on non-BGS related full requirements contract associated with the decline in value.
While these contracts including the impact of the mark-to-market remained profitable, this decline is in line with our experience from earlier in the year. For the most part, we serve these contractual commitments from the market and our approach is to hedge the volume commitment with supply contracts when we enter into the full requirement transaction.
We adjust these hedges as volume shifts as opposed to running the portfolio with any type of over-hedged exposure. An increase in the effective tax rate reduced earnings by $0.02 per share and a decline in depreciation expense and O&M offset an increase in interest expense.
The nuclear generating unit operated by Power performed at an average capacity factor of 88% during the quarter, resulting in a capacity factor of 92.5% for the first half of the year. The results for the quarter include the effect of planned 25-day refueling outage at Salem 1. Including Power’s 50% interest in the Peach Bottom units, the fleet operated at an average capacity factor during the quarter of 92.6%.
Performance in the second half of the year will be impacted by an unplanned 17-day outage at Salem 1 during the month of July to repair a transformer. The unit returned to service on July 24.
The unplanned outage is expected to reduce Salem’s capacity factor for the full year by 5%, however, given year-to-date positive results for the rest of the nuclear fleet, this outage at Salem 1 is expected to lower the full year capacity factor for the fleet by approximately 0.5 percentage point to 91%.
Generation from coal-fired fleet increased 77% during the quarter in response to weather-related demand and an improvement in dark spreads from levels experienced in the second quarter of ‘09. The combined cycle fleet benefited from market opportunities, operating at an average capacity factor of 53% in the quarter.
Power’s operating earnings for 2010, are forecast to be $1.060 billion to $1.135 billion compared to operating earnings for 2009 of $1.205 billion. Full year operating earnings will be affected by continued lower energy prices.
Power’s coal and nuclear production is 100% hedged for 2010 at an average price of $72 per megawatt hour versus average hedge prices for 2009 of $78 per megawatt hour. Included in that calculation, is the fact that the 2007 BGS contract for $98.88 per megawatt hour, which affected Power’s margin through May of this year, was replaced by the 2010 contract for $95.77 per megawatt hour.
Power continues to hedge its expected generation in the future years consistent with past practice. At mid-2010, approximately 66% of Power’s anticipated coal and nuclear generation is hedged for 2011 with hedges in place for about 26% of Power’s anticipated base load generation for 2012.
Power’s full year operating earnings forecast also reflects, factors discussed this morning and last quarter, specifically, the impact of greater than anticipated erosion in margin from BGS customer migration, the impact of volume declines on other full requirements contract, the impact of the unscheduled outage of Salem 1, the impact of a one-time increase in taxes related to the enactment of the health care legislation, which we discussed in the first quarter and the impairment of sulfur-dioxide emission allowances. These items will partially offset by an increase in generation volume, a decline in depreciation expense and continued focus on O&M.
Let’s now turn to PSE&G. PSE&G reported operating earnings for the second quarter of 2010 of $0.15 per share, compared with $0.09 per share for the second quarter of 2009, as shown on Slide #22.
PSE&G’s results were influenced by warmer than normal weather, the Temperature Humidity Index or THI, a measure of heat-related discomfort was 41% above normal during the second quarter and 131% higher than year-ago level.
An increase in weather-related sales added about $0.01 per share. An increase in demand-related revenues aided PSG&E’s earnings by $0.03 per share. Extremely hot periods during the day can have a significant impact on those commercial and industrial build electric demand.
Higher transmission revenues added $0.01 per share to earnings. A decrease in operation and maintenance expense was offset by an increase in depreciation. Included in the second quarter’s O&M expense for PSE&G is a one-time $0.02 per share charge related to expenses disallowed as part of the rate case settlement. PSE&G’s strong expense management enabled the Company to show a decrease in O&M even after absorbing this charge.
On the rate case, just to recap, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved an increase in PSE&G’s electric rate of $73.5 million on June 7th and the BPU subsequently approved an increase in gas rates of $26.5 million on June 18. The rate increase provides for a 10.3% return on equity and a 51.2% equity ratio. As part of the agreement, the rate of return authorized in this case will also apply to the investment programs approved in 2009.
As of June 30th, total expenditures since inception of the capital stimulus and energy efficiency economic stimulus project was $354 million and $44 million, respectively. Spending on solar for all since inception totaled $71 million.
PSE&G also agreed to refund $122 million to electric customers over a 24-month period to resolve a long-standing issue associated with the state’s de-regulation law. The refund was recognized as a charge against income from continuing operations and net income of $0.14 per share in the second quarter and will affect PSE&G’s cash flow over a 24-month period, beginning in June of 2010.
PSE&G earned an average return on equity in its electric and gas distribution businesses of 8.3% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2010. Each 1 percentage point improvement represents $0.07 per share in earnings on an annualized basis.
Turning to guidance for the utility; PSE&G’s operating earnings for 2010 are forecasted to be from $425 million to $455 million compared to 2009’s operating earnings of $321 million.
Operating earnings will be influenced by a full-year return on capital projects approved by the BPU in 2009, the increase in electric and gas distribution rate and increase, an transmission’s revenue effective at the beginning of the year, growth in weather-normalized sales, and continued focus on operating expenses.
PSE&G is in the midst of reviewing its capital and operating expense budget to better align with costs, to ensure its ability to earn its authorized returns. As a result of this review, PSE&G has reduced its projected capital spending on distribution-related projects by $140 million a year over 2010 through 2012. Keep in mind, these are not the cost-related projects those earn contemporaneous returns, spending on those programs continues on schedule.
As Ralph indicated earlier, PSE&G notified PJM that we have not obtained certain environmental approvals that are required for the completion of the Eastern and Western segments of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line in order to meet the June of 2012 in-service date.
Therefore, PSE&G doesn’t expect the Eastern portion of the line to be in service before June of 2014 and doesn’t expect the Western portion of the line to be in service before June of 2015.
PSE&G is reviewing its plans for transmission related capital spending to ensure we are investing sufficiently to support the reliability of the system for our customers and we’ll provide an update of these programs and their capital costs, when our review is complete.
Let’s turn now to PSEG Energy Holdings. Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2010 versus operating earnings of $0.04 per share during the second quarter of 2009. The results for 2009 have been adjusted to reflect the transfer of the Texas gas-fired generating assets to Power during the fourth quarter of ‘09.
The decline in operating earnings for the quarter reflects lower gains on lease sales and lower project earnings, which together reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.05 per share. After-tax benefits associated with the start-up of solar projects in Ohio and Florida added $0.02 per share to earnings. A decline in interest expense aided earnings comparisons by $0.01 per share.
Holdings terminated one cross-border lease during the quarter and the successful termination has reduced Holding’s potential cash tax liability for LILO, SILO leases to $550 million at the end of June, and lease Holdings with only three LILO, SILO leases remaining in the portfolio.
Holding’s operating earnings for 2010 are forecast at $30 million to $40 million compared with 2009’s operating earnings of $43 million. The decline reflects the loss on income of terminated leases and a reduction in the anticipated gains from termination of leases since the majority of these terminations occurred last year.
Finally, operating earnings at the parent company were a penny a share in the second quarter compared to a nominal contribution in the year ago period. For the year, operating earnings are forecast to be in the range of $5 million to $15 million, in line with the $10 million contribution to 2009’s operating earnings from the parent company.
As Ralph indicated, we’re maintaining our forecast of 2010 operating earnings of $3 per share to $3.25 per share. And just to recap; we had some unusual items this quarter which we included in operating earnings in addition to the MTC charge, which is included in income from continuing ops.
Affecting operating earnings, we had a rate case related charge at PSE&G which increased O&M by $0.02 per share and we had the SO2 emission allowance impairment of $0.02 per share, which hurt PSEG Power’s margins in the quarter. But as we said, we did get a boost from the weather of about $0.05 per share to $0.06 per share if you combine the effects at Power and the utility.
Slide #31 provides a breakdown of the expectations for 2010 operating earnings by Company that I just mentioned. A full year improvement in return that PSE&G is expected to offset the impact of lower prices at PSE&G Power and a decline in income from Holding’s leased portfolio.
Finally, just to note, we completed several financings during the quarter at both Power and PSE&G with funds used to finance our capital program and redeem higher cost debt facility. The financings also extended the maturity of our debt profile taking the advantage of the favorable fixed income market conditions that we’ve experienced during the year.
That completes my remarks, and with that, we’re ready for your questions, so I will turn it back over to Trinity to queue to questions.

So as we mentioned we had loss of migration through a level of about 22% to 24% and that’s not inconsistent with our expectations of the volume. The real effect this quarter that you pointed out was a little different than what we thought last quarter when talking about migration is the fact that the prices in the market, the delta between the BGS sort of net realized price and the prices in the market, that gap was a little higher than we thought. That’s what led to the penny this quarter and our guidance expectation that we might in fact see a real decrease this year, year-over-year, back $0.02 to $0.04.
So, the migrations volume is consistent what we saw. The pricing in the market is a little worse, so you have a year-on-year impact. In terms of thinking about the long-term, but we don’t really forecast certainly not beyond this year. I would encourage you to keep in mind that as you think about the whole migration trend and its impact to us, it really depends upon the factors with market prices and the BGS price level.
So, when you look forward in BGS, next year for example, you have the BGS price of $1.11 rolling off and a lower price rolling on, all of that is something to keep in mind as you think about what’s that delta, and you could envision that delta getting smaller. From BGS effect, we obviously can’t forecast the market, but that’s what causes this observed slowdown in the rate of migration from those high levels you saw last year in the second quarter, where we went from essentially almost no migration up to levels of 19% by the end of the year.

So we’ve spent a little under $75 million to date. The delays are likely to result in an increase in cost and some re-arrangement of how that money gets spent and we would not think of it just as a two-year shift out, but in fairness to the state environmental reviews they are asking themselves, well, if you don’t know for sure what and when the Western piece will go into effect and the overall line is needed for reliability, does it make sense to move aggressively on the Eastern piece.
So the real root cause issue, Dan, is the National Park Service I guess they are announcing fall of 2012 is when they will complete their review. Just yesterday they announced, I don’t know if it was six or five alternate scenarios, which we’ll now have to comment on and review.
So the larger transmission projects are exciting challenge, I think, we’ve all known that all along. There is plenty of transmission work to be done at the smaller voltages, but we continue to work with our regulators and work with PJM to make sure the lights down notwithstanding with whatever happened in Maplewood over the last few weeks there, which I’m unaware of, but we’ll find out about it after this call, and so that’s what I say. The real core of the issue is the Park Service delay and the resultant impact it had on the state and then their willingness to try to understand what the overall line benefits will be versus partial line benefit?

I mean PJM does a fairly rigorous engineering analysis and there are reliability concerns. Now that doesn’t mean that on June 12 of 2012 that there will be blackouts. I mean this is all risk-based analysis and clearly the longer you allow uncorrected constraints to persist, the more the risk is of significant events. That doesn’t mean that there will be a significant event.
One could point to the fact that we had a significant event in August of 2003, and you’d have multiple ways of solving reliability concerns. One way is through transmission, another is through pricing signal sent to capacity markets to relieve constraints. So this will have upward pressure on capacity prices. We don’t forecast prices. It will have increased risk on reliability, but I think I am repeating myself too many times that the lights will definitely go out. There are other factors that policymakers have to weigh, some of which are the impacts on National Parks, and that’s the dialogue we find ourselves in there.

These are allowances that came on to our books related to asset acquisitions over a number of years ago. The SO2 market is a traded market, so you observe the prices in the market. They have typically, for many years, been well above the carrying value on our books for these allowances.
What happened, if you look at this market, and there was actually an article in a journal a couple of weeks ago about this, when the EPA draft rules came out, there was an expectation that these allowances would not be able to use for some of the purposes that have previously been thought they would be useful relative to EPA regulations, and so the value of those traded allowances went down very significantly. In fact, if you just look at that value from the beginning of June on the traded markets through the end of June, you would see those allowances and price eroding from the high teens to about $4 and in there that crossed our bases and so we obviously take a look at it.

Now this is somewhat of an anomalous set of circumstances, but if you look at what basis has done in the past few months, you’ve seen them come up quite a bit. Now, what is different about the past few months than what has been in place for the past two years? I still believe that basis has dropped in the past years because you had a drop in demand that creates excess supply in both regions and you had a shift in the marginal unit with coal price to stabilize and to increase and gas prices coming down. So it’s just been the pure fundamental of what’s the marginal unit and what is that marginal unit on basis of fuel and what’s that marginal unit on the basis of demand.
As you’ve seen, as gas comes down and demand has come down, then the East and West probably looking more similar and basis starts to shrink. It’s not a function of demographic shift or locational value or those that are being close to load. And in fact, as we saw 90 degree to 100 degree weather drive demand and gas prices no longer drop, basis resumed its upward march.
So, as we see gas price steady and I think we’ve started to see them steady and as we see a return to demand, which we have not seen in its fully glory quite yet, for the economic reasons we’ve talked about, we’ve started to see a modest upward movement in basis in the out years, not to the levels that we had experienced in ‘08, but we’ve started seeing a modest increase.

The rate case is behind us, and we won’t see another BGS and RPM auction for another 7 months to 10 months.
So we are completely focused right now on O&M control and successfully executing our capital programs. The utility has a lot to do and it’s contemporaneous clause programs, the Solar 4 All energy efficiency and stimulus and it has a fairly robust ongoing transmission construction program. Similarly Power, must finish its BET on time and under budget and lastly Holdings, while it’s completed two solar farms and has one more that we expect to finish sometime in August.
Longer term, our environmental advantages, our portfolio dispatch mix and our location are going to serve us well. We will continue our disciplined hedging strategy. It has helped us avoid precipitous declines in power prices. Candidly, it’ll also have some opportunity costs as there are unexpected spikes in prices, but this will allow us to benefit from long-term price trends, which we believe will be dominated by supply and demand dynamics with a significant environmental overlay, all of which we believe will well position to succeed in.

Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.06 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.92 per share in 2009’s third quar",817,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.06 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.92 per share in 2009’s third quarter. Overall, operating earnings benefited from strong weather related demand. New Jersey experienced the hottest summer on record this year. This stands in contrast to last year’s very cool weather conditions.
For the past three quarters, we’ve been saying the economy appears to have stabilized, well that story remains unchanged. The signals coming from employment levels and housing indicate the economy may have bottomed, but as of yet no signs of a significant recovery have appeared.
Company execution was strong in the quarter. Our fossil generating units in particular were available to respond to the increase in demand and our employees continue to support our results through their constant focus on operating efficiency and cost control.
Capital commitments are being met as well. PSEG Power is in the midst of testing the backend technology installed on the Hudson and Mercer Coal Stations. These units are expected to meet stringent environmental requirements for sulfur, mercury, nitrous oxides in particular. PSEG is in the midst of a $700 million capital program that will produce a 160 megawatts of solar energy.
PSEG Energy Holdings has completed the installation of 29 megawatts of solar capacity in New Jersey, Ohio and Florida, and is reviewing additional PPA supported solar investments. These are but a few examples. Caroline will have more details on the capital program later on.
We’re moving forward with PSEG substantial capital investment and transmission. The update we’re providing you today of PSEG planned capital outlays takes into account the announced reductions in distribution related spending, the delay in construction of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, and PJM’s recently approved reconfiguration of the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson transmission line. The net result will be a capital program yielding annual growth in the utilities rate base of 9.5% per year over 2010 to 2013 with transmission continuing its role as our most significant area of investment.
We continue to reduce our financial risk and maintain our focus on core markets. PSEG Energy Holdings successfully terminated another two cross-border leases during the quarter. Over the past two years, the successful termination of 17 leases has reduced the Holdings’ potential tax liability by $1 billion with one lease remaining in the cross-border lease portfolio.
PSEG Power announced during the quarter that it is exploring the sale of its Texas gas-fired combined cycle generating capacity. If successful, we expect the sale to close during the first quarter of 2011. We’ve been saying that we need us to get bigger in Texas or get out, and we have not found appropriate opportunities to grow in that market. The sale of the Texas assets will reduce the overall size of the portfolio by 2,000 megawatts, but it will improve returns on the portfolio and keep the focus squarely on the markets and assets with the highest value.
Our results for the quarter and year-to-date continued to support our full-year operating earnings guidance of $3 to $3.25 per share. We experienced the benefits of an improvement in weather related demand on pricing this summer, which continues to demonstrate the location of value of our assets. Say it another way, basis returned with demand albeit weather driven.
The power markets, however, remain challenging. The price of natural gas has fallen faster and further than implied by the forward curve. Our reported results continue to benefit from higher priced legacy hedges, which was scheduled to expire in 2011 and 2012. As you know, the relatively high imbedded cost of energy in our hedges under the basic generation service, as we refer to it as BGS contract versus today’s market prices led to the entry of new retail suppliers into the marketplace.
An increase in market penetration by retail supplies accelerates the impact on margins that would happen eventually from the reset of the BGS contract prices. We’re working hard to address the market challenges, we’re focused on reducing O&M without sacrificing reliability, our financial condition remains strong, the markets we serve remain constrained, and we’re well positioned for potential new EPA Regulations.
Our efforts to build an organization that focuses on maximizing efficiency, promoting renewables and building a sustainable energy strategy have not gone unnoticed. PSEG was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Role Index for the first time this year having been on the national index for the prior two years. And PSEG was recognized by the Carbon Disclosure Project for its efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the risks of climate change. We aren’t immune to declining market prices, but we’re well positioned to meet these challenges.
Now, let me turn the call over to Caroline, but I will return prior to the question-and-answer period for a few closing remarks.

I will review our quarterly operating earnings as well as the outlook for full-year results by subsidiary company. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.06 per share versus operating earnings of $0.92 per share in last year’s third quarter.
Slide four provides a reconciliation of operating income to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter. As you can see on slide nine, PSEG Power continues to provide the largest contribution to earnings. Power reported operating earnings of $0.70 per share compared with $0.71 per share last year.
PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.30 per share compared with $0.17 per share last year and Energy Holdings reported operated earnings of $0.5 per share compared with a negligible contribution to earnings a year-ago. The parent company reported earnings of $0.01 a share this year compared with earnings of $0.04 per share a year-ago.
We provided as always the waterfall charts on slides 11 and 12 that take you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date operating earnings by business. And I’ll now go through each company in more detail starting with Power.
As shown on slide 14, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the quarter of $0.70 per share compared with $0.71 per share a year-ago. The operating environment in the quarter benefited from extremely warm weather as Ralph mentioned, a sharp contrast to the operating environment of a year-ago.
A 10% increase in generation volume at spark spreads during the quarter, improved Power’s earnings by $0.04 per share. While we had a 10% increase in generation during the quarter, the improvement came primarily from Power’s coal and gas units. A 17-day unplanned outage at the Salem-1 unit which you may recall we mentioned in the July call reduced generation from the nuclear fleet during the quarter and reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. So given the different field mix and the cost of the outage combined, the increase in output resulted in a net increase in earnings of $0.01 per share.
While we’ve realized the benefit from the net increase in generation, the price received for base load generation declined as a result of lower contract hedge prices versus prior year. This reduced Power’s earnings by $0.04 per share.
We can also see that weather had a positive effect on BGS load, adding $0.03 per share to earnings. Slightly offsetting this was the reduction to BJS results based on the impact of migration which hurt Power’s earnings by $0.01 a share. The impact of migration during the quarter was in line with our revised forecast. We estimate that approximately 22% to 24% of the load supplied through BGS migrated to other suppliers at the end of September, but we don’t have the final September data yet. This is approximately steady with the level we saw as you may recall at the end of the second quarter.
Our forecast assumes further erosion in margin of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter which is consistent with the upper end of our prior guidance of a $0.02-$0.04 per share impact of migration for the full year versus 2009. We’re now forecasting about $0.04.
Market prices for energy remained lower than the embedded price for energy in the BGS contract, and this dynamic has led to the entry of new retail suppliers into the market.
For your modeling purposes, while we don’t specifically forecast migration, keep in mind that each 5% of customer migration from BGS would reduce Power’s earnings by about $0.015 per share on an annualized basis at current prices.
In addition, the continued erosion in margin on certain wholesale electric energy supply contracts reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. Recall that these contracts are marked-to-market. Also realized gains on investments in the Rabi Trust Fund added $0.01 per share to Power’s earnings. And the decline in the effective tax rate aided earnings by about $0.01 a share.
The increase in volume from the fossil fleet and lower average prices resulted in gross margins for the quarter at $57 per megawatt hour compared with $64 per megawatt hour during the third quarter of 2009.
Power’s gross margins were significantly influenced by an increase in generation from its coal-fired fleet and a higher cost of fuel given the outage at Salem-1 versus year-ago levels. Generation from the coal-fired fleet increased 40% during the quarter versus last year in response to weather related demand and an improvement in dark spreads from the levels experienced earlier in the year. The combined cycle fleet also benefited from market opportunities with an 11% increase in generation versus last year and operated at an average capacity factor of 59% in the quarter.
The increase in coal-fired generation for the quarter and year-to-date has reduced our inventory of coal. We’ve also exercised the flexibility that exists in our contracts to reduce delivery of coal and the completion of the backend technology work at Hudson and Mercer this quarter will provide greater flexibility with regard to our coal supply by reducing the need for the low sulfur Indonesian coal burned at Hudson in 2011 when the BET is expected to go into service.
Our coal supply needs over the intermediate term will be lower than historical requirements. Continued weakness in forward dark spreads is expected to reduce coal-fired generation for 2011 to about 8 terawatt to 9 terawatt hours. Our reduction in output has effectively lengthened our supply. Re-contracting an existing supply should be sufficient at this point to meet 2011’s coal requirements.
Power’s operating earnings for 2010 are still forecast at $1.060 billion to $1.135 billion compared to operating earnings for 2009 of $1.205 billion. Full-year operating earnings will be affected by continued lower energy pricing.
Power continues to hedge its expected generation in future years consistent with past practice. At the end of September, approximately 68% of Power’s anticipated coal and nuclear generation for 2011 is hedged at an average price of $71 per megawatt hour. This compares with an average hedged price for energy in 2010 of $72 per megawatt hour. These hedges reflect a PJM West Forward Energy price embedded in BGS of $70 per megawatt hour in 2008, $57 per megawatt hour in 2009, and $50 per megawatt hour in 2010. And as you know the current PJM West Forward prices are in the approximate $40 per megawatt hour range today.
These figures don’t reflect the potential impact of increase bubbles of customer migration, which could reduce the level of power supplied under existing BGS contracts. As I just mentioned, incremental migration equal to about 5% of customer load would reduce earnings by $0.015 per share. If you run out the math, an additional loss of about 15% of load would reduce our averaged hedged price in 2011 to about $67 per megawatt hour.
Now let’s turn to PSE&G. PSE&G reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $0.30 per share compared with $0.17 per share for the third quarter of 2009 as shown on slide 22. PSE&G’s results were influenced by the electric and gas rate relief effective in June and July of 2010 respectively, which improved earnings by $0.05 per share. And earnings also benefited from a return on the capital invested in the capital stimulus, energy efficiency and solar investment programs approved in 2009 by the Board of Public Utilities. And these programs added about $0.01 per share to earnings.
As Ralph mentioned, New Jersey experienced the hottest summer on record in 2010. And we estimate an increase in weather related demand added about $0.03 per share to earnings. An increase in transmission revenues effective at the start of the year added $0.01 per share to earnings this quarter.
A decline in operating and maintenance expense during the quarter improved earnings by $0.02 per share and realized gains on investments in the Rabbi Trust also added $0.02 per share to the utilities’ earnings, and a decline in the effective tax rate added about $0.01 per share. These items more than offset an increase in depreciation and interest expense associated with higher levels of capital investment which together reduced earnings by about $0.02 per share.
PSE&G’s operating earnings for 2010 are forecast at $425 million to $455 million, the same as our prior guidance, compared with 2009’s operating earnings of $321 million. Operating earnings will be influenced by a full year of return on capital projects approved by the BPU in 2009, the June and July 2010 increases in electric and gas distribution rates, an increase in transmission rates, a forecast decline in operating and maintenance expenses, and the weather related impact on sales.
We’ve updated PSE&G’s capital budget for 2010 to 2012, and we’re providing you with our initial forecast of PSE&G’s 2013 capital expenditures.
PSE&G’s revised budget for 2010 to 2012 calls for capital expenditures of $4.5 billion with plans to spend $1.6 billion in 2013, bringing the capital budget for this four-year period to approximately $6.1 billion. And on slide 25, you can see a breakdown of the spending by category and by year. This revised capital program recognizes the two-year delay in the in-service date of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, the reconfiguration and delay in operation of the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson transmission project, and the reduction in distribution spending.
In fact, distribution spending is lower by about $425 million through 2012 versus the prior guidance we gave you earlier in the year. This should increase the proportion of our expenditures that earn a contemporaneous return. For example, transmission related capital spending now represents $3.1 billion or about 50% of the capital budget for the four-year period. Of course, the number of these transmission projects depend upon our receipt of all the necessary approvals.
At the end of 2013, PSE&G’s investment in transmission would represent about 31% of its consolidated rate base. Distribution related capital spending is forecast at $2.2 billion for 2010 to 2013. Future capital spending on distribution is aligned with forecast levels of depreciation to support earning our authorized return.
PSE&G’s investment program is expected to result in annual rate base growth of about 9.5% per year over this period. Supportive regulatory recovery mechanisms and a constant focus on cost control should support PSE&G’s earning us authorized return with growth in capital providing for growth in PSE&G’s earnings. For the past 12-month period, PSE&G’s distribution ROE was 9.5%, reflecting only one quarter of results since the completion of the rate case.
Now, I’ll turn to PSEG Energy Holdings. Energy Holdings reported operated earnings of $24 million or $0.05 per share for the third quarter of 2010 versus an operating loss of $1 million during the third quarter of 2009. Operating earnings benefited from the successful termination of two cross-border leases during the quarter, which resulted in a gain of $0.03 per share, which matched a similar level of termination related gains recorded in the year-ago quarter, and results also benefited from the absence of a premium paid on the debt exchange with Power of $0.04 per share, as well as a decline in interest expense of $0.01 per share.
The successful termination of the two cross-border leases during the quarter reduced Holdings’ potential net cash exposure to $330 million on this issue at the end of September. And recall that Holdings has $320 million on deposit with the IRS to defray potential interest cost associated with this issue.
Holdings’ operating earnings for 2010 are forecast at $30 million to $40 million compared to 2009’s operating earnings of $43 million. The loss of income on terminated leases and a reduction in gains from the termination of leases will be partially offset by lower financing costs and tax benefits from the startup of solar projects in Ohio and Florida.
Finally, few other items. PSEG Power indicated during the quarter that is exploring the potential sale of our two 1,000 megawatt each combined cycle generation facilities in Texas through an auction process. The sale is dependent upon the receipt of offers that we feel reflect the appropriate value for the assets. And should we decide to sell, the schedule would call for closing to occur during the first quarter of 2011.
Finally, just to note, we completed several transactions during the quarter at PSE&G to finance its capital program and refinance high cost debt. We issued $250 million of 10-year paper at 3.5% and refinanced a $100 million of 6.4% tax exempt bonds with the issuance of tax exempt paper as multimode or annual put bonds with an initial term rate of 1.2%.
Holdings recently announced its intention to call debt in December 2010 for the redemption of the remaining $127 million of outstanding principal balance of its 8.5% senior notes that are due in June 2011.
Those conclude my remarks and comments on some of our financings. I’d now like to turn the call back to Ralph for some final comments before of course we open the call up to your questions.

Now, while it isn’t easy to build these lines, we’re committed to investing in the projects that will improve the reliability of our system, and as you can see it remains the single largest capital program for PSE&G. We’ve also provided you with some guidance around the potential impact of migration on our results. While we’re not pleased with the associated loss of margin, the more fundamental concern is the forward price of natural gas and its effect on electricity prices.

Yes, so we’ve talked about some of these before and these are low transactions that we bid on that - in most parts low transactions that we bid on, whose power we supply through the market. And so because they’re not supplied from our assets we treat these on a marked-to-market basis. And so every quarter we’re marking both sides of that transaction to market and we’re putting any changes in that through the P&L. So the primary driver of what you see here in the $0.02 is really a function of the same dynamics that are going on in the base business and that is in these low contracts there is still opportunity for migration out of those types of contracts by the provider. And so, as migration is expected or experienced and then we forecast it going forward to a large extent based on the experience that we have, we reduce the value of those contracts in terms of what they would return to the company and therefore we take that mark because they’re marked-to-market directly in our earnings as we update those forecasts. So think of this as marked-to-market, it’s not cash but it’s the representation - our best representation of the change in value of those contracts primarily driven by the same thing we talk about in the base business which is the migration out of these full requirements polar like contracts.

In terms of how to think about it, as you know from what we have been talking about over the past year, the team’s been working hard to terminate these leases at appropriate term. So as you think about all the leases that we terminated, what’s essentially happened is we reduced our tax liability essentially by the cash received from the counterparties coming in and going out. So if the terms are appropriate, we would look to terminate this last lease but of course, we have to talk to the counterparties if not we keep the lease. One thing to keep in mind though that the termination of the lease, where we are with the IRS, those two things can continue to happen and dependent of each other to some extent. You will have to terminate all your leases to try to have the settlement with the IRS given what we have now our exposure on a total basis is about $330 million and we are continuing to having discussions with the IRS to see if we can come to terms. We will try to do that at the same time, we will continue to try to terminate this lease. So you can really, one is not dependent on the other, you can really pursue both paths and that’s exactly what we are doing.
Given the size of the remaining lease though in terms of its impact to earnings, it will be marginal in terms of what might happen either from its earnings proceeds next year or a termination as you know we have two leases this quarter (inaudible). So it’s really a small number and I think it’s a credit and I think it’s a credit to the team’s work to really bring us down to only lease less.

In terms of the $1.05. So if you think about what our coal and nuclear output, let me just walk you down this a little bit because that may help. That 50% of our coal and nuclear output, in total, coal and nuclear is about 40 terawatt hours a year. So half of its about 20 terawatt hours.
With the migration we’ve already seen in BGS. BGS is about 15 terawatt hours. It used to be half and now it’s less than that because of the migration. So if you take 5% of the 15 terawatt hours and you multiply that out by the Delta in the embedded PJM West price in the BGS contract with the current level of PJM West price. And you rollout that math, you’ll get about a penny and a half. So that’s how we came up with a penny and a half. The 67 that the change in the hedge price was simply running that same sort of thinking and that same sort of calculation by taking that out of the hedged amount that we have pulling that migrating BGS load out of the hedged amount and then recalculating the weighted average hedge prices of portfolio, keeping in mind that the BGS hedge price has more things in it besides just the energy.
All those things we’ve talked about in our bar chart relative to the PJM West hedge which would not have hedge things like pieces in it. So you have just do those, that math in two pieces. So one is about how to do the penny per share, the other is weighted average of our hedge portfolio average price.

No we haven’t really changed the numbers for PEG Power. Keep in mind that we did have some growth spending in there, wouldn’t change because of taxes as the growth spending is essentially things like nuclear up rates at our nuclear at Peach Bottom in particular, and the peakers that we bid in successfully in the last two RPM auctions. They’re the primary drivers of the growth CapEx going forward. The other thing that we’ve noted a lot and it’s in the table that we put in the cay and still relevant is the decrease in the environmental spending, environmental CapEx because the VETs (ph) are essentially complete at the end of this year. So that number comes down, as you think about that also for going forward keep in mind what that also means is those assets go into service and of course then they start to become depreciated as well.
So that’s essentially the story on power. And it really has not significantly changed. The peakers and the up rates on the growth capital, the environmental spend winds down. It’s actually part of the reason why we’re able to do what we’re doing which is to fund these utility allow it to grow while still maintaining the balance sheet that we have.

Good morning, and thank you, everyone for joining us today.

Good morning, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. Earlier this month, we reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.06 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.92 per share in 2009's third quarter. Overall, operating earnings benefited from strong weather-related demand. New Jersey experienced the hottest summer on record this year. This stands in contrast to last year's very cool weather conditions.
For the past 3 quarters, we we've saying the economy appears to have stabilized, well that story remains unchanged. The signals coming from employment levels and housing indicate the economy may have bottomed, but as of yet, no signs of a significant recovery have appeared. Company execution was strong in the quarter. Our fossil generating units in particular were available to respond to the increase in demand. And our employees continue to support our results through their constant focus on operating efficiency and cost control. Capital commitments are being met as well. PSEG Power is in the midst of testing the backend technology installed on the Hudson and Mercer Gold stations. These units are expected to meet stringent environmental requirements for sulfur, mercury, nitrous oxides, in particular. PSEG is in the midst of a midst of a $700 million capital program that will produce a 160 megawatts of solar energy. PSEG Energy Holdings has completed the installation of 29 megawatts of solar capacity in New Jersey, Ohio and Florida and is reviewing additional PPA supported solar investments. These are both a few examples: We'll have more details on the capital program later on.
We're moving forward with PSEG substantial capital investment and transmission. The update we're providing you today of PSEG planned capital outlays takes into account the announced reductions and distribution related spending, the delay in construction of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, and PJM's recently approved reconfiguration of the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson transmission line. The net result will be a capital program yielding annual growth and the utilities the rate base of 9.5% per year over 2010 to 2013, with transmission continuing its role as our most significant area of investment.
We continue to reduce our financial risk and maintain our focus on core markets. PSEG Energy Holdings successfully terminated another 2 cross-border leases during the quarter. Over the past 2 years, the successful termination of 17 leases has reduced Holdings potential tax liability by $1 billion, with one lease remaining in the cross-border lease portfolio.
PSEG Power announced during the quarter, that it is exploring the sale of its Texas Gaspard combined cycle generating capacity. If successful, we expect the sale to close in the first quarter of 2011. We've been saying that we need to get it bigger in Texas or to get out, and we have not found appropriate opportunities to grow in that market. The sales of the Texas assets will reduce overall size of the of the portfolio by 2,000 megawatts, but it will improve returns on the portfolio and keep the focus squarely on the markets and assets with the highest value. Our results for the quarter and year-to-date continue to support our full-year operating earnings guidance of $3 to $3.25 per share. We experienced the benefits on an improvement in weather-related demand on our pricing this summer, which continues to demonstrate the location of value of our assets. This is said another way, basis returned with demand, albeit at weather driven. 
The Power markets to however, remain challenging. The price is natural gas is falling faster and further that implied by the forward curve. Our reported results continue to benefit from higher priced legacy hedges which was scheduled to expire in 2011 and 2012. As you know, the relatively high embedded cost of energy in our hedges under the Basic Generation Service, as we refer to the BGS contract, versus today's market prices led to the entry of new retail suppliers into the marketplace. An increase in market penetration by retail supplies accelerates the impact on margins that would happen eventually from the reset of the BGS contract prices. We're working hard to address the market challenges. We're focused on reducing O&M without sacrificing reliability, our financial condition remains strong, the markets we serve rimming to constrain, and we are well-positioned for the potential new EPA regulations.
Our efforts to build an organization that focuses on maximizing efficiency, promoting renewables and building a sustainable energy strategy have not gone unnoticed. Just PSEG was added to the Dow Jones' sustainability world Index for the first time this year, having been on the national index for the prior 2 years. And PSEG was recognized by the Carbon Disclosure Project for its efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the risks of climate change. We aren't immune to decline in market prices, but we are well-positioned to be to meet these challenges. Now let me turn the call over to Caroline, but I will return prior to the question-and-answer period for a few closing remarks."

I will review our quarterly operating earnings, as well as the outlook for full-year results by subsidiary company. As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.06 per share versus operating earnings of $0.92 per share in last year's third quarter. 
Slide 4 provides the reconciliation of operating income to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 9, PSEG Power continues to provide the largest contribution to earnings. Power reported operating earnings of $0.70 per share, compared with $0.71 per share last year.
PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.30 per share, compared to $0.17 per share last year. And Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $0.05 per share compared with a negligible contribution to earnings a year ago. The parent company reported earnings of $0.01 per share this year compared with earnings of $0.04 per share a year ago. We provided as always, the waterfall charts on slides 11 and 12 that take you through the neck changes in quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date operating earnings by business. And now I'll go through each company in more detail starting with Power.
As shown on Slide 14, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the quarter of $0.70 per share compared with $0.71 per share a year ago. The operating environment in the quarter benefited from extremely warm weather as Ralph mentioned, a sharp contrast to the operating environment of a year ago. A 10% increase in generation volume at Sparks spreads during the quarter improved Power's earnings by $0.04 per share. While we had a 10% increase in generation during the quarter, the improvement came primarily from Power's coal and gas units. A 17 day unplanned outage at the Salem 1 unit, which you may recall we mentioned in the July call, reduced generation from the nuclear fleet during the quarter, and reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. So given the different fuel mix of the cost of the outage combined, the increase in output resulted in a net increase and earnings of $0.01 per share.
While we realize the benefit from the net increase in generation, the price received for base load generation declined as a result of lower contract hedged prices versus prior year. This reduced Power's earnings by $0.04 per share. We can also see that weather had a positive effect on BGS load, adding $0.03 per share to earnings. Slightly offsetting this was the reduction to BGS results based on the impact of migration, which hurt Power's earnings by $0.01 per share. The impact of migration during the quarter, was in line with our revised forecast. We estimate that approximately 22% to 24% of the loads supplied to BGS migrated to other suppliers at the end of September, but we don't have the final September data yet. This is approximately steady with the level we saw as you may recall at the end of the second quarter.
Our forecast assumes further erosion on margin of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with the upper end of our prior guidance of a $0.02 to $0.04 per share impact of migration for the full year versus 2009. We're now forecasting about $0.04.
Market prices for energy remain lower than the embedded price for energy in the BGS contract, and this dynamic has led to the entry of new retail suppliers into the market. For your modeling purposes, while we don't specifically forecast migration, keep in mind that each 5% of customer migration from BGS would reduce Power's earnings by about a $1.05 per share on an annualized basis at current prices.
In addition, the continued erosion in margin on certain wholesale electric energy supply contracts reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. Recall that these contracts are market to market. Also, realized gains on investments in the Rabbi Trust fund added $0.01 per share to Power's earnings. And the decline in the effective tax rate aided earnings by about $0.01 per share. The increase in volume from the fossil fleet and lower average prices resulted in gross margins for the quarter, a $57 per megawatt hour, compared with $64 per megawatt hour during the third quarter of 2009. Power's gross margins were significantly increased -- by influenced by an increase in generation from coal-fired fleet at a higher cost of fuel given the outage of Salem 1 versus year-ago levels. Generation from coal-fired fleets increased 40% during the quarter, versus last year in response to weather-related demand and an improvement in dark spreads from the levels experienced earlier in the year. The combined cycle fleet also benefited from market opportunities with an 11% increase in generation versus last year, and operated at an average capacity factor of 59% in the quarter.
The increase in coal-fired generation for the quarter and year-to-date has reduced our inventory of coal. We've also exercise the flexibility that exists in our contracts reduced delivery of coal. And the completion of the back end technology work at Hudson and Mercer this quarter will provide greater flexibility with regard to our coal supplied by reducing the need for the low sulfur Indonesian coal burned at Hudson in 2011 when the BET is expected to go into service.
Our coal supply needs over the intermediate term will be lower than historical requirements. Continued weakness in forward dark spreads is expected to reduce coal-fired generation for 2011 to about 8 to 9 terawatt hours. A reduction in output has effectively like that our supply, recontracting and existing supply should be sufficient at this point to meet 2011's coal requirements.
Power's operating earnings for 2010 are still forecast at $1.60 billion to $1.135 billion compared to operating earnings for the 2009 of $1.205 billion. Full-year operating earnings will be affected by continued lower energy pricing. Power continues to hedge its expected generation in future years, consistent with past practice. At the end of September, approximately 68% of Power's anticipated coal and nuclear generation for 2011 is hedged at an average price of $71 per megawatt hour. This compares with an average hedged price for energy in 2010 of $72 per megawatt hour. These hedges reflect a PJM West Forward Energy price embedded in BGS of $70 per megawatt hour in 2008, $57 per megawatt hour in 2009, and $50 per megawatt hour in 2010. And as you know, the current PJM West forward prices are is approximately $40 per megawatt hour range today.
These figures don't reflect the potential impact of increased levels of customer migration, which could reduce the level of Power supplied under existing BGS contracts. As I just mentioned, incremental migration equal to about 5% of customer load would reduce earnings by $0.015 per share. If you run out of the math, an additional loss of about 50% of load would reduce our average hedged price in 2011 to about $67 per megawatt hour.
Now let's turn to PSE&G. PSE&G reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $0.30 per share, compared with $0.17 per share for the third quarter of 2009, as shown on Slide 22. PSE&G's results were influenced by the electric and gas rate relief effective in June and July of 2010, respectively, which improves earnings by $0.05 per share. And earnings also benefited from a return on a capital invested in the capital stimulus, energy efficiency and solar investment programs approved in 2009 by the Board of Public Utilities. And these programs added about $0.01 per share to earnings.
As Ralph mentioned, New Jersey experienced the hottest summer on record in 2010. And we estimate an increase in weather-related demand added about $0.03 per share to earnings. An increase in transmission revenues effective at the start of the year, added $0.01 per share to earnings this quarter.
A decline in operating and maintenance expense during the quarter, improved earnings by $0.02 per share, and realized gains on investments in the Rabbi Trust also added $0.02 per share for the Utility's earnings. And the decline in the effective tax rate added about $0.01 per share. These items more than offset an increase in depreciation and interest expense associated with higher levels of capital investment, which together reduce earnings by about $0.02 per share.
PSE&G's operating earnings for 2010 are forecast at $425 million to $455 million, the same as our prior guidance compared with 2009's operating earnings of $321 million. Operating earnings will be influenced by a full year of return on capital projects approved by the BPU in 2009, the June and July 2010 increases in electric and gas distribution rates, an increase in transmission rates, a forecast decline in operating and maintenance expenses, and the weather-related impact on sales.
We've updated PSE&Gs capital budget for 2010 to 2012, and we're providing you with initial forecast of PSE&Gs 2013 capital expenditures.
PSE&G's revised budget for 2010 to 2012 calls for capital expenditures of $4.5 billion with plans to spend $1.6 billion in 2013, bringing the capital budget for this 4-year period to approximately $6.1 billion. And on Slide 25, you can see a breakdown of the spending by category and by year. This revised capital program recognizes the two-year delay in the in-service date of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, the reconfiguration and delay in operation of the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson transmission project, and the reduction in distribution spending.
In fact, distributions it spending is lower by about $425 million through 2012 versus the prior guidance we gave you earlier in the year. This should increase the proportion of our expenditures that earn a contemporaneous return. For example, transmission-related capital spending now represents $3.1 billion, or about 50% of the capital budget for the 4 year period. Of course the number of these transmission projects depend upon our receipt of all the necessary approvals.
At the end of 2013, PSE&G's investment and transmission will represent about 31% of its consolidated rate base. Distribution-related capital spending is forecast at $2.2 billion for 2010 to 2013. Future capital spending on distribution is aligned with the forecast levels of depreciation to support earning our authorized return.
PSE&G's investment program is expected to result in annual rate-based growth of about 9.5% per year over this period. Supportive regulatory recovery mechanisms and a constant focus on cost control should support PSE&G's earning its authorized return with growth in capital providing for growth in PSE&G's earnings. In the past 12 month period, PSE&G's distribution ROE was 9.5%, reflecting only one quarter of results is the completion of the rate case. 
Now I'll turn to PSEG Energy Holdings. Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $24 million, or $0.05 per share for the third quarter of 2010, versus an operating loss of $1 million during the third quarter of 2009. Operating earnings benefited from the successful termination of 2 cross-border leases during the quarter, which resulted in a gain of $0.03 per share, which matched the similar level termination related gains recorded in the year ago quarter. And results also benefited from the absence of a premium paid on the debt exchange with Power of $0.04 per share, as well as the decline in interest expense of $0.01 per share.
The successful termination of the 2 cross-border leases during the quarter, reduced Holdings' potential net cash exposure to $330 million on this issue at the end of September. And recall that Holdings has $320 million on deposit with the IRS to defray potential interest cost associated with this issue.
Holdings operating earnings for 2010 are forecast at $30 million to $40 million compared to 2009's operating earnings of $43 million. The loss of income on terminated leases and a reduction in gains from the termination of leases will be partially offset by lower financing costs and tax benefits from a startup of solar projects in Ohio and Florida.
Finally, a few other items. PSEG Power indicated during the quarter, that it is exploring the potential sale of our two 1,000 MW each combined cycle generation facilities in Texas through an auction process. The sales dependent upon the receipt of offers that we feel reflect the appropriate value for the assets. And should we decide to sell, the scheduled would call for closing to occur during the first quarter of 2011. Finally, just in the, we completed several transactions during the quarter, at PSE&G to finance its capital program and refinance high cost debt. We issued $250 million of 10-year paper at 3.5%, and refinanced the $100 million of 6.4% tax exempt bonds with the issuance of tax exempt paper as multi-mode or annual put bonds with an initial term rate of 1.2%. Holdings recently announced its intention to call debt in December 2010 for the redemption of the remaining $127 million of outstanding principal balance of its 8.5% senior notes that are due in June 2011. Those conclude my remarks and comments on some of our financings. I now like to turn the call back to Ralph for some final comments before of course we open the call up to your questions."

In terms of how to think about it, from what we've talking about over the past year, the teams that it's been working hard to terminate these leases at appropriate term. So as you think about all the leases that we've terminated, what's essentially happened is we reduced our tax liability essentially by the cash received from the counterparties coming in and going out. So if the terms are appropriate, we would look to terminate this last lease but of course, we have to talk to the counterparties. If not, we keep the lease. One thing to keep in mind though, that the termination of the lease -- where we are with the IRS, those 2 things continue to happen, independent on each other to some extent, obviously we have to terminate all the lease is to try to have that the IRS given what we have now our exposure on a total basis is about $330 million and we're continuing to have discussions with the IRS is to see if we can come to terms, we'll try to do that but at the same time, we'll continue to try to terminate this lease. So you can really what is that dependent on the other, you can really pursue was blessed that's exactly what we're doing. Given the size of the remaining lease though, in terms of impacted earnings, that will be marginal in terms of what might happen either from its earnings proceeds next year or termination as you know, we have to leases this quarter and $0.03. So it's really a small number, and I think it's a credit to the team's work to really bring us down to lease less."

Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.06 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.92 per share in 2009's third qua",812,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.06 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.92 per share in 2009's third quarter. Overall, operating earnings benefited from strong weather-related demand. New Jersey experienced the hottest summer on record this year. This stands in contrast to last year's very cool weather conditions.
For the past 3 quarters, we've been saying the economy appears to have stabilized. Well, that story remains unchanged. The signals coming from employment levels and housing indicate the economy may have bottomed, but as of yet, no signs of a significant recovery have appeared. Company execution was strong in the quarter. Our fossil generating units, in particular, were available to respond to the increase in demand, and our employees continue to support our results through their constant focus on operating efficiency and cost control.
Capital commitments are being met as well. PSEG Power is in the midst of testing the back-end technology installed on the Hudson and Mercer coal stations. These units are expected to meet stringent environmental requirements for sulfur, mercury, nitrous oxides, in particular. PSEG is in the midst of a $700 million capital program that will produce a 160 megawatts of solar energy. PSEG Energy Holdings has completed the installation of 29 megawatts of solar capacity in New Jersey, Ohio and Florida and is reviewing additional PPA-supported solar investments. These are but a few examples. Caroline will have more details on the capital program later on.
We're moving forward with PSEG's substantial capital investment and transmission. The update we're providing you today of PSEG's planned capital outlays takes into account the announced reductions and distribution-related spending, the delay in construction of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line and PJM's recently approved reconfiguration of the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson transmission line. The net result will be a capital program yielding annual growth and the utilities rate base of 9.5% per year over 2010 to 2013, with transmission continuing its role as our most significant area of investment.
We continue to reduce our financial risk and maintain our focus on core markets. PSEG Energy Holdings successfully terminated another 2 cross-border leases during the quarter. Over the past 2 years, the successful termination of 17 leases has reduced Holdings' potential tax liability by $1 billion, with one lease remaining in the cross-border lease portfolio.
PSEG Power announced during the quarter that it is exploring the sale of its Texas gas-fired combined cycle generating capacity. If successful, we expect the sale to close during the first quarter of 2011. We've been saying that we need to just get bigger in Texas or to get out, and we have not found appropriate opportunities to grow in that market. The sales of the Texas assets will reduce the overall size of the portfolio by 2,000 megawatts, but it will improve returns on the portfolio and keep the focus squarely on the markets and assets with the highest value.
Our results for the quarter and year-to-date continue to support our full year operating earnings guidance of $3 to $3.25 per share. We experienced the benefits on an improvement in weather-related demand on pricing this summer, which continues to demonstrate the location of value of our assets. Said another way, basis returned with demand, albeit weather-driven.
The power markets, however, remain challenging. The price of natural gas is falling faster and further than implied by the forward curve. Our reported results continue to benefit from higher-priced legacy hedges, which are scheduled to expire in 2011 and 2012. As you know, the relatively high embedded cost of energy in our hedges under the Basic Generation Service, as we refer to as the BGS contract, versus today's market prices led to the entry of new retail suppliers into the marketplace. An increase in market penetration by retail suppliers accelerates the impact on margins that would happen eventually from the reset of the BGS contract prices. We're working hard to address the market challenges. We're focused on reducing our O&M without sacrificing reliability. Our financial condition remains strong, the markets we serve remain constrained, and we're well positioned for potential new EPA regulations.
Our efforts to build an organization that focuses on maximizing efficiency, promoting renewables and building a sustainable energy strategy have not gone unnoticed. PSEG was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time this year, having been on the national index for the prior 2 years, and PSEG was recognized by the Carbon Disclosure Project for its efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the risks of climate change. We aren't immune to declining market prices, but we're well positioned to meet these challenges.
Now let me turn the call over to Caroline, but I will return prior to the question-and-answer period for a few closing remarks."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.06 per share versus operating earnings with $0.92 per share in last year's third quarter.
Slide 4 provides the reconciliation of operating income to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 9, PSEG Power continues to provide the largest contribution to earnings. Power reported operating earnings of $0.70 per share compared with $0.71 per share last year.
PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.30 per share compared to $0.17 per share last year. And Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $0.05 per share compared with a negligible contribution to earnings a year ago. The parent company reported earnings of $0.01 a share this year compared with earnings of $0.04 per share a year ago. We provided, as always, the waterfall charts on Slides 11 and 12 that take you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date operating earnings by business. And I'll now go through each company in more detail, starting with Power.
As shown on Slide 14, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the quarter of $0.70 per share compared with $0.71 per share a year ago. The operating environment in the quarter benefited from extremely warm weather, as Ralph mentioned, a sharp contrast to the operating environment of a year ago. A 10% increase in generation volume at sparks spreads during the quarter improved Power's earnings by $0.04 per share. While we had a 10% increase in generation during the quarter, the improvement came primarily from Power's coal and gas units. A 17-day unplanned outage at the Salem 1 unit, which you may recall we mentioned in the July call, reduced generation from the nuclear fleet during the quarter and reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. So given the different fuel mix and the cost of the outage combined, the increase in output resulted in a net increase and earnings of $0.01 per share.
While we realize the benefit from the net increase in generation, the price received for base load generation declined as a result of lower contract hedged prices versus prior year. This reduced Power's earnings by $0.04 per share. We can also see that weather had a positive effect on BGS load, adding $0.03 per share to earnings. Slightly offsetting this was the reduction to BGS results based on the impact of migration, which hurt Power's earnings by $0.01 per share. The impact of migration during the quarter was in line with our revised forecast. We estimate that approximately 22% to 24% of the loads supplied through BGS migrated to other suppliers at the end of September, but we don't have the final September data yet. This is approximately steady with the level we saw, as you may recall, at the end of the second quarter.
Our forecast assumes further erosion in margin of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with the upper end of our prior guidance of a $0.02 to $0.04 per share impact of migration for the full year versus 2009. We're now forecasting about $0.04.
Market prices for energy remain lower than the embedded price for energy in the BGS contract, and this dynamic has led to the entry of new retail suppliers into the market. For your modeling purposes, while we don't specifically forecast migration, keep in mind that each 5% of customer migration from BGS would reduce Power's earnings by about a $0.015 per share on an annualized basis at current prices.
In addition, the continued erosion in margin on certain wholesale electric energy supply contracts reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. Recall that these contracts are marked to market. Also, realized gains on investments in the Rabbi Trust fund added $0.01 per share to Power's earnings, and the decline in the effective tax rate aided earnings by about $0.01 per share.
The increase in volume from the fossil fleet and lower average prices resulted in gross margins from the -- for the quarter a $57 per megawatt hour compared with $64 per megawatt hour during the third quarter of 2009. Power's gross margins were significantly increased by -- influenced by an increase in generation from its coal-fired fleet and a higher cost of fuel, given the outage of Salem 1 versus year-ago levels. Generation from the coal-fired fleet increased 40% during the quarter versus last year in response to weather-related demand and an improvement in dark spreads from the levels experienced earlier in the year. The combined cycle fleet also benefited from market opportunities with an 11% increase in generation versus last year and operated at an average capacity factor of 59% in the quarter.
The increase in coal-fired generation for the quarter and year-to-date has reduced our inventory of coal. We've also exercised the flexibility that exists in our contracts to reduce delivery of coal. And the completion of the back-end technology work at Hudson and Mercer this quarter will provide greater flexibility with regard to our coal supply by reducing the need for the low-sulfur Indonesian coal burned at Hudson in 2011 when the BET is expected to go into service.
Our coal supply needs over the intermediate term will be lower than historical requirements. Continued weakness in forward dark spreads is expected to reduce coal-fired generation for 2011 to about 8 to 9 terawatt hours. A reduction in output has effectively lengthened our supply. Re-contracting an existing supply should be sufficient at this point to meet 2011's coal requirements.
Power's operating earnings for 2010 are still forecast at $1.060 billion to $1.135 billion compared to operating earnings for 2009 of $1.205 billion. Full year operating earnings will be affected by continued lower energy pricing.
Power continues to hedge its expected generation in future years, consistent with past practice. At the end of September, approximately 68% of Power's anticipated coal and nuclear generation for 2011 is hedged at an average price of $71 per megawatt hour. This compares with an average hedged price for energy in 2010 of $72 per megawatt hour. These hedges reflect a PGM -- PJM West Forward Energy Price embedded in BGS of $70 per megawatt hour in 2008, $57 per megawatt hour in 2009 and $50 per megawatt hour in 2010. And as you know, the current PJM West Forward Prices are in the approximate $40 per megawatt hour range today.
These figures don't reflect the potential impact of increased levels of customer migration, which could reduce the level of Power supplied under existing BGS contracts. As I just mentioned, incremental migration equal to about 5% of customer load would reduce earnings by $0.015 per share. If you run out the math, an additional loss of about 15% of load would reduce our average hedged price in 2011 to about $67 per megawatt hour.
Now let's turn to PSE&G. PSE&G reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $0.30 per share compared with $0.17 per share for the third quarter of 2009, as shown on Slide 22. PSE&G's results were influenced by the electric and gas rate relief effective in June and July of 2010, respectively, which improved earnings by $0.05 per share. And earnings also benefited from a return on the capital invested in the capital stimulus, energy efficiency and solar investment programs approved in 2009 by the Board of Public Utilities. And these programs added about $0.01 per share to earnings.
As Ralph mentioned, New Jersey experienced the hottest summer on record in 2010. And we estimate an increase in weather-related demand added about $0.03 per share to earnings. An increase in transmission revenues effective at the start of the year added $0.01 per share to earnings this quarter.
A decline in operating and maintenance expense during the quarter improved earnings by $0.02 per share, and realized gains on investments in the Rabbi Trust also added $0.02 per share to the utility's earnings. And the decline in the effective tax rate added about $0.01 per share. These items more than offset an increase in depreciation and interest expense associated with higher levels of capital investment, which together reduced earnings by about $0.02 per share.
PSE&G's operating earnings for 2010 are forecast at $425 million to $455 million, the same as our prior guidance, compared with 2009's operating earnings of $321 million. Operating earnings will be influenced by a full year of return on capital projects approved by the BPU in 2009, the June and July 2010 increases in electric and gas distribution rates, an increase in transmission rates, a forecast decline in operating and maintenance expenses and the weather-related impact on sales.
We've updated PSE&G's capital budget for 2010 to 2012, and we're providing you with our initial forecast of PSE&G's 2013 capital expenditures. PSE&G's revised budget for 2010 to 2012 calls for capital expenditures of $4.5 billion, with plans to spend $1.6 billion in 2013, bringing the capital budget for this 4-year period to approximately $6.1 billion. And on Slide 25, you can see a breakdown of the spending by category and by year. This revised capital program recognizes the 2-year delay in the in-service date of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, the reconfiguration and delay in operation of the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson transmission project and the reduction in distribution spending.
In fact, distribution spending is lower by about $425 million through 2012 versus the prior guidance we gave you earlier in the year. This should increase the proportion of our expenditures that earn a contemporaneous return. For example, transmission-related capital spending now represents $3.1 billion or about 50% of the capital budget for the 4-year period. Of course the number of these transmission projects depend upon our receipt of all the necessary approvals.
At the end of 2013, PSE&G's investment in transmission would represent about 31% of its consolidated rate base. Distribution-related capital spending is forecast at $2.2 billion for 2010 to 2013.
Future capital spending on distribution is aligned with the forecast levels of depreciation to support earning our authorized return.
PSE&G's investment program is expected to result in annual rate-based growth of about 9.5% per year over this period. Supportive regulatory recovery mechanisms and a constant focus on cost control should support PSE&G's earning its authorized return, with growth in capital providing for growth in PSE&G's earnings. For the past 12-month period, PSE&G's distribution ROE was 9.5%, reflecting only one quarter of results since the completion of the rate case.
Now I'll turn to PSEG Energy Holdings. Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $24 million or $0.05 per share for the third quarter of 2010 versus an operating loss of $1 million during the third quarter of 2009. Operating earnings benefited from the successful termination of 2 cross-border leases during the quarter, which resulted in a gain of $0.03 per share, which matched the similar level of termination-related gains recorded in the year-ago quarter. And results also benefited from the absence of a premium paid on the debt exchange with Power of $0.04 per share as well as a decline in interest expense of $0.01 per share.
The successful termination of the 2 cross-border leases during the quarter reduced Holdings' potential net cash exposure to $330 million on this issue at the end of September. And recall that Holdings has $320 million on deposit with the IRS to defray potential interest costs associated with this issue.
Holdings' operating earnings for 2010 are forecast at $30 million to $40 million compared to 2009's operating earnings of $43 million. The loss of income on terminated leases and a reduction in gains from the termination of leases will be partially offset by lower financing costs and tax benefits from the startup of solar projects in Ohio and Florida.
Finally, a few other items. PSEG Power indicated during the quarter that it's exploring the potential sale of our two 1,000 megawatt each combined cycle generation facilities in Texas through an auction process. The sale is dependent upon the receipt of offers that we feel reflect the appropriate value for the assets. And should we decide to sell, the schedule would call for closing to occur during the first quarter of 2011.
Finally, just to note, we completed several transactions during the quarter at PSE&G to finance its capital program and refinance high-cost debt. We issued $250 million of tenure paper at 3.5% and refinanced $100 million of 6.4% tax-exempt bonds with the issuance of tax-exempt paper as multi-mode or annual put bonds with an initial term rate of 1.2%. Holdings recently announced its intention to call debt in December 2010 for the redemption of the remaining $127 million of outstanding principal balance of its 8.5% senior notes that are due in June 2011.
Those conclude my remarks and comments on some of our financings. I'd now like to turn the call back to Ralph for some final comments before, of course, we open the call up to your questions."

So in these numbers that we included on Slide 25, just for your information, for Susquehanna-Roseland, we estimate that about $550 million of the total of up to $750 million is in the numbers through 2013, and for Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson, about $250 million to $275 million of the total of $700 million is in the numbers through 2013. So there is some spend, as you would expect, on these projects that's outside our forecast period through 2013, given their in-service states. So if you look at those 2 big amounts and you look at this CapEx for transmission just so you can keep the time here in proportionality, that might be helpful."

And so every quarter, we are marking both sides of that transaction to market, and we're putting any changes in that through the P&L. So the primary driver of what you see here in the $0.02 is really a function of the same dynamics that are going on in the base business, and that is, in these low contracts, there is still opportunity for migration out of those types of account contracts by the provider. And so as migration is expected or experienced, and then we forecast it going forward to a large extent based on the experience that we have. We reduced the value of those contracts in terms of what they would return to the company, and therefore, we take that mark because they are marked to market directly in our earnings as we update those forecasts. So think of this as mark-to-market. It's not cash, but it's the representation, our best representation of the change in value of those contracts primarily driven by the same thing we talk about in the base business, which is the migration out of these full-requirement, polar-like contracts."

In terms of to think about it, as you know, from what we've talking about over the past year, the team's been working hard to terminate these leases at appropriate terms.

So if the terms are appropriate, we would look to terminate this last lease, but of course, we have to talk to the counterparties. If not, we keep the lease. One thing to keep in mind, though, that the termination of the lease and where we are with the IRS, those 2 things can continue to happen independent of each other to some extent. Now you still have to terminate all your leases to try to have the settlement with the IRS. Given what we have now, our exposure on a total basis is about $330 million, and we're continuing to have discussions with the IRS to see if we can come to terms. We'll try to do that. At the same time, we'll continue to try to terminate this lease. So you can really -- one is not dependent on the other, you can really pursue both paths, and that's exactly what we're doing. Given the size of the remaining lease, though, in terms of it impact to earnings, it will be marginal in terms of what might happen either from its earnings proceeds next year or termination.

So just to clarify, just to give you some pieces of the math, maybe just to help you to think that through. In terms of the $0.015, so if you think about what our coal and nuclear output, let me just walk you down just a little bit because that may help. About 50% of our coal and nuclear output -- in total, coal and nuclear is about 40 terawatt hours a year, so half of it's about 20 terawatt hours. With the migration is already seen in BGS, BGS is about 15 terawatt hours. It used to be half, and now it's less than that because of the migration. So if you'd take 5% of the 15 terawatt hours, and you multiply that out by the delta in the embedded PJM West Price in the BGS contract with the current level of PJM West Price, and you roll out that math, you'll get about a $0.015. So that's how we came up with the $0.015. The 67, the change in the hedge price was simply running that same sort of thinking and that same sort of calculation and taking that out of the hedged amount that we have, pulling that migrating BGS load out of a hedged amount and then recalculating the weighted average hedge price of the portfolio, keeping in mind that the BGS hedge price has more things in it besides just the energy and all those things we've talked about in our bar chart relative to the PJM West hedge, which would not have hedged things like basis in it. So you have to just do that math in 2 pieces: So one is about how to do the $0.01 per share, the other weighted average of our hedged portfolio average price."

The other thing that we've noted a lot, and it's in the table that we put in the K, and it's still relevant, is the decrease in the environmental spending, environmental CapEx, because the BETs are essentially complete at the end of this year so that number comes down. As you think about that also going forward, keep in mind, what that also means is those assets go into service, of course, and they start to become depreciated as well. So that's essentially the story on Power. And it really has not significantly changed. The peakers and the upgrades or the growth capital, the environmental spend winds down.

Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.06 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.92 per share in 2009's third qua",810,"Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.06 per share compared with operating earnings of $0.92 per share in 2009's third quarter. Overall, operating earnings benefited from strong weather-related demand. New Jersey experienced the hottest summer on record this year. This stands in contrast to last year's very cool weather conditions.
For the past 3 quarters, we've been saying the economy appears to have stabilized. Well, that story remains unchanged. The signals coming from employment levels and housing indicate the economy may have bottomed, but as of yet, no signs of a significant recovery have appeared. Company execution was strong in the quarter. Our fossil generating units, in particular, were available to respond to the increase in demand, and our employees continue to support our results through their constant focus on operating efficiency and cost control.
Capital commitments are being met as well. PSEG Power is in the midst of testing the back-end technology installed on the Hudson and Mercer coal stations. These units are expected to meet stringent environmental requirements for sulfur, mercury, nitrous oxides and particulates. PSEG is in the midst of a $700 million capital program that will produce a 160 megawatts of solar energy. PSEG Energy Holdings has completed the installation of 29 megawatts of solar capacity in New Jersey, Ohio and Florida and is reviewing additional PPA-supported solar investments. These are but a few examples. Caroline will have more details on the capital program later on.
We're moving forward with PSEG's substantial capital investment and transmission. The update we're providing you today of PSEG's planned capital outlays takes into account the announced reductions and distribution-related spending, the delay in construction of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line and PJM's recently approved reconfiguration of the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson transmission line. The net result will be a capital program yielding annual growth and the utilities rate base of 9.5% per year over 2010 to 2013, with transmission continuing its role as our most significant area of investment.
We continue to reduce our financial risk and maintain our focus on core markets. PSEG Energy Holdings successfully terminated another 2 cross-border leases during the quarter. Over the past 2 years, the successful termination of 17 leases has reduced Holdings' potential tax liability by $1 billion, with one lease remaining in the cross-border lease portfolio.
PSEG Power announced during the quarter that it is exploring the sale of its Texas gas-fired combined cycle generating capacity. If successful, we expect the sale to close during the first quarter of 2011. We've been saying that we need to just get bigger in Texas or get out, and we have not found appropriate opportunities to grow in that market. The sales of the Texas assets will reduce the overall size of the portfolio by 2,000 megawatts, but it will improve returns on the portfolio and keep the focus squarely on the markets and assets with the highest value.
Our results for the quarter and year-to-date continue to support our full year operating earnings guidance of $3 to $3.25 per share. We experienced the benefits on an improvement in weather-related demand on pricing this summer, which continues to demonstrate the locational value of our assets. Said another way, basis returned with demand, albeit weather-driven.
The power markets, however, remain challenging. The price of natural gas is falling faster and further than implied by the forward curve. Our reported results continue to benefit from higher-priced legacy hedges, which are scheduled to expire in 2011 and 2012. As you know, the relatively high embedded cost of energy in our hedges under the Basic Generation Service, as we refer to as the BGS contract, versus today's market prices led to the entry of new retail suppliers into the marketplace. An increase in market penetration by retail suppliers accelerates the impact on margins that would happen eventually from the reset of the BGS contract prices. We're working hard to address the market challenges. We're focused on reducing our O&M without sacrificing reliability. Our financial condition remains strong, the markets we serve remain constrained and we're well positioned for potential new EPA regulations.
Our efforts to build an organization that focuses on maximizing efficiency, promoting renewables and building a sustainable energy strategy have not gone unnoticed. PSEG was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time this year, having been on the national index for the prior 2 years, and PSEG was recognized by the Carbon Disclosure Project for its efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the risks of climate change. We aren't immune to declining market prices, but we're well positioned to meet these challenges.
Now let me turn the call over to Caroline, but I will return prior to the question-and-answer period for a few closing remarks."

As Ralph said, PSEG reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $1.06 per share versus operating earnings of $0.92 per share in last year's third quarter.
Slide 4 provides the reconciliation of operating income to income from continuing operations and net income for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 9, PSEG Power continues to provide the largest contribution to earnings. Power reported operating earnings of $0.70 per share compared with $0.71 per share last year.
PSE&G reported operating earnings of $0.30 per share compared with $0.17 per share last year. And Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $0.05 per share compared with a negligible contribution to earnings a year ago. The parent company reported earnings of $0.01 a share this year compared with earnings of $0.04 per share a year ago. We provided, as always, the waterfall charts on Slides 11 and 12 that take you through the net changes in quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date operating earnings by business. And I'll now go through each company in more detail, starting with Power.
As shown on Slide 14, PSEG Power reported operating earnings for the quarter of $0.70 per share compared with $0.71 per share a year ago. The operating environment in the quarter benefited from extremely warm weather, as Ralph mentioned, a sharp contrast to the operating environment of a year ago. A 10% increase in generation volume at spark spreads during the quarter improved Power's earnings by $0.04 per share. While we had a 10% increase in generation during the quarter, the improvement came primarily from Power's coal and gas units. A 17-day unplanned outage at the Salem 1 unit, which you may recall we mentioned in the July call, reduced generation from the nuclear fleet during the quarter and reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. So given the different fuel mix and the cost of the outage combined, the increase in output resulted in a net increase in earnings of $0.01 per share.
While we realize the benefit from the net increase in generation, the price received for base load generation declined as a result of lower contract hedged prices versus prior year. This reduced Power's earnings by $0.04 per share. We can also see that weather had a positive effect on BGS load, adding $0.03 per share to earnings. Slightly offsetting this was the reduction to BGS results based on the impact of migration, which hurt Power's earnings by $0.01 a share. The impact of migration during the quarter was in line with our revised forecast. We estimate that approximately 22% to 24% of the loads supplied through BGS migrated to other suppliers at the end of September, but we don't have the final September data yet. This is approximately steady with the level we saw, as you may recall, at the end of the second quarter.
Our forecast assumes further erosion in margin of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with the upper end of our prior guidance of a $0.02 to $0.04 per share impact of migration for the full year versus 2009. We're now forecasting about $0.04.
Market prices for energy remain lower than the embedded price for energy in the BGS contract, and this dynamic has led to the entry of new retail suppliers into the market. For your modeling purposes, while we don't specifically forecast migration, keep in mind that each 5% of customer migration from BGS would reduce Power's earnings by about a $0.015 per share on an annualized basis at current prices.
In addition, the continued erosion in margin on certain wholesale electric energy supply contracts reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. Recall that these contracts are marked to market. Also, realized gains on investments in the Rabbi Trust fund added $0.01 per share to Power's earnings, and the decline in the effective tax rate aided earnings by about $0.01 per share.
The increase in volume from the fossil fleet and lower average prices resulted in gross margins from the -- for the quarter of $57 per megawatt hour compared with $64 per megawatt hour during the third quarter of 2009. Power's gross margins were significantly increased by -- influenced by an increase in generation from its coal-fired fleet and a higher cost of fuel, given the outage of Salem 1 versus year-ago levels. Generation from the coal-fired fleet increased 40% during the quarter versus last year in response to weather-related demand and an improvement in dark spreads from the levels experienced earlier in the year. The combined cycle fleet also benefited from market opportunities with an 11% increase in generation versus last year and operated at an average capacity factor of 59% in the quarter.
The increase in coal-fired generation for the quarter and year-to-date has reduced our inventory of coal. We've also exercised the flexibility that exists in our contracts to reduce delivery of coal. And the completion of the back-end technology work at Hudson and Mercer this quarter will provide greater flexibility with regard to our coal supply by reducing the need for the low-sulfur Indonesian coal burned at Hudson in 2011 when the BET is expected to go into service.
Our coal supply needs over the intermediate term will be lower than historical requirements. Continued weakness in forward dark spreads is expected to reduce coal-fired generation for 2011 to about 8 to 9 terawatt hours. A reduction in output has effectively lengthened our supply. Re-contracting an existing supply should be sufficient at this point to meet 2011's coal requirements.
Power's operating earnings for 2010 are still forecast at $1.060 billion to $1.135 billion compared to operating earnings for 2009 of $1.205 billion. Full year operating earnings will be affected by continued lower energy pricing.
Power continues to hedge its expected generation in future years, consistent with past practice. At the end of September, approximately 68% of Power's anticipated coal and nuclear generation for 2011 is hedged at an average price of $71 per megawatt hour. This compares with an average hedged price for energy in 2010 of $72 per megawatt hour. These hedges reflect a PGM -- PJM West Forward Energy Price embedded in BGS of $70 per megawatt hour in 2008, $57 per megawatt hour in 2009 and $50 per megawatt hour in 2010. And as you know, the current PJM West Forward Prices are in the approximate $40 per megawatt hour range today.
These figures don't reflect the potential impact of increased levels of customer migration, which could reduce the level of Power supplied under existing BGS contracts. As I just mentioned, incremental migration equal to about 5% of customer load would reduce earnings by $0.015 per share. If you run out the math, an additional loss of about 15% of load would reduce our average hedged price in 2011 to about $67 per megawatt hour.
Now let's turn to PSE&G. PSE&G reported operating earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $0.30 per share compared with $0.17 per share for the third quarter of 2009, as shown on Slide 22. PSE&G's results were influenced by the electric and gas rate relief effective in June and July of 2010, respectively, which improved earnings by $0.05 per share. And earnings also benefited from a return on the capital invested in the capital stimulus, energy efficiency and solar investment programs approved in 2009 by the Board of Public Utilities. And these programs added about $0.01 per share to earnings.
As Ralph mentioned, New Jersey experienced the hottest summer on record in 2010. And we estimate an increase in weather-related demand added about $0.03 per share to earnings. An increase in transmission revenues effective at the start of the year added $0.01 per share to earnings this quarter.
A decline in operating and maintenance expense during the quarter improved earnings by $0.02 per share, and realized gains on investments in the Rabbi Trust also added $0.02 per share to the utility's earnings. And the decline in the effective tax rate added about $0.01 per share. These items more than offset an increase in depreciation and interest expense associated with higher levels of capital investment, which together reduced earnings by about $0.02 per share.
PSE&G's operating earnings for 2010 are forecast at $425 million to $455 million, the same as our prior guidance, compared with 2009's operating earnings of $321 million. Operating earnings will be influenced by a full year of return on capital projects approved by the BPU in 2009, the June and July 2010 increases in electric and gas distribution rates, an increase in transmission rates, a forecast decline in operating and maintenance expenses and the weather-related impact on sales.
We've updated PSE&G's capital budget for 2010 to 2012, and we're providing you with our initial forecast of PSE&G's 2013 capital expenditures. PSE&G's revised budget for 2010 to 2012 calls for capital expenditures of $4.5 billion, with plans to spend $1.6 billion in 2013, bringing the capital budget for this 4-year period to approximately $6.1 billion. And on Slide 25, you can see a breakdown of the spending by category and by year. This revised capital program recognizes the 2-year delay in the in-service date of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line, the reconfiguration and delay in operation of the Branchburg-Roseland-Hudson transmission project and the reduction in distribution spending.
In fact, distribution spending is lower by about $425 million through 2012 versus the prior guidance we gave you earlier in the year. This should increase the proportion of our expenditures that earn a contemporaneous return. For example, transmission-related capital spending now represents $3.1 billion or about 50% of the capital budget for the 4-year period. Of course a number of these transmission projects depend upon our receipt of all the necessary approvals.
At the end of 2013, PSE&G's investment in transmission would represent about 31% of its consolidated rate base. Distribution-related capital spending is forecast at $2.2 billion for 2010 to 2013.
Future capital spending on distribution is aligned with forecast levels of depreciation to support earning our authorized return.
PSE&G's investment program is expected to result in annual rate-based growth of about 9.5% per year over this period. Supportive regulatory recovery mechanisms and a constant focus on cost control should support PSE&G's earning its authorized return, with growth in capital providing for growth in PSE&G's earnings. For the past 12-month period, PSE&G's distribution ROE was 9.5%, reflecting only one quarter of results since the completion of the rate case.
Now I'll turn to PSEG Energy Holdings. Energy Holdings reported operating earnings of $24 million or $0.05 per share for the third quarter of 2010 versus an operating loss of $1 million during the third quarter of 2009. Operating earnings benefited from the successful termination of 2 cross-border leases during the quarter, which resulted in a gain of $0.03 per share, which matched the similar level of termination-related gains recorded in the year-ago quarter. And results also benefited from the absence of a premium paid on the debt exchange with Power of $0.04 per share as well as a decline in interest expense of $0.01 per share.
The successful termination of the 2 cross-border leases during the quarter reduced Holdings' potential net cash exposure to $330 million on this issue at the end of September. And recall that Holdings has $320 million on deposit with the IRS to defray potential interest costs associated with this issue.
Holdings' operating earnings for 2010 are forecast at $30 million to $40 million compared to 2009's operating earnings of $43 million. The loss of income on terminated leases and a reduction in gains from the termination of leases will be partially offset by lower financing costs and tax benefits from the startup of solar projects in Ohio and Florida.
Finally, a few other items. PSEG Power indicated during the quarter that it's exploring the potential sale of our two 1,000 megawatt each combined cycle generation facilities in Texas through an auction process. The sale is dependent upon the receipt of offers that we feel reflect the appropriate value for the assets. And should we decide to sell, the schedule would call for closing to occur during the first quarter of 2011.
Finally, just to note, we completed several transactions during the quarter at PSE&G to finance its capital program and refinance high-cost debt. We issued $250 million of tenure paper at 3.5% and refinanced $100 million of 6.4% tax-exempt bonds with the issuance of tax-exempt paper as multi-mode or annual put bonds with an initial term rate of 1.2%. Holdings recently announced its intention to call debt in December 2010 for the redemption of the remaining $127 million of outstanding principal balance of its 8 1/2% senior notes that are due in June 2011.
Those conclude my remarks and comments on some of our financings. I'd now like to turn the call back to Ralph for some final comments before, of course, we open the call up to your questions."

In conversations with many of you, we have heard concern expressed about transmission, and we've heard concern about migration and the impact on Power's margins. We hope that we've answered your questions surrounding transmission. Now while it isn't easy to build these lines, we're committed to investing in the projects that will improve the reliability of our system. And as you can see, it remains the single largest capital program for PSE&G.
We've also provided you with some guidance around the potential impact of migration on our results. While we're not pleased with the associated loss of margin, the more fundamental concern is the forward price of natural gas and its effect on electricity prices. And candidly, we're pleased to see some of you have addressed this issue in your forecast. Now while we aren't immune to declining prices, we are working to mitigate the impact through cost control where we can and through growth investments.
So now we'll open up the lines for your questions."

So there is some spend, as you would expect, on these projects that's outside our forecast period through 2013, given their in-service states.

And so every quarter, we are marking both sides of that transaction to market, and we're putting any changes in that through the P&L. So the primary driver of what you see here in the $0.02 is really a function of the same dynamics that are going on in the base business, and that is, in these low contracts, there is still opportunity for migration out of those types of account contracts by the provider. And so as migration is expected or experienced, and then we forecast it going forward to a large extent based on the experience that we have. We reduced the value of those contracts in terms of what they would return to the company, and therefore, we take that mark because they are marked to market directly in our earnings as we update those forecasts. So think of this as mark-to-market. It's not cash, but it's the representation, our best representation of the change in value of those contracts primarily driven by the same thing we talk about in the base business, which is the migration out of these full-requirement, polar-like contracts."

One thing to keep in mind, though, that the termination of the lease and where we are with the IRS, those 2 things can continue to happen independent of each other to some extent. In other words, you'll have to terminate all your leases to try to have the settlement with the IRS. Given what we have now, our exposure on a total basis is about $330 million, and we're continuing to have discussions with the IRS to see if we can come to terms. We'll try to do that.

So just to clarify, just to give you some pieces of the math, maybe just to help you to think that through. In terms of the $0.015, so if you think about what our coal and nuclear output, let me just walk you down just a little bit because that may help. About 50% of our coal and nuclear output -- in total, coal and nuclear is about 40 terawatt hours a year, so half of it's about 20 terawatt hours. With the migration we've already seen in BGS, BGS is about 15 terawatt hours. It used to be half, and now it's less than that because of the migration. So if you take 5% of the 15 terawatt hours, and you multiply that out by the delta in the embedded PJM West Price in the BGS contract with the current level of PJM West Price, and you roll out that math, you'll get about a $0.015. So that's how we came up with the $0.015. The 67, the change in the hedge price was simply running that same sort of thinking and that same sort of calculation and taking that out of the hedged amount that we have, pulling that migrating BGS load out of the hedged amount and then recalculating the weighted average hedge price of the portfolio, keeping in mind that the BGS hedge price has more things in it besides just the energy and all those things we've talked about in our bar chart relative to the PJM West hedge, which would not have hedged things like basis in it. So you have to just do that math in 2 pieces. So one is about how to do the $0.01 per share, the other weighted average of our hedged portfolio average price."

Depending on the particular LDC, you might see something different, but we're still -- those numbers are very small. All of what we've talked about in terms of the drivers, the incremental hit to our EPS from migration has been in the commercial and industrial. So we really haven't seen it as a factor to date. Keep in mind, as you probably know, there are folks out there looking to sign up residential customers. They're probably stickier than the commercial and industrial, but we haven't seen that yet. So we'll have to see that, going forward."

And the peakers that we bid in successfully in the last 2 RPM auctions, they're the primary drivers of the growth CapEx going forward. The other thing that we've noted a lot, and it's in the table that we put in the K, and it's still relevant, is the decrease in the environmental spending, environmental CapEx, because the BETs are essentially complete at the end of this year so that number comes down. As you think about that also for going forward, keep in mind, what that also means is those assets go into service, of course, and they start to become depreciated as well. So that's essentially the story on Power. And it really has not significantly changed. The peakers and the upgrades or the growth capital, the environmental spend winds down. It's actually part of the reason why we're able to do what we're doing, which is to fund this utility, allow it to grow while still maintaining the balance sheet that we have."
