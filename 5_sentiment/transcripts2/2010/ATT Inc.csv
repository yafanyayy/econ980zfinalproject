Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.51. That includes $0.04 of pressure due to severance charges, offset by a $0.04 of tax-related benefit. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues were stable at $30.9 billion, up slightly on a sequential basis for the third straight quarter with strengthened Wireless, AT&T U-verse and Strategic business services. While consolidated margins obviously reflect the charges we took in the quarter, our Wireless margin was slightly up sequentially in our already strong Wireline margin was stable. Cash flow continues to be strong, with 2009 cash from operations and pretax flow up substantially over 2008, reflecting solid cost management, lower capital expenditures and the timing of cash tax payment. With that quick overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?"

Fourth quarter highlights",1390,"Thanks, Brooks. Good morning, everyone. It's good to have you with us this morning. Before I get into the detailed results, I'd like to start with a quick overview and a couple of comments on our positioning as we head into 2010. Fourth quarter highlights are on Slide 5. When you look at the year overall, I believe that in a challenging economy, we executed with a great deal of focus, and we executed well. 2009 was a terrific year for Wireless growth, our best net add year ever. We build momentum in key growth areas: Wireless data, U-verse and advanced business solutions. Margins were generally stable throughout the year, and cash flow was up substantially. Across the board, we strengthened what we believe is the industry's best growth profile with continued leadership in mobile broadband, further expansion of premier business capabilities, powerful IP-based platforms for both our consumer and business services and continued financial strength with cash flow coming from a strong Wireless business and the Wireline business that continues to have very solid margins. Most important, we closed the year well. In the fourth quarter, Wireless unit growth, Wireless data growth, Wireless ARPU were all strong. We continue to have solid traction in terms of U-verse gains. Wireline consumer trends continue to be encouraging. Combined U-verse and broadband revenue growth was up better than 30% for the second consecutive quarter. And those revenues make up a growing percentage of our consumer revenue mix, which helped drive our third consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year revenue comparisons in consumer.We maintained mid-teens growth in our most advanced business products. Our cost initiatives are yielding benefits, supporting both margins and cash flow. We ended 2009 with cash from operations and free cash flow, both up substantially over 2008. And as you know, we increased our dividend for the 26th consecutive year while we have reduced debt. So from a number's perspectives, it was a very solid year and a good fourth quarter. And looking to 2010, like most everyone, we model a continuing slow recovery in the economy and employment. With that said, with our operational strengths, we believe we're well positioned to deliver stable to improved earnings in 2010 with additional opportunity as the economy turns. And our long-term view of the business continues to be quite positive.With that perspective, let's take a look at detailed results starting with consolidated revenues, which are covered on Slide 6. Now as Brooks has mentioned, we've seen consolidated revenue trends stabilize over the past three quarters. Revenues totaled $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down less than a percent year-over-year and slightly up sequentially. This was our third consecutive quarter of modest sequential revenue improvement. These trends reflect a number of things. The first is good Wireless growth. Second, we continued to deliver strong growth in U-verse, which continues to gain scale, driving improved revenue comparisons. And third, our business revenue comparisons were somewhat more favorable this quarter.The fundamental thing for us is that our revenue mix is undergoing a substantial transformation, increasingly weighted to wireless, data and managed services. In the fourth quarter, 70% of revenues came from these categories, and that was up 1,000 basis points over the past two years. And taken together, these revenues grew 6.5% in the fourth quarter.This shift in mix reflects broader industry changes and the fact that we've been aggressive taking a leadership position in areas like mobile broadband and IP-based products. There's every reason to expect this mixed shift will continue as our Wireless data initiatives and our U-verse platform continue to scale.The number one revenue driver for us continues to be Wireless, and the details start on Slide 7. Wireless service revenues were up 9.2% in the fourth quarter and up more than $1 billion versus fourth quarter a year ago. The major driver of this growth is strong subscriber growth. We had 2.7 million total net adds in the fourth quarter and 7.3 million for the full year. Annual postpaid net adds were 4.3 million, with 910,000 in the fourth quarter. That followed a very strong postpaid third quarter following the iPhone 3GS launch.We continue to lead the industry in postpaid ARPU, and it was up again this quarter by 2.6%. This was our eighth consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth in postpaid ARPU. Churn also was our best ever for the fourth quarter, with total and postpaid churn both down year-over-year for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our fourth quarter subscriber gains also reflect strong growth in wireless connectivity for emerging devices or what we call connected devices. This includes e-readers, navigation devices, and so forth. As you see in the table on this slide, total emerging devices on our network increased by well more than 1 million in the fourth quarter, predominantly reflected in our reseller subscriber totals. We put a concentrated effort into the emerging device base over the past year. We believe the range of devices that will be connected wirelessly is going to be quite broad. We created an organization with a specific mission to build relationships and grow in what we believe is a high potential area. And based on fourth quarter totals, that's proving to be a good strategy, and we're executing well right out of the gate.Now while ARPUs in emerging devices are typically low, the churn in the margin characteristics are quite attractive, and we're encouraged by the growth we're seeing in this category. I would add the new Apple iPad, announced yesterday, will be included in our prepaid totals. We believe the Apple iPad is a terrific new device, and we're very pleased it's good to operate on our network, and the financial characteristics are attractive. We are not subsidizing the device and customers will buy access to our network without a contract. Usage will be paid for in advance via credit card. With rates starting at $15 for a block of usage and $30 for a month of access. In addition to subscriber gains, the other major driver of Wireless growth is data adoption, where we continue to set the pace. The details are on Slide 8. Over the past few years, we've put a lot of effort into capturing the Wireless data opportunity, and it's gratifying to see those efforts pay off. We have twice the numbers of smartphones in our network than any of our competitors. We offer a terrific range of data capable devices and applications. And all of these things are reflected in our Wireless data results.Fourth quarter Wireless data revenues were up more than $800 million or over 26%. And looking at full year totals, we increased Wireless data revenues by $3.5 billion. In the fourth quarter, text messages were up 70%. Multimedia messages more than doubled. The number of 3G integrated devices on our network was up more than 4 million in line with our third quarter increase. And we activated 3.1 million iPhones in the quarter.There's still a great deal of upside in front of us in terms of integrated devices. We're still below 50% penetration of our postpaid base and integrated devices as a percent of gross adds continues to run well above that, about 70% in the fourth quarter. Average ARPU for integrated devices continues to run 1.8x our other devices, and postpaid data ARPU increased better than 17% versus fourth quarter a year ago.But even with continued strong smartphone device sales, we sustained solid margins in the fourth quarter. Our Wireless margin summary's on Slide 9. Fourth quarter Wireless services EBITDA margin was nearly 39%, up 300 basis points from the year-earlier quarter, and our margin was up a bit sequentially, which is encouraging given the usual fourth quarter seasonality that we see in the Wireless business due to holiday sales, advertising and promotions. These results reflect good operational execution and the increasingly high quality of the subscriber base as we have won customers at the high-end. It also reinforces our confidence in the longer-term Wireless margin outlook for mid-40% margins. And we expect to be in the low-40% range in 2010.Well, that's a quick look at Wireless volume and financial trends. And at this point I'd like to stop and turn it over to John Stankey, President and Chief Operating Officer for AT&T Operations, for an update on our wireless network initiatives. John?"

What I want to do is take just a couple of minutes to give you an update on our wireless network initiatives and provide a quick look ahead at some of the things we expect to accomplish",2007,"Thanks, Rick. Good morning, everyone. It's good to be here with you. What I want to do is take just a couple of minutes to give you an update on our wireless network initiatives and provide a quick look ahead at some of the things we expect to accomplish this year. Slide 10 provides a quick ground set on our wireless network capabilities today. We have a broad nationwide network that covers 97% of the U.S. population. We also have broad 3G coverage, 75% of the population and growing rapidly. We have the nation's fastest 3G network today based on third-party test. Supplementing that is the nation's largest Wi-Fi network by a wide margin, with some 20,000 hotspots, something none of our competitors match.Plus, we have the many benefits of having a GSM-based network technology. It's the predominant wireless technology globally, which means that it gets broad R&D, a wide range of devices and very attractive cost curves. GSM technology offers another advantage. Unlike CDMA, it allows for simultaneous voice and data sessions. It lets you talk and access data at the same time.And looking at the transitions that will take place over the next few years, UMTS is the natural precursor to LTE, so it has advantages in terms of forward compatibility with LTE with respect to handset design and the ability of devices to inter-operate on a global basis between 3G and 4G networks. UMTS and LTE paired together will be the predominant technology platform for years to come. That's a quick profile in terms of our wireless network capabilities. Now in terms of usage. The industry has seen unprecedented growth in wireless broadband volumes. And at AT&T, we're seeing more of those volumes because we support twice as many smartphones as any of our competitors. So as we show on the bar chart on this slide, over the past three years, our total mobile broadband usage is up some 5,000%. And in 2009, just the past year, usage is up 200%. I believe one term for this phenomenon is that it's a high-class problem. We're absolutely thrilled to have customers who use our advanced devices and applications. Customers with smartphones with advanced data capabilities are more engaged, more times per day, evidenced by their usage profiles. Their expectations are higher because value and utility are higher. And all of these things are positive for the industry and great for our business over the long haul. To get ahead of these changes in volumes and expectations, we've executed a number of major initiatives, which are summarized on Slide 11: We've made significant investments in 2009; we added some 1,900 new cell sites; added more than 100,000 new circuits for backhaul, four times our 2008 total; we doubled the number of fiber-served cell sites we have; we've made great progress on 3G overall, expanding to more than 360 cities; and most important, we completed an extensive spectrum conversion using our 850 MHz spectrum for 3G. 850 is the original cellular spectrum. It's very high quality, with terrific propagation characteristics. It's very effective penetrating buildings, for example. We exit 2009 as the only U.S. service provider that has the vast majority of its customers covered with a 3G voice and data offering in the spectrum. As customers make the shift to more data-intensive devices, we think this is important for the perceived quality of their overall experience. The result of this work is that we're moving aggressively in the right direction. When you look at our network performance nationwide over the past year, our composite quality index for voice is up 22%, data throughput increased more than 19% during the past year, 3G blocked calls are down 25%, 3G dropped calls are down 22%, and we have very high levels of call retainability nationwide. That's the inverse of the drop call rate. Within two-tenths of one percentage point of the only higher score in the industry based on independent tests. That's the nationwide view. Now I want to take a few moment and talk in detail about our progress in two high very volume markets, New York City and San Francisco. Given our high smartphone numbers, double our closest peer, in both markets, we have large population centers, very sophisticated users with high expectations and very high volumes. For example, in the dense areas of New York City, there are periods during the week when nearly 70% of the devices active on the network are data-intensive handsets. So raising performance levels in these two markets is the organization's top priority. We've put all the resources available against the issue, and we're are closing the gap. Slide 12 has the details. Let me cover what we've accomplished in the past 90 days. First, we've added cell site controller capacity. In New York, in particular, the gating factor was equipment capacity. We had to work with our vendor to get upgrades put in place. Those are now mostly behind us, which allows us to add radio capacity. The process of changing out radio equipment may cause variations in performance in particular locations on specific days. That's just the reality of the work. That said, our 3G voice composite quality index has improved in each market over the past 90 days, with three consecutive months of improvement in New York and a significant step up in Manhattan as we closed the year. Again, these numbers tell us we are closing the gap against our immediate target, which is the performance level we achieved today in our top performing markets.That's what we've accomplished over the past three months. Now what do we expect to accomplish over the next 90 days? We're adding third and fourth radio network carriers to maximize capacity on available spectrum. In Manhattan specifically, now that we have scalable cell site controllers in place throughout most of the island, we're intensely focused on putting more radio capacity on the street. We'll increase the amount of 3G spectrum and radio capacity by one-third in high-volume areas of the island by the end of the first quarter. While we are through the majority of our zoning challenges in the Bay Area, we'll continue to work the remaining issues we have in parts of the financial district and a handful of other locations to final resolution. We're adding cell towers. And over the coming months, we're building and upgrading high-capacity antenna systems to boost performance in high-traffic areas like stadiums, convention centers and public transportation routes. In short, we've got an aggressive plan. We're working closely with equipment companies. Together, we're creating solutions that will benefit everyone as usage continues to grow across the industry. And we expect a significant improvement in both markets in the coming months.Beyond these markets-specific efforts, the major network initiative we have underway is our nationwide HSPA 7.2 a deployment, which is outlined on Slide 13. HSPA 7.2 is a very big deal for the industry and for our customers. It's today's real opportunity to increase speed, and there is an ecosystem to support this change now. With software and backhaul upgrade, HSPA 7.2 has the ability to double the theoretical peak speed of the 3G network to 7.2 megabytes. It will deliver those speeds to customers well ahead of the time when an LTE echo system with handsets is available. And as we continue to move to LTE, it will provide a much more robust network experience when customers move outside of 4G locations, especially around the globe where LTE will take time to achieve ubiquity.7.2 is a major advantage. Carriers around the world are implementing it. The technology is available now. We already offered 10 devices that are 7.2 capable, so customers will be able to experience its benefits in the near term. And we're very pleased to say that one of the 7.2-enabled devices that will have connectivity on our network is Apple's new iPad, which was unveiled yesterday. As Rick said earlier, we're really excited about the device, and we work closely with Apple in planning for its connectivity on our network. AT&T is a natural fit for the iPad given the combination of our ever-improving speed of our 3G network and our robust Wi-Fi capabilities. We have a thorough technical understanding with a good read on the iPad's usage requirements and characteristics. And all that is included in our network plans for 2010 in the plans I'm sharing with you this morning.Here's where we are with our 7.2 deployment. We've already turned up 7.2 software in our 3G cell sites nationwide. That alone improves consistency in accessing data session and increases network efficiency. The next step is to build out backhaul, focusing first on our highest traffic cell sites. This is the same build we would do for LTE. So it's a seamless, efficient, and forward LTE-compatible deployment. And we anticipate that the majority of our mobile data traffic will be carried over the expanded fiber-based backhaul by the end of this year. The bottom line is that the nation's fastest 3G network will continue to get even faster throughout 2010 and 2011 in a process that is a natural progression to LTE.7.2 will be a major differentiator for AT&T in the marketplace. It's an upgrade that's not available to non-GSM carriers. Our technology allies are excited about the deployment, and we are as well. Early field results from the 7.2 software turn up are encouraging when supported with fiber-based Ethernet. Our first metro clusters show average throughput increasing nearly 50% during peak conditions, a meaningful and noticeable improvement to a customer's experience. To that end, Wireless is our number one investment priority. You see that commitment in our 2010 capital plan which is summarized on Slide 14. we're budgeting total capital investment this year in the $18 billion to $19 billion range. That's up 5% to 10% overall versus 2009, with investments in wireless up substantially.We're getting more for every dollar of wireless investment. Today, a dollar of wireless investment yields twice the capacity as it did a year ago. Even so, we'll see a substantial increase in wireless and backhaul CapEx, which will be about $2 billion. The amount of capacity we'll add to our wireless network in 2010 will be 2x what we did last year. We plan to deploy 2,000 new cell sites. Radio network controller and additional carrier installations will be 2x what we did in 2009. Deployment of the Ethernet backhaul connections to cell sites will be 10x. We'll continue to be aggressive with fiber-to-cell site deployments, 3x what we did in 2009. Plus, we're expecting regulatory approval to acquire properties from Verizon related to its Alltel divestiture. With completion of that deal and integration of the networks, our 3G coverage would increase by more than 400,000 square miles. And we'll continue with LTE trials in two markets.Beyond Wireless, our 2010 investment plans call for continued expansion of our U-verse deployment, on track with our plan to reached 30 million living units by the end of next year. Our investment in enterprise capabilities will continue to be robust. This includes an aggressive move to enhance our in-territory business broadband speeds in over 2,200 wire centers in 2010. This will be a very nice complement to the advanced speeds and performance already afforded business customers inside of our U-verse footprint. And we'll devote increased capital to projects that will give the umbrella name, one AT&T. This includes work on unified support systems, converged customer experience, common care portals, a whole host of projects designed to improve operations, eliminate unnecessary duplication, elevate the customer experience and eliminate cost. Continual process improvement and cost improvement is a major area of opportunity for us, and we approach those opportunities with great discipline and persistence.In summary, a strong capital investment program, a level framed by the expectation that regulatory and legislative decisions relating to the telecom sector will continue to be sensitive to this investment. I hope this overview has been helpful. And Rick, I'll turn it back to you."

And let me turn now, and I'd like to cover with you Wireline results, starting with consumer trends, which are on Slide 15. There are a number forces at play, as you know in the consumer space, but the dominant change for us has been the growth of our U-verse platform. As our U-verse customer base continues to scale, we're seeing steady and significant changes in our consumer revenue profile and steady improvement in trends. This was our third straight quarter with an improved year-over-year growth rate for consumer. U-verse revenues nearly tripled over the past year, and on an annualized basis, now approached $3 billion. And our total consumer Wireline IP revenues, that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband which represented annualized revenue base of more than $7 billion, grew better than 30% again this quarter.In the fourth quarter, these products represented 35% of total consumer Wireline revenues, and that's up nearly 1,000 basis points over just the past year. Our U-verse TV subs [subscribers] were up more than 1 million in 2009. We've had very steady results throughout the course of this year including 248,000 net adds in the fourth quarter. And attach rates continue to be high. Our U-verse broadband attach rate continues to run well above 90%. Our U-verse voice attach rate is in the 70% range. And more than three quarters of our U-verse customers were either tripled or quad play, combining TV, broadband, voice and Wireless.  Across all eligible living units, U-verse TV penetration now approaches 13%. And in areas marketed to for 24 months or more, overall, penetration is better than 20%. Where we have U-verse deployed and marketed, access line, decline trends are better. Revenues per household are better and brand perceptions are better. We posted our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in revenues per household. And looking at declines in consumer connections, we had a 30% overall improvement versus the fourth quarter a year ago. Again, as U-verse scales, we're starting to see meaningful, directional changes in our overall Consumer business.Next, let me we also provide a quick update on Wireline business trends, which are on Slide 16. The fundamental trends underlying our business are consistent with what we've seen in the first half of the year. We have seen some encouraging signs, but no real turn in economic conditions. Competitively, we continue to do well in the market, and we continue to see good growth in our most advanced business products. Revenues from strategic business products Ethernet Virtual Private Networks, applications, services and such were up 17%. And business IP data revenues were up better than 7%. Our total business revenues declined 5.5% versus the year-earlier quarter and 4.9% for service revenues, which exclude equipment sales. And they were down just four-tenths of a percent, sequentially. This is our best sequential comparison in business reviews in five quarters. And looking ahead to the next few quarters, prior-year comparisons are more favorable.During the past year, while we've dealt with economic pressures in the business space, we have continued to invest to expand our network reach and to strengthen our product portfolio. And we've been very aggressive on cost initiatives, which has allowed us to maintain stable business margins. These things should give us good leverage as growth returns. Looking ahead, we're watchful regarding the economy. One of the key will certainly be employment growth. And longer term, we have tremendous global networks and solutions sets, and so our outlook for business continues to be positive.Now let me close with a look at margins and cash flow. Our consolidated margin comparisons are on Slide 17. We told you at the beginning of this year, we expected 2009 consolidated operating income margin, before incremental pension and retiree benefit cost, would be stable with 2008. And even with the charges that we've booked in the past couple of quarters, that's what we delivered, with continued strong Wireline margins and improved Wireless margins. This reflects a sharp, disciplined approach to cost management across our operations. We've made good progress this year on cost-improvement initiatives in areas such as billing, customer care and network operations. We reached agreement on good union contracts with our major unions. For the year, our total force was down approximately 20,000, and Wireline operating expenses declined 1.5% for the year and 2.7% in the fourth quarter, even with the increased pension and retiree benefit cost compared with 2008.  Looking ahead, we continue to have significant opportunities to improve operations and to operate more cost efficiently. Along with solid margins, we also continue to deliver strong free cash flow, which has allowed us to further improve and strengthen our balance sheet and increase our dividend. Slide 18 provides a cash summary. For the full year, cash from operations totaled over $34 billion, and capital expenditures totaled $17.3 billion in line with our guidance. Free cash flow before dividends was a record $17.1 billion and dividend payments totaled $9.7 billion. In terms of uses of cash, we have reduced debt. Net debt is down more than $10 billion over the past six quarters. In December, we increased the dividend for the 26th consecutive year. Our balance sheet is sound. Our debt metrics are solid and improving, and we have the flexibility to retire additional debt as it comes due to continue to invest in the business while at the same time, returning substantial value to share owners.Now I'd like to close with a quick recap, which is on Slide 19. And when you look at our business and you look at our results for 2009, there clearly are a number of things that I believe set AT&T apart. We have a terrific wireless opportunity. As we roll out HSPA 7.2 and upgrade backhaul, we're aggressively investing for the next generation of growth in wireless broadband. Our U-verse platform is performing very well and it's gaining scale to the point it's beginning to meaningfully changed our consumer revenue profile. We expect continued solid U-verse growth. We have the industry's premier business capabilities. Despite the economy, growth in IP data and advanced business products continues to be solid and business margins are stable.We have substantial opportunities on the cost side of our business and a solid track record of delivering cost savings to maintain and support margins and to drive strong cash flow. Plus, we have a proud history of returning substantial value in cash to our shareowners.I might add to this list two more things. First, we have a clear vision and a positive long-term outlook for the business. It's hard not to get excited when you look at what's ahead for our Wireless business and when you look at how U-verse is scaling and when you consider the strength of our business franchise.  And second, looking more closely at the year ahead, I believe we have an achievable positive outlook for 2010. Given the economy, we're appropriately conservative in our approach. I think that's what you would expect of us. But that said, in 2010, we expect to deliver stable consolidated revenues, was stable to improving margins and EPS. That includes the additional cost of approximately $0.05 to $0.06 associated with the acquisition of Alltel properties that we expect to close early this year. We do not expect additional pension retiree benefit cost pressure in 2010. We expect Wireless service margins in the low-40% range this year and in the mid-40% range longer term. And as John outlined a few minutes ago, we're targeting CapEx in the $18 billion to $19 billion range. We're expecting free cash flow that's generally in line with 2008 levels. Results this year were helped by the timing of some tax payments, by lower capital expenditures and by improvements we made in working capital. But we're essentially saying that our cash trends are going to remain strong and steady. And that allows us to maintain a strong financial position while at the same time, continuing to return value to our owners. Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks.

And then what I might do is step back and give you a little bit of additional color on our outlook for 2010. First of all, in terms of pension and OPEB costs, as I said, we don't expect any additional pressure in 2010. And in fact, I think pension and OPEB cost will be slightly less in 2010 than in 2009. And that's a factor of strong returns in our benefit funds than we had in 2009 less we're moving at the end of the year for 2010 to a lower discount rate, which increases expense. And then it also reflects the progress we made in bargaining with respect to both pension and post-retiree medical cost. That benefit there will be offset by some dilution that we'll have from our Wireless acquisitions. And primarily, that dilution will come from the Alltel transaction and it reflects the fact that the bulk of those customers and the networks we're acquiring are CDMA. And so we'll be spending both capital and expense dollars to build out the GSM networks and GSM footprint in those territories. And as well, we're going to move as quickly as possible to transition that customer base to GSM. And in order to do that, we'll have to subsidize devices and we'll have to touch a lot of customers and incur the cost to do that. But we will move through that as quickly as possible after closing the acquisition. In terms of depreciation and amortization, there's a little bit of reduction in amortization in the year. It's going to be offset by increases in depreciation. To some degree, the increase in depreciation reflects the fact that over time, the mix of our capital expenditures has shifted somewhat in today's networks. You're spending more capital associated with software. And obviously, with our U-verse deployment, we spend capital associated with the CPE and the devices in the home like the set-top boxes. All of those are depreciated over shorter periods. So net probably a slight increase in expense when you look at depreciation and amortization combined. Now as I said, let me take a minute and step back and put some color around the outlook. First of all, we, as you would expect, continued to expect solid Wireless revenue growth as we move into 2010 and that will be driven by continuing to penetrate the base with integrated devices and grow data revenues, as well as the growth opportunity we see in emerging devices. On the Wireline side of the business, we'll continue to see in 2010 some pressure from reductions in voice revenues. However, as you've seen the last three quarters, we are seeing improving trends in consumer. And in this last quarter, we've seen some improvement in business trends. So when you put all of that together, I think we're confident that revenues will be very stable in 2010. Now as you move to margins, again we expect increasing margins in Wireless. And we expect though some continuing pressures on margins in the Wireline business that Wireline margin pressure really comes from, over time, the changing mix of the business as voice revenues are reducing those -- legacy voice revenues tend to carry higher margins. Some of the new products that are in their growth phases, both data products as well as video are lower in margin. And that creates the pressure. In 2009, I think we did an excellent job of mitigating that pressure as we went through the transition. A lot of that has to do with John Stankey and his team who's here with us today. As we go forward into 2010, we're going to have to continue to work through that transition. We're going to have to continue to focus hard on cost, and at the same time, focus on growing margins in these new services as they scale. If we're successful in doing that in 2010 as we were in 2009, we have opportunities to grow, on a consolidated basis, operating margins in 2010. And that would drive growth in EPS as well. So I hope that helps with respect to some color around the outlook. I would tell you as I did in the formal remarks, we are cautious in guidance at this point in time. We believe the economy will continue to improve, but the improvement will be slow. And frankly, I think the economy is still very fragile at this point in time. But to put it in perspective, we finished the year for 2009 with $2.12 in earnings per share. That's probably $0.10 to $0.12 higher than I would've thought last year at this time, again being cautious with respect to the environment. So as we go forward into 2010, I think we have a similar kind of opportunity. It's going to require some very good execution on the cost side of our business, as we work through some of these transitions. So I'll stop there and, John, I'll let you address the questions on LTE."

We are past the assessment phase and nowhere we're going on the technology and how we're going deploy it. As you heard, we're going to be deploying in two markets to test and validate it in more of a production environment during the course of 2010. My assessment of the stability of the technology and full complement of capabilities that are necessary to go to a commercial release that would support our application for LTE is that I don't expect that to be mature enough until 2011. That's consistent with what we have been forecasting for some period of time. So you should expect to see us to be in a position where we can probably begin to introduce that into the customer base in small parts of our territory in the 2011 timeframe without having a more meaningful footprint and scaling until 2012. And that's probably pretty consistent with when we also see devices that are the right kind of devices that people are likely to use start to emerge. Now I'd like to hope that it's sooner. It would be nice if it was. I think the good news is that if it matures faster than what my more cautious outlook would suggest right now, we're probably in a position to do that. We're doing all the hard work stuff now. The hard work is getting the backhaul in place and getting ourselves in a position where we have the infrastructure right including the antennas. And if the electronics and the software comes along and the ecosystem develops quickly, then we can probably move to go a little bit faster. But I'm not optimistic that, that's going to happen at a faster pace than what I just articulated. Our view on 7.2+ is probably going to be driven by that pace than what we expect. We haven't made any clear declaration as to whether we will do 7.2+, but it's an option that's available to us. And it really ties into -- one of the big enablers is getting the antenna worked on for LTE, just like getting backhaul in place as a precursor step, getting the antennas in place for LTE opens up the 7.2+ option for us. And if we see that the timeframes are kind of extending out or going to be problematic, we probably are more inclined to do more 7.2. On the other hand, if we don't have to pull that lever because we get quicker moved to LTE, we may opt not to do that. The nice thing is we have the choice in there really isn't a lot of incremental work to choose to do 7.2, if we decide we want to deploy."

Customers will buy the device. They'll activate it on an online basis and they will pay for it via a credit card, paid in advance. So we don't have the normal acquisition cost, the setup cost, billing cost, so on and so forth. And so then it really comes down to forecasts and estimates for usage on the device. And there, our expectation is that, that device is going to be somewhere between our highest usage integrated devices, say an iPhone and a laptop kind of environment. We believe though the device, based on where we believe it will be used, in homes, in offices, coffee shops, bookstores, airports, so on and so forth, will be used a substantial of time in a Wi-Fi environment. And so we'll have to monitor this usage as the device gets out there. And if it's substantially different, we'll adapt to it. But right now, I think the economics will be very positive because it will be a very low cost device for us, no cost really in terms of acquisition. In terms of the free cash flow guidance, let me try to describe that a little bit. We had a terrific free cash flow year in 2009. It was helped and assisted by the fact that there were some incentives from a tax standpoint in place in terms of accelerated depreciation on capital investments. Plus, our overall CapEx levels were a little lower than what we're planning for 2010. And third, we put a very strong emphasis in 2009 on improvements in working capital. And we achieved some substantial success there. Even in the economic environment that we're in, we were actually collecting receivables faster. John Stankey's team in Operations did a great job in managing things logistically with respect to our inventories and our construction work in process. And so all of that helped 2009. As we move to 2010, clearly the tax incentives with respect to capital investment are a bit unknown at this point. You heard the President at the State of the Union mentioned it last night, it's something he's supporting and hopefully, it will be supported and extended for 2010. But we're uncertain of that at this point. We will continue to focus on working capital and I think we still have opportunities for improvement. But probably not to the degree that we saw in 2009. So it's really those three items: The taxes, the working capital and then the CapEx levels that make up any difference that you see between 2009 and '10 levels."

Our expectation for 2010 includes continued focus on sales of integrated devices. And as you know, we're going to be launching in the first half of the year some additional devices, including a number of devices based on the Android operating system. And so we'll continue to focus there. It's still a terrific opportunity for us. We're at about 46% penetration of our postpaid base. We're selling at a rate that's 70% and has been climbing in integrated devices. And I think ultimately, integrated devices as a percent of postpaid can move in to the 70% to 80% range. So we're going to continue the focus there. One thing to keep in mind on margins, again the margins were up slightly sequentially. We had a similar number in the fourth quarter as we did in third quarter of integrated device and iPhone sales. But in the fourth quarter, you always have higher levels of advertising and promotions associated with year end and the holidays, and that was no exception in this fourth quarter. Compared to third quarter, that higher level of advertising and promotions impacted margins about 100 basis points. So as we go forward, obviously, you'll see that kind of seasonality in the fourth quarter but not necessarily throughout the rest of the year. And then finally, on U-verse trajectory, as John said, we'll continue to open new markets. John's team is continuing to build toward the $30 million home target that we have. That build will be steady. We'll be opening up new markets this year. Many of those will be in the Southeast.

Some of it I think is certainly economic-related, people managing their plans and their voice spend, less travel, less international roaming and long-distance, for example. I think that will improve as the economy improves. What you see happening in the base is -- the reason we're penetrating the base further in integrated devices is that, number one, it's a high percentage of our sales to new customers, but also, we've got existing customers migrating to those devices. And that's really where that revenue opportunity is and ARPU opportunity is. As they migrate to a high-end device, an iPhone or a BlackBerry, they're adding $30 plus in data usage. And with the pricing we rolled out at the beginning of January, it's also important to think about the next tier of devices, devices we call quick messaging devices, consumer touch devices. These are devices that certainly are designed to be very effective in terms of messaging, also have capabilities in terms of browsing and e-mail. And those devices represent about 25% to 30% of our sales, generally. And with the new pricing that's put in place, we'll be moving those customers and devices to include $20 worth of recurring data services. We're giving customers a lot of flexibility in terms of being able to design it, based on their needs, so they can put on a $20 unlimited messaging package or they can put on a combination of a messaging package and internet access and e-mail usage. But as that pricing change moves through that part of the base, as more customers upgrade to those devices as we continue to sell them, there's some additional ARPU opportunity there. So our expectation is with all of these moving changes to still drive ARPU growth in the postpaid base."

I did try to give you a little bit of a flavor in my comments that if you kind of look at where we sit today versus a year ago, it's costing me half as much to move that bit today than it was a year ago. And I would tell you, we're actively working that. We know that scaling and getting better yields is part of managing the dynamic in the IP space. We've been doing that on the Wireline side for a number of years. And if you look at the levers we're pulling right now to make that happen and that we'll continue to pull, one is what I would call engineering and technology. We're getting some lift from better capabilities on the equipment and features that are being enhanced and allow us to better manage capacity and load in the infrastructure and how we engineer it to get more earnings [ph] on to the system. And we're learning a lot about that in the data world and getting better month-over-month and year-over-year to integration. So once you get out of the aggregation layer and you start getting to a point where we can consolidate our transport, we have a great opportunity to scale the assets that we put in place on the Wireline side, and we're doing that. We're not building incrementally the haul data traffic. We're trying to bring as much of that traffic on to the core and the aggregation layer of the network as we can. And then three, good old-fashioned commercial aspects of how we're buying and paying for equipment. And once again, because we're on that global supply chain, we're on a technology right now that's not only giving us increased speeds, but it's getting a lot little bit longer in its maturity cycle. We're getting the benefit of pricing benefits that kind of roll in, in the latter part of the life cycle and you had all those things up, and we are getting better yields.

I don't think it's unique to this particular device and manufacturers are doing an awful lot of work. There will be decisions that folks have to make as you go to a new area interface transition that people want to take the cost of putting two area interfaces in LTE and UMTS or do they want to take the price curve on UMTS. And I think you'll see depending on the device and the application, a stratification that will occur. There will be some devices that don't require higher speeds and want to go with a better cost curve on the attachment rate. And as a result of that, they choose to use a different dongle or a modem interface. And that's one of the beauties of having both area interfaces in the network, as you can capture both aspects of that technology. In terms of the spending profile, we've been working really hard to build, I'll call it muscle and capacity, in the infrastructure and our ability to deploy and spend it. And I think we've gotten a lot better in that regard. You heard Rick talk about the improvements in working capital. Part of that is because we're just becoming a lot better or more precise around how we do our project integration and how we build networks. And I think you're seeing improved effectiveness and efficiency, and that's improved capacity as well. And frankly, what you're probably going to see this year is a very much flatter spend than you've historically seen in Wireless CapEx. It's still not going to be perfect.

We need to see growth in business fixed investment. That's why tax incentives on investment continue to be important. And on the small end, small business, we need to see capital available and new business formation begin to increase. Those are the things from an economic standpoint, I think, we need to see. What we've seen up to this point, if you look at all the economic indicators is we've seen some of the trends flattening somewhat. And so they're not necessarily trending down as they were six or nine months ago. But we haven't seen significant improvement yet. And that's why I think we're cautious as we go into this year. A couple of signs that I think are positive, as we talk with and work with business customers, some projects that particularly our large business customers have had that they've had on the shelf for a period of time, they're beginning to become active again and look at funding those projects, particularly in areas that can help their businesses become more efficient, more cost effective. And that's an area that's a sweet spot for us. We play very well in that space. So I think that's encouraging, although as you know particularly on the large business accounts, there is a time cycle before those efforts and those RFPs turn into revenues that we can book and talk about with you. We've also seen some cases in the government space where we've got some stakes, for example, that are looking at more outsourcing-type arrangements. We also see that in our enterprise customer base. And again that's an area that's positive for us where we participate very well in. So when I step back from it and if we just think about in employment, for example, our outlook is that we're not going to see probably significant growth in employment in the early part of this year. But we hope to begin to see some improvement as we get later in the year. And again, that kind of fits in with the cautious stance we've continued to have. But over time, again I think the important thing is that with our business customers, we're very well-positioned. We have the capabilities and the services and the network reach. We're positioned well in the services with a lot of growth potential. So as this economy turns, I think we're going to do very well."

First, I want to thank everyone for being with us today and taking part in the call. In 2009, as I said, I think we executed well. I think we delivered what we outlined we would for you. We closed the year well and we strengthened what we believe is the industry's strongest telecommunications platform. We had terrific Wireless growth. We extended our leadership in mobile broadband. AT&T U-verse is scaling well with continued solid net adds. It's becoming all that we envisioned in the product and more. Growth in advanced business services continues to be encouraging. And we also made good headway on cost, which helped us to deliver strong margins in both Wireline and Wireless. We delivered record cash flow for the year, and we continue to return substantial amounts of that cash to our shareowners through a strong dividend. As we look ahead, we're confident about the business. Our outlook is positive. I think there are a number of things that set AT&T apart in the marketplace. We have the best path forward to capture the next generation of mobile broadband growth. You heard John talk about it today. HSPA 7.2 gives us an important edge with a major step up in speed and an elegant migration path forward to 4G. We have premier global business capabilities. We continue to invest to further our networks and our product sets. And we have powerful IP platforms for both business and consumer products. U-verse has excellent momentum and it's reached the scale where it's now beginning to impact and improve our overall consumer trends.We have strong and improving Wireless margins with opportunities for further expansion in 2010 and in the years ahead. And we've maintained, at the same time, strong Wireline margins. We're sharply focused on cost improvement initiatives to continue to support those Wireline margins. And all of these things put us in good position to continue to deliver solid and strong cash flow with contributions from both our Wireless and Wireline businesses. So I think while we're realistic and appropriately cautious about our outlook and about the current environment, we're well-positioned and we're excited about the opportunities going forward. Again I want to thank you for being with us this morning. And as always, thanks for your interest in AT&T."

As Rich said this is Brooks McCorcle, head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And on behalf of everyone at our company we appreciate your interest and it’s really great to have you with us this morning.
Joining me on the call today is Rick Lindner, AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer. Rick will provide an update with a perspective on the quarter and then we’ll take your questions.
Let me remind you that our release, investor briefing, supplementary information and the presentation slides that accompany this call are all available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That’s www.att.com/investor.relations. 
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement which is on Slide 2, and that says that information set forth in this presentation contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this presentation based on new information or otherwise. 
This presentation may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are also available on our website at www.att.com/investor.relations. 
Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me quickly call your attention to Slide 3, which provides a consolidated financial summary. Before a previously disclosed non-cash charge, relating to the taxability of retiree healthcare subsidies, first quarter EPS was $0.59, which was up 11.3%. First quarter consolidated revenues grew year-over-year to $30.6 billion. That was supported by a double digit increase in wireless service revenues, continued mid-teens growth in strategic business products, and further AT&T U-verse gains. Consolidated margins improved both sequentially and year-over-year. We had substantial margin expansion in wireless, and wireline operating income margins were stable sequentially, reflecting solid execution in terms of our cost initiatives.
Finally, although down slightly from the first quarter a year ago, cash flow continues to be strong with cash from operating activities totaling $7.3 billion and free cash flow at $3.9 billion for the quarter.
With that quick overview, I’ll now turn the call over to AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?

It’s good to have you with us this morning. Before we cover detailed results as we typically do, I’d like to start with a few comments on the quarter overall.

Before we cover detailed results as we typically do, I’d like to start with a few comments on the quarter overall. The highlights are on Slide 4.
First of all, I’m pleased to be able to say that we had a terrific start to the year. Earnings per share before the non-cash charge was up double digits; consolidated revenues were up; margins expanded; cash flow was strong, and I think all of these reflect good execution on the plans that we outlined for you in January. Our wireless business continues to perform at a high level. We had 1.9 million net adds with continued strength in smart phones and connected devices. Wireless service revenues were up double digits; churn improved to best ever levels; postpaid ARPU grew again for the fifth consecutive quarter. And most important, even with continued strong iPhone activations we delivered substantial service wireless margin expansion to 44.5%.
The other area where we gained traction is in wireline consumer. In fact, we achieved our first sequential improvement in consumer revenues in several years. Our U-verse platform continues to scale and we had a nice rebound in broadband net adds. As a result, consumer IP revenues, that’s U-verse and broadband combined were up better than 32%.
In our business markets we’ve begun to see some early signs of improvement in the economy. Revenue and volume trends have begun to stabilize and sales of our most advanced services continued to be strong. Across the operations, we also continued to execute well on the cost side and that has helped us deliver strong margins and cash flow. So on a number of fronts, a positive quarter and a good start to the year.
Regarding the broader economic environment, in January we said that as we looked at 2010, we modeled a continuing but generally slow recovery. And while the economy has begun to show some encouraging signs, we continue to operate with that as a general framework. So that means we’re running the business in a way that allows us to deliver solid results that are not dependent on a quick economic upturn. And because we focused on cost improvement and margins, we believe we’re well positioned with good leverage when we do start to see meaningful improvement in the macro economy. 
So with that as background, let’s get into the detailed results, starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 5. Consolidated revenue trends have stabilized over the past few quarters and as Brooks mentioned, in the first quarter they totaled $30.6 billion, up $78 million versus first quarter a year ago. The key drivers are first, wireless results that continue to be very strong; second, AT&T U-verse growth has driven steady improvement in our consumer trends; and third, business revenue comparisons are improving and we’re seeing signs that economic impacts may be moderating. Our overall revenue mix continues to undergo a substantial transformation, increasingly weighted to wireless, to wireline data and managed services. 
In the first quarter, 69% of revenues came from these categories, and that was up 900 basis points over the past two years. And taken together in the first quarter, these revenues grew 7%. This shift in mix reflects broader industry and technology changes, but also the fact that we’ve moved aggressively to position our business out front in key areas, like mobile broadband, as well as advanced business products and IP based services.
So let’s move to wireless. Our wireless results start on Slide 6, and I’m pleased to say that our mobility business delivered another strong quarter. Wireless service revenues were up 10.3% to $12.8 billion. That was driven by continued strong subscriber gains, with 1.9 million net adds, our best ever first quarter total. It was led by an increase in connected device subscribers of more than 1 million, which we’ve broken out for you starting this quarter. Things like e-readers, alarm monitoring and a host of other emerging products. As you know, some time ago we created an organization devoted to growth in the emerging device space. And as you see in our results, those efforts are starting to pay off. While ARPUs and connected devices are typically low, the churn and margin characteristics are quite attractive. And it’s an important growth area. We believe the range of devices that will be connected wirelessly in the future will be both broad and deep.
Postpaid net adds for the quarter totaled 512,000 and with continued migration of the base to integrated devices. Our churn levels also continued their steady trend of improvement. Total churn was down 26 basis points year-over-year to 1.3%, and postpaid churn improved to 1.07%. Both of those are at best ever levels for us. 
Customers are choosing AT&T and equally, if not more important, more customers are choosing to stay with AT&T than ever before. Beyond subscriber gains, the other major driver of wireless revenue growth is ARPU expansion. We lead the industry in postpaid ARPU, which was up again this quarter by 3.9%. This was our fifth consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth in postpaid ARPU. The growth in postpaid ARPUs been powered by mobile data. The details are on Slide 7.
In the first quarter, postpaid data ARPU increased nearly 22%. Wireless data revenues were up $947 million over the last year to now more than $4 billion for the quarter. Mobile data is a $16 billion plus annualized revenue stream for us, a run rate that’s doubled in just over two years. To drive this kind of growth, you need three things. First, a great data network. We carry about half of all the wireless data traffic in the United States today, and as we’ll discuss in a minute data throughputs have stepped up significantly with our HSPA platform. Second, you need a broad data capable device lineup. We have that today, and you should expect to see us continue rolling out terrific devices as we go through this year. We have twice the number of smart phones on our network as any of our competitors. And third, you need rich access to applications, again an area where we lead. 
In the first quarter, data adoption was strong. We added 3.3 million 3G postpaid integrated devices to our network to reach 26.8 million in service. This included 2.7 million iPhone activations, more than a third of them new to AT&T. Customers with data plans grew nicely as well, up 2 million in the quarter and 8 million over the past year. And in both of these areas we still have a lot of running room. Only half of our postpaid subscribers have integrated devices and our inflow continues to expand, running above 70%. Our integrated device customers are high quality customers. ARPU for integrated devices is 1.7 times versus other devices. Roughly 60% of our integrated devices are on family plans, and another third are on business related plans. So they’re very sticky, with churn levels well below our averages.
Data usage trends also continue to expand. In the first quarter, text messages were up 52% to more than $140 billion. And multi-media messages more than doubled over the past year. Mobile broadband continues to be in the industry’s number one growth driver, and it’s an area where we’re very well positioned. 
Now let me give you a quick progress report on our major wireless network initiatives. The details are on Slide 8. In our last earnings call in January, John Stankey, our President and CEO for Operations, shared with you our network plan and provided a look at key performance metrics over the previous 90 days. We’ve continued to make good progress through the first quarter, the first steps in an aggressive program for the year; adding an additional radio network carrier, adding cell phone towers, building and upgrading high capacity antenna systems, and building our fibre backhaul. All in, capital spending to support wireless was up over 30% year-over-year. As we’ve explained, implementing these network enhancements does cause some variations in performance at particular locations day-to-day, so the lines on some of the charts are not smooth, but the trends are clear. 
First, with HSPA 7.2 software turned up nationwide in January and with our backhaul deployment taking shape, we’re seeing a significant step up in data speeds. Company wide, our 3G data download speeds are up 25% versus a year ago based on internal data and up 14% in just the past 90 days. In areas where we’ve completed the backhaul in support of HSPA 7.2, internal data is showing speed improvements in the 32% to 47% range, and that’s very encouraging. 
On the voice side, we continue to have very high levels of call retainability nationwide based on independent tests, and we’re seeing improvement in voice metrics in New York where we have both very high data volumes and a high concentration of data users. Over the past 90 days internal data shows that 3G dropped call performance has improved in Manhattan and in the larger metro area. We’ve added third carriers for mid-town and downtown, supporting increased capacity in these high traffic areas. Our 3G voice composite quality index, an internal metric which measures both connectivity and retainability, moved up 10% in the quarter in the New York metro area overall, and in Manhattan that index moved up 47% quarter over quarter. In terms of download speeds, in Manhattan we’re seeing average speeds that are close to our nationwide average. 
Looking ahead, we continue to execute our network plan, adding additional third carriers, adding fibre backhaul and Ethernet to cell sites in support of HSPA 7.2, as well as our migration to LTE. Deploying and building in venue solutions where appropriate. Plus we’re doing more with WiFi. In fact, our WiFi customer connections were up more than 5 times year-over-year. With our GSM technology foundation, a seamless path through HSPA to LTE, we’ve got a terrific technology path going forward for customers, and we believe the best path forward to capture the next wave of wireless growth.
Now in addition to subscriber and top line growth and the progress we’re seeing on our network initiatives, wireless margins also expanded this quarter. Slide 9 provides an overview. Our first quarter wireless service EBITDA margin was 44.5%. That’s up 380 basis points sequentially and up 200 basis points from the year earlier quarter. This reflects strong revenue growth, the high quality of our subscriber base, reduced churn, as well as cost improvements that we made in the network and support functions for wireless.
As we announced a couple of weeks ago, starting with this quarter we changed how we account for certain inter-company transactions as part of our effort to manage the business from an external customer perspective. This did have an impact on segment margins, increasing wireless EBITDA margins by 160 to 190 basis points in most periods. But it did not change the margin trends. And the comparisons on this Slide, as well as the comparisons we provided to you as part of our earlier disclosure, are all restated for this change. Longer term, with continued growth in service revenues and ongoing cost initiatives, there is additional opportunity to continue to expand wireless margins.
Now I’d like to turn and cover our wireline results, starting with consumer trends which are on Slide 10. Again this quarter we’re seeing clear evidence that U-verse is driving a steady transformation of our consumer business, and it’s helping us deliver our first sequential growth in wireline consumer revenues in quite some time. Our U-verse customer base continues to scale with 231,000 U-verse TV adds in the quarter to 2.3 million, and roughly 1 million over the past year. Broadband and U-verse voice over IP attach rates remain very high. More than three-quarters of U-verse subscribers have a triple or quad play bundle with us. And U-verse revenues continue to grow with more than a $3 billion annualized run rate, and based on current trends we should exit the year with annualized U-verse revenues exceeding $4 billion.
Today we offer 120 HD channels, more than our cable competitors in all markets where we compete, and we continue to innovate. Innovate with enhancements like our recently announced 24 megabit downstream Internet service in every U-verse market. And U-verse mobile remote access, which lets customers use their wireless handset to navigate the program guide and manage DVR recordings. In the first quarter, wireline IP revenues, that’s U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew better than 32%. These products now represent 37% of total consumer wireline revenues, up 960 basis points over the past year. As a result, we delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in revenues per household, and our fourth consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year consumer revenue comparisons.
We’re now more than three-quarters of the way through our U-verse build and we’re on track with our plan to reach 30 million living units. And as U-verse scales, we’re starting to see meaningful directional changes in our overall consumer business.
Next, let me provide a quick update on wireline business trends, which are on Slide 11. In the first quarter we saw continued improvement in business revenue trends, and that reflects good sales performance and some early signs of stabilization in business markets overall. Key economic metrics, like industrial production and net business formations, have begun to improve. We also see early signs of improvement in our own metrics. We had our first sequential growth in enterprise LD revenues in six quarters. We’re seeing lower, company managed wireless disconnects, and better business access line trends. We posted our best ever year-over-year business revenue comparisons in four quarters. And enterprise business revenues, taking out equipment, were nearly flat sequentially. All of these trends are encouraging. That said, I would caution that it’s still early in terms of talking about a recovery in business revenues, and too soon to gauge the timing and the shape of the improvement to come. 
We continue, however, to drive solid growth in our most advanced business products. Revenues from strategic business products like Ethernet, virtual private networks, application services were up nearly 15%. Plus we continued to do well selling wireless in the business space. Looking ahead it’s clear that the ability to build unified solutions for business customers that include wireless, mobile broadband in particular, will increasingly be a key differentiator for customers across all business categories, and I think that’s a big positive for AT&T.
Our priorities in the business space have not changed. We continue to invest to expand our network reach and to strengthen our product portfolio. We have been disciplined on costs to maintain stable business margins, and both of these things will provide leverage as the economy recovers.
Now I’d like to take a look at margins and cash flow for the quarter, and the margin comparisons are on Slide 12. We told you in January that we expected to deliver stable to improved consolidated margins this year, with further wireless margin expansion and a disciplined focus on cost initiatives across the business. In the first quarter I think it’s fair to say that we delivered what we said we would. Our consolidated operating income margin was 19.6%. That’s up 80 basis points versus first quarter last year, and a 390 basis point improvement sequentially. This reflects solid performance across the company. Wireline operating expenses were down 2.8%, with major cost initiatives on track, including continuing consolidation of operations as we make changes to improve processes.
In wireless, we made good progress in areas such as billing, customer care and network operations. And across the business bad debt expense continues to trend favorably and total force was down by more than 6,000 in the quarter. Company wide we have a commitment to operate as One AT&T, which first means delivering a single, seamless experience to customers for all of our wireless and wireline products. And as we consolidate and integrate operations to do that, we also have continuing opportunities for cost efficiencies. 
Along with solid margins, we also continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash summary is on Slide 13. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled $7.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $3.3 billion, including a 34% year-over-year increase in wireless capital. As we outlined for you in January, we continue to expect full year capital investment in the $18 to $19 billion range. Free cash flow before dividends was $3.9 billion, and dividend payments totaled $2.5 billion. In terms of other uses of cash, our debt is down almost $5 billion over the past 12 months and we have the flexibility to retire additional debt as it comes due while continuing to invest in the business and returning substantial value to shareowners through dividends.
I’d like to close with a quick recap on Slide 14. When you look at our business and when you look at the opportunities ahead, we believe there are a number of things that set AT&T apart in this industry. First, we have a strong wireless business that is setting the pace in terms of ARPU growth, revenue growth and margin expansion. Wireless service revenues were up double digits, churn reached best ever levels, and we delivered a substantial step up in margins with further margin expansion opportunity ahead. Most important, we’re well positioned to capture the next wave of wireless growth. We lead in integrated devices. We’ve established ourselves as the leader in connected devices, a significant growth area for us. And we have a terrific opportunity as we continue rolling out the backhaul to deliver significant speed increases for our wireless customers. We’re seeing excellent throughputs already and we’re aggressively investing for the next generation of growth in mobile broadband.
Our U-verse platform is gaining scale and is positively impacting our consumer trends. We expect continued solid U-verse growth throughout this year. We have the industry’s premier business capabilities and we’re hopeful that we’re seeing the early signs of stabilization in business markets. We have substantial opportunities ahead on the cost side of our business with continuing cost improvement opportunities that will both support margins and drive strong cash flow. And we have a proud history of returning substantial value and cash to our shareowners. So we’re off to a great start this year with excellent first quarter financial results and we continue to have a positive long-term outlook for the business.
With that, Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks. I think we’re ready for some Q&A.

And s",338,"Sure John. We had not changed our overall guidance for wireless margins although the accounting changed that we talked about will drive an increase in those margins as we report the wireless segment by somewhere around 160 to 180 basis points or so. And so our outlook for the business hasn’t changed, that 160 to 180 basis points will ride on top of that. But as we look at it, you know, our expectation is for this year still to be in the lower and characterize it as the lower 40% range. In other words it’ll be higher with the accounting change but probably still in the same general vicinity that we guided toward, and the same thing going forward. We see improvement beyond 2010, certainly up into the mid 40s and again will be more toward the upper end of that range with the accounting change we talked about.
Going forward, you know first quarter, the last couple of years at least has been a little higher in wireless margins just because you tend to have following the holiday season you tend to have a little bit lower level of gross adds and upgrades in the postpaid space. And as we go forward in the rest of this year we will have some new product launches that we’re very excited about. We’ll have some product refreshes that we’re excited about. And those will most likely drive some higher upgrades and hopefully drive some higher gross add activity as well, so that may impact margins a bit. But we’re still in margins, both in wireless and wireline, we’re still executing as we talked about a lot of plans as we integrate our operations under the One AT&T initiatives, and so we’ll see benefits from that in both of our segments as we go forward in the year. And you saw some of that in the first quarter as we mentioned, force both announced reductions that we had made as well as just normal attrition came down about 6,000.

What are your thoughts from here around buyback timing and potential levels? And then second question just related to the wireless business, as we think about postpaid versus prepaid I think as we look at the net industry forecast for this quarter your results included, there’s sort of an expectation that we’re going to show a significant shift towards prepaid in terms of where the growth is coming from. I’m wondering along those lines are you comfortable with your positioning right now in prepaid or should we expect you to engage to a greater extent in the second?

We are making good progress in bringing leverage back down into our targeted levels and we’re getting close. However, we’re also hopeful that we’re getting close to approval for the acquisition of the former Alltel properties from Verizon. That’s been pending for some time, regulatory approval. So that will push the metrics back up a little bit. But all that being said, the plan is still the same. We want to drive the credit metrics back within our target ranges and then we’ll take a look at where we are and the opportunities and determine what we want to do from a buyback perspective. So nothing really changed there.
In terms of wireless, you know what you’re seeing I think in this quarter, and its consistent with to a degree I think what people were expecting as we go into this year, is some shifting in the wireless business in terms of where revenue growth is coming from. And certainly our expectations for this year is that postpaid customer growth, postpaid net adds, will come down from prior levels but we’re seeing a continued shift then and revenue growth being driven by wireless data revenues, by penetration of integrated devices, and we’re seeing just kind of the tip of the iceberg I think with the opportunity on connected devices. And so as a result, what you see in this quarter is even with postpaid net adds being down, we’re delivering a wireless service revenue growth that’s above 10% for all of the reasons that I mentioned. 
On top of it, in the prepaid part of the business we have over the last year been making some changes and tweaks to our prepaid offerings. We’ve also made some changes and tweaks to offerings within our reseller category that are primarily prepaid in nature. And as a result, what you saw this quarter is continued growth in the reseller category, but also small but positive growth in prepaid. And when you look at the prepaid trend over the past several quarters, churn has come down dramatically and the net add trend there has improved. So we’ll continue to tweak those offers in the marketplace and continue to work to drive some growth in those categories.
A couple of things that we won’t do is we won’t chase growth that we feel is not profitable and we won’t do things that could bring a significant impact or a negative impact to our postpaid business. And that’s still to a large degree where our focus is. And there’s still a lot of opportunity there. You know we’ve reached a point where about 50% penetrated with integrated devices in the postpaid base, but when you step back and you look at the sales for the quarter and by sales I mean looking at what customers are buying both in gross adds and in upgrades, we’re at or above 75% in terms of the sales activity there in integrated devices. So still a lot of opportunity there.

Good morning. First of all, in broadband in total we had a nice rebound this quarter and that reflects certainly continued growth in the U-verse platform and it reflects some first quarter seasonality that if you look at the last several years that you see. But what it also reflects is the fact that across our broadband product set, churn rates are down. And we did have better performance in DSL and I think to a large degree that reflects the fact that we’re offering a very good set of options for customers these days across our footprint. So customers, no matter where they are, they have the option with broadband to bundle a video product, either U-verse or Direct TV. They’ve got the option to bundle a voice product. And we on top of that give them the opportunity to bundle with broadband, either wired or wireless voice or both. We’re seeing good traction in voiceover IP in our U-verse footprint. And we’re also increasing speeds in broadband, so this quarter for example we implemented across our U-verse footprint a 24 megabit download speed in our broadband product. And outside of the U-verse footprint, in many areas we are offering DSL speeds that are at the 6 and 10 megabit levels.
And so when you put all of those together, I think we’ve just got a good overall product set that appeals to a broad range of consumer customers out there. Beyond that I would tell you there wasn’t anything specific in terms of what we did in broadband this quarter.

And that simply reflects the fact that customers are continuing to migrate up in speed. So we’re currently at about 59% I believe of our consumer base that are buying 3 megabit speeds and above from us. And we expect that to continue. We expect as applications and customer demand and needs continues to increase that we’ll see customers migrating up in speeds, and so there’s ARPU opportunity there. And as you would expect, particularly in that kind of product as you drive higher speed higher ARPU, you’re also improving profitability. 
On the U-verse side of things, you know one of the things I’ve started looking at in the last quarter or two is when you look at our U-verse customers in total and the products that they’re buying, and when you step back and you look at the recurring margins in those customers, the recurring revenues and expenses, we’re driving profitability levels at an EBITDA basis that really is equal to or better than our overall wireline margin levels. And obviously what creates in U-verse some dilution to margin and earnings then is the acquisition and the installation costs associated with those customers. But you know the plan going forward is we’re not going to slow down with U-verse. We’re going to continue to try to drive good growth in the U-verse platform in video but also in broadband and voiceover IP, and we’ll continue to do that throughout this year. 
But over time as those installation costs just naturally become a smaller piece of the overall U-verse revenue stream, we’ll start to see then the lift in improvement and profitability there. But I have been encouraged by the fact that when I look at those recurring revenues and margins, that they’re at a reasonable level today and when you look at the trend they’ve been growing pretty nicely over the last few quarters.

As you know we contemplate dividend increases as we get toward the end of the year. And so as part of that we certainly look at projections for the business in terms of cash flows supporting that dividend and we consider changes in the environment like tax law changes. But frankly, we’ll wait until we get closer to that timeframe and kind of see how everything in the environment shakes out before we make any determinations there.
Putting any tax issues aside, though, what I would tell you is that we do believe that a strong and a growing dividend is a key element of how we provide returns to shareowners. So in terms of use of cash that has traditionally been a much higher priority for us and share repurchase has been a tool and a vehicle we’ve used in cases where we’ve gone through periods where we have excess cash and we’re at, you know, comfortable levels in terms of our balance sheet leverage. And so it was a way to adjust and modify our capital structure. But having said that, as we get through the rest of this year and as we see how environment changes and how it might impact our shareowner base, we’ll consider all of those options.
Wireline margins, you know, is a balancing act right now in all honesty, because we have products that are legacy products like wireline voice that are declining, but they’re very mature products with not a lot of burden from installation or acquisition costs, so they have high margins. And the products that are the future of the business are growth products generally in the area of IP base service and managed services. There are more acquisition costs certainly associated with some of them like U-verse, but over time as those products scale they will grow in margin. 
So we’re going through this transition and to balance it through this transition, that’s why we’ve been very proactive and very aggressive on the cost side of our business, and very proactive in trying to consolidate our operations that underlie and support both wireless and wireline, this set of One AT&T initiatives that we talk about. We’ve been very proactive in taking costs out of the business there and very proactive in taking costs out of the business in areas where we’re supporting services that are declining. And we’ll continue to do that.
I do believe we’ve got an opportunity to keep margins by a combination of all of those things, keep margins in wireline at a fairly stable level as we go forward in the following quarters in the wireline business and longer term, and I do think of this as longer term, I think if we get some lift in revenues and lift from the economy there is some upside to that.  
And I’m sorry, I forgot the last question.

Well first of all on the CapEx front, overall capital expenditures as you said were about flat with first quarter last year. We were up in wireless, down a bit in wireline and the reductions there had more to do with kind of demand level for services, services like high capacity circuits and so forth. We also had in the first quarter I would tell you a couple of areas where we had some supply chain and vendor issues that impacted some network components, not huge numbers but impacted the total numbers a little bit. And first quarter is always a little lower for us because of, you know, certainly a large portion of our cap spend, our portfolio capital projects, new portfolio capital projects which get approved and get into the pipeline kind of late in the prior year always take a bit of time to ramp up. So you’ve got all of those factors.
At this point our outlook for the year in terms of CapEx is the same as we gave you in January, a kind of $18 to $19 billion range, a little rebalance in the portfolio with a couple of billion dollars more spend supporting the wireless business offset by some reductions in spend in wireline. No change there. 
On the regulatory front, I think we continue to have good I think positive productive dialog with regulators. They obviously have laid out some objectives and plans that they will move forward on and it will create a number of different notices and proposed rule makings and activities on the regulatory front. We’ll continue to work with them on all of those. At the end of the day, I do believe at the end of the day they understand and agree that in order to achieve their objectives it’s going to require an environment that supports capital investment and the ability for carrier to earn a return on that investment. So I think in that respect we’re hopeful.
You know on the wireline margin front, I wouldn’t get too concerned overall I guess with quarter-to-quarter changes in wireline margins, even in the range and magnitude you spoke of because there is always some quarter-to-quarter seasonality, and frankly as large as that business is, you know, there are just some issues and adjustments that occur from quarter-to-quarter that can impact those comparisons. But as I said earlier I think overall in the levels that we operated in around the first quarter, I think we will be able to maintain wireline margins throughout the year at a fairly stable way kind of in those ranges. And then longer term, again we’ll work to increase profitability in the growth services which will then further solidify and hopefully give us some upside with some revenue growth on margins and wireline.

First of all on wireless margins I hope I didn’t confuse everybody with the comments made earlier. Very simply our outlook hasn’t changed. So whatever you have modeled for wireless margins, with this accounting change it’s going to be 160, 170, 180 basis points higher than that. And it’s just a mechanical change. What I was trying to say is that moves the margin levels up probably still at least in the ranges that I would define as towards the lower 40s in 2010 and the mid 40s beyond that, although 160 to 180 basis points higher than what you had before.
On earnings per share I think our guidance has been to stable to improving earnings per share in 2010. Not changing that guidance clearly the first quarter and being up excluding the tax charge, being up 11% gives us confidence that you know we’re going to be able to provide some growth in earnings per share. And at the end of the day, put the guidance aside, that’s our objective. We want to grow the business. We want to grow top line revenues again. We had some top line revenue growth this quarter. That’s something that we shouldn’t just put aside. We want to continue that trend and to do that we need strong wireless growth, we need continuing improvement in both our consumer and business wireline categories.
And then we want to grow obviously earnings per share with that and with some margin expansion and hopefully grow it at faster rates than revenues. So that’s what we’re setting out to do and we’re off to a good start in this year.
On tier data pricing or pricing of any product, I won’t get into you know thoughts and strategies about making potential changes in the future on pricing for any products, but I think your question is a good one. And its one not just for AT&T but its one for the industry overall, because we’re dealing with a few factors that you have to step back and just think about. One, in wireless you’re dealing with some real limitations both from a technology standpoint and more importantly from a spectrum standpoint on capacity. And secondly, you’re dealing with an overall trend of devices and applications and services moving to a wireless environment. So that’s creating a tremendous amount of demand, particularly in wireless data. And the third factor in the environment is you’re dealing with a situation where when you look at your customer base, even customers that are using similar devices, there’s huge disparity in the amount of data that they use and the amount of capacity they consume. And so when you look at all of those things as an industry I think it will influence how in the future the pricing models develop. 
And as an industry what the industry has to do is develop models that are understandable by customers, that customers you know can understand and live with, and at the same time is fair to customers in terms of the amount of a somewhat limited resource that they’re consuming. And so that’s kind of the whole thing on data pricing and it will I suspect evolve as we go forward in the industry and it’ll evolve as applications and devices continue to evolve and data traffic continues to grow.

As Rich said, this is Brooks McCorcle, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. And on behalf of everyone at our company, we appreciate your interest, and it's really great to have you with us this morning. 
Joining me on the call today is Rick Lindner, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. Rick will provide an update with the perspective on the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. 
Let me remind you that our release, investor briefing, supplementary information and the presentation slides that accompany this call are all available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That's www.att.com/investor.relations. 
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 2. And that says that information set forth in this presentation contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this presentation based on new information or otherwise. 
This presentation may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are also available on our website at www.att.com/investor.relations. 
Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me quickly call your attention to Slide 3, which provides a consolidated financial summary. Before I previously disclose non-cash charge relating to the taxability of retiree health care subsidies, first quarter EPS was $0.59, which was up 11.3%. First quarter consolidated revenues grew year-over-year to $30.6 billion that was supported by a double-digit increase in Wireless service revenues, continued mid-teens growth in strategic business products and further AT&T U-verse gains. 
Consolidated margins improved both sequentially and year-over-year. We had substantial margin expansion in Wireless, and Wireline operating income margins were stable sequentially, reflecting solid execution in terms of our cost initiatives. Finally, although down slightly from the first quarter a year ago, cash flow continues to be strong, with cash from operating activities totaling $7.3 billion and free cash flow at $3.9 billion for the quarter. 
With that quick overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?"

It's good to have you with us this morning. Before we cover detailed results as we typically do, I'd like to start with a few comments on the quarter overall. The highlights are on Slide 4. First of all, I'm p",3083,"Thanks, Brooks, and good morning, everyone. It's good to have you with us this morning. Before we cover detailed results as we typically do, I'd like to start with a few comments on the quarter overall. The highlights are on Slide 4. 
First of all, I'm pleased to be able to say that we had a terrific start to the year. Earnings per share before the non-cash charge was up double digits. Consolidated revenues were up. Margins expanded. Cash flow was strong. And I think all of these reflect good execution on the plans that we outlined for you in January. 
Our Wireless business continues to perform at a high level. We had 1.9 million net adds with continued strength in smartphones and connected devices. Wireless service revenues were up double digits. Churn improved to best-ever levels. Postpaid ARPU grew again for the fifth consecutive quarter. And most important, even with continued strong iPhone activations, we delivered substantial service Wireless margin expansion to 44½%. 
The other area where we gained traction is in Wireline consumer. In fact, we achieved our first sequential improvement in consumer revenues in several years. Our U-verse platform continues to scale, and we had a nice rebound in broadband net adds. As a result, consumer IP revenues, that's U-verse and broadband combined, were up better than 32%. 
In our business markets, we've begun to see some early signs of improvement in the economy. Revenue and volume trends had begun to stabilize, and sales of our most advanced services continue to be strong. Across the operations, we also continue to execute well on the cost side, and that has helped us deliver strong margins and cash flow, so on a number of fronts, a positive quarter and a good start to the year. 
Regarding the broader economic environment, in January, we said that as we look at 2010, we modeled a continuing but generally slow recovery. And while the economy has begun to show some encouraging signs, we continue to operate that with that as a general framework. So that means, we're running the business in a way that allows us to deliver solid results that are not dependent on a quick economic upturn. And because we focused on cost improvement and margins, we believe we're well positioned with good leverage when we do start to see meaningful improvement in the macro economy. 
So with that as background, let's get into the detailed results starting with consolidated revenues on Slide 5. Consolidated revenue trends had stabilized over the past few quarters, and as Brooks mentioned, in the first quarter, they totaled $30.6 billion, up $78 million versus first quarter a year ago. The key drivers are: First, Wireless results that continue to be very strong; second, AT&T U-verse growth has driven steady improvement in our consumer trends; and third, business revenue comparisons are improving, and we're seeing signs that economic impacts maybe moderating. 
Our overall revenue mix continues to undergo a substantial transformation, increasingly weighted to Wireless, to Wireline data and managed services. In the first quarter, 69% of revenues came from these categories and now is up 900 basis points over the past two years. And taken together in the first quarter, these revenues grew 7%. This shift in mix reflects broader industry and technology changes but also the fact that we've moved aggressively to position our business out front in key areas like mobile broadband, as well as advanced business products and IT-based services. 
So let's move to Wireless. Our Wireless results start on Slide 6, and I'm pleased to say that our Mobility business delivered another strong quarter. Wireless service revenues were up 10.3% to $12.8 billion. That was driven by continued strong subscriber gains with 1.9 million net adds, our best ever first quarter total. It was led by an increase in connected device subscribers of more than 1 million, which we've broken out for you starting this quarter, things like e-readers, alarm monitoring and host of other emerging products. 
As you know, sometime ago, we created an organization devoted to growth in the emerging device space. And as you see in our results, those efforts are starting to pay off. While ARPUs in connected devices are typically low, the churn and margin characteristics are quite attractive, and it's an important growth area. We believe the range of devices that will be connected wirelessly in the future will be both broad and deep. 
Postpaid net adds for the quarter totaled 512,000 and with continued migration of the base to integrated devices. Our churn levels also continued their steady trend of improvement. Total churn was down 26 basis points year-over-year to 1.3% and postpaid churn improved to 1.07%. Both of those are at best-ever levels for us. 
Customers are choosing AT&T, and equally, if not more important, more customers are choosing to stay with AT&T than ever before. Beyond subscriber gains, the other major driver of Wireless revenue growth is ARPU expansion. We lead the industry in postpaid ARPU, which was up again this quarter by 3.9%. This was our fifth consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth in postpaid ARPU. 
The growth in postpaid ARPU has been powered by mobile data. The details are on Slide 7. In the first quarter, postpaid data ARPU increased nearly 22%. Wireless data revenues were up $947 million over the last year to now more than $4 billion for the quarter. Mobile data is a $16 billion plus annualized revenue stream for us, a run rate that's doubled in just over two years. 
To drive this kind of growth, you need three things. First, a great data network. We carry about half of all the wireless data traffic in the United States today. And as we'll discuss in a minute, data throughputs have stepped up significantly with our HSPA platform. Second, you need a broad data-capable device lineup. We have that today, and you should expect to see us continue rolling out terrific devices as we go through this year. We have twice the number of smartphones on our network as any of our competitors. And third, you need rich access to applications, again, an area where we lead.
In the first quarter, the data adoption was strong. We added 3.3 million 3G postpaid integrated devices to our network to reach 26.8 million in service. This included 2.7 million iPhone activations, more than a third of them new to AT&T. Customers with data plans grew nicely as well, up nearly 2 million in the quarter and 8 million over the past year. And in both of these areas, we still have a lot of running room. Only half of our postpaid subscribers have integrated devices, and our inflow continues to expand, running above 70%. 
Our integrated device customers are high-quality customers. ARPU for integrated devices is 1.7x versus other devices. Roughly 60% of our integrated devices are on family plans and another third are on business-related plans. So they're very sticky, with churn levels well below our averages. 
Data usage trends also continue to expand. In the first quarter, text messages were up 52% to more than 140 billion, and multimedia messages more than doubled over the past year. Mobile broadband continues to be the industry's number one growth driver, and it's an area where we're very well positioned. 
Now let me give you a quick progress report on our major Wireless network initiatives. The details are on Slide 8. In our last earnings call in January, John Stankey, our President and CEO for Operations, shared with you our network plan and provided a look at key performance metrics over the previous 90 days. We've continued to make good progress through the first quarter, the first steps in an aggressive program for the year, adding an additional radio network carrier, adding cell towers, building and upgrading high-capacity antenna systems and building our fiber backhaul. All in, capital spending to support Wireless was up over 30% year-over-year. 
As we've explained, implementing these network enhancements does cause some variations in performance at particular locations day to day. So the lines on some of the charts are not smooth, but the trends are clear. First, with HSPA 7.2 software turned up nationwide in January and with our backhaul deployment taking shape, we're seeing a significant step up in data speeds. Company-wide, our 3G average data download speeds are up 25% versus a year ago based on internal data and up 14% in just the past 90 days. In areas where we've completed the backhaul in support of HSPA 7.2, internal data is showing speed improvements in the 32% to 47%, and that's very encouraging. 
On the Voice side, we continue to have very high levels of call retainability nationwide based on independent tests, and we're seeing improvement in voice metrics in New York where we have both very high data volumes and a high concentration of data users. Over the past 90 days, the internal data shows that 3G dropped call performance has improved in Manhattan and in the larger metro area. We've added third carriers for Midtown and Downtown, supporting increased capacity in these high-traffic areas. 
Our 3G Voice Composite Quality Index, an internal metric which measures both connectivity and retainability, moved up 10% during the quarter in the New York metro area overall. And in Manhattan, that index moved up 47% quarter-over-quarter. In terms of download speeds, in Manhattan, we're seeing average speeds that are close to our nationwide average. 
Looking ahead, we continue to execute our network plan, adding additional third carriers, adding fiber backhaul and Ethernet to cell sites in support of HSPA 7.2, as well as our migration to LTE, deploying in-building and venue solutions where appropriate. Plus, we're doing more with Wi-Fi. In fact, our Wi-Fi customer connections were up more than 5x year-over-year. With our GSM technology foundation, a seamless path through HSPA to LTE, we've got a terrific technology path going forward for customers, and we believe the best path forward to capture the next wave of Wireless growth. 
Now in addition to subscriber and top line growth and the progress we're seeing on our network initiatives, Wireless margins also expanded this quarter. Slide 9 provides an overview. Our first quarter Wireless service EBITDA margin was 44½%, that's up 380 basis points sequentially and up 200 basis points from the year-earlier quarter. This reflects strong revenue growth, the high quality of our subscriber base, reduced churn, as well as cost improvements that we've made in the network and support functions for Wireless. 
As we announced a couple of weeks ago, starting with this quarter, we've changed how we account for certain inter-company transactions, as part of our effort to manage the business from an external customer perspective. This did have an impact on segment margins, increasing Wireless EBITDA margins by 160 to 190 basis points in most periods, but it did not change the margin trends. And the comparisons on this slide, as well as the comparisons we've provided to you as part of our earlier disclosure, are all restated for this change. Longer term, with continued growth of service revenues and ongoing cost initiatives, there is additional opportunity to continue to expand Wireless margins. 
Now I'd like to turn and cover our Wireline results starting with consumer trends, which are on Slide 10. Again this quarter, we're seeing clear evidence that U-verse is driving a steady transformation of our consumer business. And it's helping us deliver our first sequential growth in Wireline consumer revenues in quite some time. Our U-verse customer base continues to scale with 231,000 U-verse TV adds in the quarter to 2.3 million and roughly 1 million over the past year. 
Broadband in U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remain very high. More than three quarters of U-verse subscribers have a triple or quad play bundle with us. And U-verse revenues continue to grow with more than a $3 billion annualized run rate, and based on current trends, we should exit the year with annualized U-verse revenues exceeding $4 billion. 
Today, we offer 120 HD channels, more than our cable competitors in all markets where we compete. And we continue to innovate with enhancements like our recently announced 24-megabit downstream Internet service in every U-verse market, and U-verse Mobile Remote Access, which lets customers use their wireless handset to navigate the program guide and manage DVR recordings. 
In the first quarter, Wireline IP revenues, that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew better than 32%. These products now represent 37% of total consumer Wireline revenues, up 960 basis points over the past year. As a result, we delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in revenues per household and our fourth consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year consumer revenue comparisons. 
We're now more than three quarters of the way through our U-verse build, and we're on track with our plan to reach 30 million living units. And as U-verse scales, we're starting to see meaningful directional changes in our overall consumer business. 
Next, let me provide a quick update on Wireline business trends, which are on Slide 11. In the first quarter, we saw continued improvement in business revenue trends. That reflects good sales performance and some early signs of stabilization in business markets overall. Key economic metrics, like industrial production and net business formations, have begun to improve. We also see early signs of improvement in our own metrics. We had our first sequential growth in Enterprise LD revenues in six quarters. We're seeing lower company-managed Wireless disconnects and better business access line trends. We posted our best ever year-over-year business revenue comparisons in four quarters. And Enterprise service revenues, taking out equipment, were nearly flat sequentially. All of these trends are encouraging. 
That said, I would caution that it's still early in terms of talking about a recovery in business revenues and too soon to gauge the timing and the shape of the improvement to come. We continue, however, to drive solid growth in our most advanced business products. Revenues from strategic business products like Ethernet, Virtual Private Networks, Application Services were up nearly 15%. Plus, we continue to do well, selling Wireless in the business space. Looking ahead, it's clear that the ability to build unified solutions for business customers that include Wireless, mobile broadband in particular, will increasingly be a key differentiator for customers across all business categories, and I think that's a big positive for AT&T. 
Our priorities in the business space had not changed. We continue to invest to expand our network reach and to strengthen our product portfolio. We have been disciplined on cost to maintain stable business margins. And both of these things will provide leverage as the economy recovers. 
Now I'd like to take a look at margins and cash flow for the quarter, and the margin comparisons are on Slide 12. We told you in January that we expected to deliver stable to improve consolidated margins this year with further Wireless margin expansion and a disciplined focus on cost initiatives across the business. In the first quarter, I think it's fair to say we delivered what we said we would. Our consolidated operating income margin was 19.6%. That's up 80 basis points versus first quarter last year and a 390 basis point improvement sequentially. This reflects solid performance across the company. 
Wireline operating expenses were down 2.8% with major cost initiatives on track, including continuing consolidation of operations as we make changes to improve processes. In Wireless, we've made good progress in areas such as billing, customer care and network operations. And across the business, bad debt expense continues to trend favorably, and total force was down by more than 6,000 in the quarter. 
Company-wide, we have a commitment to operate as one AT&T, which first means delivering a single seamless experience to customers for all of our Wireless and Wireline products. And as we consolidate and integrate operations to do that, we also have continuing opportunities for cost efficiencies. 
Along with solid margins, we also continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash summary is on Slide 13. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled $7.3 billion. Capital expenditures were $3.3 billion, including a 34% year-over-year increase in Wireless capital. As we outlined for you in January, we continue to expect full year capital investment in the $18 billion to $19 billion range. 
Free cash flow before dividends was $3.9 billion and dividend payments totaled $2.5 billion. In terms of other uses of cash, our debt is down almost $5 billion over the past 12 months, and we have the flexibility to retire additional debt as it comes due, while continuing to invest in the business and returning substantial value to shareowners through dividends. 
I'd like to close with a quick recap on Slide 14. When you look at our business, and when you look at the opportunities ahead, we believe there are a number of things that set AT&T apart in this industry. First, we have a strong Wireless business that is setting the pace in terms of ARPU growth, revenue growth and margin expansion. Wireless service revenues were up double digits. Churn reached best-ever levels, and we delivered a substantial step-up in margins with further margin expansion opportunity ahead. Most important, we're well positioned to capture the next wave of Wireless growth. We lead in integrated devices. We've established ourselves as the leader in connected devices, a significant growth area for us. And we have a terrific opportunity as we continue rolling out the backhaul to deliver significant speed increases for our Wireless customers. We're seeing excellent throughputs already, and we're aggressively investing for the next generation of growth in mobile broadband. 
Our U-verse platform is gaining scale and is positively impacting our consumer trends. We expect continued solid U-verse growth throughout this year. We have the industry's premier business capabilities, and we're hopeful that we're seeing the early signs of stabilization in business markets. We have substantial opportunities ahead on the cost side of our business with continuing cost improvement opportunities that will both support margins and drive strong cash flow. And we have a proud history of returning substantial value in cash to our shareowners. So we're off to a great start this year with excellent first quarter financial results, and we continue to have a positive long-term outlook for the business 
With that, Brooks, that concludes our prepared remarks. I think we're ready for some Q&A."

Obviously, it's really a strong quarter. And given the guidance was in the low-40s, and you sort of touched on it a little bit today saying that maybe it seem to be more in the medium turn, there could be some upside to this. But I guess the question is, is this the high water mark for the year as it relates to Wireless margins? Or how do you expect that the rest of the year will trend, especially with the potential iPhone refresh hitting in midyear as it has in the last few years?"
100231,98842171,56927,"AT&T, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","We had not changed our overall guidance for Wireless margins, although the accounting change that we talked about will drive in increase in those margins as we report the Wireless segment by somewhere around 160 to 180 basis points or so.

And so our outlook for the business hasn't changed. That 160 to 180 basis points were right on top of that. But as we look at it, our expectation is for this year still to be in the lower -- characterize it as lower 40% range. In other words, it'll be higher with the accounting change but probably still in the same general vicinity that we guided toward. And the same thing going forward, we see improvement beyond 2010. Certainly up into the mid-40s, and again, will be more towards the upper end of that range with the accounting change we talked about. Going forward, first quarter, the last couple of years at least, has been a little higher in Wireless margins just because, following the holiday season, you tend to have a little bit lower level of gross adds and upgrades in the postpaid space. And as we go forward in the rest of this year, we will have some new product launches that we're very excited about. We'll have some product refreshes that we're excited about. And those will most likely drive some higher upgrades and hopefully drive some higher gross add activity as well. So that may impact margins a bit. In margins, both in Wireless and Wireline, we're still executing, as we talked about a lot of plans as we integrate our operations under the one AT&T initiatives. And so we'll see benefits from that in both of our segments as we go forward in the year. And you saw some of that in the first quarter, as we mentioned, for us, both announced reductions that we had made, as well as just normal attrition came down about 6,000."

I'm wondering, along those lines, are your comfortable with your positioning right now in prepaid? Or should we expect you to engage to a greater extent in this segment?"

We are making good progress in bringing leverage back down into our targeted levels, and we're getting close. However, we're also hopeful that we're getting close to approval for the acquisition of the former Alltel properties from Verizon. That's been pending for some time regulatory approval. So that will push the metrics back up a little bit But all that being said, the plan is still the same. We want to drive the credit metrics back within our target ranges. And then we'll take a look at where we are and the opportunities and determine what we want to do from a buyback perspective. So nothing really changed there. In terms of Wireless, what you're seeing, I think, in this quarter -- and it's consistent to a degree, I think, what people were expecting as we go into this year, is some shifting in the Wireless business, in terms of where revenue growth is coming from. And certainly, our expectations for this year is that postpaid customer growth, postpaid net adds, will come down from prior levels. But we're seeing a continued shift then in revenue growth being driven by Wireless data revenues, by penetration of integrated devices. And we're seeing just, kind of, the tip of the iceberg, I think, with the opportunity on connected devices. And so as a result, what you see in this quarter is, even with postpaid net adds being down, we're delivering a Wireless service revenue growth that's above 10% for all of the reasons that I mentioned. On top of it, in the Prepaid part of the business, we have, over the last year, been making some changes and tweaks to our prepaid offerings. We've also made some changes and tweaks to offerings within our reseller category that are primarily prepaid in nature. And as a result, what you saw this quarter is continued growth in the reseller category but also small but positive growth in prepaid. And when you look at the prepaid trend over the past several quarters, churn has come down dramatically. And the net add trend there has improved. So we'll continue to tweak those offers in the marketplace and continue to work to drive some growth on those categories. A couple of things that we won't do is we won't growth that we feel is not profitable. And we won't do things that could bring a significant impact or a negative impact to our Postpaid business. And that's still, to a large degree, where our focus is. And there's still a lot of opportunity there. We've reached a point we're about 50% penetrated with integrated devices in the postpaid base. But when you step back and you look at the sales for the quarter -- and by sales, I mean looking at what customers are buying, both in gross adds and in upgrades, we're at or above 75% in terms of the sales activity there in integrated devices. So still a lot of opportunity there."

And that reflects certainly continued growth in the U-verse platform. But it also -- and it reflects some first quarter seasonality that if you look at the last several years that you see. But what it also reflects is the fact that across our broadband products, churn rates are down. And we did have better performance in DSL. And I think to a large degree, that reflects the fact that we're offering a very good set of options for customers these days across our footprint. So customers, no matter where they are, they have the option with broadband to bundle a video product, either U-verse or DIRECTV. They've got the option to bundle a voice product. And on top of that, give them the ability to bundle with broadband, either wired or wireless voice or both. We're seeing good traction in voice over IP in our U-verse footprint. And we're also increasing speeds in broadband. So this quarter, for example, we implemented across our U-verse footprint a 24-megabit download speed in our broadband product. And outside of the U-verse footprint, in many areas, we're offering DSL speeds that are at the 6- and 10-megabit levels. And so when you put all of those together, I think we've just got a good overall products that appeals to a broad range of consumer customers out there. Beyond that, I would tell you there weren't anything -- -- there wasn't anything specific in terms of what we did in broadband this quarter."

And that simply reflects the fact that customers are continuing to migrate up in speed. So we're currently at about 59%, I believe, of our consumer base that are buying 3-megabit speeds and above from us. And we expect that to continue. We expect, as applications and customer demand and needs continues to increase, that we'll see customers migrating up in speeds. And so there's ARPU opportunity there. And as you would expect, in particularly in that kind of product, and as you drive higher speed, higher ARPU, you're also improving profitability. On the U-verse side of things, one of the things I've started looking at in the last quarter is when you look at our U-verse customers in total and the products that they're buying, and when you step back and you look at the recurring margins in those customers, that recurring revenues and expenses, we're driving profitability levels at an EBITDA basis that really is equal to or better than our overall wireline margin levels. And obviously, what creates in U-verse some dilution to margin and earnings then is the acquisition and the installation cost associated with those customers. But the plan going forward is, we're not going to slow down with U-verse. We're going to continue to try to drive good growth in U-verse and the U-verse platform in video, but also in broadband and voice over IP. And we'll continue to do that throughout this year. But over time, as those installation cost just naturally become a smaller piece of the overall U-verse revenue stream, we'll start to see then the lift in improvement in profitability there. But I have been encouraged by the fact that when I look at those recurring revenues and margins, that they're at a reasonable level today. And when you look at the trend, that they've been growing pretty nicely over the last few quarters."

As you know, we contemplate dividend increases as we get towards the end of the year. And so as part of that, we certainly look at projections for the business in terms of cash flow supporting that dividend. And we consider changes in the environment, like tax law changes. But frankly, we'll wait until we get closer to that timeframe and, kind of, see how everything in the environment shakes out before we make any determinations there. Putting any tax issues aside though, what I would tell you is that we do believe that a strong and a growing dividend is a key element of how we provide returns to shareowners. So in terms of use of cash, that has traditionally been a much higher priority for us. And share repurchase has been a tool and a vehicle we've used in cases where we've gone through periods where we have excess cash, and we're at comfortable levels in terms of our balance sheet leverage. And so it was a way to adjust and modify our capital structure. But having said that, as we get through the rest of this year, and as we see how environment changes and how it might impact our shareowner base, we'll consider all of those options. Wireline margins is a balancing act right now, in all honestly, because we have products that are legacy products like Wireline Voice that are declining. But they're very mature products with not a lot of burden from installation or acquisition costs. So they have high margins. And the products that are the future of the business are growth products, generally, in the area of IP-based service and managed services. There are more acquisition costs, certainly, associated with some of them, like the U-verse. But over time, as those products scale, they will grow in margin. So we're going through this transition and to balance it this transition. That's why we've been very proactive and very aggressive on the cost side of our business and very proactive in trying to consolidate our operations that underlie and support both Wireless and Wireline, the set of one AT&T initiatives that we talk about. And we've been very proactive in taking costs out of the business there and very proactive in taking costs out of the business in areas where we're supporting services that are declining. And we'll continue to do that. I do believe we've got an opportunity to keep margins by a combination of all of those things, keep margins in Wireline at a fairly stable level as we go forward in the following quarters in the Wireline business. And longer term, and I do think of this as longer term, I think if we get some lift in revenues and lift from the economy, there is some upside to that. The 3G footprint is -- we're continuing to expand that footprint. And we'll have 3G coverage in virtually all areas that we serve, at the same time, as we're moving into expanding the 3G capability through HSPA 7.2, and then beginning to trial and plan and move towards LTE. It will follow the normal network progression we've had with upgrades to the data network. I don't have a specific POP number for you at this point."

Could you talk a little bit about your prospectives now on whether the climate is supportive of making those investments and when you think they'll come?

We were up in Wireless, down a bit in Wireline, and the reductions there had more to do with, kind of, demand level for services like high capacity circuits and so forth. We also had in the first quarter, I would tell you, a couple of areas where we had some supply chain and vendor issues that impacted some network components, not huge numbers but impacted the total numbers a little bit. And first quarter is always a little lower for us because of -- certainly, a large portion of our cap spend, our portfolio capital projects, new portfolio capital projects, which get approved and get into the' pipeline, kind of, late in the prior year always take a bit of time to ramp up. So you've got all of those factors. At this point, our outlook for the year, in terms of CapEx, is the same as we gave you in January, kind of, $18 billion to $19 billion range of a little rebalance in the portfolio with a couple of billion dollar more spent supporting the Wireless business, offset by some reductions in spend in Wireline. No change there. On the regulatory front, I think we continue to have good, I think positive, productive dialogue with regulators. They obviously have laid out some objectives and plans that they will move forward on. And it will create a number of different notices and proposed rulemakings and activities on the regulatory front. We'll continue to work with them on all of those. I do believe at the end of the day, I do believe they understand and agree that, in order to achieve their objectives, it's going to require an environment that supports capital investment and the ability for carriers to earn a return on that investment. So I think in that respect, we're hopeful. On the Wireline margin front, I wouldn't get too concerned overall, I guess, with the quarter-to-quarter changes in Wireline margins, even in the range of magnitude you spoke of, because there is always some quarter-to-quarter seasonality. And there, frankly, as large as that businesses, there are just some issues and adjustments that occur from quarter-to-quarter that can impact those comparisons. But as I said earlier, I think overall, in the levels that we operated in around the first quarter, I think we will be able to maintain Wireline margins throughout the year at a fairly stable way, kind of, in those ranges. And then longer term, again, we'll continue to work to increase profitability in the growth services, which will then further solidify and hopefully give us some upside with some revenue growth on margins in Wireline."

Can you give us a little bit of more context around what earnings trends could be now that you've seen, sort of, a little bit of an improvement in the economy and an upswing in Enterprise.

But it's -- very simply, our outlook hasn't changed. Whatever you have modeled for Wireless margins, with this accounting change, it's going to be 160, 170, 180 basis points higher than that. And it's just a mechanical change. And so that, what I was trying to say is that moves the margin levels up, probably still, at least, in the ranges that I would define as towards the lower 40s in 2010 and mid-40s beyond that, although 160 to 180 basis points higher than what you had before. On earnings per share, I think our guidance has been to -- stable to improving earnings per share in 2010. Not changing that guidance, clearly, the first quarter and being up, excluding the tax charge being up 11%, it gives us confidence that we're going to be able to provide some growth in earnings per share. And at the end of the day, that's -- put the guidance aside, that's our objective. We want to grow the business. We want to grow top line revenues again. We have some top line revenue growth this quarter. And that's something that we shouldn't just put aside. We want to continue that trend, and to do that, we need strong Wireless growth. We need continuing improvement in both our consumer and business wireline categories. And then we want to grow, obviously, earnings per share with that, and with some margin expansion, can hopefully grow at faster rates than revenues. So that's what we're setting out to do, and  we're off to good start in this year. On tiered-data pricing or pricing of any product, I won't get into thoughts and strategies about making potential changes in the future on pricing for any products. But I think your question is a good one. And it's one, not just for AT&T, but it's one for the industry overall. Because we're dealing with a few factors that you have to step back and just think about. One, in Wireless, you're dealing with some real limitations both from a technology standpoint, and more importantly, from a spectrum standpoint on capacity. And secondly, you're dealing with an overall trend of devices and applications and services moving to a wireless environment. So that's creating a tremendous amount of demand, particularly in Wireless data. And the third factor in the environment is you're dealing with a situation where, when you look at your customer base, even customers that are using similar devices, there's huge disparity in the amount of data that they use and the amount of capacity they consume. And so when you look at all of those things, as an industry, I think it will influence how, in the future, the pricing models developed. And as an industry, what the industry has to do is develop models that are understandable by customers, that customers can understand and live with. And at the same time, it's fair to customers in terms of the amount of a somewhat limited resource that they're consuming. And so that's, kind of, the whole thing on data pricing. And it will, I suspect, evolve as we go forward in the industry. And it will evolve as applications and devices continue to evolve, and data traffic continues to grow. Before we close, folks, I would like to add just a couple of quick closing comments. In January, we outlined a plan for you. And I believe what you seen in our results today is that we delivered what we said we would. And hopefully, what you see is that we delivered a little more than we said we would in this first quarter. We had a terrific start to the year. Wireless growth was excellent. Best ever churn, best effort Postpaid ARPU, best ever first quarter net adds, strong data growth. And I think even more importantly, we have a terrific technology path going forward to continue to deliver wireless growth. And we're already seeing solid improvements in data download speeds. And we've got a lot more to come there. At the same time, U-verse and our U-verse platform continues to scale. And it's improved and it's changing the revenue trajectory of our Wireline Consumer business. We have, what we believe, are the industry's premier business capabilities, in which we also continue to expand. And we're seeing early encouraging signs in the business markets. In total, as I said, something not to be overlooked, our consolidated revenues were up. Our cost initiatives are on track. And as a result, margins expanded and cash flow continues to be strong. So it's a strong start to the year. And our fundamental outlook on the business is positive. And now our job, very simply, is to continue to execute with the same kind of intensity and focus in the quarters ahead.

Rick will provide an update with perspective on the quarter in a minute, and then we'll take your questions. 
First, let me remind you that our release, investor briefing, supplementary information and the presentation slides that accompany this call are all available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. And as a reminder, that's www.att.com/investor.relations. 
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 2. And that says that information set forth in this presentation contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this presentation based on new information or otherwise. This presentation may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are also available on the our website at www.att.com/investor.relations. 
Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me quickly cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 3. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.68, up about 26% versus the same quarter a year ago. This includes a $0.07 gain from the exchange of Telmex Internacional stock. When excluding that onetime gain, EPS was $0.61, which was up 13% over the second quarter a year ago. This is our second consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, excluding onetime items. 
Second quarter consolidated revenues of $30.8 billion were up both year-over-year and sequentially, and that was led by continued double-digit service revenue growth in Wireless, further improvement in consumer wireline trends and continued mid-teens growth in strategic business products. In addition, our consolidated margins improved by 180 basis points year-over-year, with significant margin expansion in Wireless and also improved Wireline operating margins due to solid execution on cost initiatives. 
Cash flow also continues to be strong, with cash from operations for the quarter totaling $8.6 billion, which was up 9% year-over-year and free cash flow of $3.7 billion. As a reminder, we have moved Sterling Commerce to discontinued operations and we've restated eight quarters of history. Comparisons we'll be showing you today are based on results from continuing operations.

Before we get into detailed results, let me start with a few quick comments on the quarter overall. And the second quarter highlights are on Slide 4. The main point I'd like to make, s",2793,"Thanks, Brooks, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. Before we get into detailed results, let me start with a few quick comments on the quarter overall. And the second quarter highlights are on Slide 4. 
The main point I'd like to make, starting out, is that we again delivered a very strong set of financial results, as Brooks mentioned. We had our second consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, excluding some onetime items. Consolidated revenues were up both year-over-year and sequentially. Margins expanded and they expanded Wireless, in Wireline and in total, and cash flow was strong. So we're pleased across the board. The team is executing at a high level and the financial results are solid. We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for the business, and the results we put up in the first half clearly add to our visibility and confidence for the second half of this year with an improved full year outlook. 
That comes from a number of things. First, we've got terrific momentum in Wireless. Wireless service revenues grew double digits. Postpaid ARPU grew again for the sixth consecutive quarter. We also had our best second quarter ever for organic net adds at 1.6 million. Our churn rates continued to improve and we hit best-ever levels again. And both integrated devices and connected devices continue to be strengths for us. Even with strong iPhone activations in the quarter, we delivered substantial year-over-year Wireless margin expansion. 
And second, improving trends point to a return-to-revenue growth in our Consumer Wireline business. U-verse continues to scale, and it's driving growth in consumer IP revenues. And we posted our second consecutive quarter of sequential growth in Consumer Wireline. 
Third, we continue to see good traction in our business markets, and revenue trends are steadily moving in the right direction. And finally, we continue to execute well on the cost side, which has helped us deliver strong margins and strong free cash flow. So there's a lot of be positive about in terms of our current results as well as in the look ahead. 
With that as background, let's take a look at consolidated revenues on Slide 5. Our revenues totaled $30.8 billion for the quarter. That's up about $200 million versus the second quarter of a year ago. As you can see on this chart, our overall revenue mix continues to undergo a substantial and positive transformation, increasingly weighted to Wireless, to Wireline Data and Managed Services.
In the second quarter, 71% of revenues came from these categories, and that's up from 66% a year ago and 61% two years ago. Combined revenues from these sources grew nearly 8% in the second quarter. The drivers behind this transformation are clear. First is the explosive growth the industry has seen in mobile broadband. That's an area where AT&T has set the pace and where we're well positioned going forward. We're also seeing a transformation in Wireline Data with the emergence of U-verse and with strong mid-teens growth in strategic business services, even during the economic downturn. When you put this together and look at Data Services, both Wireless and Wired combined, they are the primary growth drivers. Total data revenue grew 15% year-over-year. And we expect this mix shift in revenues to continue, and the company is well positioned for it. 
Now let's take a look at Wireless, starting on Slide 6. As the Wireless business evolves, our focus has been on data and ARPU growth, and our results this quarter show the strength of that approach. Wireless Service revenues grew over 10% and are up more than $1 billion versus second quarter a year ago. The standout metric for us was postpaid ARPU, driven by mobile broadband and continued strong data adoption. Postpaid ARPU grew 3.4%, and that's despite adding 1.6 million subscribers from an acquisition late in the quarter.
Churn also continues to perform at record levels, and we had 1.6 million organic net adds, our best-ever second quarter, to get us to a total of over 90 million subscribers. Postpaid net adds were 500,000, with continued migration at the base to integrated devices. And prepaid increased by 300,000 due to the introduction of the iPad 3G. Customer response to the iPad 3G has been very positive since its launch at the end of April. 
We also added nearly 900,000 new connected devices: e-readers, alarm monitoring systems and a host of other emerging products. These connected devices have lower ARPUs but high margins, and it's a terrific opportunity for us. Our continued growth in postpaid ARPU and improvements in churn validates our strategy of focusing on high-value postpaid subscribers. For AT&T, we believe this strategy will continue to drive improvements in our overall Wireless results. 
Slide 7 highlights our growth in Wireless Data. In the second quarter, we grew Wireless Data revenues over 27% to $4.4 billion. Our postpaid data ARPU was up over 18% and customers on postpaid data plans grew nicely, up about a 1.5 million in the quarter and almost 7.6 million over the past year. 
We added 2.9 million 3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, and that was up nearly 15 million in the past 12 months. The ARPU for integrated devices continues to be 1.7x our other devices. Approximately 70% of integrated devices are on family plans and over 40% are on business-related plans with churn levels well below our average. When you combine them, these two groups of subscribers are above 80% of the base. And there's still a great deal of upside. A little more than half of our postpaid subscribers have integrated devices today, and our percentage of sales continues to run above 75%. 
iPhone activations for the quarter were a record 3.2 million and sales continue to be strong. During the second quarter, we introduced, as you all know, new pricing for Wireless Data. These plans are another way to expand our opportunity in mobile broadband. They make it more affordable for people to enjoy the benefits of the mobile Internet at a lower price and allow customers to migrate up as their data needs grow. While it's still early, we're pleased with the initial results on the new data plans and they are in line with our expectations. 
I also want to give you an update on our wireless network progress. The details are on Slide 8. First, we continue to execute aggressively on our nationwide initiatives. Earlier this year, we deployed HSPA 7.2 nationwide which increased our network speeds. In areas where we've completed the backhaul in support of 7.2, internal data is showing speed improvements in the 32% to 47% range. 
We recently announced plans to deploy HSPA+ by the end of this year. This has the capacity to double the theoretical peak speeds offered by HSPA 7.2. 
We're continuing to add cell towers. We're upgrading high-capacity antenna systems, and we're building out fiber backhaul throughout our footprint. 
In support of this growth, year-to-date capital spending for Wireless is up 49% from the first half of 2009. But what's great is that all of this work delivers immediate customer benefits, plus it's part of a seamless path to next-generation LTE. We plan to begin our trials for LTE within the next few months and expect to begin deploying LTE in 2011. 
In the meantime, the nation's fastest mobile broadband network gets even faster while on a seamless path toward 4G. I'm pleased to report that we're seeing and our customers are experiencing the impact of these investments. Company-wide, our 3G average data download speeds are up 15% versus a year ago based on internal data. 
In New York, our data is showing download speeds that are up 31% over the past six months. 3G dropped calls improved 13% across the metro area and 23% in Manhattan. 3G blocked calls are also down 21% in New York, in the New York Metro as a whole and 39% in Manhattan. 
And looking ahead, we are moving as quickly and as aggressively as possible as our Chief Technology Officer said in remarks a few days ago, we're moving ""heaven and earth"" to execute our network plan. We're adding additional third and fourth carriers, adding fiber backhaul and Ethernet to cell sites. We're deploying in-building and venue solutions, where appropriate. And we're doing more with Wi-Fi, including piloting Wi-Fi hot zones, like the one we've turned up and have running in Times Square. In San Francisco, we're implementing the same actions, and we're seeing similar progress, but we're about 90 days behind the schedule in New York City. You can expect improvement in San Francisco to follow similar trends to those in New York. 
In summary, we have a terrific technology path forward, and it's a huge advantage for us. We're executing against it aggressively. We're making progress and there's more to come. 
The other great news for Wireless has been the strength in the growth of our margins. The details are on Slide 9. When people look at things such as the iPhone and the whole explosion in mobile broadband, there's a natural tendency to focus on unit growth in revenue gains. But equally, if not more important, it is the profitability of those customers and services. 
In the second quarter, even with record iPhone activations of more than 3.2 million, our Wireless service margin was over 43%. It was up 300 basis points from the year-earlier quarter. And for a little perspective on that, our Wireless margins right now are up over 700 basis points above where they were just three years ago. And longer term, with continued growth in service revenues and ongoing cost initiatives, there is further opportunity to expand Wireless margins. 
You see the same trends when you look at Wireless operating income. In the second quarter, Wireless operating income grew by $800 million to reach $4.1 billion, and that's up 25% versus the year-earlier quarter. And looking back, our Wireless operating income has more than doubled in less than three years. 
Let me turn now and cover our Wireline results, starting with consumer trends on Slide 10. One of the big drivers in the continued improvement in consumer revenues has been our U-verse platform. The product continues to scale nicely. Our broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remain very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have either a triple or quad-play bundle with us. And as a result, U-verse ARPUs are attractive and growing. ARPU for U-verse triple play customers was nearly $160 in the second quarter, and that was up 13.8% year-over-year and 6.8% from the first quarter of 2010. 
In the second quarter, Wireline IP revenues, that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew 32%. And these products now represent more than 40% of total Consumer Wireline revenues, up almost 1,000 basis points in just the past year. This was our first $1 billion revenue quarter for U-verse, and it was our second straight quarter of sequential growth in total Wireline Consumer revenues. And we now have a clear line of sight to a return to Consumer Wireline revenue growth in the quarters ahead. 
Going forward, we expect U-verse revenue to continue to grow and margins to improve, and this will drive further improvements in our overall consumer financials. And last week, we announced the start of pair bonding deployment for U-verse. This will help us further expand U-verse services to even more customers as we stay on track to reach 30 million by next year. 
Now let's take a look at Wireline business, which is on Slide 11. We're seeing continued improvement as we, in the industry, work our way back from the economic downturn. While we're certainly not all the way back, we are seeing further signs of stabilization. Recent contract wins are encouraging, and the trends continue to move in the right direction. 
Revenues from strategic business products, Ethernet, virtual private networks, application services, were up nearly 16%. Business IP revenues were up more than 9%, the best growth in this category in several quarters. And we posted our first growth in five quarters in total business data revenues. That reflects some stabilization in data transport for business, which is also encouraging. Plus, we continue to do well selling wireless in the business space. We're seeing a fundamental shift with more enterprises asking us to help deploy full mobile solutions that bring together mobile broadband, cloud computing, seamless access to applications and even social media. 
We're uniquely positioned to deliver these kinds of solutions. We've had some major successes already, and we recently created a new business sales group to accelerate this opportunity. This new unit will develop applications that help enterprises mobilize their business. And we'll use these applications to build industry and company-specific solutions. So there's more to come here, but we're excited about this opportunity. 
We're also excited about the momentum we're seeing with several customer wins that play to our global network and mobility strengths. We recently announced agreements with Hilton Worldwide to provide a fully-managed suite of Wi-Fi and Internet services; and with German distribution company, Henkel, to manage their worldwide global network infrastructure in more than 100 countries. 
Now let's move ahead and take a look at margins and cash flow. The margin comparisons are on Slide 12. We said at the beginning of the year, we expected to deliver stable to improved consolidated margins when compared to 2009. And so far, we've beaten that. In the second quarter, consolidated operating income margin was 19.8%. That's 180 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2009. This reflects solid performance across the company, both in Wireless and Wireline. 
Our Wireline operating income margin was 12.2% in the second quarter. That's up 50 basis points versus second quarter last year. This reflects improving revenue trends and solid execution on cost initiatives. Across the business, total force was down more than 10,000 since the end of 2009. 
Company-wide, we have a commitment to operate as One AT&T [ph], which means delivering a single seamless experience to customers for all wireless and wireline products. And as we consolidate and integrate operations in order to do that, we have continuing opportunities for cost efficiencies. These initiatives strengthen our ability to sustain solid margins, and they put us in a unique position among our competitors to serve customers seamlessly with a best-in-class operation.
Along with solid margins, we also continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash summary is on Slide 13. In the first half of the year, cash from operations totaled $15.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $8.2 billion with a 49% year-over-year increase in Wireless capital. And as we outlined for you in January, we continued to expect full year capital investment in the $18 billion to $19 billion range. 
Free cash flow before dividends was $7.6 billion, and dividend payments totaled $5 billion. Over the last six quarters, we have generated over $10 billion of free cash flow after dividends. And in terms of using that cash, our debt is down almost $7 billion over the past 12 months. That gives us a debt-to-capital ratio of 40.3% and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5. This gives us the flexibility to retire additional debt as it comes due and continue to invest in the business and return substantial value to our shareowners.
I'd like to close by recapping just a few items that are on Slide 14. Our revenue trends are moving in a good direction. Wireless Service revenues grew double digits. We had strong mid-teens growth in strategic business service revenues. Business IP and data transport trends have improved, and we have clear line of sight to a return to growth in consumer Wireline as U-verse scales. 
In addition to top line improvements, we continue to have strong margins with expansion in Wireless, in Wireline and consolidated. For the second straight quarter, we delivered strong double-digit earnings growth, excluding onetime items, and cash flow was strong with more cost-improvement opportunities going forward. These results clearly add to our visibility and the confidence we have for the second half of this year. And it's fair to say that versus the outlook we provided you in January, we have improved expectations. 
For the full year, we now expect improved margins versus 2009 levels. We also expect strong earnings per share growth. And consistent with stronger earnings, we expect full year free cash flow that's above our original outlook. Our job is to continue to execute and to deliver financial results for you. We did that in the second quarter, and that's where we're focused going forward. 
Well, Brooks, that concludes what I had prepared. I think we're ready for Q&A."

And then just to understand on the guidance, for Q3 in particular, you've put out the early upgrade offer of six months. Obviously, the iPhone came in a little bit later this quarter.

We've had a lot of focus and had just terrific results on cash flow during a period that, as you all know, has been very, very difficult economically. That cash flow has given us the ability to continue to invest in the business through capital expenditures. We made also some significant purchases of Wireless Spectrum. We closed two very nice Wireless acquisitions. And so all of those things have helped us position the business going forward. In addition to that, we have paid down debt, and we brought our credit metrics back into the top end of the range. That represents our target range. So going forward, that does give us some flexibility to use excess free cash flow after payment of dividends for things other than debt reduction. And we're certainly going to consider those options. And one of those obviously is share repurchase. In terms of the guidance going forward, as you noted, we will probably see some degree of acceleration potentially in upgrades of iPhones from fourth quarter to third, as the iPhone 4 availability continues to improve from a supply standpoint. But I don't think that will have a -- it certainly will have no impact on the total year results. And our total guidance for the year may have a bit of an impact in 3Q, but I think it will tend to be more modest."

And it is all tied into the series of initiatives that we put under the umbrella of One AT&T [ph]. And the exciting part about that is it positions the company to provide services to customers and to interface with customers in the way they want to work with us, which is to be able to, through single points of contact, be able to purchase both wireless and wired products. So it's a better customer experience. And at the same time, it gives us real opportunities to consolidate organizations, to eliminate systems, to consolidated processes, all of which allow us to continually take costs out of the business. It's what has helped us reduce costs and reduced force, as we talked about the presentation, throughout the first half of this year. In addition to that, we are seeing now some benefits of work that we've done in our benefit plans, particularly through bargaining and particularly through our medical plans last year. We're starting to see some of the benefits from that, and we'll continue to see that as we go through the next couple of years. So all of those things are helping on the cost side. We've also had some other factors that have helped. We've been working very hard. We've got a consolidated, dedicated group that is working to reduce access costs, the amounts we pay to carry traffic and to use other carriers' networks. And we've had good results there, reductions in access costs and reductions in improvements in the trends there. And we're seeing good results now, frankly, despite the economy, in bad debt expense. So all of those things obviously have helped on the margin side. As we go forward, we will continue all of those efforts. And I think that will continue to help us maintain margins in our Wireline business. And our outlook would be to continue to perform with EBITDA margins in the lower 30% range, similar to what you've seen in the first half of the year and in the second quarter. With respect to broadband, we did have a weaker broadband number in the second quarter. And I think that was due to two things, primarily. One is just normal second quarter kind of seasonality. But also, we have seen competitors become more aggressive with promotions targeted specifically at our non-U-verse areas. And we will respond and are responding to those. We'll respond in a targeted fashion in terms of offers and promotions. But more importantly, we're also building infrastructure this year and building out IP DSLAMs in some of our non-U-verse areas that give us the ability to offer more robust data speeds and have a stronger broadband offering in those areas, and I think that will help as well. So our outlook is, as we go forward into the third quarter and the second half of the year, is that we should see some improvement in those overall broadband numbers. At the same time, we continue to be very pleased with U-verse performance and the performance in the U-verse areas. I think we'll also see a bit stronger results going forward in U-verse. One, it was affected a little bit just in the second quarter from a seasonality perspective. But in addition going forward, the ability to utilize pair bonding will expand our reach. So it brings more homes that we can now reach with the U-verse product set and gives us more homes to market into. One last comment I'd make with respect to really broadband but also just total revenue connections in the consumer area is, as you know, we've been reporting for many years now the revenue connections number. And that's an important indicator of consumer revenues. But it's also important to note that not all revenue connections are created equally. And so as you see in our second quarter results, we had some weakness in some of the connection numbers. Some of that, to a large degree, is seasonal in nature. But at the same time, we continue to see strong and improving revenue trends. And so when you look underneath that, what you see is that where we tend to lose some connections are in some lower ARPU voice and lower speed, lower ARPU broadband products. Where we're gaining connections, and U-verse is a perfect example of this, if you look at in the U-verse areas, we're gaining connections with customers who were buying multiple products, triple and quad play kinds of bundles. They're buying higher speed data products, and they're buying high-end video packages. So as a result, when you look at our broadband numbers, even though the total broadband declined a bit in the quarter, our overall consumer broadband ARPU is up year-over-year over 5%. And our consumer revenue per household is up about 7.5%. And so that's what you see driving those revenue results and as well contributing to margin results, because when you sell a bundled set of products and when you sell higher ARPU products into households, it gives you the opportunity to maintain and strengthen margins."

Was that more front-end loaded in this quarter or back-end loaded in Q1? And can we expect sort of a similar trend throughout the year, or is this sort of first-half phenomenon? And secondly, I was a little surprised by positive commentary regarding sales improvement on the business side. And I guess there was a comment about economic metrics improving as well. Can you just sort of clarify what you're seeing there?"

Well, first of all, on Wireless margins, I think some of our LANs [ph] from a force standpoint are probably a bit more front-end loaded for us this year, but we'll see. And it really will be determined by how volumes and what kind of demand growth we see as we go through the second part of the year. And again, the big drivers of the margin improvement are the to things that we talked about. So our biggest expenses, first of all, are force, wages and benefits and then access expenses. And so those are the areas that we have focused on and we'll continue, obviously, from the improvements we've made in our benefit plans, from the reductions we've made in force. We'll continue to see those benefits as we go forward in the second half of the year. Wireline, as you know, is also going through a significant transformation in products from voice to video and data. And what we're working very hard to do is to manage the margins and the profitability of that mix of services as we make the transition. And to do that, we have to continually monitor and migrate costs out of services and areas that are declining ago, and we need to continue to improve margins in the data services and the video services that are growing. So it's really working both ends of that equation, and we've done a good job up to this point. And my expectation is we'll continue, as we go in the second half of the year, to be able to manage that and maintain those margins in the kinds of ranges you saw in the first half of the year. The other question had to do with business sales, and just let me be clear. When you look at the trends over the last three or four quarters, we are seeing some improvement in three or four of the economic metrics that we believe are important relative to our business revenue trends. But that improvement is, I would characterize as being modest and slow. And the economic trends are, first of all, in unemployment, where unemployment continues to be stubbornly high. It's improved a bit, but not seen, frankly, much movement there. We are seeing some improving trends in industrial production. Again, slow and modest. We are seeing some improvement in business formations at the low end of business, and so those are also helpful. But overall, what I'd characterize in business is we expect going forward, in the remainder of this year and as we get into 2011, a steady improvement. But it will be a slower improvement. We're not anticipating any kind of V-shaped recovery, if you will. One other thing I'd add in business, and this is also important, we've talked about this in the past is, the business group as well as our operations folks had done a terrific job in managing the cost and the margin side of supporting business customers. So as we've gone through the last 18, 24 months, our fully allocated margins in business have stayed very stable. And in fact, in the last couple of quarters, we've seen a bit of an increase in margins on the business side. And that's been encouraging to us. One of the things we've talked to you all about is our belief that the things we have done on the cost side will allow us to leverage that cost structure and gets some margin improvement as we started to see some continued improvement in revenues. And I think we're seeing a bit of that now."

Can you flesh that out for us a little bit? I'm just wondering, maybe specifically, parameters around what constitutes sort of an attractive market opportunity for you?

First of all, on postpaid ARPU growth, we continue to be very pleased with the performance. And obviously, it's driven by data revenues by growth and the penetration of integrated devices as we talked about in the presentation. We continue to see good results there, and we continue to have upside potential. I believe that integrated devices at some point will get up into the 70%, 80% range of the base, maybe higher. It's just the direction that the market is going. It's very early on the tiered wireless data plans to really give you much in terms of the results and how that will impact the trends. I'll tell you on kind of a macro basis, I think what it will do is it will put a little bit of pressure on ARPU and data growth in the near term as some customers migrate down to some lower price points. But obviously, it puts wireless data in a much better position and provide some growth opportunity going forward. I don't think it will dramatically change the trajectory of ARPUs or revenue growth, but it may reduce the growth rates a bit as we go forward over the next year or so. The early results on the tiered data plans though have been I think pretty encouraging and on balance, pretty much what we expected. We have seen some migrations of customers from a $30 unlimited plans down into the lower tiered plans. But the migrations at this point have tended to be at kind of the lower end of our range of expectations. And originally, to be honest, we had expected virtually all of those customers to migrate down to the lower price point. And in fact, we've had a portion of those customers more than we had expected migrating but just migrating to the $25 plan. So from an ARPU perspective, all of that is a bit better than we had expected. On the other side, we are seeing nice growth in terms of customers that are now upgrading to integrated devices and moving into the lower tiered plan. And so I think we are seeing the benefits of lowering the point of entry so that customers can move into the integrated device, begin to try the data services. And we believe over time, based on how much data they use, they will then begin to migrate up to higher tiered plans. So all in all, I think it's been within our expectations. With respect to acquisitions, I would tell you that while we have looked at international opportunities particularly with respect to some emerging markets, when we look at those kinds of opportunities, we look at a number of factors including the cost, can we produce value to shareowners based on that investment, what the market structure is like and what partnership opportunities are available. And finding the right opportunity there is very difficult. So I believe the Chairman's comments in the article you were talking about really pointed to the fact that we haven't found opportunities there that we feel are the right fit for us. Generally, if we were to make an investment in most cases, we would want the ability to have substantial control over operations, although the one area that has been very successful for us, and that we're very pleased with, has been our relationship and our stake in América Móvil, which has been I think a good way for us to bring some emerging market exposure into our mix."

Obviously, we saw the agreement to sell Sterling Commerce. Also, you guys agreed to sell a unit in Japan. It sounds like you guys are zeroing in on a strategy more focused on upgrading that portion of the rural wireline market that you can to push back on some of the cable inroads. I was wondering, are there any more plans inside AT&T to focus on divesting those parts of the business that may include some of the rural wireline markets that increasingly look non-core to the AT&T game plan? And then the second part of that, I guess, is to follow up on Jason's question. The second part of what Randall was saying seemed to be this continuing theme about the industrial logic of a satellite acquisition. But I think that as time has passed and your facilities-based video has rolled out, it seems like there's less and less of an industrial logic. I was wondering if you could kind of speak to where that issue stands internally now."

As you noted, we've done a couple of divestitures. And as you would expect from us is, I think every company does, we are continually looking at our portfolio of assets and products and services and looking at areas that are not as strong a fit for us or not as closely tied to our strategies going forward. And when there are opportunities at the right prices and the right terms to make some divestitures there, we will. But that's just part of the ongoing process of looking at the portfolio of assets that we have. The rural properties are interesting in terms of looking at those, because a couple of things that they do for us is -- our business is scale-related. And so when we look at those properties, they tend to produce pretty good cash flows, and the direct costs are relatively low related to many of those properties or they are shared across our total infrastructure. And so we continue to look at opportunities there to strengthen the position, to increase and improve our broadband capability, to utilize our relationships and commercial agreements with satellite to bring a full bundle of products into those territories. And we'll continue to look at what makes the most sense for those going forward, but there's nothing imminent with respect to those. And in terms of the discussion about satellite, and our businesses has gone on for many years. And there are always, again, are advantages of scale and the ability to leverage the size of customer bases to reduce content costs. But in all acquisitions and opportunities, you look at what are the financial characteristics and opportunities and can you create value. And obviously, as we've gone up to this point, we felt very good about the path we're on. And as you heard today, and as you see again in our results, you continue to see the growth in the U-verse platform. And the strength of that, frankly, is in its ability to provide voice, data and video, a full bundle of products all over a common infrastructure. And so we'll continue to push down that path. And you see the results. You see the improvement it's making in our consumer business and our consumer revenue trends. And so I think we're looking at all the right things. I think we're following the right path with respect to that consumer business."

They've only been out there, at the longest, a couple of months, and so not a lot of history at this point. What we do see is that, first of all, in the quarter, we did 400,000 to 500,000 iPad 3Gs over that two-month period that we're activated on the network. The majority of those, probably in the 75% to 80% range, come on at the higher data package. So originally, some signed up at the $30 package, and then as we introduce our tiered pricing, they're coming on at the $25 2 gig level. And overall ARPU so far, again, it's very early on -- in the same range as our prepaid base kind of upper 20s to $30 customers. And usage patterns are about that we've expected so far, which is above our typical iPhone customer but less than our typical LaptopConnect customers. So in all respects, I think the iPad numbers, metrics, ARPUs, volumes have been in the ranges that we expected. One thing that's been encouraging and a bit surprising so far is the level of interest from business customers. And when we first introduced the iPhone, the businesses and in particular, CIOs of our business customers, were reluctant. And they kind of push back on bringing the iPhone into their infrastructure. And over time, that's, as you know, has changed dramatically, and now we have businesses that are developing applications and putting their own applications and content down on the iPhone base within their companies. And so that's evolved. Well, right from the beginning with the iPad, we've had a number of our business customers expressed interest. A number of them had trials going on. They see a lot of opportunity to use the iPad within their business. And in fact, right before the call, Brooks and I were just talking. And she has downloaded -- as you go through earnings, we produce a lot of paper, obviously, with presentations and backup materials. She's got all of that downloaded now on her iPad. So I think we'll be doing much more of that going forward. And that's just an example where people see the opportunity, businesses see the opportunity, in many cases, to use the iPad potentially in place of laptops for many of their people that travel. So it'll be interesting to see how the product evolves. But so far, it's been very good."

As you know, we said at the beginning of the year, we expected Wireless CapEx to b",781,"Sure, Tim. First of all, in CapEx. CapEx, we're right on target and plan through the first half of the year to be in the $18 billion to $19 billion range that we guided to. As you know, we said at the beginning of the year, we expected Wireless CapEx to be up a couple billion dollars this year. If you look at first-half results, I think Wireless CapEx is up about $1 billion during the first half. And so, again, we're right on target with that. We're seeing in some areas may be a bit more demand than we had in the original plan, but not enough to change our guidance or total CapEx for the year. So I think everything this year is right on target. We're in the very early planning stages to update our plans for next year. But on a macro basis, what I would expect at this point as we look forward over the next few years is that overall, we'll continue to be in a similar range, kind of lower teens as a percent of revenues. But you will see some continued shift in our CapEx between Wireline and Wireless. Obviously, as we get to end of next year, we'll be ramping up our initial $30 million home build on U-verse, so that will further bring Wireline CapEx down a little bit. On the Wireless side, we'll be rolling out LTE. So you will continue to see a bit of a mix shift there. But overall CapEx, I would tell you, as a percent of revenues, in ranges pretty consistent with what you're currently seeing. In terms of earnings guidance, as you said, we've had two very strong quarters to start the year with double-digit earnings growth. As you know, it's a volatile environment out there, and we can't commit to you double-digit earnings growth every quarter. But the first half of the year has given us confidence and visibility into what we can do, both in terms of revenues and margins in the second half. And I think we'll continue to have the opportunity to post strong earnings growth in the second half of the year. We've got a couple of things that will be different from the first half. We will incur some costs as a part of the acquisition of the Alltel properties. And as you know, the majority of customers there, we acquired 1.6 million customers. The majority of those are postpaid, about 1.4 million, and the majority of those customers overall are CDMA customers. And so we want to, as quickly as possible, build out the GSM networks in those footprints and convert that base to GSM. And there's a cost associated with doing that, so you'll see some impact from that in the second half of the year. And as we talked about on one of the earlier questions, as we go into third quarter, we'll have a bit of an acceleration of some upgrades to the iPhone 4. But overall, as I mentioned in the presentation, versus where we were at the beginning of this year, better visibility into earnings growth and more confidence in earnings growth as we go through the second half of the year. 
Folks, if I can, I just like to offer a couple of closing comments. And first of all, I want to thank all of you for taking part in the call today. And I just like to emphasize first that, again, we delivered another strong quarter of financial results, with consolidated revenues up year-over-year and sequentially. Our margins were strong and growing with expansion across the business in Wireless and Wireline and consolidated, and this drove double-digit earnings growth for the second consecutive quarter. 
Secondly, we continued our momentum in Wireless, with double-digit service revenue growth and our sixth consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU growth. Also, delivered substantial year-over-year Wireless margin expansion even with a record quarter in terms of iPhone and integrated device activations. And third, we continue to execute well on the cost side, while efficiently managing the business. And this helped us deliver solid margins and strong free cash flow and put's us in a great position to continue delivering good results in the remainder of this year. 
And we have a fundamentally positive outlook for the business long term. And near term, feel good about the second half of the year. Our job now, as I've mentioned before, is to continue to execute and deliver those financial results for you. That's where our focus is. I want to thank you again for being on the call, and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T."

Rick will provide an update with perspective on the quarter in a minute, and then we'll take your questions. 
First, let me remind you that our release, investor briefing, supplementary information and the presentation slides that accompany this call are all available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. And as a reminder, that's www.att.com/investor.relations. 
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 2. And that says that information set forth in this presentation contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this presentation based on new information or otherwise. This presentation may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are also available on the our website at www.att.com/investor.relations. 
Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me quickly cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on Slide 3. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.68, up about 26% versus the same quarter a year ago. This includes a $0.07 gain from the exchange of Telmex Internacional stock. When excluding that onetime gain, EPS was $0.61, which was up 13% over the second quarter a year ago. This is our second consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, excluding onetime items. 
Second quarter consolidated revenues of $30.8 billion were up both year-over-year and sequentially, and that was led by continued double-digit service revenue growth in Wireless, further improvement in consumer wireline trends and continued mid-teens growth in strategic business products. In addition, our consolidated margins improved by 180 basis points year-over-year, with significant margin expansion in Wireless and also improved Wireline operating margins due to solid execution on cost initiatives. 
Cash flow also continues to be strong, with cash from operations for the quarter totaling $8.6 billion, which was up 9% year-over-year and free cash flow of $3.7 billion. As a reminder, we have moved Sterling Commerce to discontinued operations and we've restated eight quarters of history. Comparisons we'll be showing you today are based on results from continuing operations. 
With that quick overview, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?

Before we get into detailed results, let me start with a few quick comments on the quarter overall. And the second quarter highlights are on Slide 4. The main point I'd like to make, s",2793,"Thanks, Brooks, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. Before we get into detailed results, let me start with a few quick comments on the quarter overall. And the second quarter highlights are on Slide 4. 
The main point I'd like to make, starting out, is that we again delivered a very strong set of financial results, as Brooks mentioned. We had our second consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth, excluding some onetime items. Consolidated revenues were up both year-over-year and sequentially. Margins expanded and they expanded Wireless, in Wireline and in total, and cash flow was strong. So we're pleased across the board. The team is executing at a high level and the financial results are solid. We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for the business, and the results we put up in the first half clearly add to our visibility and confidence for the second half of this year with an improved full year outlook. 
That comes from a number of things. First, we've got terrific momentum in Wireless. Wireless service revenues grew double digits. Postpaid ARPU grew again for the sixth consecutive quarter. We also had our best second quarter ever for organic net adds at 1.6 million. Our churn rates continued to improve and we hit best-ever levels again. And both integrated devices and connected devices continue to be strengths for us. Even with strong iPhone activations in the quarter, we delivered substantial year-over-year Wireless margin expansion. 
And second, improving trends point to a return-to-revenue growth in our Consumer Wireline business. U-verse continues to scale, and it's driving growth in consumer IP revenues. And we posted our second consecutive quarter of sequential growth in Consumer Wireline. 
Third, we continue to see good traction in our business markets, and revenue trends are steadily moving in the right direction. And finally, we continue to execute well on the cost side, which has helped us deliver strong margins and strong free cash flow. So there's a lot of be positive about in terms of our current results as well as in the look ahead. 
With that as background, let's take a look at consolidated revenues on Slide 5. Our revenues totaled $30.8 billion for the quarter. That's up about $200 million versus the second quarter of a year ago. As you can see on this chart, our overall revenue mix continues to undergo a substantial and positive transformation, increasingly weighted to Wireless, to Wireline Data and Managed Services.
In the second quarter, 71% of revenues came from these categories, and that's up from 66% a year ago and 61% two years ago. Combined revenues from these sources grew nearly 8% in the second quarter. The drivers behind this transformation are clear. First is the explosive growth the industry has seen in mobile broadband. That's an area where AT&T has set the pace and where we're well positioned going forward. We're also seeing a transformation in Wireline Data with the emergence of U-verse and with strong mid-teens growth in strategic business services, even during the economic downturn. When you put this together and look at Data Services, both Wireless and Wired combined, they are the primary growth drivers. Total data revenue grew 15% year-over-year. And we expect this mix shift in revenues to continue, and the company is well positioned for it. 
Now let's take a look at Wireless, starting on Slide 6. As the Wireless business evolves, our focus has been on data and ARPU growth, and our results this quarter show the strength of that approach. Wireless Service revenues grew over 10% and are up more than $1 billion versus second quarter a year ago. The standout metric for us was postpaid ARPU, driven by mobile broadband and continued strong data adoption. Postpaid ARPU grew 3.4%, and that's despite adding 1.6 million subscribers from an acquisition late in the quarter.
Churn also continues to perform at record levels, and we had 1.6 million organic net adds, our best-ever second quarter, to get us to a total of over 90 million subscribers. Postpaid net adds were 500,000, with continued migration at the base to integrated devices. And prepaid increased by 300,000 due to the introduction of the iPad 3G. Customer response to the iPad 3G has been very positive since its launch at the end of April. 
We also added nearly 900,000 new connected devices: e-readers, alarm monitoring systems and a host of other emerging products. These connected devices have lower ARPUs but high margins, and it's a terrific opportunity for us. Our continued growth in postpaid ARPU and improvements in churn validates our strategy of focusing on high-value postpaid subscribers. For AT&T, we believe this strategy will continue to drive improvements in our overall Wireless results. 
Slide 7 highlights our growth in Wireless Data. In the second quarter, we grew Wireless Data revenues over 27% to $4.4 billion. Our postpaid data ARPU was up over 18% and customers on postpaid data plans grew nicely, up about a 1.5 million in the quarter and almost 7.6 million over the past year. 
We added 2.9 million 3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, and that was up nearly 15 million in the past 12 months. The ARPU for integrated devices continues to be 1.7x our other devices. Approximately 70% of integrated devices are on family plans and over 40% are on business-related plans with churn levels well below our average. When you combine them, these two groups of subscribers are above 80% of the base. And there's still a great deal of upside. A little more than half of our postpaid subscribers have integrated devices today, and our percentage of sales continues to run above 75%. 
iPhone activations for the quarter were a record 3.2 million and sales continue to be strong. During the second quarter, we introduced, as you all know, new pricing for Wireless Data. These plans are another way to expand our opportunity in mobile broadband. They make it more affordable for people to enjoy the benefits of the mobile Internet at a lower price and allow customers to migrate up as their data needs grow. While it's still early, we're pleased with the initial results on the new data plans and they are in line with our expectations. 
I also want to give you an update on our wireless network progress. The details are on Slide 8. First, we continue to execute aggressively on our nationwide initiatives. Earlier this year, we deployed HSPA 7.2 nationwide which increased our network speeds. In areas where we've completed the backhaul in support of 7.2, internal data is showing speed improvements in the 32% to 47% range. 
We recently announced plans to deploy HSPA+ by the end of this year. This has the capacity to double the theoretical peak speeds offered by HSPA 7.2. 
We're continuing to add cell towers. We're upgrading high-capacity antenna systems, and we're building out fiber backhaul throughout our footprint. 
In support of this growth, year-to-date capital spending for Wireless is up 49% from the first half of 2009. But what's great is that all of this work delivers immediate customer benefits, plus it's part of a seamless path to next-generation LTE. We plan to begin our trials for LTE within the next few months and expect to begin deploying LTE in 2011. 
In the meantime, the nation's fastest mobile broadband network gets even faster while on a seamless path toward 4G. I'm pleased to report that we're seeing and our customers are experiencing the impact of these investments. Company-wide, our 3G average data download speeds are up 15% versus a year ago based on internal data. 
In New York, our data is showing download speeds that are up 31% over the past six months. 3G dropped calls improved 13% across the metro area and 23% in Manhattan. 3G blocked calls are also down 21% in New York, in the New York Metro as a whole and 39% in Manhattan. 
And looking ahead, we are moving as quickly and as aggressively as possible as our Chief Technology Officer said in remarks a few days ago, we're moving ""heaven and earth"" to execute our network plan. We're adding additional third and fourth carriers, adding fiber backhaul and Ethernet to cell sites. We're deploying in-building and venue solutions, where appropriate. And we're doing more with Wi-Fi, including piloting Wi-Fi hot zones, like the one we've turned up and have running in Times Square. In San Francisco, we're implementing the same actions, and we're seeing similar progress, but we're about 90 days behind the schedule in New York City. You can expect improvement in San Francisco to follow similar trends to those in New York. 
In summary, we have a terrific technology path forward, and it's a huge advantage for us. We're executing against it aggressively. We're making progress and there's more to come. 
The other great news for Wireless has been the strength in the growth of our margins. The details are on Slide 9. When people look at things such as the iPhone and the whole explosion in mobile broadband, there's a natural tendency to focus on unit growth in revenue gains. But equally, if not more important, it is the profitability of those customers and services. 
In the second quarter, even with record iPhone activations of more than 3.2 million, our Wireless service margin was over 43%. It was up 300 basis points from the year-earlier quarter. And for a little perspective on that, our Wireless margins right now are up over 700 basis points above where they were just three years ago. And longer term, with continued growth in service revenues and ongoing cost initiatives, there is further opportunity to expand Wireless margins. 
You see the same trends when you look at Wireless operating income. In the second quarter, Wireless operating income grew by $800 million to reach $4.1 billion, and that's up 25% versus the year-earlier quarter. And looking back, our Wireless operating income has more than doubled in less than three years. 
Let me turn now and cover our Wireline results, starting with consumer trends on Slide 10. One of the big drivers in the continued improvement in consumer revenues has been our U-verse platform. The product continues to scale nicely. Our broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remain very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have either a triple or quad-play bundle with us. And as a result, U-verse ARPUs are attractive and growing. ARPU for U-verse triple play customers was nearly $160 in the second quarter, and that was up 13.8% year-over-year and 6.8% from the first quarter of 2010. 
In the second quarter, Wireline IP revenues, that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew 32%. And these products now represent more than 40% of total Consumer Wireline revenues, up almost 1,000 basis points in just the past year. This was our first $1 billion revenue quarter for U-verse, and it was our second straight quarter of sequential growth in total Wireline Consumer revenues. And we now have a clear line of sight to a return to Consumer Wireline revenue growth in the quarters ahead. 
Going forward, we expect U-verse revenue to continue to grow and margins to improve, and this will drive further improvements in our overall consumer financials. And last week, we announced the start of pair bonding deployment for U-verse. This will help us further expand U-verse services to even more customers as we stay on track to reach 30 million by next year. 
Now let's take a look at Wireline business, which is on Slide 11. We're seeing continued improvement as we, in the industry, work our way back from the economic downturn. While we're certainly not all the way back, we are seeing further signs of stabilization. Recent contract wins are encouraging, and the trends continue to move in the right direction. 
Revenues from strategic business products, Ethernet, virtual private networks, application services, were up nearly 16%. Business IP revenues were up more than 9%, the best growth in this category in several quarters. And we posted our first growth in five quarters in total business data revenues. That reflects some stabilization in data transport for business, which is also encouraging. Plus, we continue to do well selling wireless in the business space. We're seeing a fundamental shift with more enterprises asking us to help deploy full mobile solutions that bring together mobile broadband, cloud computing, seamless access to applications and even social media. 
We're uniquely positioned to deliver these kinds of solutions. We've had some major successes already, and we recently created a new business sales group to accelerate this opportunity. This new unit will develop applications that help enterprises mobilize their business. And we'll use these applications to build industry and company-specific solutions. So there's more to come here, but we're excited about this opportunity. 
We're also excited about the momentum we're seeing with several customer wins that play to our global network and mobility strengths. We recently announced agreements with Hilton Worldwide to provide a fully-managed suite of Wi-Fi and Internet services; and with German distribution company, Henkel, to manage their worldwide global network infrastructure in more than 100 countries. 
Now let's move ahead and take a look at margins and cash flow. The margin comparisons are on Slide 12. We said at the beginning of the year, we expected to deliver stable to improved consolidated margins when compared to 2009. And so far, we've beaten that. In the second quarter, consolidated operating income margin was 19.8%. That's 180 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2009. This reflects solid performance across the company, both in Wireless and Wireline. 
Our Wireline operating income margin was 12.2% in the second quarter. That's up 50 basis points versus second quarter last year. This reflects improving revenue trends and solid execution on cost initiatives. Across the business, total force was down more than 10,000 since the end of 2009. 
Company-wide, we have a commitment to operate as One AT&T [ph], which means delivering a single seamless experience to customers for all wireless and wireline products. And as we consolidate and integrate operations in order to do that, we have continuing opportunities for cost efficiencies. These initiatives strengthen our ability to sustain solid margins, and they put us in a unique position among our competitors to serve customers seamlessly with a best-in-class operation.
Along with solid margins, we also continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash summary is on Slide 13. In the first half of the year, cash from operations totaled $15.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $8.2 billion with a 49% year-over-year increase in Wireless capital. And as we outlined for you in January, we continued to expect full year capital investment in the $18 billion to $19 billion range. 
Free cash flow before dividends was $7.6 billion, and dividend payments totaled $5 billion. Over the last six quarters, we have generated over $10 billion of free cash flow after dividends. And in terms of using that cash, our debt is down almost $7 billion over the past 12 months. That gives us a debt-to-capital ratio of 40.3% and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5. This gives us the flexibility to retire additional debt as it comes due and continue to invest in the business and return substantial value to our shareowners.
I'd like to close by recapping just a few items that are on Slide 14. Our revenue trends are moving in a good direction. Wireless Service revenues grew double digits. We had strong mid-teens growth in strategic business service revenues. Business IP and data transport trends have improved, and we have clear line of sight to a return to growth in consumer Wireline as U-verse scales. 
In addition to top line improvements, we continue to have strong margins with expansion in Wireless, in Wireline and consolidated. For the second straight quarter, we delivered strong double-digit earnings growth, excluding onetime items, and cash flow was strong with more cost-improvement opportunities going forward. These results clearly add to our visibility and the confidence we have for the second half of this year. And it's fair to say that versus the outlook we provided you in January, we have improved expectations. 
For the full year, we now expect improved margins versus 2009 levels. We also expect strong earnings per share growth. And consistent with stronger earnings, we expect full year free cash flow that's above our original outlook. Our job is to continue to execute and to deliver financial results for you. We did that in the second quarter, and that's where we're focused going forward. 
Well, Brooks, that concludes what I had prepared. I think we're ready for Q&A.

We've had a lot of focus and had just terrific results on cash flow during a period that, as you all know, has been very, very difficult economically. That cash flow has given us the ability to continue to invest in the business through capital expenditures. We made also some significant purchases of Wireless Spectrum. We closed two very nice Wireless acquisitions. And so all of those things have helped us position the business going forward. In addition to that, we have paid down debt, and we brought our credit metrics back into the top end of the range. That represents our target range. So going forward, that does give us some flexibility to use excess free cash flow after payment of dividends for things other than debt reduction. And we're certainly going to consider those options. And one of those obviously is share repurchase. In terms of the guidance going forward, as you noted, we will probably see some degree of acceleration potentially in upgrades of iPhones from fourth quarter to third, as the iPhone 4 availability continues to improve from a supply standpoint. But I don't think that will have a -- it certainly will have no impact on the total year results. And our total guidance for the year may have a bit of an impact in 3Q, but I think it will tend to be more modest.

And it is all tied into the series of initiatives that we put under the umbrella of One AT&T [ph]. And the exciting part about that is it positions the company to provide services to customers and to interface with customers in the way they want to work with us, which is to be able to, through single points of contact, be able to purchase both wireless and wired products. So it's a better customer experience. And at the same time, it gives us real opportunities to consolidate organizations, to eliminate systems, to consolidated processes, all of which allow us to continually take costs out of the business. It's what has helped us reduce costs and reduced force, as we talked about the presentation, throughout the first half of this year. In addition to that, we are seeing now some benefits of work that we've done in our benefit plans, particularly through bargaining and particularly through our medical plans last year. We're starting to see some of the benefits from that, and we'll continue to see that as we go through the next couple of years. So all of those things are helping on the cost side. We've also had some other factors that have helped. We've been working very hard. We've got a consolidated, dedicated group that is working to reduce access costs, the amounts we pay to carry traffic and to use other carriers' networks. And we've had good results there, reductions in access costs and reductions in improvements in the trends there. And we're seeing good results now, frankly, despite the economy, in bad debt expense. So all of those things obviously have helped on the margin side. As we go forward, we will continue all of those efforts. And I think that will continue to help us maintain margins in our Wireline business. And our outlook would be to continue to perform with EBITDA margins in the lower 30% range, similar to what you've seen in the first half of the year and in the second quarter. With respect to broadband, we did have a weaker broadband number in the second quarter. And I think that was due to two things, primarily. One is just normal second quarter kind of seasonality. But also, we have seen competitors become more aggressive with promotions targeted specifically at our non-U-verse areas. And we will respond and are responding to those. We'll respond in a targeted fashion in terms of offers and promotions. But more importantly, we're also building infrastructure this year and building out IP DSLAMs in some of our non-U-verse areas that give us the ability to offer more robust data speeds and have a stronger broadband offering in those areas, and I think that will help as well. So our outlook is, as we go forward into the third quarter and the second half of the year, is that we should see some improvement in those overall broadband numbers. At the same time, we continue to be very pleased with U-verse performance and the performance in the U-verse areas. I think we'll also see a bit stronger results going forward in U-verse. One, it was affected a little bit just in the second quarter from a seasonality perspective. But in addition going forward, the ability to utilize pair bonding will expand our reach. So it brings more homes that we can now reach with the U-verse product set and gives us more homes to market into. One last comment I'd make with respect to really broadband but also just total revenue connections in the consumer area is, as you know, we've been reporting for many years now the revenue connections number. And that's an important indicator of consumer revenues. But it's also important to note that not all revenue connections are created equally. And so as you see in our second quarter results, we had some weakness in some of the connection numbers. Some of that, to a large degree, is seasonal in nature. But at the same time, we continue to see strong and improving revenue trends. And so when you look underneath that, what you see is that where we tend to lose some connections are in some lower ARPU voice and lower speed, lower ARPU broadband products. Where we're gaining connections, and U-verse is a perfect example of this, if you look at in the U-verse areas, we're gaining connections with customers who were buying multiple products, triple and quad play kinds of bundles. They're buying higher speed data products, and they're buying high-end video packages. So as a result, when you look at our broadband numbers, even though the total broadband declined a bit in the quarter, our overall consumer broadband ARPU is up year-over-year over 5%. And our consumer revenue per household is up about 7.5%. And so that's what you see driving those revenue results and as well contributing to margin results, because when you sell a bundled set of products and when you sell higher ARPU products into households, it gives you the opportunity to maintain and strengthen margins.

Well, first of all, on Wireless margins, I think some of our LANs [ph] from a force standpoint are probably a bit more front-end loaded for us this year, but we'll see. And it really will be determined by how volumes and what kind of demand growth we see as we go through the second part of the year. And again, the big drivers of the margin improvement are the to things that we talked about. So our biggest expenses, first of all, are force, wages and benefits and then access expenses. And so those are the areas that we have focused on and we'll continue, obviously, from the improvements we've made in our benefit plans, from the reductions we've made in force. We'll continue to see those benefits as we go forward in the second half of the year. Wireline, as you know, is also going through a significant transformation in products from voice to video and data. And what we're working very hard to do is to manage the margins and the profitability of that mix of services as we make the transition. And to do that, we have to continually monitor and migrate costs out of services and areas that are declining ago, and we need to continue to improve margins in the data services and the video services that are growing. So it's really working both ends of that equation, and we've done a good job up to this point. And my expectation is we'll continue, as we go in the second half of the year, to be able to manage that and maintain those margins in the kinds of ranges you saw in the first half of the year. The other question had to do with business sales, and just let me be clear. When you look at the trends over the last three or four quarters, we are seeing some improvement in three or four of the economic metrics that we believe are important relative to our business revenue trends. But that improvement is, I would characterize as being modest and slow. And the economic trends are, first of all, in unemployment, where unemployment continues to be stubbornly high. It's improved a bit, but not seen, frankly, much movement there. We are seeing some improving trends in industrial production. Again, slow and modest. We are seeing some improvement in business formations at the low end of business, and so those are also helpful. But overall, what I'd characterize in business is we expect going forward, in the remainder of this year and as we get into 2011, a steady improvement. But it will be a slower improvement. We're not anticipating any kind of V-shaped recovery, if you will. One other thing I'd add in business, and this is also important, we've talked about this in the past is, the business group as well as our operations folks had done a terrific job in managing the cost and the margin side of supporting business customers. So as we've gone through the last 18, 24 months, our fully allocated margins in business have stayed very stable. And in fact, in the last couple of quarters, we've seen a bit of an increase in margins on the business side. And that's been encouraging to us. One of the things we've talked to you all about is our belief that the things we have done on the cost side will allow us to leverage that cost structure and gets some margin improvement as we started to see some continued improvement in revenues. And I think we're seeing a bit of that now.

First of all, on postpaid ARPU growth, we continue to be very pleased with the performance. And obviously, it's driven by data revenues by growth and the penetration of integrated devices as we talked about in the presentation. We continue to see good results there, and we continue to have upside potential. I believe that integrated devices at some point will get up into the 70%, 80% range of the base, maybe higher. It's just the direction that the market is going. It's very early on the tiered wireless data plans to really give you much in terms of the results and how that will impact the trends. I'll tell you on kind of a macro basis, I think what it will do is it will put a little bit of pressure on ARPU and data growth in the near term as some customers migrate down to some lower price points. But obviously, it puts wireless data in a much better position and provide some growth opportunity going forward. I don't think it will dramatically change the trajectory of ARPUs or revenue growth, but it may reduce the growth rates a bit as we go forward over the next year or so. The early results on the tiered data plans though have been I think pretty encouraging and on balance, pretty much what we expected. We have seen some migrations of customers from a $30 unlimited plans down into the lower tiered plans. But the migrations at this point have tended to be at kind of the lower end of our range of expectations. And originally, to be honest, we had expected virtually all of those customers to migrate down to the lower price point. And in fact, we've had a portion of those customers more than we had expected migrating but just migrating to the $25 plan. So from an ARPU perspective, all of that is a bit better than we had expected. On the other side, we are seeing nice growth in terms of customers that are now upgrading to integrated devices and moving into the lower tiered plan. And so I think we are seeing the benefits of lowering the point of entry so that customers can move into the integrated device, begin to try the data services. And we believe over time, based on how much data they use, they will then begin to migrate up to higher tiered plans. So all in all, I think it's been within our expectations. With respect to acquisitions, I would tell you that while we have looked at international opportunities particularly with respect to some emerging markets, when we look at those kinds of opportunities, we look at a number of factors including the cost, can we produce value to shareowners based on that investment, what the market structure is like and what partnership opportunities are available. And finding the right opportunity there is very difficult. So I believe the Chairman's comments in the article you were talking about really pointed to the fact that we haven't found opportunities there that we feel are the right fit for us. Generally, if we were to make an investment in most cases, we would want the ability to have substantial control over operations, although the one area that has been very successful for us, and that we're very pleased with, has been our relationship and our stake in América Móvil, which has been I think a good way for us to bring some emerging market exposure into our mix.

I was wondering, are there any more plans inside AT&T to focus on divesting those parts of the business that may include some of the rural wireline markets that increasingly look non-core to the AT&T game plan? And then the second part of that, I guess, is to follow up on Jason's question. The second part of what Randall was saying seemed to be this continuing theme about the industrial logic of a satellite acquisition.

And when there are opportunities at the right prices and the right terms to make some divestitures there, we will. But that's just part of the ongoing process of looking at the portfolio of assets that we have. The rural properties are interesting in terms of looking at those, because a couple of things that they do for us is -- our business is scale-related. And so when we look at those properties, they tend to produce pretty good cash flows, and the direct costs are relatively low related to many of those properties or they are shared across our total infrastructure. And so we continue to look at opportunities there to strengthen the position, to increase and improve our broadband capability, to utilize our relationships and commercial agreements with satellite to bring a full bundle of products into those territories. And we'll continue to look at what makes the most sense for those going forward, but there's nothing imminent with respect to those. And in terms of the discussion about satellite, and our businesses has gone on for many years. And there are always, again, are advantages of scale and the ability to leverage the size of customer bases to reduce content costs. But in all acquisitions and opportunities, you look at what are the financial characteristics and opportunities and can you create value. And obviously, as we've gone up to this point, we felt very good about the path we're on. And as you heard today, and as you see again in our results, you continue to see the growth in the U-verse platform. And the strength of that, frankly, is in its ability to provide voice, data and video, a full bundle of products all over a common infrastructure. And so we'll continue to push down that path. And you see the results. You see the improvement it's making in our consumer business and our consumer revenue trends. And so I think we're looking at all the right things. I think we're following the right path with respect to that consumer business.

What we do see is that, first of all, in the quarter, we did 400,000 to 500,000 iPad 3Gs over that two-month period that we're activated on the network. The majority of those, probably in the 75% to 80% range, come on at the higher data package. So originally, some signed up at the $30 package, and then as we introduce our tiered pricing, they're coming on at the $25 2 gig level. And overall ARPU so far, again, it's very early on -- in the same range as our prepaid base kind of upper 20s to $30 customers. And usage patterns are about that we've expected so far, which is above our typical iPhone customer but less than our typical LaptopConnect customers. So in all respects, I think the iPad numbers, metrics, ARPUs, volumes have been in the ranges that we expected. One thing that's been encouraging and a bit surprising so far is the level of interest from business customers. And when we first introduced the iPhone, the businesses and in particular, CIOs of our business customers, were reluctant. And they kind of push back on bringing the iPhone into their infrastructure. And over time, that's, as you know, has changed dramatically, and now we have businesses that are developing applications and putting their own applications and content down on the iPhone base within their companies. And so that's evolved. Well, right from the beginning with the iPad, we've had a number of our business customers expressed interest. A number of them had trials going on. They see a lot of opportunity to use the iPad within their business. And in fact, right before the call, Brooks and I were just talking. And she has downloaded -- as you go through earnings, we produce a lot of paper, obviously, with presentations and backup materials. She's got all of that downloaded now on her iPad. So I think we'll be doing much more of that going forward. And that's just an example where people see the opportunity, businesses see the opportunity, in many cases, to use the iPad potentially in place of laptops for many of their people that travel. So it'll be interesting to see how the product evolves. But so far, it's been very good.

CapEx, we're right on target and plan through the first half of the year to be in the $18 billion to $19 billion range that we guided to. As you know, we said at the beginning of the year, we expected Wireless CapEx to b",781,"Sure, Tim. First of all, in CapEx. CapEx, we're right on target and plan through the first half of the year to be in the $18 billion to $19 billion range that we guided to. As you know, we said at the beginning of the year, we expected Wireless CapEx to be up a couple billion dollars this year. If you look at first-half results, I think Wireless CapEx is up about $1 billion during the first half. And so, again, we're right on target with that. We're seeing in some areas may be a bit more demand than we had in the original plan, but not enough to change our guidance or total CapEx for the year. So I think everything this year is right on target. We're in the very early planning stages to update our plans for next year. But on a macro basis, what I would expect at this point as we look forward over the next few years is that overall, we'll continue to be in a similar range, kind of lower teens as a percent of revenues. But you will see some continued shift in our CapEx between Wireline and Wireless. Obviously, as we get to end of next year, we'll be ramping up our initial $30 million home build on U-verse, so that will further bring Wireline CapEx down a little bit. On the Wireless side, we'll be rolling out LTE. So you will continue to see a bit of a mix shift there. But overall CapEx, I would tell you, as a percent of revenues, in ranges pretty consistent with what you're currently seeing. In terms of earnings guidance, as you said, we've had two very strong quarters to start the year with double-digit earnings growth. As you know, it's a volatile environment out there, and we can't commit to you double-digit earnings growth every quarter. But the first half of the year has given us confidence and visibility into what we can do, both in terms of revenues and margins in the second half. And I think we'll continue to have the opportunity to post strong earnings growth in the second half of the year. We've got a couple of things that will be different from the first half. We will incur some costs as a part of the acquisition of the Alltel properties. And as you know, the majority of customers there, we acquired 1.6 million customers. The majority of those are postpaid, about 1.4 million, and the majority of those customers overall are CDMA customers. And so we want to, as quickly as possible, build out the GSM networks in those footprints and convert that base to GSM. And there's a cost associated with doing that, so you'll see some impact from that in the second half of the year. And as we talked about on one of the earlier questions, as we go into third quarter, we'll have a bit of an acceleration of some upgrades to the iPhone 4. But overall, as I mentioned in the presentation, versus where we were at the beginning of this year, better visibility into earnings growth and more confidence in earnings growth as we go through the second half of the year. 
Folks, if I can, I just like to offer a couple of closing comments. And first of all, I want to thank all of you for taking part in the call today. And I just like to emphasize first that, again, we delivered another strong quarter of financial results, with consolidated revenues up year-over-year and sequentially. Our margins were strong and growing with expansion across the business in Wireless and Wireline and consolidated, and this drove double-digit earnings growth for the second consecutive quarter. 
Secondly, we continued our momentum in Wireless, with double-digit service revenue growth and our sixth consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU growth. Also, delivered substantial year-over-year Wireless margin expansion even with a record quarter in terms of iPhone and integrated device activations. And third, we continue to execute well on the cost side, while efficiently managing the business. And this helped us deliver solid margins and strong free cash flow and put's us in a great position to continue delivering good results in the remainder of this year. 
And we have a fundamentally positive outlook for the business long term. And near term, feel good about the second half of the year. Our job now, as I've mentioned before, is to continue to execute and deliver those financial results for you. That's where our focus is. I want to thank you again for being on the call, and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T.

Welcome to our third quarter conference call. It's great to have you with us this morning. As John mentioned, this is Brooks McCorcle, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T, and joining me on the call today are Rick Lindner, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer; and Ralph de la Vega, AT&T's President and CEO for Mobility and Consumer markets.  Rick and Ralph will cover our results, then we'll follow with Q&A. 
Let me remind you that our release, our investor briefing, our supplementary information and the presentation slides that accompany this call are all available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. And as a reminder, that's www.att.com/investor.relations.
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3. And that says that information set forth in this presentation contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this presentation based on new information or otherwise.
This presentation may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are also available on our website.
Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me call your attention to Slide 4, which provides a financial summary. Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $2.08, which includes the $0.13 gain from the cash sale of Sterling Commerce during the quarter and another $1.40 gain from a previously disclosed tax settlement. Excluding these gains, EPS was $0.55. That's up about 4% versus EPS for the third quarter a year ago and up about 9% year-to-date versus the same period last year. That's our third consecutive quarter of EPS growth before significant items.
Consolidated revenues were $31.6 billion, up both year-over-year and sequentially. And that was led by strong growth in mobile broadband U-verse services and advanced business offerings. Even with record integrated device sales, our consolidated operating margin was essentially flat from the prior year, reflecting operational improvements in network and support functions and solid execution on cost initiatives.
And free cash flow continues to be strong, $4 billion in the quarter and $11.6 billion year-to-date. With that, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?"

Before we get into the highlights on Slide 5, let me first just say we're very pleased with what we accomplished in the third quarter.

Before we get into the highlights on Slide 5, let me first just say we're very pleased with what we accomplished in the third quarter. First off, we are excited about the trends that we're seeing with revenue growth. Not only did we have a solid consolidated revenue growth quarter that was fueled by double-digit Wireless revenue growth, but we also saw Wireline consumer revenues grow for the first time in more than two years. Second, we continue to see the benefits of our mobile broadband strategy. We had just an incredible Wireless quarter across most every metric.
New customers are choosing AT&T and existing customers are renewing their contracts in record numbers. And I think that speaks volumes about both the strength of our network and the ever-widening selection of devices that we carry. Ralph will give you more details in a moment, but we are very pleased with the improvement that we're seeing in revenue trends.
We also continue to see improving revenue trends in our business markets, and I'll speak to those in just a few minutes. But from my perspective, the thing I'm most encouraged by is that even with pressure on margins from integrated device sales, we delivered good, consolidated margins with earnings growth and continued free cash flow. And I think that puts us in great position to have a solid year in 2010 with good momentum going forward.
With that overview, let's take a look at revenues on Slide 6. Consolidated revenue totaled $31.6 billion. That's up nearly $850 million versus third quarter a year ago, and that growth is due to strong Wireless growth to solid U-verse gains and to improved business trends. Our overall revenue mix continued its transformation in the third quarter, with 73% of revenues coming from Wireless, Wireline Data and Managed Services. That's up from 68% a year ago and 62% two years ago. Combined, the revenues from these sources were up nearly 10% in the third quarter, and we expect this shift to continue, and it's one of the reasons we have a positive long-term view of the business going forward, as growth of Wireless and Data outstrips declines of legacy services.
At this point, let me turn it now to Ralph de la Vega, who, as you know, runs our Wireless and Consumer business for an update on those areas. Ralph?"

It's good to have this opportunity to talk with you again. As Rick said, we have a tremendous Wireless growth quarter, everything we could hope for and more. Now what you keep hearing again and again is record.",1838,"Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. It's good to have this opportunity to talk with you again. As Rick said, we have a tremendous Wireless growth quarter, everything we could hope for and more. Now what you keep hearing again and again is record. As you can see on Slide 7, record sales of integrated devices, record gross adds, record customer upgrades, record third quarter net adds of 2.6 million, record Wireless Data sales. We also had the best ever third quarter total churn, our seventh consecutive quarter of growth in postpaid ARPU, and we added 1.2 million connected devices in the third quarter, setting the pace for the industry.
These were simply the best Wireless volumes we've had in any third quarter in our history, off the charts. But you know what, we believe that we're just scratching the surface here, especially when you consider three areas where the potential is huge. First, we still see a lot of growth opportunity with integrated devices. About 57% of our postpaid base have these devices, but our sales rate is more than 80%.
Second, we believe emerging Wireless devices are just beginning to take off. And third, the business phase is just beginning to fully integrate mobile data in their operation, lots of opportunity there. So we're very pleased with our third quarter results and even more excited about the opportunity that lies ahead.
With that overview, let me drill down and cover Wireless results, starting with revenue and subscriber trends on Slide 8. Our results this quarter showed the strength of our focus on data and ARPU growth. In the third quarter, we accelerated both revenue growth and subscriber growth. Total Wireless revenues were up $1.6 billion or 11.4%, and Wireless service revenues grew 10.5%, up more than $1.3 billion versus the third quarter a year ago.
Mobile broadband and strong data adoption drove our seventh consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU gain, a record unmatched by our peers, up by 2.0%, which includes about 40 basis points of pressure from properties acquired from Verizon Wireless. For the third straight quarter, we set a new record in terms of total net adds. Strongest first quarter ever was followed by our strongest second quarter ever and our strongest third quarter ever, with 2.6 million net adds. Postpaid net adds were about 750,000, up 50% sequentially. Prepaid net adds totaled more than 320,000, with continued strong sales of the iPad 3G. Customer response has been very strong since the iPad 3G was first introduced in late April, and we expect that momentum to continue as we go through the fourth quarter.
We also added 1.2 million connected devices to our network in the third quarter. This is terrific business for us, lower ARPUs, but higher margins and low churn, and we're still in the starting blocks with this terrific opportunity. These results clearly demonstrate the benefits of our mobile broadband strategy.
When you look at our net adds, our ARPU gains and churn improvement is clear that our subscriber metrics have never been better, and they continue to go in the right direction. One of the key drivers behind our Wireless growth is our integrated device strategy. The details are on Slide 9. The rapid adoption of powerful integrated devices has revolutionized our industry, and customer response continues to be incredible. In the third quarter, more than 80% of postpaid sales were integrated devices. In the third quarter, we had our largest integrated device quarter ever, signing up more than 8 million subscribers, including both upgrades and net adds. We added 3.8 million 3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, up more than 14 million in the past 12 months, and ARPU for integrative devices continues to be 1.7x our other devices.
And these subscribers tend to be very sticky for us. Approximately 80% of these subscribers are on family or business-related plans with churn levels well below our average. These results also reflect another record quarter for iPhone activations. More than 5 million were activated during the quarter. That's more than 60% higher than our previous records, and sales continue to be strong.
As a result, data revenues also continued to be strong. We grew Wireless data revenues by more than 30%, up more than $1.1 billion year-over-year. This was also our first full quarter of our new pricing for Wireless data, and the initial results have been very positive. We're also seeing more customers being drawn to upgrade to integrated devices, adding data plans at the lower price point and then they can migrate up after data needs grow.
Our network today supports more integrated devices than any of our competitors and more data traffic than any of our competitors, and we lead in connected devices. Slide 10 shows how we built this leadership position. We have the best portfolio of integrated devices in the industry, using all major operating systems. That includes Android, RIM, Apple OS, webOS, Symbian. And last week, we announced the addition of three new devices using Windows Phone 7, our portfolio keeps getting better. Three new Motorola Android devices are scheduled for the fourth quarter, giving us seven great Android devices for our company. Plus the BlackBerry Torch, which is exclusive to AT&T, continues to do well, and we just announced that we're launching the Motorola ES400, which is a rugged device for the Enterprise space. In addition to these handsets, we're launching HSPA+ and LTE data cards like the Shockwave from Sierra Wireless and the Adrenaline from LG. The Shockwave will allow our customers to connect to our HSPA+ network, and the Adrenaline is our first LTE upgradable device. We also offer some great emerging devices including the iPad, which begins selling in our stores next week.
Our formula is great devices plus a great mobile broadband network, and we're in terrific spot for both fronts. We have a terrific technology pack for customers. Our strategy to continuously upgrade network speed place with the strength of GSM technology and provides the most elegant path to LTE with backwards compatibility at every step. Slide 11 has more details on our network path.
Let me say that we're really excited about our network road map. We have the nation's fastest mobile broadband network today, and the best transition plan in the market. Because of the technology choices we have made, we will have a significant advantage for the next couple of years at least, and customers are starting to get it. This year alone, we already spent almost $6 billion or almost half of our capital expenditures so far this year on Wireless-related investments. 
Now here's the progress we're seeing from those investments. Earlier this year, we completed the HSPA 7.2 software upgrade, making the nation's fastest mobile broadband network even faster. Now we're in the process of deploying HSPA+ to our networks. This will again allow us to increase our network speeds, and we expect the software upgrade to be completed by the end of this year.
And all the while we're making progress with our backhaul upgrades, executing a very aggressive investment and deployment program. This backhaul expansion is critical today and is the foundation for LTE. The same work has to be done to handle the massive growth in mobile broadband. What all this means for our customers is a great experience leading into LTE. We will not have the fall back issues that CDMA customers will have as they move from 4G back to CDMA Rev A speeds. Our LTE trials are currently underway in Dallas and Baltimore, with an expected launch in mid-2011 to reach 70 million to 75 million POPs by the end of next year. Customers who are excited about 4G and over the next couple of years, they will expect the smooth, fast ride to 4G, and that's what we plan to deliver. We believe this gives us a great position to continue to capture growth in mobile broadband.
Now I'd like to discuss how these network initiatives, along with subscriber and revenue growth, is impacting our Wireless margins and operating income, and those details are on Slide 12. Obviously, the record quarter for integrated device sales, which includes about 2 million incremental iPhone activations, had an impact on our Wireless service margins. Absent the costs associated with these additional activations, service more just would have been similar to last quarter. But it is important to keep in mind the long-term benefits these customers bring including lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth.
In the third quarter, our Wireless OIBDA service margin was 37.6%, down from the year-earlier quarter. We believe the impact of margins will be temporary, and our expectations for total year Wireless OIBDA service margins continue to be in the low 40% range. Looking at Wireless operating income, you can see the trends that I am talking about. While the third quarter operating income was relatively flat year-over-year, year-to-date Wireless operating income is up 15% year-over-year to reach $11.8 billion.
Now let me turn and cover consumer Wireline results, starting with the U-verse update. Slide 13 has the information. We had another solid net add quarter in U-verse TV subscribers, helping drive the first year-over-year growth in consumer revenue in more than two years. We had an increase of 236,000 U-verse TV subscribers, bringing our total to 2.7 million, up more than 900,000 over the past year. Broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remain very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have a triple- or quad-play bundle with us, and we had a very nice rebound in our total broadband adds, up about 150,000 for the quarter. This has led to improved consumer ARPUs and revenue trends. 
In the third quarter, Wireline IP revenue, and that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew 30%. These revenues now represent more than 42% of total Wireline Consumer revenues, up almost 1,000 basis points over just a fast year. ARPU for U-verse triple-play customers was about $160 in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year.
The U-verse TV experience continues to receive positive customer feedback. The latest J.D. Power study ranked us the highest in every region where we were ranked. We continue to add new features that take advantage of U-verse's IP TV platform. For example, we are the first U.S. TV provider to allow customers to use their Xbox 360 as a TV receiver. This replaces a need for an extra receiver and allows customers to receive chats and game invitations while watching live TV and switch seamlessly from game to TV mode.
And the U-verse Mobile app allows customers to download and watch hit TV shows and much more. It's available on four operating systems, including Android and the new Windows Phone 7. Innovations such as this has helped U-verse transform our Consumer business. We're confident this transformation and the positive impact it has on revenues will continue. Rick, that covers Wireless and Consumer, and I'll turn it back to you."
100231,113613692,80756,"AT&T, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","AT&T Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ralph.

Before we close, let me provide a quick update on business customer trends on Slide 14. The fundamental trends underlying our business are consistent with what you've seen in earlier quarters this year. We're seeing continued signs of stabilization as we work our way through the economic downturn. But I think what is encouraging to us is the trends of our business customers in investing in productivity and efficiency, which helps drive growth in our strategic business products.
Revenues from these products such as Ethernet, Virtual Private Networks and application services were up again this quarter, more than 15%. And business IP revenues, overall, were up 8%. As you know, during this downturn, we've executed a clear and consistent strategy in business markets. First, we've invested right through the downturn, adding capacity reach and new capabilities. Second, we've won new business with a number of customer wins that played to both our global and mobility strengths. And third, as we work to make operations and service more seamless for customers, that's given us opportunities to improve our cost structure and grow margins through this downturn. Because of all of this, we are well positioned as the economy improves over time.
Now let's take a look at margins and cash flow, starting with consolidated margin comparisons on Slide 15. For the third quarter, consolidated operating margins were relatively stable at 17.3%, and that's despite Wireless margin pressure from integrated device sales. This reflects solid performance across the company. Our Wireline operating income margin was 12% in the third quarter. That's up from 11.2% in third quarter last year. This reflects improving revenue trends and solid execution on cost initiatives. Across the business, our total force since the end of 2009 is down by more than 15,000.
Company-wide, we have a commitment to operate as one AT&T, and that means delivering a single, seamless experience to customers for all of our Wireless and Wireline products. And as we consolidate and integrate operations, we have continuing opportunities for cost efficiencies. These initiatives are going well, and they've helped us sustain solid margins while also improving customer service.
Along with solid margins, we continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash flow summary is on Slide 16. In the first three quarters of this year, cash from operations totaled $25.4 billion. Our capital expenditures were $13.7 billion, and that includes a 55% year-over-year increase in Wireless-related capital.
We continue to expect full year capital investment of $18 billion to $19 billion, although we're trending toward the upper end of that range. Free cash flow before dividends was $11.6 billion, and dividend payments totaled $7.4 billion.
Over the last six quarters, we have generated free cash flow in excess of dividends of more than $9 billion. In terms of uses of cash, debt is down almost $4 billion over the past 12 months. That gives us a debt-to-capital ratio of 37.8% and net debt to EBITDA of 1.5%. And all of this gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business and return substantial value to shareowners.
Let me close by recapping a few items on Slide 17. Again, first, we had a terrific Wireless quarter, breaking about every sales record that we track. And in addition, Ralph's team delivered continued growth in postpaid ARPU and lower churn.
We are also very pleased with our Wireline Consumer business, which achieved positive growth this quarter thanks to U-verse and the transformation those services are making in the business. Combined with continued solid cost management, this helped us deliver very strong financial results, with solid revenue and earnings growth and stable year-over-year consolidated margins, even with record Wireless device sales. Put this together with the results from the first half of the year, and you're seeing the makings of a very good 2010. Year-to-date, we're growing revenue. We're expanding margins. We're increasing earnings, and cash flow remained strong, giving us the ability to continue to invest in the business and return value to shareholders.
Brooks, I think we should stop there, and we're ready to take some questions."

In Wireless, it would make sense, I think, given the fourth quarter seasonality we normally see on that. You could maybe see some additional pressure on there, especially if the upgrades stay high, if you could comment on that? And then on Wireline, some of the growth metrics were better than we thought, and despite that, you still had better-than-expected margins I was wondering if that trend can continue as well?"

The amount of incr",574,"Yes, let's talk a little bit about margin trends. First off, as Ralph mentioned in his remarks, we would expect at this point margins in Wireless to rebound and be stronger in the fourth quarter versus the 37.6% we had in third quarter. The amount of increase there and improvement is a little difficult to project at this point. It's going to be based on the volume of integrated device sales, particularly as we go through the holiday season. But even with that, I would expect margins to be a bit stronger in Wireless. One other thing that is impacting or will impact Wireless margins in the fourth quarter and probably for the next two or three quarters is the transition and conversion of the customer base that we acquired from the former Alltel properties. As we're now getting to the point where we're going to begin aggressively moving that customer base from their current network to new GSM networks to new billing systems. And in the course of doing that, we're going to have to provide that base with new devices, and there'll be subsidies involved in that. And we talked about all of that as part of the acquisition when we first announced it. But I just wanted to remind you, we're now, as we move into the fourth quarter, we're going to be getting into that period where we'll be going through that activity. But even with those, I would expect some improvement in Wireless margins. On the Wireline side, as you mentioned, John, we've had very good results in Wireline margins, and that business is going through a massive transformation as it moves increasingly from voice and legacy Data Services to U-verse to IP-based Data Services and to Managed Services. We've managed that transition, I think, very well. It's an ongoing effort here, believe me, in terms of finding ways to be more efficient in the business. And the one AT&T initiatives that I mentioned in my remarks have been a major contributor to that, and it really does involve almost an internal merger and integration of organizations, processes, systems that support Wireless and Wireline, and we have to move in that direction in order to be able to interface with customers and provide single points of contact, and that's really the way customers want to deal with us across both our Wireless and Wireline products. But at the same time, it's contributed to our ability to take a lot of costs out of the business. As we go into the fourth quarter, I would expect there to be the normal seasonal pressure that we have on Wireline margins, and you've seen that typically every year. It's a function of two or three things. One, being the fourth quarter typically has fewer business days, which affect things like long-distance revenues, for example. So it impacts both revenues and margins. We also typically have a bit higher overtime rates in the fourth quarter due to holidays and due to some of the typical seasonal weather patterns we get in some of our regions. But beyond that, we'll continue to focus on margins on the Wireline side. When you step back from all of that, our expectation is still to be for, in total, for the year, as we guided, in the low 40s in EBITDA margins for Wireless and in the lower 30s in the EBITDA margins for the Wireline business."

Let me try to size up the postpaid ARPU question for you. I mentioned in my comments that the Alltel acquisition impacted us by 40 basis points as the customers that we acquired with those properties had lower average postpaid ARPUs than those of AT&T's, so that accounts for 40 basis points. There's another 70-plus basis points that are accounted for as a result of lower regulatory fees, including the universal service fund fees and the regulatory cost recovery fees. If you put those two things together, that accounts for almost more than 100 basis points of difference. If you add that to the 2% growth that we reflected in this quarter, then it's pretty much in line with what we have been reporting for the last several quarters, somewhere north of 2% to 3% ARPU growth, and we expect that as we continue to sell more integrated devices, our base has the capability to continue to get on higher ARPUs in the coming quarters ahead."

We had another good cash flow quarter in the third quarter. And in fact, one of the things we've been very pleased with is over the last two years, as we've gone through a very difficult time, the company's continued to reduce strong cash flow, and that's given us the flexibility to continue to invest in areas where we see opportunities for growth, including doing a couple of Wireless acquisitions that we've closed in the last year. And it's also given us good, solid support for our dividend and growing the dividend, and it's allowed us to pay down debt and strengthen the balance sheet. We are sitting right now, similar to where we were last quarter about this time at kind of the upper end of our target credit metric ranges. And part of the reason we continue to stay at that kind of same range over the last quarter is because we have been absorbing the acquisition of the Alltel properties. As we go forward, as cash flow permits, I think we're going to and as we migrate solidly into our target ranges, I think then that gives us flexibility in addition to continuing to invest in the business and support the dividend, to look at some other alternatives like share repurchase. In terms of the ratings activities, we have essentially not changed our, for many, many years, our desire and commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. And I can tell you in the last six years, we have not changed essentially the credit metrics that we target to support a strong balance sheet. But each of the rating agencies look at the numbers and the results and have their own proprietary calculations and their own targets, and it's different for each one. And so we will continue to be very consistent in the metrics that we target in some cases. For example, I think the rating activity you're talking about is S&P moving us to a credit watch position. If you look at their press release when they did that two or three months ago and look at the numbers they put in that release, we would have to delever substantially to the tune of as much as $15 billion in order to hit the ranges they were targeting. And I think that's beyond the level that we are targeting in our credit metrics. So we continue to be very consistent in how we're applying that. I think that's the right way to manage the business, given the capital intensive nature of the business, the size of our business, the size of the debt portfolio. I think it's prudent, and we will continue to be consistent with that as we move firmly into our target credit metrics as I've said. That and the cash flow gives us a lot of flexibility to continue to invest where there's opportunities, to continue to support the dividend and to consider other alternatives like share repurchase."

So that will be my viewpoint on that. In terms of the value of customers that are signing up for either iPhones or integrated devices, those are the highest APV value customers that we have. So we like to see them sign up in record numbers like we did this past quarter. 8 million in total in terms of integrated devices.

So it will be interesting to see what customers eventually opt for. But I think the technology and the capability with these operating systems are that they can be such that they can adapt to all sort of lower-priced SKUs and the question is, will that be something that customers buy? We all always have the view that we should give the customers the choice, and that we have a wide range of devices with different price points.

You did see this year a shift in our -- while the overall capital levels haven't changed dramatically, you have seen a shift between Wireline and Wireless. I think as we go into the next year or two, I think you'll continue to see some shifts there. And that's a very natural transition. It's following the shifts in the business. Wireless is nearly 50% of our revenues today. And in addition, as we look forward over the next year, we've got commercial deployment of LTE on the Wireless side.

It's all now about innovation. I've never seen innovation cycles come quicker. And so I think we're going to have the opportunity to do is to offer customers an incredible choice of applications and services based on this innovative capabilities. But if you look at Android, it has some very good and fast innovation cycles. So does Apple. Microsoft just came out, and they've already announced they're going to upgrade some things in that infrastructure and operating system in early next year. So I think it will be a race of innovation to see who can develop the most innovative products and services. And the thing that I liked about our position is we believe we believe in having a wide choice of OSs, having every single major one. So that if there's any innovation that is important to our customer base, they know that they can come to AT&T, and we'll be able to have it for them. And that's been our view.

If you have a slower network, I don't think you're going to get utility out of the processing power and the memory capabilities and the video that these devices are capable of delivering. So I think our HSPA+ piece will take a one additional level and give you a fantastic experience when you have one of these processors that now have one gigahertz as a basic core processor. But what we see in the horizon is actually dual core processors, two processors as fast as one gigahertz each. So you can imagine that those devices, unless you have a really fast network, are not going to be able to deliver the best experience to our customers. So that's why I like our positioning so much that we'll have HSPA+ delivered by the end of the year. We're going to have the capability to begin the backhaul upgrades and to provide the services on a geographic basis as soon as the backhaul is complete, and when you get one of these devices with one gigahertz processor, maybe even dual processors, they're going to absolutely hum. They're just going to be awesome. And so I think those are the trends that I see in the marketplace, and we're very excited because I think it plays to our strengths."

One on handsets and devices, Ralph's exactly right, and we're seeing an unprecedented level of innovation. And it is just fun in this business, frankly, to see the innovation, the new devices, the new features that are coming out literally every quarter. But I want to make sure while it's fun to talk about all the different devices of handsets, I want to make sure that we don't lose sight of the real story here from our perspective. And the real story here is this quarter, with as large of a postpaid base as we have, well over 80% of the devices we sold into that postpaid base, both upgrades and new gross adds, were integrated devices. That's astounding, and it's huge compared to even where we were just a year ago. And I think what that speaks to is the combination of the features in these devices along with the network speeds that Ralph talked about has really facilitated a value proposition for customers and has turned the mobile phone into a mobile computing device. And increasingly, customers want to be able to access applications, access the Internet and receive content via their mobile devices. That is really the real story here. And it leaves us into a Mobile Broadband business for us that's approaching a $20 billion a year business, and a business that's growing at 25% to 30%. That's underlying it. That's the real story, and I think the opportunity for us and why we're excited about this space. And why, frankly, we continue to push integrated devices, we continue to push Data Services into our postpaid base. The other thing that I want to comment on really relates to the overall customer experience in our network as we migrate up first, as we migrated up to HSPA 7.2 and then to HSPA+ and then to LTE. I think we've got the opportunity over the next few years to offer a superior experience on these devices because to facilitate the kind of Data Services and applications and devices that we're going to have and everyone's going to have on the network and that customers want, it's going to require mobile broadband speed. And as a result, you see all the carriers rolling out 4G networks, whether they be LTE or whether they'd be WiMAX or other technologies. But everyone is working to increase speeds. The advantage that we'll have is not just in terms of the speeds available on these new 4G networks. But initially, these 4G networks are going to cover a relatively small piece of geography. And in our network, as customers move off of that geography, they're going to have a great experience in LTE as they move off of that geography. They're going to have a very, very good experience in HSPA+ across our network. And that will be an advantage versus other carriers where you will see a significant decrease in speeds when you're out of their 4G footprint."

One is you mentioned that on the Enterprise side, 70% of the customers have converted already to IP. And can you help us think about if you look at the global Enterprise revenue change whether you look at year-over-year or sequentially, how much of that can be attributed to this conversion process of moving to lower-cost IP services versus how to think about the business organically in terms of the demand for traffic in a more normal pricing environment once you get through conversion? The second part of the question was more of a strategic question. As Wireless continues to evolve and start to take share of the broadband market more substantially, in your view, does it still makes sense for Wireless and Wireline to be part of the same company? Or are there advantages over time in thinking about what Wireless can do to compete more effectively against what is the traditional Wireline business?"

Let me take a shot at those and invite Ralph to comment as well. First of all, I think when you look at our business sales and revenues and look at the various business revenue streams there, again, that's a business going",630,"Those are great questions, Mike. Let me take a shot at those and invite Ralph to comment as well. First of all, I think when you look at our business sales and revenues and look at the various business revenue streams there, again, that's a business going through a transition. We've actually crossed the line this quarter where traditional voice revenues as part of our business revenues are down below 40% of business revenues. Increasingly, it's becoming a business driven by data, by IP-based services, Managed Services and increasingly as we go forward, as companies move more of their applications and their content into the cloud, hosting cloud computing becomes more important, as well as facilitating applications through mobile devices. And I think we're well positioned in all areas of the business where there are growth opportunities. And that's why you see strategic business service revenues continuing to grow quarter after quarter at mid-teens rates. It's why you've seen in the last several quarters IP-based data revenues increasing on the business side, getting into the upper single digit rates of growth. We're also seeing impacts in other areas, still a lot of demand for bandwidth and transport. Now the revenue streams there have been flatter more recently, but that's more a function of companies increasing their bandwidth, but at the same time, grooming their networks and moving to higher speed services. And so we're seeing both on a retail and a wholesale environment, significant demand for Ethernet in backhaul. Again, all of those areas were positioned very well. The one area that has been a drag in the business somewhat has been voice volumes, and I think we will see some improvements there. But as we require some improvement in the economy in employment and as well as on the small end of the business, in new business formations. As we see that and as the business becomes increasingly driven by IP-based services that are on a good growth trajectory, I think that, that's what gives us comfort that the overall revenues on the business side will continue to improve. And as we've talked about, we think longer term this is a GDP, GDP-plus type of growth sector for us. You asked a very good question about the importance of or the need or desire to have both Wireless and Wireline assets, given this environment. And I guess what I would say, Michael, is I think more than ever before, we think there are advantages and strengths in having a combination of Wireless and Wireline assets because that's what is required to provide the kinds of service experience that customers want. And essentially, whether you're a business customer or a consumer customer, you want the convenience of mobility and mobile access to networks and to data applications and content. And you want that over a variety of devices. That's why you see the proliferation of devices on the network from all of the connected devices that Ralph's team is selling to notebook computers to tablet computing. That's the way people want to access the network. But in order to provide the bandwidth and to provide the capacity and to provide the kind of service experience you want, you've got to drive that traffic as quickly as possible into a wired infrastructure, which improves service quality and provides significantly more bandwidth. That's why, for example, in our case, that's why we believe having the Wi-Fi infrastructure and hotspots that we have across the country and around the world are so important. So in our view, we believe to provide the kinds of services that consumers and businesses demand in the future, having both Wireless and Wireline capabilities and having an integrated carrier model is the best way to provide those services."

Let me remind you that our release, our investor briefing, our supplementary information and the presentation slides that accompany this call are all available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. And as a reminder, that's www.att.com/investor.relations.
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on Slide 3. And that says that information set forth in this presentation contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this presentation based on new information or otherwise.
This presentation may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are also available on our website.
Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me call your attention to Slide 4, which provides a financial summary. Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $2.08, which includes the $0.13 gain from the cash sale of Sterling Commerce during the quarter and another $1.40 gain from a previously disclosed tax settlement. Excluding these gains, EPS was $0.55. That's up about 4% versus EPS for the third quarter a year ago and up about 9% year-to-date versus the same period last year. That's our third consecutive quarter of EPS growth before significant items.
Consolidated revenues were $31.6 billion, up both year-over-year and sequentially. And that was led by strong growth in mobile broadband U-verse services and advanced business offerings. Even with record integrated device sales, our consolidated operating margin was essentially flat from the prior year, reflecting operational improvements in network and support functions and solid execution on cost initiatives.
And free cash flow continues to be strong, $4 billion in the quarter and $11.6 billion year-to-date. With that, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?

Before we get into the highlights on Slide 5, let me first just say we're very pleased with what we accomplished in the third quarter. First off, we are excited about the trends that we're seeing with revenue growth. Not only did we have a solid consolidated revenue growth quarter that was fueled by double-digit Wireless revenue growth, but we also saw Wireline consumer revenues grow for the first time in more than two years. Second, we continue to see the benefits of our mobile broadband strategy. We had just an incredible Wireless quarter across most every metric.
New customers are choosing AT&T and existing customers are renewing their contracts in record numbers. And I think that speaks volumes about both the strength of our network and the ever-widening selection of devices that we carry. Ralph will give you more details in a moment, but we are very pleased with the improvement that we're seeing in revenue trends.
We also continue to see improving revenue trends in our business markets, and I'll speak to those in just a few minutes. But from my perspective, the thing I'm most encouraged by is that even with pressure on margins from integrated device sales, we delivered good, consolidated margins with earnings growth and continued free cash flow. And I think that puts us in great position to have a solid year in 2010 with good momentum going forward.
With that overview, let's take a look at revenues on Slide 6. Consolidated revenue totaled $31.6 billion. That's up nearly $850 million versus third quarter a year ago, and that growth is due to strong Wireless growth to solid U-verse gains and to improved business trends. Our overall revenue mix continued its transformation in the third quarter, with 73% of revenues coming from Wireless, Wireline Data and Managed Services. That's up from 68% a year ago and 62% two years ago. Combined, the revenues from these sources were up nearly 10% in the third quarter, and we expect this shift to continue, and it's one of the reasons we have a positive long-term view of the business going forward, as growth of Wireless and Data outstrips declines of legacy services.
At this point, let me turn it now to Ralph de la Vega, who, as you know, runs our Wireless and Consumer business for an update on those areas. Ralph?

As Rick said, we have a tremendous Wireless growth quarter, everything we could hope for and more. Now what you keep hearing again and again is record. As you can see on Slide 7, record sales of integrated devices, record gross adds, record customer upgrades, record third quarter net adds of 2.6 million, record Wireless Data sales. We also had the best ever third quarter total churn, our seventh consecutive quarter of growth in postpaid ARPU, and we added 1.2 million connected devices in the third quarter, setting the pace for the industry.
These were simply the best Wireless volumes we've had in any third quarter in our history, off the charts. But you know what, we believe that we're just scratching the surface here, especially when you consider three areas where the potential is huge. First, we still see a lot of growth opportunity with integrated devices. About 57% of our postpaid base have these devices, but our sales rate is more than 80%.
Second, we believe emerging Wireless devices are just beginning to take off. And third, the business phase is just beginning to fully integrate mobile data in their operation, lots of opportunity there. So we're very pleased with our third quarter results and even more excited about the opportunity that lies ahead.
With that overview, let me drill down and cover Wireless results, starting with revenue and subscriber trends on Slide 8. Our results this quarter showed the strength of our focus on data and ARPU growth. In the third quarter, we accelerated both revenue growth and subscriber growth. Total Wireless revenues were up $1.6 billion or 11.4%, and Wireless service revenues grew 10.5%, up more than $1.3 billion versus the third quarter a year ago.
Mobile broadband and strong data adoption drove our seventh consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU gain, a record unmatched by our peers, up by 2.0%, which includes about 40 basis points of pressure from properties acquired from Verizon Wireless. For the third straight quarter, we set a new record in terms of total net adds. Strongest first quarter ever was followed by our strongest second quarter ever and our strongest third quarter ever, with 2.6 million net adds. Postpaid net adds were about 750,000, up 50% sequentially. Prepaid net adds totaled more than 320,000, with continued strong sales of the iPad 3G. Customer response has been very strong since the iPad 3G was first introduced in late April, and we expect that momentum to continue as we go through the fourth quarter.
We also added 1.2 million connected devices to our network in the third quarter. This is terrific business for us, lower ARPUs, but higher margins and low churn, and we're still in the starting blocks with this terrific opportunity. These results clearly demonstrate the benefits of our mobile broadband strategy.
When you look at our net adds, our ARPU gains and churn improvement is clear that our subscriber metrics have never been better, and they continue to go in the right direction. One of the key drivers behind our Wireless growth is our integrated device strategy. The details are on Slide 9. The rapid adoption of powerful integrated devices has revolutionized our industry, and customer response continues to be incredible. In the third quarter, more than 80% of postpaid sales were integrated devices. In the third quarter, we had our largest integrated device quarter ever, signing up more than 8 million subscribers, including both upgrades and net adds. We added 3.8 million 3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, up more than 14 million in the past 12 months, and ARPU for integrative devices continues to be 1.7x our other devices.
And these subscribers tend to be very sticky for us. Approximately 80% of these subscribers are on family or business-related plans with churn levels well below our average. These results also reflect another record quarter for iPhone activations. More than 5 million were activated during the quarter. That's more than 60% higher than our previous records, and sales continue to be strong.
As a result, data revenues also continued to be strong. We grew Wireless data revenues by more than 30%, up more than $1.1 billion year-over-year. This was also our first full quarter of our new pricing for Wireless data, and the initial results have been very positive. We're also seeing more customers being drawn to upgrade to integrated devices, adding data plans at the lower price point and then they can migrate up after data needs grow.
Our network today supports more integrated devices than any of our competitors and more data traffic than any of our competitors, and we lead in connected devices. Slide 10 shows how we built this leadership position. We have the best portfolio of integrated devices in the industry, using all major operating systems. That includes Android, RIM, Apple OS, webOS, Symbian. And last week, we announced the addition of three new devices using Windows Phone 7, our portfolio keeps getting better. Three new Motorola Android devices are scheduled for the fourth quarter, giving us seven great Android devices for our company. Plus the BlackBerry Torch, which is exclusive to AT&T, continues to do well, and we just announced that we're launching the Motorola ES400, which is a rugged device for the Enterprise space. In addition to these handsets, we're launching HSPA+ and LTE data cards like the Shockwave from Sierra Wireless and the Adrenaline from LG. The Shockwave will allow our customers to connect to our HSPA+ network, and the Adrenaline is our first LTE upgradable device. We also offer some great emerging devices including the iPad, which begins selling in our stores next week.
Our formula is great devices plus a great mobile broadband network, and we're in terrific spot for both fronts. We have a terrific technology pack for customers. Our strategy to continuously upgrade network speed place with the strength of GSM technology and provides the most elegant path to LTE with backwards compatibility at every step. Slide 11 has more details on our network path.
Let me say that we're really excited about our network road map. We have the nation's fastest mobile broadband network today, and the best transition plan in the market. Because of the technology choices we have made, we will have a significant advantage for the next couple of years at least, and customers are starting to get it. This year alone, we already spent almost $6 billion or almost half of our capital expenditures so far this year on Wireless-related investments. 
Now here's the progress we're seeing from those investments. Earlier this year, we completed the HSPA 7.2 software upgrade, making the nation's fastest mobile broadband network even faster. Now we're in the process of deploying HSPA+ to our networks. This will again allow us to increase our network speeds, and we expect the software upgrade to be completed by the end of this year.
And all the while we're making progress with our backhaul upgrades, executing a very aggressive investment and deployment program. This backhaul expansion is critical today and is the foundation for LTE. The same work has to be done to handle the massive growth in mobile broadband. What all this means for our customers is a great experience leading into LTE. We will not have the fall back issues that CDMA customers will have as they move from 4G back to CDMA Rev A speeds. Our LTE trials are currently underway in Dallas and Baltimore, with an expected launch in mid-2011 to reach 70 million to 75 million POPs by the end of next year. Customers who are excited about 4G and over the next couple of years, they will expect the smooth, fast ride to 4G, and that's what we plan to deliver. We believe this gives us a great position to continue to capture growth in mobile broadband.
Now I'd like to discuss how these network initiatives, along with subscriber and revenue growth, is impacting our Wireless margins and operating income, and those details are on Slide 12. Obviously, the record quarter for integrated device sales, which includes about 2 million incremental iPhone activations, had an impact on our Wireless service margins. Absent the costs associated with these additional activations, service more just would have been similar to last quarter. But it is important to keep in mind the long-term benefits these customers bring including lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth.
In the third quarter, our Wireless OIBDA service margin was 37.6%, down from the year-earlier quarter. We believe the impact of margins will be temporary, and our expectations for total year Wireless OIBDA service margins continue to be in the low 40% range. Looking at Wireless operating income, you can see the trends that I am talking about. While the third quarter operating income was relatively flat year-over-year, year-to-date Wireless operating income is up 15% year-over-year to reach $11.8 billion.
Now let me turn and cover consumer Wireline results, starting with the U-verse update. Slide 13 has the information. We had another solid net add quarter in U-verse TV subscribers, helping drive the first year-over-year growth in consumer revenue in more than two years. We had an increase of 236,000 U-verse TV subscribers, bringing our total to 2.7 million, up more than 900,000 over the past year. Broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remain very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have a triple- or quad-play bundle with us, and we had a very nice rebound in our total broadband adds, up about 150,000 for the quarter. This has led to improved consumer ARPUs and revenue trends. 
In the third quarter, Wireline IP revenue, and that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew 30%. These revenues now represent more than 42% of total Wireline Consumer revenues, up almost 1,000 basis points over just a fast year. ARPU for U-verse triple-play customers was about $160 in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year.
The U-verse TV experience continues to receive positive customer feedback. The latest J.D. Power study ranked us the highest in every region where we were ranked. We continue to add new features that take advantage of U-verse's IP TV platform. For example, we are the first U.S. TV provider to allow customers to use their Xbox 360 as a TV receiver. This replaces a need for an extra receiver and allows customers to receive chats and game invitations while watching live TV and switch seamlessly from game to TV mode.
And the U-verse Mobile app allows customers to download and watch hit TV shows and much more. It's available on four operating systems, including Android and the new Windows Phone 7. Innovations such as this has helped U-verse transform our Consumer business. We're confident this transformation and the positive impact it has on revenues will continue. Rick, that covers Wireless and Consumer, and I'll turn it back to you.

Before we close, let me provide a quick update on business customer trends on Slide 14. The fundamental trends underlying our business are consistent with what you've seen in earlier quarters this year. We're seeing continued signs of stabilization as we work our way through the economic downturn. But I think what is encouraging to us is the trends of our business customers in investing in productivity and efficiency, which helps drive growth in our strategic business products.
Revenues from these products such as Ethernet, Virtual Private Networks and application services were up again this quarter, more than 15%. And business IP revenues, overall, were up 8%. As you know, during this downturn, we've executed a clear and consistent strategy in business markets. First, we've invested right through the downturn, adding capacity reach and new capabilities. Second, we've won new business with a number of customer wins that played to both our global and mobility strengths. And third, as we work to make operations and service more seamless for customers, that's given us opportunities to improve our cost structure and grow margins through this downturn. Because of all of this, we are well positioned as the economy improves over time.
Now let's take a look at margins and cash flow, starting with consolidated margin comparisons on Slide 15. For the third quarter, consolidated operating margins were relatively stable at 17.3%, and that's despite Wireless margin pressure from integrated device sales. This reflects solid performance across the company. Our Wireline operating income margin was 12% in the third quarter. That's up from 11.2% in third quarter last year. This reflects improving revenue trends and solid execution on cost initiatives. Across the business, our total force since the end of 2009 is down by more than 15,000.
Company-wide, we have a commitment to operate as one AT&T, and that means delivering a single, seamless experience to customers for all of our Wireless and Wireline products. And as we consolidate and integrate operations, we have continuing opportunities for cost efficiencies. These initiatives are going well, and they've helped us sustain solid margins while also improving customer service.
Along with solid margins, we continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash flow summary is on Slide 16. In the first three quarters of this year, cash from operations totaled $25.4 billion. Our capital expenditures were $13.7 billion, and that includes a 55% year-over-year increase in Wireless-related capital.
We continue to expect full year capital investment of $18 billion to $19 billion, although we're trending toward the upper end of that range. Free cash flow before dividends was $11.6 billion, and dividend payments totaled $7.4 billion.
Over the last six quarters, we have generated free cash flow in excess of dividends of more than $9 billion. In terms of uses of cash, debt is down almost $4 billion over the past 12 months. That gives us a debt-to-capital ratio of 37.8% and net debt to EBITDA of 1.5%. And all of this gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business and return substantial value to shareowners.
Let me close by recapping a few items on Slide 17. Again, first, we had a terrific Wireless quarter, breaking about every sales record that we track. And in addition, Ralph's team delivered continued growth in postpaid ARPU and lower churn.
We are also very pleased with our Wireline Consumer business, which achieved positive growth this quarter thanks to U-verse and the transformation those services are making in the business. Combined with continued solid cost management, this helped us deliver very strong financial results, with solid revenue and earnings growth and stable year-over-year consolidated margins, even with record Wireless device sales. Put this together with the results from the first half of the year, and you're seeing the makings of a very good 2010. Year-to-date, we're growing revenue. We're expanding margins. We're increasing earnings, and cash flow remained strong, giving us the ability to continue to invest in the business and return value to shareholders.
Brooks, I think we should stop there, and we're ready to take some questions.

First off, as Ralph mentioned in his remarks, we would expect at this point margins in Wireless to rebound and be stronger in the fourth quarter versus the 37.6% we had in third quarter. The amount of increase there and improvement is a little difficult to project at this point. It's going to be based on the volume of integrated device sales, particularly as we go through the holiday season. But even with that, I would expect margins to be a bit stronger in Wireless. One other thing that is impacting or will impact Wireless margins in the fourth quarter and probably for the next two or three quarters is the transition and conversion of the customer base that we acquired from the former Alltel properties. As we're now getting to the point where we're going to begin aggressively moving that customer base from their current network to new GSM networks to new billing systems. And in the course of doing that, we're going to have to provide that base with new devices, and there'll be subsidies involved in that. And we talked about all of that as part of the acquisition when we first announced it. But I just wanted to remind you, we're now, as we move into the fourth quarter, we're going to be getting into that period where we'll be going through that activity. But even with those, I would expect some improvement in Wireless margins. On the Wireline side, as you mentioned, John, we've had very good results in Wireline margins, and that business is going through a massive transformation as it moves increasingly from voice and legacy Data Services to U-verse to IP-based Data Services and to Managed Services. We've managed that transition, I think, very well. It's an ongoing effort here, believe me, in terms of finding ways to be more efficient in the business. And the one AT&T initiatives that I mentioned in my remarks have been a major contributor to that, and it really does involve almost an internal merger and integration of organizations, processes, systems that support Wireless and Wireline, and we have to move in that direction in order to be able to interface with customers and provide single points of contact, and that's really the way customers want to deal with us across both our Wireless and Wireline products. But at the same time, it's contributed to our ability to take a lot of costs out of the business. As we go into the fourth quarter, I would expect there to be the normal seasonal pressure that we have on Wireline margins, and you've seen that typically every year. It's a function of two or three things. One, being the fourth quarter typically has fewer business days, which affect things like long-distance revenues, for example. So it impacts both revenues and margins. We also typically have a bit higher overtime rates in the fourth quarter due to holidays and due to some of the typical seasonal weather patterns we get in some of our regions. But beyond that, we'll continue to focus on margins on the Wireline side. When you step back from all of that, our expectation is still to be for, in total, for the year, as we guided, in the low 40s in EBITDA margins for Wireless and in the lower 30s in the EBITDA margins for the Wireline business.

Let me try to size up the postpaid ARPU question for you. I mentioned in my comments that the Alltel acquisition impacted us by 40 basis points as the customers that we acquired with those properties had lower average postpaid ARPUs than those of AT&T's, so that accounts for 40 basis points. There's another 70-plus basis points that are accounted for as a result of lower regulatory fees, including the universal service fund fees and the regulatory cost recovery fees. If you put those two things together, that accounts for almost more than 100 basis points of difference. If you add that to the 2% growth that we reflected in this quarter, then it's pretty much in line with what we have been reporting for the last several quarters, somewhere north of 2% to 3% ARPU growth, and we expect that as we continue to sell more integrated devices, our base has the capability to continue to get on higher ARPUs in the coming quarters ahead.

We had another good cash flow quarter in the third quarter. And in fact, one of the things we've been very pleased with is over the last two years, as we've gone through a very difficult time, the company's continued to reduce strong cash flow, and that's given us the flexibility to continue to invest in areas where we see opportunities for growth, including doing a couple of Wireless acquisitions that we've closed in the last year. And it's also given us good, solid support for our dividend and growing the dividend, and it's allowed us to pay down debt and strengthen the balance sheet. We are sitting right now, similar to where we were last quarter about this time at kind of the upper end of our target credit metric ranges. And part of the reason we continue to stay at that kind of same range over the last quarter is because we have been absorbing the acquisition of the Alltel properties. As we go forward, as cash flow permits, I think we're going to and as we migrate solidly into our target ranges, I think then that gives us flexibility in addition to continuing to invest in the business and support the dividend, to look at some other alternatives like share repurchase. In terms of the ratings activities, we have essentially not changed our, for many, many years, our desire and commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. And I can tell you in the last six years, we have not changed essentially the credit metrics that we target to support a strong balance sheet. But each of the rating agencies look at the numbers and the results and have their own proprietary calculations and their own targets, and it's different for each one. And so we will continue to be very consistent in the metrics that we target in some cases. For example, I think the rating activity you're talking about is S&P moving us to a credit watch position. If you look at their press release when they did that two or three months ago and look at the numbers they put in that release, we would have to delever substantially to the tune of as much as $15 billion in order to hit the ranges they were targeting. And I think that's beyond the level that we are targeting in our credit metrics. So we continue to be very consistent in how we're applying that. I think that's the right way to manage the business, given the capital intensive nature of the business, the size of our business, the size of the debt portfolio. I think it's prudent, and we will continue to be consistent with that as we move firmly into our target credit metrics as I've said. That and the cash flow gives us a lot of flexibility to continue to invest where there's opportunities, to continue to support the dividend and to consider other alternatives like share repurchase.

So we like to see them sign up in record numbers like we did this past quarter. 8 million in total in terms of integrated devices.

So it will be interesting to see what customers eventually opt for. But I think the technology and the capability with these operating systems are that they can be such that they can adapt to all sort of lower-priced SKUs and the question is, will that be something that customers buy? We all always have the view that we should give the customers the choice, and that we have a wide range of devices with different price points. So if they want a low-end smartphone, that maybe doesn't have as much processing power or as much memory, they can have that.

I think as we go into the next year or two, I think you'll continue to see some shifts there. And that's a very natural transition. It's following the shifts in the business. Wireless is nearly 50% of our revenues today. And in addition, as we look forward over the next year, we've got commercial deployment of LTE on the Wireless side. And at the end of '11, we'll be starting to wind down the primary build activities we had around U-verse. And so all of those things will contribute, as well as the trends in the business toward shifting some capital between Wireline and Wireless.

It seems like the iPhone, based on your numbers, are still kind of pulling ahead of their competitors here. I guess Droid being the main competitor. When do you think maybe that could reverse a little bit and I guess your flow anyway where the Droid and the new Microsoft phones can start to gain a little bit more share on iPhone? And then secondly, can you give a little bit more color when you upgrade to HSPA+, what the customer experience is like? Because I assume the churn on the iPhone issue is going to be largely dictated by network quality and maybe just a little bit more update on where you are with the backhaul upgrade and what will become six months from now or so?

The development of the applications and operations systems are leading the U.S. to be at the epicenter of everything that is happening new with smartphones. And I think what you're seeing is more choices coming into the marketplace and every year, everybody's phones seem to be getting better and better and better. So I think what is happening in the industry the battle is a battle of innovation cycles, who can innovate quicker and faster based on the fact that all these OS have a very good base capability. It's all now about innovation. I've never seen innovation cycles come quicker. And so I think we're going to have the opportunity to do is to offer customers an incredible choice of applications and services based on this innovative capabilities. But if you look at Android, it has some very good and fast innovation cycles. So does Apple. Microsoft just came out, and they've already announced they're going to upgrade some things in that infrastructure and operating system in early next year. So I think it will be a race of innovation to see who can develop the most innovative products and services. And the thing that I liked about our position is we believe we believe in having a wide choice of OSs, having every single major one. So that if there's any innovation that is important to our customer base, they know that they can come to AT&T, and we'll be able to have it for them. And that's been our view. In terms of HSPA+, I think any speed that we can provide to the network to make it faster, makes all these devices faster. The beauty about it is that the faster network speeds that we're offering today make these devices really come to life. If you have a slower network, I don't think you're going to get utility out of the processing power and the memory capabilities and the video that these devices are capable of delivering. So I think our HSPA+ piece will take a one additional level and give you a fantastic experience when you have one of these processors that now have one gigahertz as a basic core processor. But what we see in the horizon is actually dual core processors, two processors as fast as one gigahertz each. So you can imagine that those devices, unless you have a really fast network, are not going to be able to deliver the best experience to our customers. So that's why I like our positioning so much that we'll have HSPA+ delivered by the end of the year. We're going to have the capability to begin the backhaul upgrades and to provide the services on a geographic basis as soon as the backhaul is complete, and when you get one of these devices with one gigahertz processor, maybe even dual processors, they're going to absolutely hum. They're just going to be awesome. And so I think those are the trends that I see in the marketplace, and we're very excited because I think it plays to our strengths.

One on handsets and devices, Ralph's exactly right, and we're seeing an unprecedented level of innovation. And it is just fun in this business, frankly, to see the innovation, the new devices, the new features that are coming out literally every quarter. But I want to make sure while it's fun to talk about all the different devices of handsets, I want to make sure that we don't lose sight of the real story here from our perspective. And the real story here is this quarter, with as large of a postpaid base as we have, well over 80% of the devices we sold into that postpaid base, both upgrades and new gross adds, were integrated devices. That's astounding, and it's huge compared to even where we were just a year ago. And I think what that speaks to is the combination of the features in these devices along with the network speeds that Ralph talked about has really facilitated a value proposition for customers and has turned the mobile phone into a mobile computing device. And increasingly, customers want to be able to access applications, access the Internet and receive content via their mobile devices. That is really the real story here. And it leaves us into a Mobile Broadband business for us that's approaching a $20 billion a year business, and a business that's growing at 25% to 30%. That's underlying it. That's the real story, and I think the opportunity for us and why we're excited about this space. And why, frankly, we continue to push integrated devices, we continue to push Data Services into our postpaid base. The other thing that I want to comment on really relates to the overall customer experience in our network as we migrate up first, as we migrated up to HSPA 7.2 and then to HSPA+ and then to LTE. I think we've got the opportunity over the next few years to offer a superior experience on these devices because to facilitate the kind of Data Services and applications and devices that we're going to have and everyone's going to have on the network and that customers want, it's going to require mobile broadband speed. And as a result, you see all the carriers rolling out 4G networks, whether they be LTE or whether they'd be WiMAX or other technologies. But everyone is working to increase speeds. The advantage that we'll have is not just in terms of the speeds available on these new 4G networks. But initially, these 4G networks are going to cover a relatively small piece of geography. And in our network, as customers move off of that geography, they're going to have a great experience in LTE as they move off of that geography. They're going to have a very, very good experience in HSPA+ across our network. And that will be an advantage versus other carriers where you will see a significant decrease in speeds when you're out of their 4G footprint.

One is you mentioned that on the Enterprise side, 70% of the customers have converted already to IP. And can you help us think about if you look at the global Enterprise revenue change whether you look at year-over-year or sequentially, how much of that can be attributed to this conversion process of moving to lower-cost IP services versus how to think about the business organically in terms of the demand for traffic in a more normal pricing environment once you get through conversion? The second part of the question was more of a strategic question. As Wireless continues to evolve and start to take share of the broadband market more substantially, in your view, does it still makes sense for Wireless and Wireline to be part of the same company? Or are there advantages over time in thinking about what Wireless can do to compete more effectively against what is the traditional Wireline business?

First of all, I think when you look at our business sales and revenues and look at the various business revenue streams there, again, that's a business going",630,"Those are great questions, Mike. Let me take a shot at those and invite Ralph to comment as well. First of all, I think when you look at our business sales and revenues and look at the various business revenue streams there, again, that's a business going through a transition. We've actually crossed the line this quarter where traditional voice revenues as part of our business revenues are down below 40% of business revenues. Increasingly, it's becoming a business driven by data, by IP-based services, Managed Services and increasingly as we go forward, as companies move more of their applications and their content into the cloud, hosting cloud computing becomes more important, as well as facilitating applications through mobile devices. And I think we're well positioned in all areas of the business where there are growth opportunities. And that's why you see strategic business service revenues continuing to grow quarter after quarter at mid-teens rates. It's why you've seen in the last several quarters IP-based data revenues increasing on the business side, getting into the upper single digit rates of growth. We're also seeing impacts in other areas, still a lot of demand for bandwidth and transport. Now the revenue streams there have been flatter more recently, but that's more a function of companies increasing their bandwidth, but at the same time, grooming their networks and moving to higher speed services. And so we're seeing both on a retail and a wholesale environment, significant demand for Ethernet in backhaul. Again, all of those areas were positioned very well. The one area that has been a drag in the business somewhat has been voice volumes, and I think we will see some improvements there. But as we require some improvement in the economy in employment and as well as on the small end of the business, in new business formations. As we see that and as the business becomes increasingly driven by IP-based services that are on a good growth trajectory, I think that, that's what gives us comfort that the overall revenues on the business side will continue to improve. And as we've talked about, we think longer term this is a GDP, GDP-plus type of growth sector for us. You asked a very good question about the importance of or the need or desire to have both Wireless and Wireline assets, given this environment. And I guess what I would say, Michael, is I think more than ever before, we think there are advantages and strengths in having a combination of Wireless and Wireline assets because that's what is required to provide the kinds of service experience that customers want. And essentially, whether you're a business customer or a consumer customer, you want the convenience of mobility and mobile access to networks and to data applications and content. And you want that over a variety of devices. That's why you see the proliferation of devices on the network from all of the connected devices that Ralph's team is selling to notebook computers to tablet computing. That's the way people want to access the network. But in order to provide the bandwidth and to provide the capacity and to provide the kind of service experience you want, you've got to drive that traffic as quickly as possible into a wired infrastructure, which improves service quality and provides significantly more bandwidth. That's why, for example, in our case, that's why we believe having the Wi-Fi infrastructure and hotspots that we have across the country and around the world are so important. So in our view, we believe to provide the kinds of services that consumers and businesses demand in the future, having both Wireless and Wireline capabilities and having an integrated carrier model is the best way to provide those services.

Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me call your attention to Slide 4, which provides a financial summary. Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $2.08, which includes a $0.13 gain from the cash sale of Sterling Commerce during the quarter and another $1.40 gain from a previously disclosed tax settlement. Excluding these gains, EPS was $0.55. That's up about 4% versus EPS for the third quarter a year ago and up about 9% year-to-date versus the same period last year. That's our third consecutive quarter of EPS growth before significant items.
Consolidated revenues were $31.6 billion, up both year-over-year and sequentially. And that was led by strong growth in mobile broadband, U-verse services and advanced business offerings. Even with record integrated device sales, our consolidated operating margin was essentially flat from the prior year, reflecting operational improvements in network and support functions and solid execution on cost initiatives.
And free cash flow continues to be strong, $4 billion in the quarter and $11.6 billion year-to-date.

Before we get into the highlights on Slide 5, let me first just say we're very pleased with what we accomplished in the third quarter. First off, we’re excited about the trends that we're seeing with revenue growth. Not only did we have a solid consolidated revenue growth quarter that was fueled by double-digit Wireless revenue growth, but we also saw Wireline consumer revenues grow for the first time in more than two years. Second, we continue to see the benefits of our mobile broadband strategy. We had just an incredible Wireless quarter across most every metric.
New customers are choosing AT&T and existing customers are renewing their contracts in record numbers. And I think that speaks volumes about both the strength of our network and the ever-widening selection of devices that we carry. Ralph will give you more details in a moment, but we are very pleased with the improvement that we're seeing in revenue trends.
We also continue to see improving revenue trends in our business markets, and I'll speak to those in just a few minutes. But from my perspective, the thing I'm most encouraged by is that even with pressure on margins from integrated device sales, we delivered good, consolidated margins with earnings growth and continued free cash flow. And I think that puts us in great position to have a solid year in 2010 with good momentum going forward.
With that overview, let's take a look at revenues on Slide 6. Consolidated revenue totaled $31.6 billion. That's up nearly $850 million versus third quarter a year ago, and that growth is due to strong Wireless growth, to solid U-verse gains and to improved business trends. 
Our overall revenue mix continued its transformation in the third quarter, with 73% of revenues coming from Wireless, Wireline Data and Managed Services. That's up from 68% a year ago and 62% two years ago. Combined, the revenues from these sources were up nearly 10% in the third quarter, and we expect this shift to continue, and it's one of the reasons we have a positive long-term view of the business going forward, as growth of Wireless and Data outstrips declines of legacy services.
At this point, let me turn it now to Ralph de la Vega, who, as you know, runs our Wireless and Consumer business for an update on those areas. Ralph?"

As Rick said, we have a tremendous Wireless growth quarter, everything we could hope for and more. Now what you keep hearing again and again is record. 
As you can see on Slide 7, record sales of integrated devices, record gross adds, record customer upgrades, record third quarter net adds of 2.6 million, record Wireless Data sales. We also had the best ever third quarter total churn, our seventh consecutive quarter of growth in postpaid ARPU, and we added 1.2 million connected devices in the third quarter, setting the pace for the industry.
These were simply the best Wireless volumes we've had in any third quarter in our history, off the charts. But you know what, we believe that we're just scratching the surface here, especially when you consider three areas where the potential is huge. First, we still see a lot of growth opportunity with integrated devices. About 57% of our postpaid base have these devices, but our sales rate is more than 80%.
Second, we believe emerging Wireless devices are just beginning to take off. And third, the business phase is just beginning to fully integrate mobile data in their operation, lots of opportunity there. So we're very pleased with our third quarter results and even more excited about the opportunity that lies ahead.
With that overview, let me drill down and cover Wireless results, starting with revenue and subscriber trends on Slide 8. Our results this quarter show the strength of our focus on data and ARPU growth. In the third quarter, we accelerated both revenue growth and subscriber growth. Total Wireless revenues were up $1.6 billion or 11.4%, and Wireless service revenues grew 10.5%, up more than $1.3 billion versus the third quarter a year ago.
Mobile broadband and strong data adoption drove our seventh consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU gain, a record unmatched by our peers, up by 2.0%, which includes about 40 basis points of pressure from properties acquired from Verizon Wireless. 
For the third straight quarter, we set a new record in terms of total net adds. The strongest first quarter ever was followed by our strongest second quarter ever and now our strongest third quarter ever, with 2.6 million net adds. Postpaid net adds were about 750,000, up 50% sequentially. Prepaid net adds totaled more than 320,000, with continued strong sales of the iPad 3G. Customer response has been very strong since the iPad 3G was first introduced in late April, and we expect that momentum to continue as we go through the fourth quarter.
We also added 1.2 million connected devices to our network in the third quarter. This is terrific business for us, lower ARPUs but higher margins and low churn, and we're still in the starting blocks with this terrific opportunity. These results clearly demonstrate the benefits of our mobile broadband strategy.
When you look at our net adds, our ARPU gains and churn improvement is clear that our subscriber metrics have never been better, and they continue to go in the right direction. One of the key drivers behind our Wireless growth is our integrated device strategy. The details are on Slide 9. The rapid adoption of powerful integrated devices has revolutionized our industry, and customer response continues to be incredible. In the third quarter, more than 80% of postpaid sales were integrated devices. In the third quarter, we had our largest integrated device quarter ever, signing up more than 8 million subscribers, including both upgrades and net adds. We added 3.8 million 3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, up more than 14 million in the past 12 months, and ARPU for our integrated devices continues to be 1.7x our other devices.
And these subscribers tend to be very sticky for us. Approximately 80% of these subscribers are on family or business-related plans with churn levels well below our average. These results also reflect another record quarter for iPhone activations. More than 5 million were activated during the quarter. That's more than 60% higher than our previous record, and sales continue to be strong.
As a result, data revenues also continued to be strong. We grew Wireless data revenues by more than 30%, up more than $1.1 billion year-over-year. This was also our first full quarter of our new pricing for Wireless data, and the initial results have been very positive. We're also seeing more customers being drawn to upgrade to integrated devices, adding data plans at the lower price point and then they can migrate up after data needs grow.
Our network today supports more integrated devices than any of our competitors and more data traffic than any of our competitors, and we lead in connected devices. 
Slide 10 shows how we built this leadership position. We have the best portfolio of integrated devices in the industry, using all major operating systems. That includes Android, RIM, Apple OS, webOS, Symbian. And last week, we announced the addition of three new devices using Windows Phone 7. Our portfolio keeps getting better. Three new Motorola Android devices are scheduled for the fourth quarter, giving us seven great Android devices for our company. Plus the BlackBerry Torch, which is exclusive to AT&T, continues to do well, and we just announced that we're launching the Motorola ES400, which is a rugged device for the Enterprise space. In addition to these handsets, we're launching HSPA+ and LTE data cards like the Shockwave from Sierra Wireless and the Adrenaline from LG. The Shockwave will allow our customers to connect to our HSPA+ network, and the Adrenaline is our first LTE upgradable device. We also offer some great emerging devices including the iPad, which begins selling in our stores next week.
Our formula is great devices plus a great mobile broadband network, and we're in terrific spot for both fronts. We have a terrific technology pack for customers. Our strategy to continuously upgrade network speed placed with the strength of GSM technology and provides the most elegant path to LTE with backwards compatibility at every step. Slide 11 has more details on our network path.
Let me say that we're really excited about our network roadmap. We have the nation's fastest mobile broadband network today and the best transition plan in the market. Because of the technology choices we have made, we will have a significant advantage for the next couple of years at least, and customers are starting to get it. This year alone, we already spent almost $6 billion or almost half of our capital expenditures so far this year on Wireless-related investments. 
Now here's the progress we're seeing from those investments. Earlier this year, we completed the HSPA 7.2 software upgrade, making the nation's fastest mobile broadband network even faster. Now we're in the process of deploying HSPA+ to our networks. This will again allow us to increase our network speeds, and we expect the software upgrade to be completed by the end of this year.
And all the while we're making progress with our backhaul upgrades, executing a very aggressive investment and deployment program. This backhaul expansion is critical today and is the foundation for LTE. The same work has to be done to handle the massive growth in mobile broadband. What all this means for our customers is a great experience leading into LTE. We will not have the fall back issues that CDMA customers will have as they move from 4G back to CDMA Rev A speeds. Our LTE trials are currently underway in Dallas and Baltimore, with an expected launch in mid-2011 to reach 70 million to 75 million POPs by the end of next year. Customers who are excited about 4G and over the next couple of years, they will expect a smooth, fast ride to 4G, and that's what we plan to deliver. We believe this gives us a great position to continue to capture growth in mobile broadband.
Now I'd like to discuss how these network initiatives, along with subscriber and revenue growth, is impacting our Wireless margins and operating income, and those details are on Slide 12. Obviously, the record quarter for integrated device sales, which includes about 2 million incremental iPhone activations, had an impact on our Wireless service margins. Absent the costs associated with these additional activations, service more just would have been similar to last quarter. But it is important to keep in mind the long-term benefits these customers bring including lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth.
In the third quarter, our Wireless OIBDA service margin was 37.6%, down from the year-earlier quarter. We believe the impact of margins will be temporary, and our expectations for total year Wireless OIBDA service margins continue to be in the low 40% range. Looking at Wireless operating income, you can see the trends that I am talking about. While the third quarter operating income was relatively flat year-over-year, year-to-date Wireless operating income is up 15% year-over-year to reach $11.8 billion.
Now let me turn and cover consumer Wireline results, starting with the U-verse update, and Slide 13 has the information. We had another solid net add quarter in U-verse TV subscribers, helping drive the first year-over-year growth in consumer revenue in more than two years. We had an increase of 236,000 U-verse TV subscribers, bringing our total to 2.7 million, up more than 900,000 over the past year. Broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remain very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have a triple- or quad-play bundle with us, and we had a very nice rebound in our total broadband adds, up about 150,000 for the quarter. This has led to improved consumer ARPUs and revenue trends. 
In the third quarter, Wireline IP revenue, and that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew 30%. These revenues now represent more than 42% of total Wireline Consumer revenues, up almost 1,000 basis points over just the past year. ARPU for U-verse triple-play customers was about $160 in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year.
The U-verse TV experience continues to receive positive customer feedback. The latest J.D. Power study ranked us the highest in every region where we were ranked. We continue to add new features that take advantage of U-verse's IP TV platform. For example, we are the first U.S. TV provider to allow customers to use their Xbox 360 as a TV receiver. This replaces a need for an extra receiver and allows customers to receive chats and game invitations while watching live TV and switch seamlessly from game to TV mode.
And the U-verse Mobile app allows customers to download and watch hit TV shows and much more. It's available on four operating systems, including Android and the new Windows Phone 7. Innovations such as this has helped U-verse transform our Consumer business. We're confident this transformation and the positive impact it has on revenues will continue. 
Rick, that covers Wireless and Consumer, and I'll turn it back to you."

Before we close, let me provide a quick update on business customer trends on Slide 14. The fundamental trends underlying our business are consistent with what you've seen in earlier quarters this year. We're seeing continued signs of stabilization as we work our way through the economic downturn. But I think what is encouraging to us is the trends of our business customers in investing in productivity and efficiency, which helps drive growth in our strategic business products.
Revenues from these products such as Ethernet, Virtual Private Networks and application services were up again this quarter, more than 15%. And business IP revenues, overall, were up 8%. As you know, during this downturn, we've executed a clear and consistent strategy in business markets. First, we've invested right through the downturn, adding capacity reach and new capabilities. Second, we've won new business with a number of customer wins that played to both our global and mobility strengths. And third, as we work to make operations and service more seamless for customers, that's given us opportunities to improve our cost structure and grow margins through this downturn. Because of all of this, we’re well positioned as the economy improves over time.
Now let's take a look at margins and cash flow, starting with consolidated margin comparisons on Slide 15. For the third quarter, consolidated operating margins were relatively stable at 17.3%, and that's despite Wireless margin pressure from integrated device sales. This reflects solid performance across the company. Our Wireline operating income margin was 12% in the third quarter. That's up from 11.2% in third quarter last year. This reflects improving revenue trends and solid execution on cost initiatives. Across the business, our total force since the end of 2009 is down by more than 15,000.
Company-wide, we have a commitment to operate as one AT&T, and that means delivering a single, seamless experience to customers for all of our Wireless and Wireline products. And as we consolidate and integrate operations, we have continuing opportunities for cost efficiencies. These initiatives are going well, and they've helped us sustain solid margins while also improving customer service.
Along with solid margins, we continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash flow summary is on Slide 16. In the first three quarters of this year, cash from operations totaled $25.4 billion. Our capital expenditures were $13.7 billion, and that includes a 55% year-over-year increase in Wireless-related capital.
We continue to expect full year capital investment of $18 billion to $19 billion, although we're trending toward the upper end of that range. Free cash flow before dividends was $11.6 billion, and dividend payments totaled $7.4 billion.
Over the last six quarters, we have generated free cash flow in excess of dividends of more than $9 billion. In terms of uses of cash, debt is down almost $4 billion over the past 12 months. That gives us a debt-to-capital ratio of 37.8% and net debt to EBITDA of 1.5%. And all of this gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business and return substantial value to shareowners.
Let me close by recapping a few items on Slide 17. Again, first, we had a terrific Wireless quarter, breaking about every sales record that we track. And in addition, Ralph's team delivered continued growth in postpaid ARPU and lower churn.
We’re also very pleased with our Wireline Consumer business, which achieved positive growth this quarter thanks to U-verse and the transformation those services are making in the business. Combined with continued solid cost management, this helped us deliver very strong financial results, with solid revenue and earnings growth and stable year-over-year consolidated margins, even with record Wireless device sales. Put this together with results from the first half of the year, and you're seeing the makings of a very good 2010. Year-to-date, we're growing revenue. We're expanding margins. We're increasing earnings, and cash flow remained strong, giving us the ability to continue to invest in the business and return value to shareholders.
Brooks, I think we should stop there, and we're ready to take some questions."

First off, as Ralph mentioned in his remarks, we would expect at this point margins in Wireless to rebound and be stronger in the fourth quarter versus the 37.6% we had in third quarter. The amount of increase there and improvement is a little difficult to project at this point. It's going to be based on the volume of integrated device sales, particularly as we go through the holiday season. But even with that, I would expect margins to be a bit stronger in Wireless. One other thing that is impacting or will impact Wireless margins in the fourth quarter and probably for the next two or three quarters is the transition and conversion of the customer base that we acquired from the former Alltel properties. As we're now getting to the point where we're going to begin aggressively moving that customer base from their current network to new GSM networks to new billing systems. And in the course of doing that, we're going to have to provide that base with new devices, and there'll be subsidies involved in that. And we talked about all of that as part of the acquisition when we first announced it. But I just wanted to remind you, we're now, as we move into the fourth quarter, we're going to be getting into that period where we'll be going through that activity. But even with those, I would expect some improvement in Wireless margins. On the Wireline side, as you mentioned, John, we've had very good results in Wireline margins, and that business is going through a massive transformation as it moves increasingly from voice and legacy Data Services to U-verse to IP-based Data Services and to Managed Services. We've managed that transition, I think, very well. It's an ongoing effort here, believe me, in terms of finding ways to be more efficient in the business. And the one AT&T initiatives that I mentioned in my remarks have been a major contributor to that, and it really does involve almost an internal merger and integration of organizations, processes, systems that support Wireless and Wireline, and we have to move in that direction in order to be able to interface with customers and provide single points of contact, and that's really the way customers want to deal with us across both our Wireless and Wireline product sets. But at the same time, it's contributed to our ability to take a lot of costs out of the business. As we go into the fourth quarter, I would expect there to be the normal seasonal pressure that we have on Wireline margins, and you've seen that typically every year. It's a function of two or three things: One, being the fourth quarter typically has fewer business days, which affects things like long-distance revenues, for example. So it impacts both revenues and margins. We also typically have a bit higher overtime rates in the fourth quarter due to holidays and due to some of the typical seasonal weather patterns we get in some of our regions. But beyond that, we'll continue to focus on margins on the Wireline side. When you step back from all of that, our expectation is still to be for, in total, for the year, as we guided, in the low 40s in EBITDA margins for Wireless and in the lower 30s in the EBITDA margins for the Wireline business."

But I'm wondering there's just been some recent debt ratings agency discussions I think in the late summer that implied risk to ratings.

Let me try to size up the postpaid ARPU question for you. I mentioned in my comments that the Alltel acquisition impacted us by 40 basis points as the customers that we acquired with those properties had lower average postpaid ARPUs than those of AT&T, so that accounts for 40 basis points. There's another 70-plus basis points that are accounted for as a result of lower regulatory fees, including the universal service fund fees and the regulatory cost recovery fees. If you put those two things together, that accounts for almost more than 100 basis points of difference. If you add that to the 2% growth that we reflected in this quarter, then it's pretty much in line with what we have been reporting for the last several quarters, somewhere north of 2% to 3% ARPU growth, and we expect that as we continue to sell more integrated devices, our base has the capability to continue to get on higher ARPUs in the coming quarters ahead."

And in fact, one of the things we've been very pleased with is over the last two years, as we've gone through a very difficult time, the company's continued to reduce strong cash flow, and that's given us the flexibility to continue to invest in areas where we see opportunities for growth, including doing a couple of Wireless acquisitions that we've closed in the last year. And it's also given us good, solid support for our dividend and growing the dividend, and it's allowed us to pay down debt and strengthen the balance sheet. We are sitting right now, similar to where we were last quarter about this time at kind of the upper end of our target credit metric ranges. And part of the reason we continued to stay at that kind of same range over the last quarter is because we have been absorbing the acquisition of the Alltel properties. As we go forward, as cash flow permits, I think we're going to and as we migrate solidly into our target ranges, I think then that gives us flexibility in addition to continuing to invest in the business and support the dividend, to look at some other alternatives like share repurchase. In terms of the ratings activities, we have essentially not changed our, for many, many years, our desire and commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. And I can tell you in the last six years, we have not changed essentially the credit metrics that we target to support a strong balance sheet. But each of the rating agencies look at the numbers and the results and have their own proprietary calculations and their own targets, and it's different for each one. And so we’ll continue to be very consistent in the metrics that we target in some cases. For example, I think the rating activity you're talking about is S&P moving us to a credit watch position. If you look at their press release when they did that two or three months ago and look at the numbers they put in that release, we would have to de-lever substantially to the tune of as much as $15 billion in order to hit the ranges they were targeting. And I think that's beyond the level that we’re targeting in our credit metrics. So we continue to be very consistent in how we're applying that. I think that's the right way to manage the business, given the capital intensive nature of the business, the size of our business, the size of the debt portfolio. I think it's prudent, and we’ll continue to be consistent with that as we move firmly into our target credit metrics as I've said. That and the cash flow gives us a lot of flexibility to continue to invest where there's opportunities, to continue to support the dividend and to consider other alternatives like share repurchase."

In terms of capital expenditures, it's always a function of timing and demand in the business. And so as I mentioned in our remarks, I think we'll probably trend towards the upper end of the range. Our Wireless CapEx is up year-over-year about 55%. We talked about being $2 billion higher for the year this year versus last year in Wireless CapEx, and year-to-date, that's about where we are. So I think everything's coming in pretty much as we expected. You did see this year a shift in our -- while the overall capital levels haven't changed dramatically, you have seen a shift between Wireline and Wireless. I think as we go into the next year or two, I think you'll continue to see some shifts there. And that's a very natural transition. It's following the shifts in the business. Wireless is nearly 50% of our revenues today. And in addition, as we look forward over the next year, we've got commercial deployment of LTE on the Wireless side. And at the end of '11, we'll be starting to wind down the primary build activities we had around U-verse. And so all of those things will contribute, as well as the trends in the business towards shifting some capital between Wireline and Wireless."

And then secondly, can you give a little bit more color when you upgrade to HSPA+, what the customer experience is like? Because I assume the churn on the iPhone issue is going to be largely dictated by network quality and maybe just a little bit more update on where you are with the backhaul upgrade and what will become six months from now or so."

The development of the applications and operation systems are leading the U.S. to be at the epicenter of everything that is happening new with smartphones. And I think what you're seeing is more choices come into the marketplace and every year, everybody's phones seem to be getting better and better and better. So I think what is happening in the industry the battle is a battle of innovation cycles, who can innovate quicker and faster based on the fact that all these OSs have a very good base capability. It's all now about innovation. I've never seen innovation cycles come quicker. And so I think we're going to have the opportunity to do is to offer customers an incredible choice of applications and services based on this innovative capabilities. But if you look at Android, it has some very good and fast innovation cycles. So does Apple. Microsoft just came out, and they've already announced they're going to upgrade some things in that infrastructure and operating system in early next year. So I think it will be a race of innovation to see who can develop the most innovative products and services. And the thing that I like about our position is we believe we believe in having a wide choice of OSs, having every single major one so that if there's any innovation that is important to our customer base, they know they can come to AT&T, and we'll be able to have it for them. And that's been our view. In terms of HSPA+, I think any speed that we can provide in the network to make it faster, makes all these devices faster. The beauty about it is that the faster network speeds that we're offering today make these devices really come to life. If you have a slower network, I don't think you're going to get the utility out of the processing power and the memory capabilities and the video that these devices are capable of delivering. So I think our HSPA+ piece will take a one additional level and give you a fantastic experience when you have one of these processors that now have one gigahertz as a basic core processor. But what we see in the horizon is actually dual core processors, two processors as fast as one gigahertz each. So you can imagine that those devices, unless you have a really fast network, are not going to be able to deliver the best experience to our customers. So that's why I like our positioning so much that we'll have HSPA+ delivered by the end of the year. We're going to have the capability to begin the backhaul upgrades and to provide the services on a geographic basis as soon as the backhaul is complete, and when you get one of these devices with one gigahertz processor, maybe even dual processors, they're going to absolutely hum. And they're just going to be awesome. And so I think those are the trends that I see in the marketplace, and we're very excited because I think it plays to our strengths."

One on handsets and devices, Ralph's exactly right, and we're seeing an unprecedented level of innovation. And it is just fun in this business, frankly, to see the innovation, the new devices, the new features that are coming out literally every quarter. But I want to make sure while it's fun to talk about all the different devices of handsets, I want to make sure that we don't lose sight of the real story here from our perspective. And the real story here is this quarter, with as large of a postpaid base as we have, well over 80% of the devices we sold into that postpaid base, both upgrades and new gross adds, were integrated devices. That's astounding, and it's huge compared to even where we were just a year ago. And I think what that speaks to is the combination of the features in these devices along with the network speeds that Ralph talked about has really facilitated a value proposition for customers and has turned the mobile phone into a mobile computing device. And increasingly, customers want to be able to access applications, access the Internet and receive content via their mobile devices. That is really the real story here. And it leads us into a Mobile Broadband business for us that's approaching a $20 billion a year business, and a business that's growing at 25% to 30%. Underlying it, that's the real story, and I think the opportunity for us and why we're excited about this space. And why, frankly, we continue to push integrated devices, we continue to push Data Services into our postpaid base. The other thing that I want to comment on really relates to the overall customer experience in our network as we migrate up first, as we migrated up to HSPA 7.2 and then to HSPA+ and then to LTE. I think we've got the opportunity over the next few years to offer a superior experience on these devices because to facilitate the kinds of Data Services and applications and devices that we're going to have -- that everyone's going to have on the network and that customers want, it's going to require mobile broadband speed. And as a result, you see all the carriers rolling out 4G networks, whether they be LTE or whether they be WiMAX or other technologies. But everyone is working to increase speeds. The advantage that we'll have is not just in terms of the speeds available on these new 4G networks. But initially, these 4G networks are going to cover a relatively small piece of geography. And in our network, as customers move off of that geography, they're going to have a great experience in LTE as they move off of that geography. They're going to have a very, very good experience in HSPA+ across our network. And that will be an advantage versus other carriers where you will see a significant decrease in speeds when you're out of their 4G footprint."

One is you mentioned that on the Enterprise side, 70% of the customers have converted already to IP. And can you help us think about if you look at the global Enterprise revenue change whether you look at year-over-year or sequentially, how much of that can be attributed to this conversion process of moving to lower-cost IP services versus how to think about the business organically in terms of the demand for traffic in a more normal pricing environment once you get through the conversion? The second part of the question was more of a strategic question. As Wireless continues to evolve and start to take share of the broadband market more substantially, in your view, does it still makes sense for Wireless and Wireline to be part of the same company? Or are there advantages over time in thinking about what Wireless can do to compete more effectively against what is the traditional Wireline business?"

First of all, I think when you look at our business sales and revenues and look at the various business revenue streams there, again, that's a business going",628,"Those are great questions, Mike. Let me take a shot at those and invite Ralph to comment as well. First of all, I think when you look at our business sales and revenues and look at the various business revenue streams there, again, that's a business going through a transition. We've actually crossed the line this quarter where traditional voice revenues as part of our business revenues are down below 40% of business revenues. Increasingly, it's becoming a business driven by data, by IP-based services, Managed Services and increasingly as we go forward, as companies move more of their applications and their content into the cloud hosting, cloud computing becomes more important, as well as facilitating applications through mobile devices. And I think we're well positioned in all areas of the business where there are growth opportunities. And that's why you see strategic business service revenues continuing to grow quarter after quarter at mid-teens rates. It's why you've seen in the last several quarters IP-based data revenues increasing on the business side, getting into the upper-single-digit rates of growth. We're also seeing impacts in other areas, still a lot of demand for bandwidth and transport. Now the revenue streams there have been flatter more recently, but that's more a function of companies increasing their bandwidth, but at the same time, grooming their networks and moving to higher speed services. And so we're seeing both on a retail and a wholesale environment, significant demand for Ethernet in backhaul. Again, all of those areas, we’re positioned very well. The one area that has been a drag in the business somewhat has been voice volumes, and I think we will see some improvements there. But as we require some improvement in the economy in employment and as well as on the small end of the business, in new business formations. As we see that and as the business becomes increasingly driven by IP-based services that are on a good growth trajectory, I think that that's what gives us comfort that the overall revenues on the business side will continue to improve. And as we've talked about, we think longer term this is a GDP, GDP-plus type of growth sector for us. You ask a very good question about the importance of or the need or desire to have both Wireless and Wireline assets, given this environment. And I guess what I would say, Michael, is I think more than ever before, we think there are advantages and strengths in having a combination of Wireless and Wireline assets because that's what is required to provide the kinds of service experience that customers want. And essentially, whether you're a business customer or a consumer customer, you want the convenience of mobility and mobile access to networks and to data applications and content. And you want that over a variety of devices. That's why you see the proliferation of devices on the network from all of the connected devices that Ralph's team is selling to notebook computers to tablet computing. That's the way people want to access the network. But in order to provide the bandwidth and to provide the capacity and to provide the kind of service experience you want, you've got to drive that traffic as quickly as possible into a wired infrastructure, which improves service quality and provides significantly more bandwidth. That's why, for example, in our case, that's why we believe having the Wi-Fi infrastructure and hotspots that we have across the country and around the world are so important. So in our view, we believe to provide the kinds of services that consumers and businesses demand in the future, having both Wireless and Wireline capabilities and having an integrated carrier model is the best way to provide those services."

Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me call your attention to Slide 4, which provides a financial summary. Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $2.08, which includes the $0.13 gain from the cash sale of Sterling Commerce during the quarter and another $1.40 gain from a previously disclosed tax settlement. Excluding these gains, EPS was $0.55. That's up about 4% versus EPS for the third quarter a year ago and up about 9% year-to-date versus the same period last year. That's our third consecutive quarter of EPS growth before significant items.
Consolidated revenues were $31.6 billion, up both year-over-year and sequentially. And that was led by strong growth in mobile broadband U-verse services and advanced business offerings. Even with record integrated device sales, our consolidated operating margin was essentially flat from the prior year, reflecting operational improvements in network and support functions and solid execution on cost initiatives.
And free cash flow continues to be strong, $4 billion in the quarter and $11.6 billion year-to-date. With that, I will now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, Rick Lindner. Rick?"

Before we get into the highlights on Slide 5, let me first just say we're very pleased with what we accomplished in the third quarter. First off, we are excited about the trends that we're seeing with revenue growth. Not only did we have a solid consolidated revenue growth quarter that was fueled by double-digit Wireless revenue growth, but we also saw Wireline consumer revenues grow for the first time in more than two years. Second, we continue to see the benefits of our mobile broadband strategy. We had just an incredible Wireless quarter across most every metric.
New customers are choosing AT&T and existing customers are renewing their contracts in record numbers. And I think that speaks volumes about both the strength of our network and the ever-widening selection of devices that we carry. Ralph will give you more details in a moment, but we are very pleased with the improvement that we're seeing in revenue trends.
We also continue to see improving revenue trends in our business markets, and I'll speak to those in just a few minutes. But from my perspective, the thing I'm most encouraged by is that even with pressure on margins from integrated device sales, we delivered good, consolidated margins with earnings growth and continued free cash flow. And I think that puts us in great position to have a solid year in 2010 with good momentum going forward.
With that overview, let's take a look at revenues on Slide 6. Consolidated revenue totaled $31.6 billion. That's up nearly $850 million versus third quarter a year ago, and that growth is due to strong Wireless growth to solid U-verse gains and to improved business trends. Our overall revenue mix continued its transformation in the third quarter, with 73% of revenues coming from Wireless, Wireline Data and Managed Services. That's up from 68% a year ago and 62% two years ago. Combined, the revenues from these sources were up nearly 10% in the third quarter, and we expect this shift to continue, and it's one of the reasons we have a positive long-term view of the business going forward, as growth of Wireless and Data outstrips declines of legacy services.
At this point, let me turn it now to Ralph de la Vega, who, as you know, runs our Wireless and Consumer business for an update on those areas. Ralph?"

It's good to have this opportunity to talk with you again. As Rick said, we have a tremendous Wireless growth quarter, everything we could hope for and more. Now what you keep hearing again and again is record.",1838,"Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. It's good to have this opportunity to talk with you again. As Rick said, we have a tremendous Wireless growth quarter, everything we could hope for and more. Now what you keep hearing again and again is record. As you can see on Slide 7, record sales of integrated devices, record gross adds, record customer upgrades, record third quarter net adds of 2.6 million, record Wireless Data sales. We also had the best ever third quarter total churn, our seventh consecutive quarter of growth in postpaid ARPU, and we added 1.2 million connected devices in the third quarter, setting the pace for the industry.
These were simply the best Wireless volumes we've had in any third quarter in our history, off the charts. But you know what, we believe that we're just scratching the surface here, especially when you consider three areas where the potential is huge. First, we still see a lot of growth opportunity with integrated devices. About 57% of our postpaid base have these devices, but our sales rate is more than 80%.
Second, we believe emerging Wireless devices are just beginning to take off. And third, the business phase is just beginning to fully integrate mobile data in their operation, lots of opportunity there. So we're very pleased with our third quarter results and even more excited about the opportunity that lies ahead.
With that overview, let me drill down and cover Wireless results, starting with revenue and subscriber trends on Slide 8. Our results this quarter showed the strength of our focus on data and ARPU growth. In the third quarter, we accelerated both revenue growth and subscriber growth. Total Wireless revenues were up $1.6 billion or 11.4%, and Wireless service revenues grew 10.5%, up more than $1.3 billion versus the third quarter a year ago.
Mobile broadband and strong data adoption drove our seventh consecutive quarter of postpaid ARPU gain, a record unmatched by our peers, up by 2.0%, which includes about 40 basis points of pressure from properties acquired from Verizon Wireless. For the third straight quarter, we set a new record in terms of total net adds. Strongest first quarter ever was followed by our strongest second quarter ever and our strongest third quarter ever, with 2.6 million net adds. Postpaid net adds were about 750,000, up 50% sequentially. Prepaid net adds totaled more than 320,000, with continued strong sales of the iPad 3G. Customer response has been very strong since the iPad 3G was first introduced in late April, and we expect that momentum to continue as we go through the fourth quarter.
We also added 1.2 million connected devices to our network in the third quarter. This is terrific business for us, lower ARPUs, but higher margins and low churn, and we're still in the starting blocks with this terrific opportunity. These results clearly demonstrate the benefits of our mobile broadband strategy.
When you look at our net adds, our ARPU gains and churn improvement is clear that our subscriber metrics have never been better, and they continue to go in the right direction. One of the key drivers behind our Wireless growth is our integrated device strategy. The details are on Slide 9. The rapid adoption of powerful integrated devices has revolutionized our industry, and customer response continues to be incredible. In the third quarter, more than 80% of postpaid sales were integrated devices. In the third quarter, we had our largest integrated device quarter ever, signing up more than 8 million subscribers, including both upgrades and net adds. We added 3.8 million 3G postpaid integrated devices in the quarter, up more than 14 million in the past 12 months, and ARPU for integrative devices continues to be 1.7x our other devices.
And these subscribers tend to be very sticky for us. Approximately 80% of these subscribers are on family or business-related plans with churn levels well below our average. These results also reflect another record quarter for iPhone activations. More than 5 million were activated during the quarter. That's more than 60% higher than our previous records, and sales continue to be strong.
As a result, data revenues also continued to be strong. We grew Wireless data revenues by more than 30%, up more than $1.1 billion year-over-year. This was also our first full quarter of our new pricing for Wireless data, and the initial results have been very positive. We're also seeing more customers being drawn to upgrade to integrated devices, adding data plans at the lower price point and then they can migrate up after data needs grow.
Our network today supports more integrated devices than any of our competitors and more data traffic than any of our competitors, and we lead in connected devices. Slide 10 shows how we built this leadership position. We have the best portfolio of integrated devices in the industry, using all major operating systems. That includes Android, RIM, Apple OS, webOS, Symbian. And last week, we announced the addition of three new devices using Windows Phone 7, our portfolio keeps getting better. Three new Motorola Android devices are scheduled for the fourth quarter, giving us seven great Android devices for our company. Plus the BlackBerry Torch, which is exclusive to AT&T, continues to do well, and we just announced that we're launching the Motorola ES400, which is a rugged device for the Enterprise space. In addition to these handsets, we're launching HSPA+ and LTE data cards like the Shockwave from Sierra Wireless and the Adrenaline from LG. The Shockwave will allow our customers to connect to our HSPA+ network, and the Adrenaline is our first LTE upgradable device. We also offer some great emerging devices including the iPad, which begins selling in our stores next week.
Our formula is great devices plus a great mobile broadband network, and we're in terrific spot for both fronts. We have a terrific technology pack for customers. Our strategy to continuously upgrade network speed place with the strength of GSM technology and provides the most elegant path to LTE with backwards compatibility at every step. Slide 11 has more details on our network path.
Let me say that we're really excited about our network road map. We have the nation's fastest mobile broadband network today, and the best transition plan in the market. Because of the technology choices we have made, we will have a significant advantage for the next couple of years at least, and customers are starting to get it. This year alone, we already spent almost $6 billion or almost half of our capital expenditures so far this year on Wireless-related investments. 
Now here's the progress we're seeing from those investments. Earlier this year, we completed the HSPA 7.2 software upgrade, making the nation's fastest mobile broadband network even faster. Now we're in the process of deploying HSPA+ to our networks. This will again allow us to increase our network speeds, and we expect the software upgrade to be completed by the end of this year.
And all the while we're making progress with our backhaul upgrades, executing a very aggressive investment and deployment program. This backhaul expansion is critical today and is the foundation for LTE. The same work has to be done to handle the massive growth in mobile broadband. What all this means for our customers is a great experience leading into LTE. We will not have the fall back issues that CDMA customers will have as they move from 4G back to CDMA Rev A speeds. Our LTE trials are currently underway in Dallas and Baltimore, with an expected launch in mid-2011 to reach 70 million to 75 million POPs by the end of next year. Customers who are excited about 4G and over the next couple of years, they will expect the smooth, fast ride to 4G, and that's what we plan to deliver. We believe this gives us a great position to continue to capture growth in mobile broadband.
Now I'd like to discuss how these network initiatives, along with subscriber and revenue growth, is impacting our Wireless margins and operating income, and those details are on Slide 12. Obviously, the record quarter for integrated device sales, which includes about 2 million incremental iPhone activations, had an impact on our Wireless service margins. Absent the costs associated with these additional activations, service more just would have been similar to last quarter. But it is important to keep in mind the long-term benefits these customers bring including lower churn, higher ARPUs and strong data growth.
In the third quarter, our Wireless OIBDA service margin was 37.6%, down from the year-earlier quarter. We believe the impact of margins will be temporary, and our expectations for total year Wireless OIBDA service margins continue to be in the low 40% range. Looking at Wireless operating income, you can see the trends that I am talking about. While the third quarter operating income was relatively flat year-over-year, year-to-date Wireless operating income is up 15% year-over-year to reach $11.8 billion.
Now let me turn and cover consumer Wireline results, starting with the U-verse update. Slide 13 has the information. We had another solid net add quarter in U-verse TV subscribers, helping drive the first year-over-year growth in consumer revenue in more than two years. We had an increase of 236,000 U-verse TV subscribers, bringing our total to 2.7 million, up more than 900,000 over the past year. Broadband and U-verse Voice over IP attach rates remain very high. More than 3/4 of U-verse subscribers have a triple- or quad-play bundle with us, and we had a very nice rebound in our total broadband adds, up about 150,000 for the quarter. This has led to improved consumer ARPUs and revenue trends. 
In the third quarter, Wireline IP revenue, and that's U-verse services plus non-U-verse broadband, grew 30%. These revenues now represent more than 42% of total Wireline Consumer revenues, up almost 1,000 basis points over just a fast year. ARPU for U-verse triple-play customers was about $160 in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year.
The U-verse TV experience continues to receive positive customer feedback. The latest J.D. Power study ranked us the highest in every region where we were ranked. We continue to add new features that take advantage of U-verse's IP TV platform. For example, we are the first U.S. TV provider to allow customers to use their Xbox 360 as a TV receiver. This replaces a need for an extra receiver and allows customers to receive chats and game invitations while watching live TV and switch seamlessly from game to TV mode.
And the U-verse Mobile app allows customers to download and watch hit TV shows and much more. It's available on four operating systems, including Android and the new Windows Phone 7. Innovations such as this has helped U-verse transform our Consumer business. We're confident this transformation and the positive impact it has on revenues will continue. Rick, that covers Wireless and Consumer, and I'll turn it back to you."

Before we close, let me provide a quick update on business customer trends on Slide 14. The fundamental trends underlying our business are consistent with what you've seen in earlier quarters this year. We're seeing continued signs of stabilization as we work our way through the economic downturn. But I think what is encouraging to us is the trends of our business customers in investing in productivity and efficiency, which helps drive growth in our strategic business products.
Revenues from these products such as Ethernet, Virtual Private Networks and application services were up again this quarter, more than 15%. And business IP revenues, overall, were up 8%. As you know, during this downturn, we've executed a clear and consistent strategy in business markets. First, we've invested right through the downturn, adding capacity reach and new capabilities. Second, we've won new business with a number of customer wins that played to both our global and mobility strengths. And third, as we work to make operations and service more seamless for customers, that's given us opportunities to improve our cost structure and grow margins through this downturn. Because of all of this, we are well positioned as the economy improves over time.
Now let's take a look at margins and cash flow, starting with consolidated margin comparisons on Slide 15. For the third quarter, consolidated operating margins were relatively stable at 17.3%, and that's despite Wireless margin pressure from integrated device sales. This reflects solid performance across the company. Our Wireline operating income margin was 12% in the third quarter. That's up from 11.2% in third quarter last year. This reflects improving revenue trends and solid execution on cost initiatives. Across the business, our total force since the end of 2009 is down by more than 15,000.
Company-wide, we have a commitment to operate as one AT&T, and that means delivering a single, seamless experience to customers for all of our Wireless and Wireline products. And as we consolidate and integrate operations, we have continuing opportunities for cost efficiencies. These initiatives are going well, and they've helped us sustain solid margins while also improving customer service.
Along with solid margins, we continue to deliver strong free cash flow. Our cash flow summary is on Slide 16. In the first three quarters of this year, cash from operations totaled $25.4 billion. Our capital expenditures were $13.7 billion, and that includes a 55% year-over-year increase in Wireless-related capital.
We continue to expect full year capital investment of $18 billion to $19 billion, although we're trending toward the upper end of that range. Free cash flow before dividends was $11.6 billion, and dividend payments totaled $7.4 billion.
Over the last six quarters, we have generated free cash flow in excess of dividends of more than $9 billion. In terms of uses of cash, debt is down almost $4 billion over the past 12 months. That gives us a debt-to-capital ratio of 37.8% and net debt to EBITDA of 1.5%. And all of this gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business and return substantial value to shareowners.
Let me close by recapping a few items on Slide 17. Again, first, we had a terrific Wireless quarter, breaking about every sales record that we track. And in addition, Ralph's team delivered continued growth in postpaid ARPU and lower churn.
We are also very pleased with our Wireline Consumer business, which achieved positive growth this quarter thanks to U-verse and the transformation those services are making in the business. Combined with continued solid cost management, this helped us deliver very strong financial results, with solid revenue and earnings growth and stable year-over-year consolidated margins, even with record Wireless device sales. Put this together with the results from the first half of the year, and you're seeing the makings of a very good 2010. Year-to-date, we're growing revenue. We're expanding margins. We're increasing earnings, and cash flow remained strong, giving us the ability to continue to invest in the business and return value to shareholders.
Brooks, I think we should stop there, and we're ready to take some questions."

First off, as Ralph mentioned in his remarks, we would expect at this point margins in Wireless to rebound and be stronger in the fourth quarter versus the 37.6% we had in third quarter. The amount of increase there and improvement is a little difficult to project at this point. It's going to be based on the volume of integrated device sales, particularly as we go through the holiday season. But even with that, I would expect margins to be a bit stronger in Wireless. One other thing that is impacting or will impact Wireless margins in the fourth quarter and probably for the next two or three quarters is the transition and conversion of the customer base that we acquired from the former Alltel properties. As we're now getting to the point where we're going to begin aggressively moving that customer base from their current network to new GSM networks to new billing systems. And in the course of doing that, we're going to have to provide that base with new devices, and there'll be subsidies involved in that. And we talked about all of that as part of the acquisition when we first announced it. But I just wanted to remind you, we're now, as we move into the fourth quarter, we're going to be getting into that period where we'll be going through that activity. But even with those, I would expect some improvement in Wireless margins. On the Wireline side, as you mentioned, John, we've had very good results in Wireline margins, and that business is going through a massive transformation as it moves increasingly from voice and legacy Data Services to U-verse to IP-based Data Services and to Managed Services. We've managed that transition, I think, very well. It's an ongoing effort here, believe me, in terms of finding ways to be more efficient in the business. And the one AT&T initiatives that I mentioned in my remarks have been a major contributor to that, and it really does involve almost an internal merger and integration of organizations, processes, systems that support Wireless and Wireline, and we have to move in that direction in order to be able to interface with customers and provide single points of contact, and that's really the way customers want to deal with us across both our Wireless and Wireline products. But at the same time, it's contributed to our ability to take a lot of costs out of the business. As we go into the fourth quarter, I would expect there to be the normal seasonal pressure that we have on Wireline margins, and you've seen that typically every year. It's a function of two or three things. One, being the fourth quarter typically has fewer business days, which affect things like long-distance revenues, for example. So it impacts both revenues and margins. We also typically have a bit higher overtime rates in the fourth quarter due to holidays and due to some of the typical seasonal weather patterns we get in some of our regions. But beyond that, we'll continue to focus on margins on the Wireline side. When you step back from all of that, our expectation is still to be for, in total, for the year, as we guided, in the low 40s in EBITDA margins for Wireless and in the lower 30s in the EBITDA margins for the Wireline business."

Let me try to size up the postpaid ARPU question for you. I mentioned in my comments that the Alltel acquisition impacted us by 40 basis points as the customers that we acquired with those properties had lower average postpaid ARPUs than those of AT&T's, so that accounts for 40 basis points. There's another 70-plus basis points that are accounted for as a result of lower regulatory fees, including the universal service fund fees and the regulatory cost recovery fees. If you put those two things together, that accounts for almost more than 100 basis points of difference. If you add that to the 2% growth that we reflected in this quarter, then it's pretty much in line with what we have been reporting for the last several quarters, somewhere north of 2% to 3% ARPU growth, and we expect that as we continue to sell more integrated devices, our base has the capability to continue to get on higher ARPUs in the coming quarters ahead."

We had another good cash flow quarter in the third quarter. And in fact, one of the things we've been very pleased with is over the last two years, as we've gone through a very difficult time, the company's continued to reduce strong cash flow, and that's given us the flexibility to continue to invest in areas where we see opportunities for growth, including doing a couple of Wireless acquisitions that we've closed in the last year. And it's also given us good, solid support for our dividend and growing the dividend, and it's allowed us to pay down debt and strengthen the balance sheet. We are sitting right now, similar to where we were last quarter about this time at kind of the upper end of our target credit metric ranges. And part of the reason we continue to stay at that kind of same range over the last quarter is because we have been absorbing the acquisition of the Alltel properties. As we go forward, as cash flow permits, I think we're going to and as we migrate solidly into our target ranges, I think then that gives us flexibility in addition to continuing to invest in the business and support the dividend, to look at some other alternatives like share repurchase. In terms of the ratings activities, we have essentially not changed our, for many, many years, our desire and commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. And I can tell you in the last six years, we have not changed essentially the credit metrics that we target to support a strong balance sheet. But each of the rating agencies look at the numbers and the results and have their own proprietary calculations and their own targets, and it's different for each one. And so we will continue to be very consistent in the metrics that we target in some cases. For example, I think the rating activity you're talking about is S&P moving us to a credit watch position. If you look at their press release when they did that two or three months ago and look at the numbers they put in that release, we would have to delever substantially to the tune of as much as $15 billion in order to hit the ranges they were targeting. And I think that's beyond the level that we are targeting in our credit metrics. So we continue to be very consistent in how we're applying that. I think that's the right way to manage the business, given the capital intensive nature of the business, the size of our business, the size of the debt portfolio. I think it's prudent, and we will continue to be consistent with that as we move firmly into our target credit metrics as I've said. That and the cash flow gives us a lot of flexibility to continue to invest where there's opportunities, to continue to support the dividend and to consider other alternatives like share repurchase."

So we like to see them sign up in record numbers like we did this past quarter. 8 million in total in terms of integrated devices.

So it will be interesting to see what customers eventually opt for.

We all always have the view that we should give the customers the choice, and that we have a wide range of devices with different price points. So if they want a low-end smartphone, that maybe doesn't have as much processing power or as much memory, they can have that.

The key, in my view, is will customers want the lower-end device. And look if they want the lower-end device, AT&T has the volume and the scale to be able to deliver to them as good as anybody in the planet. So I'm very comfortable that if that's the trend, we'll be able to offer a competitive device. But my estimation, if that happens, it will be gradually over time. It won't be a one-time event in a particular quarter, down in 2011."

In terms of capital expenditures, it's always a function of timing and demand in the business. And so as I mentioned in our remarks, I think we'll probably trend towards the upper end of the range. Our Wireless CapEx is up year-over-year about 55%. We talked about being $2 billion higher for the year this year versus last year in Wireless CapEx and year-to-date, that's about where we are. So I think everything's coming in pretty much as we expected. You did see this year a shift in our -- while the overall capital levels haven't changed dramatically, you have seen a shift between Wireline and Wireless. I think as we go into the next year or two, I think you'll continue to see some shifts there. And that's a very natural transition. It's following the shifts in the business. Wireless is nearly 50% of our revenues today. And in addition, as we look forward over the next year, we've got commercial deployment of LTE on the Wireless side. And at the end of '11, we'll be starting to wind down the primary build activities we had around U-verse. And so all of those things will contribute, as well as the trends in the business toward shifting some capital between Wireline and Wireless."

It seems like the iPhone, based on your numbers, are still kind of pulling ahead of their competitors here. I guess Droid being the main competitor. When do you think maybe that could reverse a little bit and I guess your flow anyway where the Droid and the new Microsoft phones can start to gain a little bit more share on iPhone? And then secondly, can you give a little bit more color when you upgrade to HSPA+, what the customer experience is like? Because I assume the churn on the iPhone issue is going to be largely dictated by network quality and maybe just a little bit more update on where you are with the backhaul upgrade and what will become six months from now or so?"

The development of the applications and operations systems are leading the U.S. to be at the epicenter of everything that is happening new with smartphones. And I think what you're seeing is more choices coming into the marketplace and every year, everybody's phones seem to be getting better and better and better. So I think what is happening in the industry the battle is a battle of innovation cycles, who can innovate quicker and faster based on the fact that all these OS have a very good base capability. It's all now about innovation. I've never seen innovation cycles come quicker. And so I think we're going to have the opportunity to do is to offer customers an incredible choice of applications and services based on this innovative capabilities. But if you look at Android, it has some very good and fast innovation cycles. So does Apple. Microsoft just came out, and they've already announced they're going to upgrade some things in that infrastructure and operating system in early next year. So I think it will be a race of innovation to see who can develop the most innovative products and services. And the thing that I liked about our position is we believe we believe in having a wide choice of OSs, having every single major one. So that if there's any innovation that is important to our customer base, they know that they can come to AT&T, and we'll be able to have it for them. And that's been our view. In terms of HSPA+, I think any speed that we can provide to the network to make it faster, makes all these devices faster. The beauty about it is that the faster network speeds that we're offering today make these devices really come to life. If you have a slower network, I don't think you're going to get utility out of the processing power and the memory capabilities and the video that these devices are capable of delivering. So I think our HSPA+ piece will take a one additional level and give you a fantastic experience when you have one of these processors that now have one gigahertz as a basic core processor. But what we see in the horizon is actually dual core processors, two processors as fast as one gigahertz each. So you can imagine that those devices, unless you have a really fast network, are not going to be able to deliver the best experience to our customers. So that's why I like our positioning so much that we'll have HSPA+ delivered by the end of the year. We're going to have the capability to begin the backhaul upgrades and to provide the services on a geographic basis as soon as the backhaul is complete, and when you get one of these devices with one gigahertz processor, maybe even dual processors, they're going to absolutely hum. They're just going to be awesome. And so I think those are the trends that I see in the marketplace, and we're very excited because I think it plays to our strengths."

One on handsets and devices, Ralph's exactly right, and we're seeing an unprecedented level of innovation. And it is just fun in this business, frankly, to see the innovation, the new devices, the new features that are coming out literally every quarter. But I want to make sure while it's fun to talk about all the different devices of handsets, I want to make sure that we don't lose sight of the real story here from our perspective. And the real story here is this quarter, with as large of a postpaid base as we have, well over 80% of the devices we sold into that postpaid base, both upgrades and new gross adds, were integrated devices. That's astounding, and it's huge compared to even where we were just a year ago. And I think what that speaks to is the combination of the features in these devices along with the network speeds that Ralph talked about has really facilitated a value proposition for customers and has turned the mobile phone into a mobile computing device. And increasingly, customers want to be able to access applications, access the Internet and receive content via their mobile devices. That is really the real story here. And it leaves us into a Mobile Broadband business for us that's approaching a $20 billion a year business, and a business that's growing at 25% to 30%. That's underlying it. That's the real story, and I think the opportunity for us and why we're excited about this space. And why, frankly, we continue to push integrated devices, we continue to push Data Services into our postpaid base. The other thing that I want to comment on really relates to the overall customer experience in our network as we migrate up first, as we migrated up to HSPA 7.2 and then to HSPA+ and then to LTE. I think we've got the opportunity over the next few years to offer a superior experience on these devices because to facilitate the kind of Data Services and applications and devices that we're going to have and everyone's going to have on the network and that customers want, it's going to require mobile broadband speed. And as a result, you see all the carriers rolling out 4G networks, whether they be LTE or whether they'd be WiMAX or other technologies. But everyone is working to increase speeds. The advantage that we'll have is not just in terms of the speeds available on these new 4G networks. But initially, these 4G networks are going to cover a relatively small piece of geography. And in our network, as customers move off of that geography, they're going to have a great experience in LTE as they move off of that geography. They're going to have a very, very good experience in HSPA+ across our network. And that will be an advantage versus other carriers where you will see a significant decrease in speeds when you're out of their 4G footprint."

One is you mentioned that on the Enterprise side, 70% of the customers have converted already to IP. And can you help us think about if you look at the global Enterprise revenue change whether you look at year-over-year or sequentially, how much of that can be attributed to this conversion process of moving to lower-cost IP services versus how to think about the business organically in terms of the demand for traffic in a more normal pricing environment once you get through conversion? The second part of the question was more of a strategic question. As Wireless continues to evolve and start to take share of the broadband market more substantially, in your view, does it still makes sense for Wireless and Wireline to be part of the same company? Or are there advantages over time in thinking about what Wireless can do to compete more effectively against what is the traditional Wireline business?"

Let me take a shot at those and invite Ralph to comment as well. First of all, I think when you look at our business sales and revenues and look at the various business revenue streams there, again, that's a business going through a transition. We've actually crossed the line this quarter where traditional voice revenues as part of our business revenues are down below 40% of business revenues. Increasingly, it's becoming a business driven by data, by IP-based services, Managed Services and increasingly as we go forward, as companies move more of their applications and their content into the cloud, hosting cloud computing becomes more important, as well as facilitating applications through mobile devices. And I think we're well positioned in all areas of the business where there are growth opportunities. And that's why you see strategic business service revenues continuing to grow quarter after quarter at mid-teens rates. It's why you've seen in the last several quarters IP-based data revenues increasing on the business side, getting into the upper single digit rates of growth. We're also seeing impacts in other areas, still a lot of demand for bandwidth and transport. Now the revenue streams there have been flatter more recently, but that's more a function of companies increasing their bandwidth, but at the same time, grooming their networks and moving to higher speed services. And so we're seeing both on a retail and a wholesale environment, significant demand for Ethernet in backhaul. Again, all of those areas were positioned very well. The one area that has been a drag in the business somewhat has been voice volumes, and I think we will see some improvements there. But as we require some improvement in the economy in employment and as well as on the small end of the business, in new business formations. As we see that and as the business becomes increasingly driven by IP-based services that are on a good growth trajectory, I think that, that's what gives us comfort that the overall revenues on the business side will continue to improve. And as we've talked about, we think longer term this is a GDP, GDP-plus type of growth sector for us. You asked a very good question about the importance of or the need or desire to have both Wireless and Wireline assets, given this environment. And I guess what I would say, Michael, is I think more than ever before, we think there are advantages and strengths in having a combination of Wireless and Wireline assets because that's what is required to provide the kinds of service experience that customers want. And essentially, whether you're a business customer or a consumer customer, you want the convenience of mobility and mobile access to networks and to data applications and content. And you want that over a variety of devices. That's why you see the proliferation of devices on the network from all of the connected devices that Ralph's team is selling to notebook computers to tablet computing. That's the way people want to access the network. But in order to provide the bandwidth and to provide the capacity and to provide the kind of service experience you want, you've got to drive that traffic as quickly as possible into a wired infrastructure, which improves service quality and provides significantly more bandwidth. That's why, for example, in our case, that's why we believe having the Wi-Fi infrastructure and hotspots that we have across the country and around the world are so important. So in our view, we believe to provide the kinds of services that consumers and businesses demand in the future, having both Wireless and Wireline capabilities and having an integrated carrier model is the best way to provide those services."
