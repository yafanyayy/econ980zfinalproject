Well, for Waters 2009 I think as you all realize was a very challenging year. The year of course started with a high degree of uncertainty in the midst of a global financial crisis, severe recessionary conditions. It was around the mid point of 2009 the uncertainties for our markets began to abate a little bit and a more stable but significantly weaker demand pattern emerged.
During the second half of the year demand appeared to remain fairly stable with some indications that certain segments of our end markets were potentially seeing a modest level of recovery. These second half dynamics continued through the fourth quarter and we find ourselves entering 2010 somewhat optimistic that our end markets will improve, but continuing to feel that the recovery may be slow.
Fortunately we were able to see storm clouds building in late 2008 and we adequately anticipated end market weakness as we designed our 2009 business plans. 
Early in 2009 steps were taken to tightly control spending while continuing to support critical growth programs including new product introductions. Now, with the year behind us we can appreciate the results of our business strategy as we were able to grow our earnings, generate strong free cash flow and introduce exciting new products in this most difficult demand environment.
If you look at the fourth quarter, our sales and earnings came in roughly as we had expected with currency neutral revenues just under flat and our earnings per share up 5%. Geographically, our revenues were largely in line with our expectations.
Moving down the P&L our profitability remains strong due to favorable currency translation, disciplined pricing and continued tight expense control.
On the product side, we began shipping Synapse G2 mass spectrometry system in the fourth quarter. As you will recall, this new technology system was showcased at the ASMS conference earlier in 2009 and was quickly well received by the scientific community as offering novel capabilities for a wide array of applications.
In fact, the order ramp for Synapse 2 during the second half of 2009 was stronger than for any previously introduced high end mass spec instrument from Waters, even without significant governmental stimulus orders in the U.S., a topic I’ll come back to a little later.
On the chromatography side, Acuity UPLC continued to displace HPLC system sales and now represents our most popular chromatography platform. In our view, recent competitive introductions in the UPLC product space corroborate the technology and will help accelerate the conversion of the overall LC market to proven sub two micron particle chromatography as pioneered by Waters.
Looking at customer segments in the fourth quarter, we saw a continuation of the trends from earlier in the year. The weakest segment was the chemical industry, a business that’s about 15% of our overall sales. The declines that we saw in this segment were less severe as we anniversaried the onset of the weakness that began in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Our TA instruments division has a large exposure to this industrial segment as many of their customers are involved with production of materials that find their way into automobiles and other consumer goods.
Within our TA division we saw a more moderate decline in the sales for the quarter and order flow dynamics suggest that the demand was strengthening in the quarter. These data suggest that we likely saw the low point of demand from industrial chemical customers in mid 2009 and that a modest recovery has started to materialize during the past few months.
Demand from our pharmaceutical customers modestly improved in the fourth quarter. Factors contributing to increased demand include a rebound in sales in India and small improvements in demand from CRO and generic firms.
Sales to our larger pharmaceutical accounts declined modestly in the quarter. Acuity and IN mass spectrometry continue to account for the growth in pharmaceutical demand but we have yet to see the onset of a return to historical rates of instrument replacement.
Waters sales growth in applied markets including food and environmental testing were affected by the significant business we transacted late in 2008 associated with Melamine testing primarily in Asia and Asian countries. Factoring out the effects of these sales, the applied markets represent a growing business for Waters.
Our sales to government and university labs were flat with last year. However, this result does not fully reflect the demand we saw in the quarter as we built an order backlog for multiple synapses two systems.
Interestingly, our orders and sales in the quarter did not include meaningful activity from U.S. governmental stimulus money. From our perspective, the funding of these programs has been delayed and will likely influence our business by mid 2010.
We remain optimistic that the strength of our research product offering such as our Synapse G2 and Divo Platforms will afford us a fair share of stimulus related spending.
I’d now like to focus on new product initiatives that will impact our business in 2010 and beyond. Earlier this year I discussed with you our new mass spectrometers including the Divo Series of bench top instruments and our exciting Synapse Q2 HDMS and MS systems.
Through 2009 orders and sales for these systems have ramped very nicely and we have entered 2010 with considerable business momentum. Installations of Q2 systems in the fourth quarter proceeded smoothly and we look forward to presentations at this year’s AMSM conference in Utah that will highlight the performance and advantages of G2 technology for a wide range of applications.
2010 and should be an exciting year for Waters and mass spectrometry. As some industry participants work their way through new management structures, and sort out new strategies, we plan to execute our established product and market plans. Our focus will be on continuous innovation and in 2010 we plan to introduce new mass spectrometry systems that will push the performance envelope while broadening the attractiveness of MS technology to a wider base of customers.
On the chromatography front, I’ve spoken to you about the dramatic impact of Acuity UPLC on numerous occasions and earlier this morning, I mentioned that UPLC now accounts for most of our chromatography shipments.
Since introduction in 2004, Acuity has allowed hundreds of organization around the globe to realize improved data quality, increased sample throughput and reduced costs per analysis. With all the proven benefits of Acuity UPLC, many have been quick to embrace UPLC technology.
However, many more have been attracted by the promise of UPLC but remain reluctant to change largely because of their comfort level with existing HPLC systems and techniques. In our industry there is no substitute for working with thousands of UPLC customers to gain insights for product improvements and the ideas for next generation systems and it’s in that light that I want to tell you about our new Acuity UPLC H Class system that we’ve just introduced this week.
Working closely with our customers, we saw the need to provide a bridge to UPLC performance that builds upon the wide spread knowledge and comfort laboratories have with HPLC operation. We feel that Acuity UPLC H Class is this bridge and it has been designed to fulfill the needs of mainstream customers, especially those working in method development and routine analysis laboratories.
It does this by combining UPLC performance with the operational familiarity of traditional HPLC, a combination of high performance and simplicity that we believe will facilitate adoption by a broader range of industries, applications and operators, all of whom will realize the scientific and work flow benefits of UPLC.
I encourage you to visit our website for a detailed description of our new Acuity UPLC H Class as well descriptions of our complete family of application Acuity Systems.
Before turning you over to John for a more detailed review of our financials, I want to share some thoughts about 2010 and reiterate some of our key business strategies.
Looking at the competitive landscape of the strength of our product portfolio in 2010, I believe that we’ve never been in a stronger product position. Our strategy of focusing on our technological strengths and staying close to our customer base has allowed us to protect and growth our market share and deliver superior financial results even in these difficult economic times.
2009 was one of those difficult times and yet we were able to grow our earnings per share and introduce exciting new products. I believe that 2010 will be a better year for Waters than 2009. Most signs suggest that the worst of the recession, in our markets at least, is behind us and that demand for our products should increase.
However, we feel that there is ample reason to manage our business cautiously as we are not expecting a dramatic change in economic conditions and do expect that there may be some lumpiness to the recovery.
Accordingly, we will continue to manage our expenses closely while we follow a proven plan for the deployment of capital. 
In 2010 we will continue on the path of globalizing our manufacturing operations that further balances our production capacity with global demand patterns for our products. This strategy provides us with high quality, cost effective manufacturing in tax favored jurisdictions.
Lastly, we anticipate continuing to look for acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our history on this front; smaller technologically focused targets with growth and profitability profiles that are in line with our current business.
We expect that 2010 will be another year of free cash flow, providing us the resources to continue our multi year share repurchase program. 
With that, I’d like to turn it over to John for a closer look at our financials.

Fourth quarter sales increased by 3% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.12 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.07 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.08 this quarter compared to $1.01 last year.",1035,"Thank  you Doug. Good morning. Fourth quarter sales increased by 3% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.12 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.07 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.08 this quarter compared to $1.01 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.
Looking at our Q4 sales results, sales were up 3% this quarter with currency translation providing four points of growth. Without the benefit of currency translation, sales were down 1% versus prior year. Acquired businesses added about two points of growth this quarter.
Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales in the U.S. and Japan were up 1% and 7% respectively. In Europe sales declined by 5% and in Asia, sales were down 3% against a strong base of comparison which included shipments related to Melamine testing requirements in 2008.
Turning to the product front within the Waters Division, instrument system sales were flat and recurring revenues due to fewer selling days this quarter declined by 1%. Within our TA Instruments Division, sales declined by 7% versus prior year.
Now I would like to comment on our non-GAAP financial performance. Gross margin came in at 60.3% this quarter which is up 140 basis points from Q4 last year. Gross margins benefited from favorable product mix, product cost reductions and foreign currency translation.
SG&A expenses increased 6% this quarter compared to prior year and R&D expenses increased by 1%. 
Our full year operating effective tax rate came in at 18.4%, down modestly from Q3 as a result of a shift of income into lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, Q4’s pre tax income was effective at 17.1%.
On the balance sheet, cash and short term investments totaled $630 million and debt totaled $632 million bringing us to a net debt position of $2 million.
On the stock buy back front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market and during the fourth quarter we purchased 907,000 shares of our common stock for $54 million. For the full year, we purchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $210 million.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any non cash tax benefit from FAS123 accounting and excluding unusual non recurring items. 
Q4 free cash flow was $112 million after funding $13 million of CapEx adding back $5 million of FAS123R benefits. For the full year, free cash flow was $341 million after funding $94 million of CapEx and adding back $5 million of FAS123R benefits and excluding $12 million of payments associated with a litigation provision and lease settlement.
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 67 days this quarter, up three days from Q4 last year and inventories were up about $5 million from year end last year, largely due to currency translation.
Looking at 2010, we currently expect economic conditions to marginally improve as we move through the year. Geographically we expect that Asia will continue to see overall favorable business conditions and provide solid growth in 2010. In the U.S., Europe and Japan we expect to see gradual improvements across the area as these geographies begin to lift out of recession and grow modestly in 2010.
Product wise we feel we have a strong line up across our technology platforms and are well positioned in our end markets as we begin the year. From a customer segment perspective, we expect 2010 to see sluggish performance from our industrial base customers, mid single digit growth from our broadly defined pharmaceutical customers and near double digit growth from our government and academic customers heavily affected by stimulus spending.
Overall this should provide for mid single digit growth before currency effects. Currency at today’s levels should add about a point to sales growth in 2010. Currency comparisons to sales growth for the quarter we base the comparison will start off more favorable early in the year and become more difficult as the year progresses.
Now I would like to comment on our expectations for non-GAAP financial performance in 2010. Gross margins were heavily affected by foreign currency translation in 2009 which will provide a difficult base of comparison this year. We currently expect margins to start off the year at around 59% and end the year over 60%. These more difficult currency comparisons will provide slower than average EPS growth in the first half of the year.
On the expense front, our efforts to control costs during 2009 again creates a difficult comparison and while we will continue to be cautious on spending, we currently expect that SG&A and R&D will grow at about the same rate as sales as we make modest investments to support growth in our businesses, specifically in our Asian geographies.
On the tax front, during 2010 we anticipate upward pressure on the tax rate from continued success of our high end mass spec products manufactured in the U.K. and downward pressure from the transfer of additional production to Singapore.
At this time, these effects look to principally offset each other and we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at around 18.5%.
A continuation of our buy back efforts should provide for a full year of fully diluted share count of around 93.5 million shares. Interest costs are expected to rise somewhat this year and we expect to have about $12 million of net interest expense in 2010.
Non-GAAP EPS for the full year 2010 are currently expected to be between $3.70 and $3.85 per fully diluted share. 
Free cash flow is expected to remain strong and should approach $400 million in 2010. 
For Q1, we expect mid single digit sales growth for currency translation effects and currency translation at today’s levels would add about three points of growth. Gross margin as a percentage of sales will have the most difficult comparison in Q1 and is expected to be around 59% this quarter. Expenses are expected to grow a bit less than sales for the quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.79 per fully diluted share.

I also read the DuPont news morning. They seem to have clearly turned the corner there. That’s a good sign.
TA also saw some underlying improvement in terms of the attitudes of their major customers, their quote rates and in fact, their business rates, so that is a pretty good barometer of the industrial marketplace and they’re feeling cautiously optimistic that that’s continuing as we move into the new year.
So I think there are some good signs. We also see counter signs that they’re very tight with their capital spending. I still think we’re going to see a lot of these big companies in both industrial arena and pharmaceutical arena be slow to open the purse strings in the new year and they’re probably going to wait as it’s become somewhat traditional a little on in the year before they see any major capital releases.

Some of that actually happened in the fourth quarter as you would expect because in order to introduce it now, we had to have fulfillment literature and training etc. all in place to be able to launch this.
You can clearly hear our excitement over this new system and we do think it is a very important, exciting launch. On the other hand, I also have to tell you, we’re being fairly cautious in terms of the net overall impact on our business.
So there’s clearly a little bit of a dichotomy there because we have to look at cannibalization. We have to look at the speed of the uptick and so I suppose it’s fair to say we talk a little bit out of both sides of our mouth here. But trust me that we really think this is an important introduction and an important system for us.
Typically, the way companies and Waters business mode in some years past is that you’re really struggling to get a new product to pick on and a typical launch pattern is, you’ve got the product, you’re confident about being able to ship it sometime at the end of the first quarter, you launch it, but you’re still struggling to build inventory and to get the product out there, so you don’t have a very strange order pattern that you can’t fulfill at the end of a quarter.
But that’s always a struggle and trust me, over 30 years in this industry, we’ve talked about it enough and talked to competitors enough to say that’s a pretty typical pattern.
What we do with the H Class is the total fulfillment is done. The training is done. Inventories are now ready to ship and we’ve actually begun to take real orders for the H Class. This is very unusual for a launch of this magnitude so that’s why we launched it when we did.
It was ready. We’re ready to ship it by the end of the first quarter. We’re not going to be in a position to have a large build backlog. Art’s chastising me in the background here when I said by the end of the quarter. Orders taken now will ship in 30 days. That’s our quote pattern.
So we’re very comfortable with it. This launch pattern has been as smooth and as on time as I’ve ever seen in my history here. So we have high expectations. You don’t necessarily see that because of this whole level of confusion in the economic pattern and some of our customers, so if we’re right, I think long term this is going to stimulate our growth rate.

It should be a more, we shouldn’t have the calendar irregularities in 2010 that we had, although we still have the fact that we had the first quarter of last year with the outsize number of selling days, but the calendar itself in 2010 is pretty consistent.
So right now we’ve got a very strong launch pattern in new chemistries, particularly in the new Acuity product line that we’re very enthusiastic about and we think that should deliver that mid single digit growth rate.
In terms of the new system, the great advantage of the H Class is that it allows customers to adopt UPLC at their own pace and allows them to run the traditional system, methods the way they wanted to at the same time being able to lead them on to the greener pastures of UPLC capabilities.
To the extent that they adopt UPLC, we’re highly confident that they will be buying our UPLC chemistries. To the extent that they run HPLC methods, on of the advantages of this is that they can run their existing chemistries. So if they’re on Waters chemistries, they’re likely to continue to run that.
Probably in the early phase of this, it probably doesn’t dramatically change market share dynamics in the consumables business. In the later stages as we think this movement to UPLC it should improve the growth rate even further in UPLC chemistries.

I think one of the hurdles we face as a lot of companies do I think is that we reacted so quickly and took significant steps to sustain our profitability in 2009 that it was unlikely that you continue all of those steps as you move forward into 2010.
The dynamic of that is, you have to make up some ground in terms of salaries, merit increases, commissions, that you took out in 2009.

Unequivocally Acuity columns continue to grow at a very strong pace so our model here that we have more of a razor and blade model with UPLC is clearly playing out. What we’re seeing in terms of our overall consumables business in 2009 is much more related to fewer samples being run in the traditional marketplace, inventories coming down in the sample prep world particularly in places like India where they dramatically reduced inventories.
We’re beginning to see some sign that’s turning around but I think 2009 was a pretty aggressive inventory management cycle.

We’re taking HPLC which ran at 3,000 PSI up to as high as 15,000 PSI and we’re taking the columns particle size down from three microns, five microns down to sub two. So the big question in the world is how can you maintain the robustness of the system.
So when we designed both the Acuity instrumentation and the column, they were designed hand in hand. The instrumentation contains capabilities that actually monitor the column and it’s what has given the Acuity columns the reputation of being equal but in even more cases, more robust than the traditional UPLC column.
The column itself has electronic devices that actually connect to the Acuity system. It tells you what’s going on in the system. It tells you what’s going on at the separation. So think of this as a fully integrated system.
The traditional HPLC column was a free standing device. It got connected. There was no real system based interfacing between the column and the system. The customers immediately realized this and the psychology in the marketplace right now is that there is no viable chemistry alternative at this time that gives you this whole system’s approach.
And even those companies that are coming in trying to sell instrumentation, for all intents and purposes the viable approach of trying to attach an Acuity column to their system, but they lack all the documentation, the information, the element that has made this combination so powerful in the marketplace.
So for the moment we’re finding very high compliance. Column utilization for Acuity run greater than 90%. The traditional HPLC for almost everybody in the marketplace, 10% to 20% of your columns are used on your system because of the long term availability of all sorts of different columns.
We’ve really changed the game in this marketplace and at least for the moment, it looks like its going to get stronger before it gets weaker.

I would think that the high end G2 is likely to move our mass spec growth a few points perhaps overall as it continues to hopefully grow near double digit as we make our way across the quarters. Certainly the early indications based on order backlog and customer interest would suggest that’s true. 
On the LC side I would say that Acuity even in a poor year, 2009, grew nicely and I think this transition product that we now have that really begins to help people transition from HPLC to UPLC should expand the base against which we can grow our LC products. It’s hard to say what cannibalization will be of perhaps some of the HPLC products, but I think net net , looking at the new product  driving at least some single digit growth for HPLC, for LC in total makes sense.

That might be why you see some elements of technology getting a little bit earlier releases than others. We’re told that particularly the mass spectrometry reviews have largely been completed and that those authorizations are in process and we should begin to see orders late in the first quarter into the second quarter. 
Whether you see orders that can be fulfilled and make their way to shipment, probably that’s more second quarter weighted rather than first.

We do have on the one hand additionally this new product launch. We’re taking orders. We’ll be shipping on that front as well, but we need to be a little cautious and transition to that new product.

It’s very hard to imagine that in the long run they can invest the money to compete across this line on both the engineering requirements to provide UPLC. More and more the data requirements, particularly the important integrated HPLC and UPLC data with mass spectrometry data, so the competitive issue I think really make it tough, and I expect that you’ll see that over the next couple of years.
That’s not to say all competitors can’t do that. There are a few who clearly can. But I think it does mean that the strong get stronger, so I think that has a competitive impact in the industry.
I don’t think in terms of capacity, the capacity in this industry isn’t bricks and mortar. It’s much more of a product cycle capacity than it is, and I think we are at the front end of that cycle right now.  I think we’re in good shape.

The great advantage of UPLC is that in many of these high volume applications, you can replace two or three instruments, traditional instruments with one of ours.
And now we’re going to give them the ability to make that transition much easier by starting off on a HPLC and quickly using the same instrument to ramp up to UPLC’s capabilities. So I think it’s a product that fits dramatically well with the needs of our customer base.
Now to be fair, Acuity did some of that, but it wasn’t easy to make that transition in these regulated applications, particularly in QC. We think that’s what H Class does extraordinarily well and should motivate a more rapid transition in these high volume applications.
I think the other thing that you’re going to see this year, certainly from us is a continuation of this continuous improvement in mass spectrometry. The G2 is not the last innovative mass spec that you’re going to see from us in the next 12 months and the technological playing field probably moves more attractively for us as we get through 2010.
We’ve got a number of industry participants who are going through their own structural reassessments or merger activity on their own. I think all in makes us a more, I think the competitive environment is tilted in our favor a little bit more in 2010.

Well, our results in the first quarter I think signify continued improvement in customer demands and also stronger reacceptance of our key new products. But we’re not totally prepared to believe that the economic conditions that have challenged industries since late 2008 are fully behind us. We are increasingly optimistic about our business prospects for 2010 and are very excited about out strong product division.
The difficult business conditions in 2009 required us to improve our operational efficiency and with these efficiency still in place improving end markets in 2010 should allow us to transition toward our more traditional sales growth rates in 2011 and beyond.
Turning to first quarter 2010, our organic sales growth with 6%, and we delivered 9% adjusted earnings per share growth. And however more important, we executed well on our new product initiatives most notably, our new Synapt G-2 and our H-Class ACUITY UPLC systems.
Demand for our Synapt G-2 has been strong and we successfully delivered and installed the record number of Synapt class mass spectrometers in the first quarter. Sales of new Synapt instruments was strongest in North America, Europe and Japan. Key application areas of Synapt continued to be in proteomics and metabolite identification. However, we have more recently begun to see uptake by customers in organic synthesis and central analytical labs and pharmaceutical, academic and industrial accounts. 
On decision to introduce the H-Class ACUITY UPLC early in 2010 helped to drive order growth in LC instrumentation an important. Our H-Class UPLC system was designed based on consistent customer feedback regarding key performance features required to accelerate UPLC uptake and regulated testing applications.
As you may recall we introduced this new instruments configuration in late January and gained customer shipments in early February. Though significant new launches often result in the delay of orders as customers reevaluate and modify their purchasing plan to adequately consider a new system offerings. Our positioning of the H-Class appears to have resulted in a little disruption of our sales momentum while setting the stage for an acceleration of the equity business as we move through 2010.
Some of our largest equity users, companies that have globally deployed UPLC instruments through the development organizations have told us that they are now more confident of transferring UPLC technology throughout their quality control labratories.
For many this new outlook is based upon new H-Class instrument features that allow for the running of legacy HPLC methodologies while providing an easy upgrades path to UPLC performance. With the introduction of the H-Class, overall interest in UPLC has significantly increased. We see this in seminar attendance and requests for customer demonstration and then our lead and quotation volumes. Most interesting we have started to see new orders in sales from competitive uses. We have been motivated to try small particle chromatography but it has not been sufficiently confident to move forward until they learned about our new H-Class UPLC.
With in our Waters division recurring revenue sales that is the combination of our service and chromatography chemicals businesses performs about as expected and grew in the mid single-digit range. We expect this trend to continue through 2010 with the chemicals business growing a bit faster than the service business.
Sales of our TA Instruments division grew a little faster than those for the Waters division with strong performance across TA lines of thermal analysis, rheometry and biocalorimetry systems. Given TA’s heavy exposure to the economically sensitive chemical industry its sale growth and even stronger double-digit orders growth are indicative of the recovery and our industrial end markets and as TA’s continued strong product positions. 
Business activity for TA as indicated by sales leads and quotes for new instruments appears to be continually improving and sales growth for the division is likely to accelerate in future quarters. Sales to industrial accounts for the Waters Division were also positive in the first quarter. We have historically included sales to the chemical, food and environmental testing industries within our broadly defined industrial segments. Within these sub-segments chemical and environmental sales were strong in the quarter, while food testing growth was effected negatively by a strong Asian Melamine Testing business in the base quarter’s comparison. Pharmaceutical segment sales in the first quarter grew at about the same rate as our overall sales growth. We look across the segment and we benefited from a recovery of sales to generic firms in India and strength globally from generic CRO at specialty pharmaceutical accounts. 
As we expected merger activity among certain our larger pharmaceutical customers affected their purchases from us in the quarter. However, we are encouraged that recent feedback from some of largest accounts indicated that an instrument replacement cycle, especially in light of our their excitement from our ACUITY H-Class UPLC launch maybe on the horizon. 
And look at our business geographically, sales in the quarter was strongest in Asia with India and Japan driving the lion’s share of the improvement. As you will recall, last year we endured a very difficult first half performance in India as a severe devaluation of the rupee helped depress demand for dollar denominated laboratory instruments. In Japan, strong sales to academic institutions primarily for research mass spectrometry systems resulted in solid double-digit revenue growth.
Our sales growth in China was consistent with our overall mid single digit sales performance and was as I mentioned earlier affected by strong Melamine sales in the 2009 quarter’s results. Factoring the Melamine business out of the quarter’s results sales would have been up a strong double-digit rate. And that’s an encouraging factor to consider as Melamine related comparisons should not be a factor of future quarters.
Looking ahead towards the second quarter and full year 2010 will be an exiting year for new product launches, I’ve already reviewed the ACQUITY H-Class introduction and I am pleased to now tell you that significant new mass spectrometry base systems are planned for the upcoming ASMS conference in Salt Lake City. We expect that this year’s ASMS will be just as exiting as last year’s when we showcase the Synapt G-2 HDMS system. With the improving demand pattern that’s emerging this year and our commitment to overall cost containment, we’re expecting another year of strong free cash flow.
As we have for the past several years, we’ll continue to deploy our cash to its smaller acquisitions and our share repurchase program. They are off to a strong start in 2010 with a $100 million deployed for stock repurchases in the first quarter.
So in closing I would like to say that we are encouraged by the trends that we see developing in 2010. Furthermore, we are confident that with our strong product portfolio and broad access to growth markets, we are very well positioned to benefit from a continued global economic recovery and for an ongoing opportunity to deliver industry leading top line and bottom line performance.
Now here is John to take you through more detailed financial analysis.

36475,100777750,57990,"Waters Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Waters Corporation","Executives","Thank you Doug and good morning. First quarter sales increased by 10%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.81 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.74 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings was $0.79 this quarter compared to $0.75 last yea",940,"Thank you Doug and good morning. First quarter sales increased by 10%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.81 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.74 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings was $0.79 this quarter compared to $0.75 last year. 
A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning. Reviewing Q1 sales results compared to Q1 last year sales were up 10%
this quarter with currency translation representing 4% of this increase.
Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. and Europe were up 2% sales within Japan were up 22% and the sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%.
Turning to the product front within the Waters division, instrument system sales increased by 7% recurring revenues grew by 6% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments Division, sales increased by 8% versus prior year.
Now I would like to comment on our Q1 non-GAAP reported financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance was larger than originally anticipated this quarter and came in at 60.3%, the company continues to benefit from manufacturing cost reductions and more significant foreign currency translation benefits than expected.
The combination of the relative strength of the yen and weakness of the British pounds versus the U.S. dollar had a beneficial impact on our gross margin percentage based on our geographical sales and production mix. We experienced a similar and even more pronounced currency impact in Q1 of 2009 and this accounts for the year-over-year decline in gross margin percentage.
Going forward, the 2009 base of comparison becomes more favorable and we expect to see year-over-year growth in gross margin percentage in future quarters. SG&A expenses increased 8% this quarter compared to prior year and R&D increased by 10% this quarter as we prepared for new product releases later this year.
Income taxes came in on planned of about 18.5%, we are on track for the transfer of additional LC production to Singapore later this year which helps to lower our tax rate, but the success of our Synapt systems manufactured in the UK puts upward pressure on our effective tax rate. Our present view has not changed from January and we expect these effects to principally offset each other and then our full year effective tax rate will remain around 18.5%.
However that is depended upon many new product introductions and manufacturing transfers that could bring some variation into the picture as yield unfolds. On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $692 million and debt totaled $712 million bringing us to a net debt position of about $20 million.
Earlier in the quarter, we took advantage of improving capital markets and diversified our debt structure by entering into an agreement to issue $200 million of notes in a private placement to qualified investors. 100 million of the notes were a 3.75 coupon for a five-year term and another $100 million of notes were a 5% coupon for a ten year team.
On the stock buyback front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market and during the first quarter we purchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $101 million. 
We defined free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures plus any non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non recurring items.
For Q1, pre-cash flow was $95 million after funding $11 million of CapEx and adding back $2 million of non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. This strong start for the year allowed us to accelerate our buyback program and put this on a path to approach $400 of free cash flow this year.
Comparable free cash flow in Q1 last was $64 million. Accounts receivable day sales outstanding stood at 78 days this quarter comparable to Q1 last year and inventories were up about $10 million from year end as is typical at this point in the year. 
Overall our Q1 results were somewhat stronger than anticipated in January, many of our end markets improved as the quarter progressed and they appear to be on track to continue to do so, we presently expect our currency neutral sales to grow between 5 and 7% for the full year 2010. Currency translation based on current rates looks to be about neutral the sales growth for the full year. 
Moving down the P&L gross margins continued to be favorably affected by product cost reductions and foreign currency translation given the relative weakness of the pound instead of the yen. Additionally product mix is favorable to margins and our new products are performing well early in the production ramp up, given these factors we now expect full- year gross margins to be up by about 75 basis points versus 2009.
Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate almost equal to sales. We expect our operating tax rate to be about 18.5% and net interest expense is expected to be approximately $13.5 million. And our fully diluted average outstanding share count for the full year 2010 is currently estimated to be about 93.5 million shares. 
Rolling all of this together we currently expect Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.85 to $4 per share. For Q2 we expect our currency neutral sales to grow around 7%. At current exchange rates, currency translation should increase sales by about 1% bringing our reported sales growth to 8%. At this sales level non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter are expected to be between $0.86 and $0.96. Doug?

I refer to it as what is it either 0 lag notch where when we announced the product we started shipping potentially immediately. We had trained the sales force we had the marketing literature already that was introduced typically, introduced these platforms kind of licensed to get the Pittcon and then your shipping by the end of the subsequent quarter. This was you know and so part of it is just the way, our businesses evolve so we were very happy first of all with our ability to drive the developments and the manufacturing to the point where we are able to do that.
Then I would say the most interesting dynamic I think has been with competitive accounts we knew we had some early indication in some of our classic Waters accounts about the reaction to it, we clearly aiming this technology and trying to bring a faster uptake curve into the QA regulated the applications part of our business and taking this instrument into competitive accounts has been very, very positive.
So I think that’s probably the early indication, the other thing I think is we commented on that often times you introduced a new platform like this and the immediate response you see is delay because customers are used to buying your old products and they kind of put things on hold to evaluate and sometimes they run new systems through months of evaluation studies I am sure we saw some of that, but overall the net effect was really a positive effect rather than a delayed effect.

And for intents and purposes replaced the traditional HPLC marketplace, while at the same time taking into consideration a large installed base HPLC that have been in play for 30 years. And so we really took our time we focused on the customer needs we delivered a product that probably is, hits the mark so precisely in terms of what customers were asking for and now seeing it’s hard to argue with something that you said if you do this we’ll buy it and so we’re experiencing this and the beauty of it is the demonstration units are in place there is no delay on delivery. It utilizes the same broad systems chemistry solution we’ve had out for six years. So its really the experience that we've had with paying off for us on this strategy.

I think the thing that keep us from being maybe slightly more optimistic at this point is waiting to be sure that overall the developed markets in the United States and in Western Europe can show sustainable strength pockets there is that the industrial markets there but [big] Pharma is still going through some of the merger pains.

Overall, I would say our more interesting dynamics is the early indicators of request for demonstrations, request for quotes, quote activity and some of them the soft and more intangible that I think are much stronger than we anticipated would be at this stage of the game. So that’s the kind of momentum that I think, it doesn’t result in sales in the first quarter but we’re optimistic we could gain for stronger sales as we go forward.
We also in the first quarter, this quarter ended with the Easter season you had Good Friday, that always throws a little confusion particularly at the areas like Western Europe and the more traditional religious areas and we didn’t have that last year, it’s always a guess as to how much that affects your order activity lots of strong orders coming in the next week. So you know again intangible dealing that you know its all pretty good going forward.

But it doesn't sound like it changed a lot and it sounds like you still expect this to be a year where you spend a little bit more operationally than the norm. So what's changed here? Is it really the revenue number? Is it gross margin, or should we be a little bit more positive when it comes to modeling out non-operational items?

Yes, we are continuing to make investments small investments in headcount where we need to will continue to do that. So, we are not going to see a significant gap in the growth of our expenses versus the top line but that’s no different than what we have said in January. 
Currency for the full year is a little bit less of the top line benefit but offsetting that and more is the fact that we did move the organic growth from what we defined as mid single digit four to six to five to seven. 
So, it’s little bit here and there that basically say that you know the incremental profitability that we saw out of the business in the first quarter principally continues for the next three and that comes pretty close to the full year increase that, you’ve seen in the guidance for the EPS.

And I would say that, that model is likely to be what we’ll continue to say going forward beyond this year because of as you pointed out because of investments that we need to make this year and this year being kind of a year of recovery on the spend line is not likely to be quite as much leverage, I don't think the expenses go exactly the same rate of sales, but there is not likely to be the full one or two points of differential.

So what we’re really looking at is its while we are selling H-Class to the people who have very little exposure to UPLC at all its probably less than a quarter of the sales, so both of the sales are really the early adopters testing it, verifying it, setting up an understanding with the technology coming to us and say here are the areas within our corporation that we want to utilize this technology. But here the attributes I think is different from that than for us this is the new purchase traditionally those design to us early adaptors get a very broad versatility, full capability research type view of the product, here is what's required of people in methods development, quality control, while routine applications what typical HPLCs user would look to attributes that, emulate more of our Alliance products than the full research grade.

Well, our results in the first quarter, I think, signify a continued improvement in customer demand and also strong early acceptance of our key new products. Though we are not totally prepared to believe that the economic conditions that have challenged industries since late 2008 are fully behind us, we are increasingly optimistic about our business prospects in 2010 and are very excited about our strong new product positions. The difficult business conditions in 2009 required us to improve our operational efficiency, and with these efficiencies still in place, improving end markets in 2010 should allow us to transition toward our more traditional sales growth rates in 2011 and beyond. 
Turning to the first quarter of 2010, our organic sales growth was 6%, and we delivered 9% adjusted earnings per share growth. And however, more important, we executed well on our new product initiatives, most notably, our new SYNAPT G2 and our H-Class ACQUITY UPLC systems. Demand for our SYNAPT G2 has been strong, and we successfully delivered and installed a record number of SYNAPT class mass spectrometers in the first quarter. Sales of new SYNAPT instruments were strongest in North America, Europe and in Japan. Key application areas for SYNAPT continue to be in proteomics and metabolite identification. However, we have more recently begun to see uptick by customers in organic synthesis and central analytical labs, in pharmaceutical, academic and industrial accounts.
Our decision to introduce the H-Class ACQUITY UPLC  early in 2010 helped to drive order growth in LC [liquid chromatography] instrumentation in the quarter. Our H-Class UPLC system was designed based on consistent customer feedback regarding key performance features required to accelerate UPLC uptake and regulated testing applications. 
As you may recall, we introduced this new instrument configuration in late January and began customer shipments in early February. Those significant new launches often result in the delay of orders, as customers reevaluate and modify their purchasing plan to adequately consider a new system offering. Our positioning of the H-Class appears to have resulted in a little disruption of our sales momentum while setting the stage for an acceleration of ACQUITY business as we move through 2010.
Some of our largest ACQUITY users, companies that have globally deployed UPLC instruments through the development organizations have told us that they are now more confident of transferring UPLC technology throughout their quality control laboratories. For many, this new outlook is based upon new H-Class instrument features that allow for the running of legacy HPLC methodologies while providing an easy upgrade path to UPLC performance. With the introduction of the H-Class, overall interest in UPLC has significantly increased. We see these in seminar attendance and requests for customer demonstrations and in our lead and quotation volumes. Most interesting, we have started to see new orders and sales from competitive users who have been motivated to try small particle chromatography but have not been sufficiently confident to move forward until they learned about our new H-Class UPLC. 
Within our Waters division, recurring revenue sales, that is the combination of our Service and Chromatography Chemicals businesses, performed about as expected and grew in the mid single-digit range. We expect this trend to continue through 2010 with the Chemicals business growing a bit faster than the Service business.
Sales of our [ph] (25:19) TA Instruments division grew a little faster than those at the large division, with strong performance across TA's lines of thermal analysis, rheometry and biocalorimetry system. Given TA's heavy exposure to the economically sensitive chemical industry, its sales growth and even stronger double-digit orders growth are indicative of a recovery in our industrial end markets and of TA's continued strong product positions. Business activity for TA, as indicated by sales leads and quotes for new instruments, appears to be continually improving, and sales growth for the division is likely to accelerate in future quarters. 
Sales to industrial accounts for the Waters division were also positive in the first quarter. We have historically included sales to the chemical, food and environmental testing industries within our broadly defined Industrial segment. Within these subsegments, chemical and environmental sales were strong in the quarter while food testing growth was affected negatively by strong Asian Melamine Testing business in the base quarter comparisons. 
Pharmaceutical segment sales in the first quarter grew at about the same rate as our overall sales growth. We look across the segment and we benefited from a recovery of sales, the generic firms in India and strength globally from generic, CRO and specialty pharmaceutical accounts. 
As we have expected, merger activity among certain of our larger pharmaceutical customers affected their purchases from us in the quarter. However, we are encouraged by recent feedback from some of our largest accounts indicated that an instrument replacement cycle, especially in light of their excitement from our ACQUITY H-Class UPLC launch, may be on the horizon. 
Looking at our business geographically, sales in the quarter was strongest in Asia, with India and Japan driving the lion's share of the improvement. As you will recall, last year, we endured a very difficult first half performance in India as the severe devaluation of the rupee helped depress demand for dollar-denominated laboratory instruments. In Japan, strong sales to academic institutions, primarily for research mass spectrometry systems, resulted in solid double-digit revenue growth. Our sales growth in China was consistent with our overall mid-single-digit sales performance and was, as I mentioned earlier, affected by strong melamine sales in the 2009 quarters' results. Factoring the Melamine business out of the quarter's results, sales would have been up a strong double-digit rate, and that's an encouraging factor to consider as melamine-related comparisons should not be a factor in future quarters. 
Looking ahead towards the second quarter and full year, 2010 will be an exciting year for new product launches. I've already reviewed the ACQUITY H-Class introductions, and I'm pleased to now tell you that significant new mass spectrometry-based systems are planned for the upcoming ASMS Conference in Salt Lake City. We expect that this year's ASMS will be just as exciting as last year's when we showcased the SYNAPT G2 HDMS systems. With the improving demand pattern that's emerging this year and our commitment to overall cost containment, we are expecting another year of strong free cash flow. As we have for the past several years, we will continue to deploy our cash to smaller acquisitions and our share repurchase program. We're off to a strong start in 2010 with $100 million deployed for stock repurchases in the first quarter.
So in closing, I'd like to say that we are encouraged by the trends that we see developing in 2010. Furthermore, we are confident that with our strong product portfolio and broad access to growth markets, we are very well-positioned to benefit from a continued global economic recovery and for an ongoing opportunity to deliver industry-leading topline and bottom line performance. Now here's John to take you through a more detailed financial analysis."
36475,100777750,58221,"Waters Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Waters Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. First quarter's sales increased by 10%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.81 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.74 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.79 this quarter compared to $0.75 las",943,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning. First quarter's sales increased by 10%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.81 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.74 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.79 this quarter compared to $0.75 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.
Reviewing Q1 sales results compared to Q1 last year, sales were up 10% this quarter with currency translation representing 4% of this increase. Looking at our sales growth, geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. and Europe were up 2%, sales within Japan were up 22%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%. 
Turning to the product front, within the Waters division, instrument system sales increased by 7% and recurring revenues grew by 6% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, sales increased by 8% versus prior year.
Now I would like to comment on our Q1 non-GAAP recorded financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance was stronger than originally anticipated this quarter and came in at 60.3%. The company continues to benefit from manufacturing cost reductions and more significant foreign currency translation benefits than expected. The combination of the relative strength of the yen and weakness of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar had a beneficial impact on our gross margin percentage based on our geographical sales and production mix. We experienced a similar and even more pronounced currency impact in Q1 of 2009, and this accounts for the year-over-year decline in gross margin percentage. Going forward, the 2009 base of comparison becomes more favorable, and we expect to see year-over-year growth in gross margin percentage in future quarters. 
SG&A expenses increased 8% this quarter compared to prior year, and R&D increased by 10% this quarter as we prepare for new product releases later this year. Income taxes came in on plan at about 18.5%. We are on track for the transfer of additional LC production to Singapore later this year, which helps to lower our tax rate, but the success of our SYNAPT systems manufactured in the UK puts upward pressure on our effective tax rate. Our present view has not changed from January, and we expect these effects to principally offset each other and that our full year effective tax rate will remain around 18.5%. However, that is dependent upon many new product introductions and manufacturing transfers that could bring some variation into the picture as the year unfolds.
On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $692 million, and debt totaled $712 million bringing us to a net debt position of about $20 million. Earlier in the quarter, we took advantage of improving capital markets and diversified our debt structure by entering into an agreement to issue $200 million of notes in a private placement to qualified investors. $100 million of the notes bear a 3.75% coupon for a five-year term, and another $100 million of notes bear a 5% coupon for a 10-year term. 
On the stock buyback front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market, and during the first quarter, we purchased $1.7 million shares of our common stock for $101 million. We define free cash flow, as cash from operations less capital expenditures, plus any non-cash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. For Q1, free cash flow was $95 million after funding $11 million of CapEx and adding back $2 million of non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. This strong start of the year allowed us to accelerate our buyback program and puts us on a path to approach $400 million of free cash flow this year. Comparable free cash flow in Q1 last year was $64 million.
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 78 days this quarter, comparable to Q1 last year, and inventories were up about $10 million from year end as is typical at this point in the year. 
Overall, our Q1 results were somewhat stronger than anticipated in January. Many of our end markets improved as the quarter progressed, and they appear to be on the path to continue to do so. We presently expect our currency-neutral sales to grow between 5% and 7% for the full year of 2010. Currency translation based on current rates looks to be about neutral to sales growth for the full year.
Moving down the P&L, gross margins continue to be favorably affected by product cost reductions and foreign currency translation, given the relative weakness of the pound and strength of the yen. Additionally, product mix is favorable to margins, and our new products are performing well early in their production ramp up. 
Given these factors, we now expect full-year gross margins to be up by about 75 basis points versus 2009. Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate almost equal to sales. We expect our operating tax rate to be about 18.5%, and net interest expense is expected to be approximately $13.5 million. And our fully diluted average outstanding share count for the full year of 2010 is currently estimated to be about 93.5 million shares. Rolling all of these together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.85 to $4 per share.
For Q2, we expect our currency-neutral sales to grow around 7%. At current exchange rates, currency translation should increase sales by about 1%, bringing our reported sales growth to 8%. At this sales level, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter are expected to be between $0.86 and $0.90. Doug?"

Art refers to it as a zero-lag launch where when we announced the product, we started shipping essentially, immediately. We had trained the sales force, we had the marketing literature already. It was typically introduced these platforms kind of launching to get to Pittcon [Pittsburgh Conference] and then you're shipping by the end of the subsequent quarter. This was -- and then some part of it is just the way our business has evolved. So we were very happy, first of all, with our ability to drive the development and the manufacturing to the point where we're able to do that. Then I would say, the most interesting dynamic, I think, has been with competitive accounts. We knew we had some early indication in some of our classic Waters accounts about their reaction to it. We're clearly aiming this technology and trying to bring a faster uptake curve into the QA-regulated applications part of our business. And taking this instrument into competitive accounts has been very, very positive. So I think that's the early indication. The other thing, I think, as we commented on, is that oftentimes you introduce a new platform like this and the immediate response you'd see is delay, because customers are used to buying your old products and they kind of put things on hold to evaluate. And sometimes, they run new systems through months of evaluation studies. I'm sure we saw some of that but overall, the net effect was really a positive effect rather than a delayed effect. Art, you want to add anything to that?"

And something very unique in our business is we were left alone for our intents and purposes for about five years before any significant competition decided to try and participate. But throughout that period and after several thousands of systems being installed and evaluated, we had the luxury of working with these customers and very precisely understanding what does it take now to move this technology downstream, and for all intents and purposes, replaced the traditional HPLC marketplace while at the same time taking into consideration a larger installed base HPLCs that had been in place for 30 years. And so, we really took our time. We focused on the customer needs. We delivered a product that probably hits the mark so precisely and tell them what customers were asking for. And now seeing it, it's hard to argue with something that if you do this, we will buy it. And so we're experiencing this and the beauty of it is the demonstration units are in place, no delay in delivery. It utilizes the same broad systems chemistry solution we had after 6 years, so it's really the experience that we have that's paying off for us on this strategy."

The reaction to the H-Class and the seamlessness, with which it's coming to market, and the continued interest in the high-end mass spectrometry product lines are all encouraging. I think, the things that keep us from being maybe slightly more optimistic at this point is waiting to be sure that overall, the developed markets in the United States and in Western Europe can show sustainable strength pockets there, as I said, the industrial markets there.

But that being said, I would also say that right out of the gate, we have some very good product costs on the new H-Class that are contributing even in the first quarter to improve margins. We've had a relatively strong Chemistry business, so that's provided a little bit about of upside on mix as well. We expect that to continue. And our Thermal Analysis business has done very well at some of these industrial accounts and within the TA product line. That tends to be the line that has the higher mix.

Some of those accounts were up, but many weren't. I think there was maybe a little bit of a lag in the CapEx release, perhaps at some of those accounts. And it's not impossible to think that the H-Class launch, while it was very successful right out of the gate, is some accounts where they're going to do a little bit more work on that before it gets implemented.

They believe that, that's how they will justify the performance of the equipment, and that's how they will ultimately use it. The H-Class, for the most part, gives an account the ability to have more flexibility. So if they buy an application, where they're utilizing UPLC, but at the same time couldn't justify the purchase because they may still have three or four legacy methods that are HPLC. The interest in the H-Class is that, I can, if I need to, also run an HPLC-separation audit. So while some people are buying it to a future proof for a potential UPLC application, we think this will be the case moving forward. For the most part now, people are still focused on purchasing many of our UPLC products with the prospect of taking advantage of the superior performance capability."

It's really making itself felt in the innards of pharmaceutical, and they're really looking at the productivity, the H-Class and ACQUITY, can give them. Because it really means doing a lot of their jobs with a lot fewer people. If they can replace multiple, traditional HPLCs with fewer H-Class or fewer ACQUITYs, it can dramatically change their productivity.

So what we're really looking at is, while we are selling H-Class to people who have a very little exposure to UPLC at all, it's probably less than a quarter of the sales. So both of the sales are really the early adopters testing it, verifying it, setting up and understanding the technology, coming to us and say, here are the areas within our corporation that we want to utilize this technology.

Early adopters get a very broad versatility, full capability of research-type view of the product. Here's what's required of people and method developing, quality control, for routine applications. The more typical HPLC user would look to attributes that emulate more of our Alliance product than the full-research grade.

Well, our results in the first quarter, I think, signify a continued improvement in customer demand and also strong early acceptance of our key new products. Though we are not totally prepared to believe that the economic conditions that have challenged industries since late 2008 are fully behind us, we are increasingly optimistic about our business prospects in 2010 and are very excited about our strong new product positions. The difficult business conditions in 2009 required us to improve our operational efficiency, and with these efficiencies still in place, improving end markets in 2010 should allow us to transition toward our more traditional sales growth rates in 2011 and beyond. 
Turning to the first quarter of 2010, our organic sales growth was 6%, and we delivered 9% adjusted earnings per share growth. And however, more important, we executed well on our new product initiatives, most notably, our new SYNAPT G2 and our H-Class ACQUITY UPLC systems. Demand for our SYNAPT G2 has been strong, and we successfully delivered and installed a record number of SYNAPT class mass spectrometers in the first quarter. Sales of new SYNAPT instruments were strongest in North America, Europe and in Japan. Key application areas for SYNAPT continue to be in proteomics and metabolite identification. However, we have more recently begun to see uptick by customers in organic synthesis and central analytical labs, in pharmaceutical, academic and industrial accounts.
Our decision to introduce the H-Class ACQUITY UPLC  early in 2010 helped to drive order growth in LC [liquid chromatography] instrumentation in the quarter. Our H-Class UPLC system was designed based on consistent customer feedback regarding key performance features required to accelerate UPLC uptake and regulated testing applications. 
As you may recall, we introduced this new instrument configuration in late January and began customer shipments in early February. Those significant new launches often result in the delay of orders, as customers reevaluate and modify their purchasing plan to adequately consider a new system offering. Our positioning of the H-Class appears to have resulted in a little disruption of our sales momentum while setting the stage for an acceleration of ACQUITY business as we move through 2010.
Some of our largest ACQUITY users, companies that have globally deployed UPLC instruments through the development organizations have told us that they are now more confident of transferring UPLC technology throughout their quality control laboratories. For many, this new outlook is based upon new H-Class instrument features that allow for the running of legacy HPLC methodologies while providing an easy upgrade path to UPLC performance. With the introduction of the H-Class, overall interest in UPLC has significantly increased. We see these in seminar attendance and requests for customer demonstrations and in our lead and quotation volumes. Most interesting, we have started to see new orders and sales from competitive users who have been motivated to try small particle chromatography but have not been sufficiently confident to move forward until they learned about our new H-Class UPLC. 
Within our Waters division, recurring revenue sales, that is the combination of our Service and Chromatography Chemicals businesses, performed about as expected and grew in the mid single-digit range. We expect this trend to continue through 2010 with the Chemicals business growing a bit faster than the Service business.
Sales of our TA Instruments division grew a little faster than those at the large division, with strong performance across TA's lines of thermal analysis, rheometry and biocalorimetry system. Given TA's heavy exposure to the economically sensitive chemical industry, its sales growth and even stronger double-digit orders growth are indicative of a recovery in our industrial end markets and of TA's continued strong product positions. Business activity for TA, as indicated by sales leads and quotes for new instruments, appears to be continually improving, and sales growth for the division is likely to accelerate in future quarters. 
Sales to industrial accounts for the Waters division were also positive in the first quarter. We have historically included sales to the chemical, food and environmental testing industries within our broadly defined Industrial segment. Within these subsegments, chemical and environmental sales were strong in the quarter while food testing growth was affected negatively by strong Asian Melamine Testing business in the base quarter comparisons. 
Pharmaceutical segment sales in the first quarter grew at about the same rate as our overall sales growth. We look across the segment and we benefited from a recovery of sales, the generic firms in India and strength globally from generic, CRO and specialty pharmaceutical accounts. 
As we have expected, merger activity among certain of our larger pharmaceutical customers affected their purchases from us in the quarter. However, we are encouraged by recent feedback from some of our largest accounts indicated that an instrument replacement cycle, especially in light of their excitement from our ACQUITY H-Class UPLC launch, may be on the horizon. 
Looking at our business geographically, sales in the quarter was strongest in Asia, with India and Japan driving the lion's share of the improvement. As you will recall, last year, we endured a very difficult first half performance in India as the severe devaluation of the rupee helped depress demand for dollar-denominated laboratory instruments. In Japan, strong sales to academic institutions, primarily for research mass spectrometry systems, resulted in solid double-digit revenue growth. Our sales growth in China was consistent with our overall mid-single-digit sales performance and was, as I mentioned earlier, affected by strong melamine sales in the 2009 quarters' results. Factoring the Melamine business out of the quarter's results, sales would have been up a strong double-digit rate, and that's an encouraging factor to consider as melamine-related comparisons should not be a factor in future quarters. 
Looking ahead towards the second quarter and full year, 2010 will be an exciting year for new product launches. I've already reviewed the ACQUITY H-Class introductions, and I'm pleased to now tell you that significant new mass spectrometry-based systems are planned for the upcoming ASMS Conference in Salt Lake City. We expect that this year's ASMS will be just as exciting as last year's when we showcased the SYNAPT G2 HDMS systems. With the improving demand pattern that's emerging this year and our commitment to overall cost containment, we are expecting another year of strong free cash flow. As we have for the past several years, we will continue to deploy our cash to smaller acquisitions and our share repurchase program. We're off to a strong start in 2010 with $100 million deployed for stock repurchases in the first quarter.
So in closing, I'd like to say that we are encouraged by the trends that we see developing in 2010. Furthermore, we are confident that with our strong product portfolio and broad access to growth markets, we are very well-positioned to benefit from a continued global economic recovery and for an ongoing opportunity to deliver industry-leading top line and bottom line performance. Now here's John to take you through a more detailed financial analysis."
36475,100777750,61479,"Waters Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Waters Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. The first quarter sales increased by 10%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.81 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.74 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.79 this quarter compared to $0.75 l",944,"Thank you, Doug, and good morning. The first quarter sales increased by 10%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.81 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.74 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.79 this quarter compared to $0.75 last year. 
A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.  Reviewing Q1 sales results compared to Q1 last year, sales were up 10% this quarter with currency translation representing 4% of this increase. 
Looking at our sales growth, geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. and Europe were up 2%. Sales within Japan were up 22% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%. 
Turning to the product front. Within the Waters division, instrument system sales increased by 7% and recurring revenues grew by 6% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, sales increased by 8% versus prior year.
Now I would like to comment on our Q1 non-GAAP recorded financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance was stronger than originally anticipated this quarter and came in at 60.3%. The company continues to benefit from manufacturing cost reductions and more significant foreign currency translation benefits than expected. 
The combination of the relative strength of the yen and weakness of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar had a beneficial impact on our gross margin percentage based on our geographical sales and production mix. We experienced a similar and even more pronounced currency impact in Q1 of 2009, and this accounts for the year-over-year decline in gross margin percentage. 
Going forward, the 2009 base of comparison becomes more favorable, and we expect to see year-over-year growth in gross margin percentage in future quarters. SG&A expenses increased 8% this quarter compared to prior year, and R&D increased by 10% this quarter as we prepare for new product releases later this year. 
Income taxes came in on plan at about 18.5%. We are on track for the transfer of additional LC production to Singapore later this year, which helps to lower our tax rate, but the success of our SYNAPT systems manufactured in the U.K. puts upward pressure on our effective tax rate. Our present view has not changed from January, and we expect these effects to principally offset each other and that our full year effective tax rate will remain around 18.5%. However, that is dependent upon many new product introductions and manufacturing transfers that could bring some variation into the picture as the year unfolds.
On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $692 million and debt totaled $712 million, bringing us to a net debt position of about $20 million. Earlier in the quarter, we took advantage of improving capital markets and diversified our debt structure by entering into an agreement to issue $200 million of notes in a private placement to qualified investors. $100 million of the notes bear a 3.75% coupon for a five-year term, and another $100 million of notes bear a 5% coupon for a 10-year term. 
On the stock buyback front, we continue to purchase our shares in the open market and during the first quarter, we purchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $101 million. We define free cash flow, as cash from operations less capital expenditures, plus any non-cash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. 
For Q1, free cash flow was $95 million after funding $11 million of CapEx and adding back $2 million of non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. This strong start to the year allowed us to accelerate our buyback program and puts us on a path to approach $400 million of free cash flow this year. Comparable free cash flow in Q1 last year was $64 million.
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 78 days this quarter comparable to Q1 last year, and inventories were up about $10 million from year end as is typical at this point in the year. 
Overall, our Q1 results were somewhat stronger than anticipated in January. Many of our end markets improved as the quarter progressed, and they appear to be on the path to continue to do so. We presently expect our currency-neutral sales to grow between 5% and 7% for the full year of 2010. Currency translation based on current rates looks to be about neutral to sales growth for the full year.
Moving down the P&L, gross margins continue to be favorably affected by product cost reductions and foreign currency translation, given the relative weakness of the pound and strength of the yen. Additionally, product mix is favorable to margins, and our new products are performing well early in their production ramp up. 
Given these factors, we now expect full-year gross margins to be up by about 75 basis points versus 2009. Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate almost equal to sales. We expect our operating tax rate to be about 18.5%, and net interest expense is expected to be approximately $13.5 million. And our fully diluted average outstanding share count for the full year of 2010 is currently estimated to be about 93.5 million shares. Rolling all of these together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.85 to $4 per share.
For Q2, we expect our currency-neutral sales to grow around 7%. At current exchange rates, currency translation should increase sales by about 1%, bringing our reported sales growth to 8%. At this sales level, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter are expected to be between $0.86 and $0.90. Doug?"

Art refers to it as a zero-lag launch where when we announced the product, we started shipping essentially, immediately. We had trained the sales force, we had the marketing literature already. It was typically introduced these platforms kind of launching to get to Pittcon [Pittsburgh Conference] and then you're shipping by the end of the subsequent quarter. This was -- and then some part of it is just the way our business has evolved. So we were very happy, first of all, with our ability to drive the development and the manufacturing to the point where we're able to do that. Then I would say, the most interesting dynamic, I think, has been with competitive accounts. We knew we had some early indication in some of our classic Waters accounts about their reaction to it. We're clearly aiming this technology and trying to bring a faster uptake curve into the QA-regulated applications part of our business. And taking this instrument into competitive accounts has been very, very positive. So I think that's the early indication. The other thing, I think, as we commented on, is that oftentimes you introduce a new platform like this and the immediate response you'd see is delay, because customers are used to buying your old products and they kind of put things on hold to evaluate. And sometimes, they run new systems through months of evaluation studies. I'm sure we saw some of that but overall, the net effect was really a positive effect rather than a delayed effect. Art, you want to add anything to that?"

And something very unique in our business is we were left alone for our intents and purposes for about five years before any significant competition decided to try and participate. But throughout that period and after several thousands of systems being installed and evaluated, we had the luxury of working with these customers and very precisely understanding what does it take now to move this technology downstream. And for all intents and purposes, replaced the traditional HPLC marketplace, while at the same time taking into consideration a larger installed base HPLCs that had been in play for 30 years. And so we really took our time, we focused on the customer needs, we delivered a product that probably hits the mark so precisely in terms of what customers were asking for. And now seeing it, it's hard to argue with something that if you do this, we will buy it. And so we're experiencing this and the beauty of it is the demonstration units are in place, no delay in delivery. It utilizes the same broad systems chemistry solution we've had out for six years. So it's really the experience that we have that's paying off for us on this strategy."

We thought we were being perhaps a tad on the conservative side, because we didn't want to overstate our spending budgets coming into the year. But industrial, you can see that very clearly in the TA piece of our business. We also see it in the Waters piece. So I think that the strength of the recovery in India generic pharmaceuticals is pretty clear. That's not insignificant piece of our business. The reaction to the H-Class and the seamlessness, with which it's coming to market, and the continued interest in the high-end mass spectrometry product lines are all encouraging. I think, the things that keep us from being maybe slightly more optimistic at this point is waiting to be sure that overall, the developed markets in the United States and in Western Europe can show sustainable strength pockets there, as I said, the industrial markets there. But big pharma is still going through some of their merger pains. We see a lot of encouragement from that segment of the business, but we probably don't want to take it to the bank quite yet."

So a piece of the improvement in gross margin, a significant piece, is currency. But that being said, I would also say that right out of the gate, we have some very good product costs on the new H-Class that are contributing even in the first quarter to improve margins. We've had a relatively strong Chemistry business, so that's provided a little bit about of upside on mix as well. We expect that to continue. And our Thermal Analysis business has done very well at some of these industrial accounts and within the TA product line. That tends to be the line that has the higher mix.

So I would say, really, the only serious pocket of concern is large pharma. A lot of that I'm certain is merger related. I think we're going to see that dissipate as we make our way through the year. Some of those accounts were up, but many weren't. I think there was maybe a little bit of a lag in the CapEx release, perhaps at some of those accounts. And it's not impossible to think that the H-Class launch, while it was very successful right out of the gate, is some accounts where they're going to do a little bit more work on that before it gets implemented.

Currency for the full year is a little bit less of a top line benefit but offsetting that and more is the fact that we did move the organic growth from what we defined as mid-single-digit of four to six to five to seven.

Because of, as you pointed out, because of investments that we need to make this year, and this year being kind of a year of recovery on the spend line, there's not likely to be quite as much leverage.

If you look at the number of ACQUITY sold over the last five years or so, we have had very broad-based penetration. It is almost impossible to find a large account that doesn't have multiple traditional ACQUITY UPLC systems. So what you're dealing with is the ACQUITY's has been purchased by early adopters, development people, and some method development and even QC [quality control] departments. So what we're really looking at is, while we are selling H-Class to people who have a very little exposure to UPLC at all, it's probably less than a quarter of the sales. So both of the sales are really the early adopters testing it, verifying it, setting up and understanding the technology, coming to us and say, here are the areas within our corporation that we want to utilize this technology. But here are the attributes, I think, they're different for them than for us. The system we purchase traditionally was designed for us. Early adopters get a very broad versatility, full capability of research-type view of the product. Here's what's required of people and method developing, quality control, for routine applications. The more typical HPLC user would look to attributes that emulate more of our Alliance product than the full-research grade. So I'd say that the bulk of our focus of interest is to progress the technology downstream in the already dominant position we have across large, and for that matter, intermediate companies, throughout the technology laboratory world out there."

Well from many perspectives I think we’re pleased with our second quarter’s performance. Sales of our newly introduced instrument systems and a broad-based improvement in customer demand contributed to 9% currency neutral sales growth",1756,"Thank you John. Well from many perspectives I think we’re pleased with our second quarter’s performance. Sales of our newly introduced instrument systems and a broad-based improvement in customer demand contributed to 9% currency neutral sales growth and close to 20% growth in earnings per share. At the same time, we are confident that our exciting new product launches, which we showcased at June’s ASMS conference and earlier this year, will provide us with a powerful competitive edge in the second half of 2010 and further into 2011. 
When you look at the quarter, sales growth to pharmaceutical and industrial chemical customers significantly improved in comparison to what we’ve been seeing in the last few quarters. As you know, the pharmaceutical segment represents more than half of the Waters Division’s sales, and it was improvements in this customer set that contributed most meaningfully to the division’s growth in the second quarter.
Geographically, pharmaceutical growth was strongest in North America and Asia, with drug discovery and QC applications leading the way. Sales in the quarter for most of our large-cap drug accounts grew sequentially from the levels that we saw in the first quarter. However, in absolute terms, demand remained somewhat weak, as many of these customers continue to rationalize their operations. Fortunately, strong demand from generic, specialty biopharmaceuticals, and TRO customers much more than offset the slower sales at our larger drug firms and all in our pharmaceutical business segment enjoyed double-digit top-line growth in the quarter.
Sales to industrial chemical accounts were also strong in the quarter, and our TA instruments division benefitted from a significant and broad rebound in capital spending. As you may recall, TA’s largest customer segment is the industrial chemical market, manufacturers of fine chemicals and polymers used in applications ranging from consumer electronics, to aerospace components, to medical devices. And as you may remember, the severe economic conditions that we endured in late 2008 and through 2009 resulted in a pronounced decline in TA’s sales. 
Throughout this difficult period, TA continued to maintain its technological leadership, provided market-leading customer support, and successfully maintained system pricing. This year, as we continue to emerge from a recession, we are seeing a very impressive rebound in demand for both instrumentation and services at our TA division. 
Within the Waters division, we are seeing a similar recovery in demand at fine chemical accounts, though this customer segment is a significantly smaller percentage of the Waters division’s overall business.
If you look at our non-profit customers, the combined government and academic sales grew more modestly in the quarter and were highlighted by robust shipment volume of high-end mass spec systems to universities. 
U.S. stimulus-related business was not a significant factor in the quarter, and in almost all regions sales to government customers softened as new austerity measures seemed to be having somewhat of an impact.
Looking at our overall sales geographically, Asia and North America saw impressive growth in the quarter. Within Asia the recovery of business in India from last year’s weak levels was a very significant growth driver while our businesses in China and Eastern Asia also continued to grow nicely. The outlook for businesses in Asia, outside of Japan, appears healthy as we move into the second half of this year.
In Japan, you will recall that we had a very successful first quarter sales result as government stimulus funds were spent ahead of the close of their fiscal year. We knew that last quarter sales were not indicative of long-term demand in Japan, and expected full-year currency-neutral revenue growth to be at the mid-single-digit level. In the second quarter we saw a modest decline in sales in Japan, bringing the first half constant-currency sales growth rate to a little less than 10%.
Recently, much concern has been voiced about economic weakness in Europe. However, in the second quarter our European currency-neutral sales grew at about the same rate as the company’s overall rate. Within Europe, sales growth in Eastern Europe was strong and for the region as a whole mass spectrometry shipments were robust.
Moving forward, we share in what appears to be a prevailing concern that Western Europe may again experience a period of soft demand. However, we are not currently seeing this in our order trends and continue to believe that our overall European business will deliver at least moderate growth in the second half of 2010.
Earlier today I mentioned that our recent new product launches positively contributed to our results in the most recently completed quarter. And now I would like to review with you the instrument systems that I was referring to and provide you with some perspective on the potential impact of these products on our future performance.
If you’ll look at the second quarter, Synapt mass spectrometry and ACUITY H-Class systems were the star performers. With our Synapt G-2 MS and Synapt G-2 HDMS instruments, we are continuing to strengthen our position in research-grade mass spectrometry. Since we began shipments in late 2009, our Synapt user base has been rapidly expanding. 
More publications from leading researchers have described the instrument’s unique performance attributes for a variety of applications and we have continued to enhance the system’s performance with more ionization options, new advanced chromatography inlets, and application-tailored software packages. 
At this year’s ASMS conference in June, we introduced two new high-performance systems: the Xevo G2 QTof, and the Xevo TQ-S. These systems have been engineered to deliver industry-leading performance in compact and easy to use instrument configurations. 
The Xevo G2 QTof incorporates our new QuanTof (inaudible) technology an innovation that facilitates high sensitivity compound identification and quantification in a single experimental step. In applications from environmental and food safety screening, to drug metabolite identification, the Xevo G2 can generate results in a single run that previously required running multiple experiments on a range of MS instruments. I’m pleased to tell you that we began shipping the new Xevo G2 QTof late in the second quarter, and that we’ll be ramping up production to address our order backlog in the third quarter. 
The Xevo TQ-S is our new flagship research tandem, or as commonly referred to, triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. This new system targets the largest market opportunity in mass spectrometry-based instrumentation, and we are excited to have what we believe is the highest-performance offering. We feel that we have an opportunity to gain share in applications where high sensitivity, that is the ability to see trace amounts of organic or bio molecules, is of primary importance.
Our ACUITY UPLC position, a leading market position in chromatography for high-performance MS applications, gives us easy access to our targeted customer set and the ability to offer complete UPLC MS systems for those customers requiring a turnkey high-performance solution. Order volume for the new Xevo TQ-S ramped nicely in the second quarter, and we plan to begin customer shipments this quarter.
Earlier this year I had the opportunity to speak to you about our ACUITY strategy and our new ACUITY H-Class UPLC system. As you may recall, the H-Class instrument offers capabilities that allow for the running of legacy HPLC methodologies while providing an easy upgrade path to UPLC performance. It is, however, a true UPLC system with attributes that leverage the performance of our ACUITY column chemistries. 
The ACUITY H-Class was developed based on feedback that we received from our largest ACUITY users, primarily customers that have already deployed UPLC instruments through their development organization. They told us that they are now more confident of transferring UPLC technology throughout their quality control laboratories for required instrument design features to facilitate that process. These design features and additional performance enhancements were incorporated into our ACUITY H-Class. 
While we introduced and began shipments of the H-Class in the first quarter of 2010, early feedback that we received from the market was very positive, and that excitement level only grew throughout the second quarter. More important, in the second quarter, its first full quarter in the market, the H-Class has made significant inroads in opening the pharmaceutical QC market to UPLC technology, and we are confident that this trend will continue in the second half of 2010 and beyond.
All of this is a very encouraging dynamic. Not only are we pleased to see the rapid adoption of our new LC systems, we are also pleased to see signs that our new ACUITY H-Class UPLC may be a key factor in initiating a long-awaited new instrument replacement cycle in pharmaceutical QC.
From my recent comments you can likely sense that I’m very excited about the strength of our new product offerings. However, our success is also dependent on funds being available globally to acquire new goods and services, and it is today’s macroeconomic concerns that somewhat temper my near term enthusiasm. 
John will review with you our financial outlook for the remainder of this year, but before passing you on to him, I want to say that we feel that we are emerging from the first half of this year with strong business momentum and reasonable visibility for the third quarter. Capital budgets for some of our largest accounts are still being released, and we enjoy order backlogs for our newly introduced products. 
That said, we feel it is most prudent to be cautious in our full-year outlook and to adopt a reasonable but conservative spending budget for our business. Major product development projects will be fully funded and strategic initiatives such as our program to transfer instrument production to tax-have sites will proceed as planned. However, we continue to monitor customer demand and our internal spending in an effort to react appropriately to dynamic business conditions.
In the second quarter, our pre-tax cash generation exceeded $100 million, and for the half-year period was more than $200 million. We feel that cash generation is an important internal and external measurement in evaluating the company’s performance, and this year we believe we are well-positioned to generate about $0.25 of free cash for each dollar of sales we make.
So in closing, I will reiterate that I am pleased with our performance for the first half of 2010. We remain cautiously optimistic that we can continue to grow our top and bottom lines through the remainder of 2010 and into 2011 at rates more in line with our pre-recessionary growth trends and we remain committed to a focused business strategy that has served us well for many years.
So I’d like to now turn it over to John for the financials.

Second quarter sales increased by 8% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 19% at $0.93 this quarter, compared to earnings of $0.78 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.90 this quarter, compared to $",1031,"Thank you Doug, and good morning. Second quarter sales increased by 8% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 19% at $0.93 this quarter, compared to earnings of $0.78 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.90 this quarter, compared to $0.72 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.
Reviewing Q2 sales results compared to Q2 last year, sales were up 9% this quarter before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth by 1% this quarter. Looking at our sales growth geographically, and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 11%, Europe’s sales were up 9%, sales within Japan were down 3%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14%.
Turning to the product front, within the Waters division instrument systems sales increased by 8% and recurring revenues grew by 7% this quarter before foreign exchange effects. Within our TA instruments division, sales were strong and increased by 28% versus prior year as customers returned to more traditional levels of purchasing activity.
Now I would like to comment on our Q2 non-GAAP reported financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance continued to be strong this quarter and came in about as expected at 60.3%, comparable to prior year end last quarter. 
SG&A expenses increased 2% this quarter compared to prior year. Salaries increased modestly and marketing costs were up related to food safety programs, but these increases were largely mitigated by lower currency translation costs, lower than anticipated incentive plan expenses from finalization of 2009 accrual balances, and a continued restraint on adding additional headcount at this time. For the remainder of the year we expect SG&A to grow at a mid-single-digit rate. 
R&D expenses increased by 6% this quarter from continued new product development programs, partially offset by favorable currency translations related to our mass-spec operations in the U.K. We expect R&D to grow at a similar rate during the second half of the year.
Our effective income tax rate came in a little better than projected at about 18%. A modest shift in estimated production levels in favor of our tax-advantaged geographies reduced our anticipated full-year 2010 tax rate by about a half a point. This provided about a penny of benefit to our Q2 EPS.
On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $754 million and debt totaled $757 million, bringing us to a net debt position of about $3 million. 
On the stock buyback front, we continued to purchase our shares on the open market, and during the second quarter we purchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock for $75 million.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, less any non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual and nonrecurring items. For Q2 free cash flow remains strong. It came it at $102 million after funding $11 million of cap backs and adding back about $1 million of non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
This strong start to the year allowed us to accelerate our buyback program and keeps us on a firm path towards $400 million of free cash flow this year. Comparable free cash flow in Q2 last year was $63 million, which included funding $18 million for a new TA facility. 
Accounts receivable day sales outstanding stood at 73 days this quarter, down one day versus Q2 last year, and inventories were up $13 million from year end, as is typical at this point in the year. Overall, our Q2 results were somewhat stronger than we had anticipated at the start of the quarter. Our new products have been well-received and continue to gain traction and customer demand continues to recover from depressed levels we saw last year. I
In April, we said that we expected our currency neutral sales to grow between 5% and 7% for the full year 2010. Through the first half we grew 8%, slightly over our expectations, primarily due to a strong rebound in our TA instrument business. For the second half, we now project our sales growth to average about 7%, with Q3 growing a little faster than this and Q4 a little slower, given differing bases of comparison (easier in Q3, tougher in Q4). 
New product introductions at ASMS, a strong ramp of sales of our new H-Class products, and a building backlog of orders altogether give us confidence that the organic growth of the business is on more stable footing as we enter the second half of the year.
On the other hand, general economic uncertainties remain and cause us to be a bit cautious as we consider growth expectations in the fourth quarter. For the full year then, we expect organic sales growth between 7% and 8%. Currency translation at today’s levels is expected to reduce sales growth by about 1%. 
Moving down to P&L, gross margins continue to be favorably affected by product cost reductions and by foreign currency translation in the second half given the continuation of relative weakness of the British Pound and strength of the Japanese Yen. Additionally, product mix is favorable to margins and our new products are performing well early in their production ramp up. 
Given these factors, we expect full year gross margins to be up about 50 basis points versus 2009. Operating expenses are expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate. Net interest expense is expected to be about $13.5 million, and as I mentioned earlier, we expect our operating tax rate to be approximately 18%. Our fully diluted average outstanding share count for the full year 2010 is currently estimated to be around 93.5 million shares.
Rolling all of this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.92 to $4.02 per share. For Q3 we expect our currency neutral sales to grow around 8%. At current exchange rates currency translation should decrease sales growth by about 2%, bringing reported sales growth to 6%. At this sales level, non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share for the third quarter are expected to be between $0.93 and $0.97.
Doug?

But our strongest Alliance customers today are still in India, and in those generic accounts. What’s really encouraging about the H-Class is that it’s beginning to penetrate into classical QC applications, and that works on several fronts. Number one, that’s an area where we’re seeing large pharma long out their replacement cycles and number two, they tend to the highest purchases of columns. Those applications are heavy column users. Now, the benefit of H-Class is they can use traditional columns, but as they move to more high-throughput applications and get truly into UPLC applications, they use more UPLC columns. So I think that works in our favor on a number of fronts. We think we’re at the front end of that but the early signs are very encouraging.

The big drug accounts still are struggling with their acquisitions and their restructuring. So if you look at absolute comparisons of our largest pharmaceutical companies around the world, those results were negative quarter-on-quarter. That is, compared to the ’09 quarter. What’s interesting is that sequentially they improve from the first quarter to the second quarter, we’re seeing order rates improve. We’re also seeing a great deal of interest and quote rate activity is pretty strong there. I think you know, holding my breath and crossing my fingers, that sequentially we’ll continue to see improvement in those accounts. It’s hard to imagine that they could get worse. And particularly in the bio applications of those accounts we’re seeing a huge amount of interest from our most recent offerings with our bio ACUITY and the results coming out of our new systems offerings. 
So that’s all encouraging. In terms of current business, generic accounts, that being particularly true in India, bouncing off poor results last year, but generic accounts in Europe and in the United States are all very strong, and that’s across the board and that’s where some of the interest that we’re seeing in H-Clas and QC applications coming from. I think that’s pretty broad based. And that’s also true of CRO activity, pretty broad based geographically. So that’s I think the result of our good performance in pharma.

The gross margin in the third quarter came down a bit and we’re suggesting that we’re more likely to be somewhat consistent with gross margins as we move into the third quarter from the second this year as a result of product mix. And also the currency environment remains very favorable for us. We have a relatively strong Yen still as we speak, so our sales in that region are being translated favorably where there’s no production in that part of the world so there’s no offset to the cost of sales line. And the British Pound continues to be relatively weak, so our units coming out of our Manchester operation as they’re sold around the world are favorable. So that environment continues as we look at the second half, so I would say that you’re looking at probably two thirds of the overall improvement is currency and the remainder is associated with cost reductions and product mix and some of the newer products that our coming out pretty strong in margins. So that’s, based on where we are today, that’s how it works.

In our second half organic growth is just a smidge slower than we’re experiencing now, and if we continue to see current run rates and things involved on the new product front, it’s not impossible that we could see better results. But tempering our expectations is major questions about Western Europe, particularly the government-supported segments of the Western Europe business. Frankly, all in Europe has been pretty good, but we’ve seen pockets of weakness in Western Europe and that government-supported piece is under a fair amount of strain. So that tempers our expectations. We certainly saw strong government spending in Japan in the first quarter, weaker in the second quarter, so that causes us some element of concern. We factored that into our results. If things evolve a little bit better then we could possibly do a little bit better. We frankly have not seen a lot of results from stimulus spending in the United States from government stimulus spending. That could be a little bit better, but frankly we’re not banking too much of that in the second half either. I’d say that’s where most of our conservative comes in. We might be a little conservative on how long we think the TA bounce and how high it can get so that’s another element that if we turned out a little bit better we wouldn’t be totally surprised. Those are the key elements of when I say we’re a little bit cautious in the second half. Those are areas that we think we’ve injected some degree of conservatism.

In terms of our Synapt business and really talking about our high end mass spec business, we’re very confident of our position. We had a great first half in that. That’s particularly so on the orders front, but also true on the shipment front. It is true that we built some backlog, and what we’re talking about in terms of concerns or potential issues in the second half is not related to the high end MS.

There really isn’t anything on the front burner right now from an M&A perspective.

So if that’s down a little bit, then it is, but I’d say they’re relatively flat Q2 to Q3. But a mid-single-digit growth in SG&A for Q3 specifically year-over-year is what we’re forecasting.
As it relates to longer term needs for investment and the like, I believe currently that to the extent that the business continues to pick up and to the extent that the economy continues to do better, that we’ll have the ability to live within the organic top line growth rate in being able to fund investments in SG&A and R&D that don’t force those expenses to grow at the same rate as sales. 
Now, whether they can grow a point, two points less than sales or more is obviously dependent on how high that top line is. But I don’t foresee that we’re going to be needing to grow SG&A and R&D faster certainly than sales based on what we currently see in the pipeline. 
That does afford us to put some personnel in place, principally service-type people that come into the cost of sales line but other support people as well, and we’ve been doing some of that, even as we’ve made our way through the first half of the year, principally international folks. So I’d say we’re not in a dire need there. Yes, we’ll make investments in headcount if the business grows and I’m confident it will be contained within what you expect from us in being able to leverage our base of costs.

Well from many perspectives I think we’re pleased with our second quarter’s performance. Sales of our newly introduced instrument systems and a broad-based improvement in customer demand contributed to 9% currency neutral sales growth and close to 20% growth in earnings per share. At the same time, we are confident that our exciting new product launches, which we showcased at June’s ASMS conference and earlier this year, will provide us with a powerful competitive edge in the second half of 2010 and further into 2011. 
When you look at the quarter, sales growth to pharmaceutical and industrial chemical customers significantly improved in comparison to what we’ve been seeing in the last few quarters. As you know, the pharmaceutical segment represents more than half of the Waters Division’s sales, and it was improvements in this customer set that contributed most meaningfully to the division’s growth in the second quarter.
Geographically, pharmaceutical growth was strongest in North America and Asia, with drug discovery and QC applications leading the way. Sales in the quarter for most of our large-cap drug accounts grew sequentially from the levels that we saw in the first quarter. However, in absolute terms, demand remained somewhat weak, as many of these customers continue to rationalize their operations. Fortunately, strong demand from generic, specialty biopharmaceuticals, and TRO customers much more than offset the slower sales at our larger drug firms and all in our pharmaceutical business segment enjoyed double-digit top-line growth in the quarter.
Sales to industrial chemical accounts were also strong in the quarter, and our TA instruments division benefitted from a significant and broad rebound in capital spending. As you may recall, TA’s largest customer segment is the industrial chemical market, manufacturers of fine chemicals and polymers used in applications ranging from consumer electronics, to aerospace components, to medical devices. And as you may remember, the severe economic conditions that we endured in late 2008 and through 2009 resulted in a pronounced decline in TA’s sales. 
Throughout this difficult period, TA continued to maintain its technological leadership, provided market-leading customer support, and successfully maintained system pricing. This year, as we continue to emerge from a recession, we are seeing a very impressive rebound in demand for both instrumentation and services at our TA division. 
Within the Waters division, we are seeing a similar recovery in demand at fine chemical accounts, though this customer segment is a significantly smaller percentage of the Waters division’s overall business.
If you look at our non-profit customers, the combined government and academic sales grew more modestly in the quarter and were highlighted by robust shipment volume of high-end mass spec systems to universities. 
U.S. stimulus-related business was not a significant factor in the quarter, and in almost all regions sales to government customers softened as new austerity measures seemed to be having somewhat of an impact.
Looking at our overall sales geographically, Asia and North America saw impressive growth in the quarter. Within Asia the recovery of business in India from last year’s weak levels was a very significant growth driver while our businesses in China and Eastern Asia also continued to grow nicely. The outlook for businesses in Asia, outside of Japan, appears healthy as we move into the second half of this year.
In Japan, you will recall that we had a very successful first quarter sales result as government stimulus funds were spent ahead of the close of their fiscal year. We knew that last quarter sales were not indicative of long-term demand in Japan, and expected full-year currency-neutral revenue growth to be at the mid-single-digit level. In the second quarter we saw a modest decline in sales in Japan, bringing the first half constant-currency sales growth rate to a little less than 10%.
Recently, much concern has been voiced about economic weakness in Europe. However, in the second quarter our European currency-neutral sales grew at about the same rate as the company’s overall rate. Within Europe, sales growth in Eastern Europe was strong and for the region as a whole mass spectrometry shipments were robust.
Moving forward, we share in what appears to be a prevailing concern that Western Europe may again experience a period of soft demand. However, we are not currently seeing this in our order trends and continue to believe that our overall European business will deliver at least moderate growth in the second half of 2010.
Earlier today I mentioned that our recent new product launches positively contributed to our results in the most recently completed quarter. And now I would like to review with you the instrument systems that I was referring to and provide you with some perspective on the potential impact of these products on our future performance.
If you’ll look at the second quarter, Synapt mass spectrometry and ACUITY H-Class systems were the star performers. With our Synapt G-2 MS and Synapt G-2 HDMS instruments, we are continuing to strengthen our position in research-grade mass spectrometry. Since we began shipments in late 2009, our Synapt user base has been rapidly expanding. 
More publications from leading researchers have described the instrument’s unique performance attributes for a variety of applications and we have continued to enhance the system’s performance with more ionization options, new advanced chromatography inlets, and application-tailored software packages. 
At this year’s ASMS conference in June, we introduced two new high-performance systems: the Xevo G2 QTof, and the Xevo TQ-S. These systems have been engineered to deliver industry-leading performance in compact and easy to use instrument configurations. 
The Xevo G2 QTof incorporates our new QuanTof (inaudible) technology an innovation that facilitates high sensitivity compound identification and quantification in a single experimental step. In applications from environmental and food safety screening, to drug metabolite identification, the Xevo G2 can generate results in a single run that previously required running multiple experiments on a range of MS instruments. I’m pleased to tell you that we began shipping the new Xevo G2 QTof late in the second quarter, and that we’ll be ramping up production to address our order backlog in the third quarter. 
The Xevo TQ-S is our new flagship research tandem, or as commonly referred to, triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. This new system targets the largest market opportunity in mass spectrometry-based instrumentation, and we are excited to have what we believe is the highest-performance offering. We feel that we have an opportunity to gain share in applications where high sensitivity, that is the ability to see trace amounts of organic or bio molecules, is of primary importance.
Our ACUITY UPLC position, a leading market position in chromatography for high-performance MS applications, gives us easy access to our targeted customer set and the ability to offer complete UPLC MS systems for those customers requiring a turnkey high-performance solution. Order volume for the new Xevo TQ-S ramped nicely in the second quarter, and we plan to begin customer shipments this quarter.
Earlier this year I had the opportunity to speak to you about our ACUITY strategy and our new ACUITY H-Class UPLC system. As you may recall, the H-Class instrument offers capabilities that allow for the running of legacy HPLC methodologies while providing an easy upgrade path to UPLC performance. It is, however, a true UPLC system with attributes that leverage the performance of our ACUITY column chemistries. 
The ACUITY H-Class was developed based on feedback that we received from our largest ACUITY users, primarily customers that have already deployed UPLC instruments through their development organization. They told us that they are now more confident of transferring UPLC technology throughout their quality control laboratories for required instrument design features to facilitate that process. These design features and additional performance enhancements were incorporated into our ACUITY H-Class. 
While we introduced and began shipments of the H-Class in the first quarter of 2010, early feedback that we received from the market was very positive, and that excitement level only grew throughout the second quarter. More important, in the second quarter, its first full quarter in the market, the H-Class has made significant inroads in opening the pharmaceutical QC market to UPLC technology, and we are confident that this trend will continue in the second half of 2010 and beyond.
All of this is a very encouraging dynamic. Not only are we pleased to see the rapid adoption of our new LC systems, we are also pleased to see signs that our new ACUITY H-Class UPLC may be a key factor in initiating a long-awaited new instrument replacement cycle in pharmaceutical QC.
From my recent comments you can likely sense that I’m very excited about the strength of our new product offerings. However, our success is also dependent on funds being available globally to acquire new goods and services, and it is today’s macroeconomic concerns that somewhat temper my near term enthusiasm. 
John will review with you our financial outlook for the remainder of this year, but before passing you on to him, I want to say that we feel that we are emerging from the first half of this year with strong business momentum and reasonable visibility for the third quarter. Capital budgets for some of our largest accounts are still being released, and we enjoy order backlogs for our newly introduced products. 
That said, we feel it is most prudent to be cautious in our full-year outlook and to adopt a reasonable but conservative spending budget for our business. Major product development projects will be fully funded and strategic initiatives such as our program to transfer instrument production to tax-have sites will proceed as planned. However, we continue to monitor customer demand and our internal spending in an effort to react appropriately to dynamic business conditions.
In the second quarter, our pre-tax cash generation exceeded $100 million, and for the half-year period was more than $200 million. We feel that cash generation is an important internal and external measurement in evaluating the company’s performance, and this year we believe we are well-positioned to generate about $0.25 of free cash for each dollar of sales we make.
So in closing, I will reiterate that I am pleased with our performance for the first half of 2010. We remain cautiously optimistic that we can continue to grow our top and bottom lines through the remainder of 2010 and into 2011 at rates more in line with our pre-recessionary growth trends and we remain committed to a focused business strategy that has served us well for many years.
So I’d like to now turn it over to John for the financials.

Second quarter sales increased by 8% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 19% at $0.93 this quarter, compared to earnings of $0.78 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.90 this quarter, compared to $",1031,"Thank you Doug, and good morning. Second quarter sales increased by 8% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 19% at $0.93 this quarter, compared to earnings of $0.78 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.90 this quarter, compared to $0.72 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.
Reviewing Q2 sales results compared to Q2 last year, sales were up 9% this quarter before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth by 1% this quarter. Looking at our sales growth geographically, and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 11%, Europe’s sales were up 9%, sales within Japan were down 3%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14%.
Turning to the product front, within the Waters division instrument systems sales increased by 8% and recurring revenues grew by 7% this quarter before foreign exchange effects. Within our TA instruments division, sales were strong and increased by 28% versus prior year as customers returned to more traditional levels of purchasing activity.
Now I would like to comment on our Q2 non-GAAP reported financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance continued to be strong this quarter and came in about as expected at 60.3%, comparable to prior year end last quarter. 
SG&A expenses increased 2% this quarter compared to prior year. Salaries increased modestly and marketing costs were up related to food safety programs, but these increases were largely mitigated by lower currency translation costs, lower than anticipated incentive plan expenses from finalization of 2009 accrual balances, and a continued restraint on adding additional headcount at this time. For the remainder of the year we expect SG&A to grow at a mid-single-digit rate. 
R&D expenses increased by 6% this quarter from continued new product development programs, partially offset by favorable currency translations related to our mass-spec operations in the U.K. We expect R&D to grow at a similar rate during the second half of the year.
Our effective income tax rate came in a little better than projected at about 18%. A modest shift in estimated production levels in favor of our tax-advantaged geographies reduced our anticipated full-year 2010 tax rate by about a half a point. This provided about a penny of benefit to our Q2 EPS.
On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $754 million and debt totaled $757 million, bringing us to a net debt position of about $3 million. 
On the stock buyback front, we continued to purchase our shares on the open market, and during the second quarter we purchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock for $75 million.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, less any non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual and nonrecurring items. For Q2 free cash flow remains strong. It came it at $102 million after funding $11 million of cap backs and adding back about $1 million of non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
This strong start to the year allowed us to accelerate our buyback program and keeps us on a firm path towards $400 million of free cash flow this year. Comparable free cash flow in Q2 last year was $63 million, which included funding $18 million for a new TA facility. 
Accounts receivable day sales outstanding stood at 73 days this quarter, down one day versus Q2 last year, and inventories were up $13 million from year end, as is typical at this point in the year. Overall, our Q2 results were somewhat stronger than we had anticipated at the start of the quarter. Our new products have been well-received and continue to gain traction and customer demand continues to recover from depressed levels we saw last year. I
In April, we said that we expected our currency neutral sales to grow between 5% and 7% for the full year 2010. Through the first half we grew 8%, slightly over our expectations, primarily due to a strong rebound in our TA instrument business. For the second half, we now project our sales growth to average about 7%, with Q3 growing a little faster than this and Q4 a little slower, given differing bases of comparison (easier in Q3, tougher in Q4). 
New product introductions at ASMS, a strong ramp of sales of our new H-Class products, and a building backlog of orders altogether give us confidence that the organic growth of the business is on more stable footing as we enter the second half of the year.
On the other hand, general economic uncertainties remain and cause us to be a bit cautious as we consider growth expectations in the fourth quarter. For the full year then, we expect organic sales growth between 7% and 8%. Currency translation at today’s levels is expected to reduce sales growth by about 1%. 
Moving down to P&L, gross margins continue to be favorably affected by product cost reductions and by foreign currency translation in the second half given the continuation of relative weakness of the British Pound and strength of the Japanese Yen. Additionally, product mix is favorable to margins and our new products are performing well early in their production ramp up. 
Given these factors, we expect full year gross margins to be up about 50 basis points versus 2009. Operating expenses are expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate. Net interest expense is expected to be about $13.5 million, and as I mentioned earlier, we expect our operating tax rate to be approximately 18%. Our fully diluted average outstanding share count for the full year 2010 is currently estimated to be around 93.5 million shares.
Rolling all of this together, we currently expect non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share to be in the range of $3.92 to $4.02 per share. For Q3 we expect our currency neutral sales to grow around 8%. At current exchange rates currency translation should decrease sales growth by about 2%, bringing reported sales growth to 6%. At this sales level, non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share for the third quarter are expected to be between $0.93 and $0.97.

So if you look at the mix I’d say some of those H-Class sales would have previously been ACUITY sales, not so much Alliance. But our strongest Alliance customers today are still in India, and in those generic accounts. What’s really encouraging about the H-Class is that it’s beginning to penetrate into classical QC applications, and that works on several fronts. Number one, that’s an area where we’re seeing large pharma long out their replacement cycles and number two, they tend to the highest purchases of columns. Those applications are heavy column users. Now, the benefit of H-Class is they can use traditional columns, but as they move to more high-throughput applications and get truly into UPLC applications, they use more UPLC columns. So I think that works in our favor on a number of fronts. We think we’re at the front end of that but the early signs are very encouraging.

The big drug accounts still are struggling with their acquisitions and their restructuring. So if you look at absolute comparisons of our largest pharmaceutical companies around the world, those results were negative quarter-on-quarter. That is, compared to the ’09 quarter. What’s interesting is that sequentially they improve from the first quarter to the second quarter, we’re seeing order rates improve. We’re also seeing a great deal of interest and quote rate activity is pretty strong there. I think you know, holding my breath and crossing my fingers, that sequentially we’ll continue to see improvement in those accounts. It’s hard to imagine that they could get worse. And particularly in the bio applications of those accounts we’re seeing a huge amount of interest from our most recent offerings with our bio ACUITY and the results coming out of our new systems offerings. 
So that’s all encouraging. In terms of current business, generic accounts, that being particularly true in India, bouncing off poor results last year, but generic accounts in Europe and in the United States are all very strong, and that’s across the board and that’s where some of the interest that we’re seeing in H-Clas and QC applications coming from. I think that’s pretty broad based. And that’s also true of CRO activity, pretty broad based geographically. So that’s I think the result of our good performance in pharma. Again across the board we had double digit growth in pharma in the Waters division this quarter, so we’re pretty enthusiastic about that.

The gross margin in the third quarter came down a bit and we’re suggesting that we’re more likely to be somewhat consistent with gross margins as we move into the third quarter from the second this year as a result of product mix. And also the currency environment remains very favorable for us. We have a relatively strong Yen still as we speak, so our sales in that region are being translated favorably where there’s no production in that part of the world so there’s no offset to the cost of sales line. And the British Pound continues to be relatively weak, so our units coming out of our Manchester operation as they’re sold around the world are favorable. So that environment continues as we look at the second half, so I would say that you’re looking at probably two thirds of the overall improvement is currency and the remainder is associated with cost reductions and product mix and some of the newer products that our coming out pretty strong in margins. So that’s, based on where we are today, that’s how it works.

In our second half organic growth is just a smidge slower than we’re experiencing now, and if we continue to see current run rates and things involved on the new product front, it’s not impossible that we could see better results. But tempering our expectations is major questions about Western Europe, particularly the government-supported segments of the Western Europe business. Frankly, all in Europe has been pretty good, but we’ve seen pockets of weakness in Western Europe and that government-supported piece is under a fair amount of strain. So that tempers our expectations. We certainly saw strong government spending in Japan in the first quarter, weaker in the second quarter, so that causes us some element of concern. We factored that into our results. If things evolve a little bit better then we could possibly do a little bit better. We frankly have not seen a lot of results from stimulus spending in the United States from government stimulus spending. That could be a little bit better, but frankly we’re not banking too much of that in the second half either. I’d say that’s where most of our conservative comes in. We might be a little conservative on how long we think the TA bounce and how high it can get so that’s another element that if we turned out a little bit better we wouldn’t be totally surprised. Those are the key elements of when I say we’re a little bit cautious in the second half. Those are areas that we think we’ve injected some degree of conservatism.

We were relatively aggressive in the second quarter I’d say, at $75 million.

We’ve principally spent what we’ve generated, if you will, on the program, say, for $25 million. So I’d say the message there is that we are bullish on being aggressive in buyers of the stock. We’ve done that. 
There really isn’t anything on the front burner right now from an M&A perspective. We continue to look at the small bolt-on acquisitions that we’re typically trying to close, but I would say at least in the near term there doesn’t appear to be one that would consume cash, so it’s likely that we’ll continue to get back in the market when the window opens and continue to buy our shares in the second half. It’s not impossible that we’ll go well beyond, perhaps, that $250 million limit to the extent that we don’t buy something on the M&A front.

So if that’s down a little bit, then it is, but I’d say they’re relatively flat Q2 to Q3. But a mid-single-digit growth in SG&A for Q3 specifically year-over-year is what we’re forecasting.
As it relates to longer term needs for investment and the like, I believe currently that to the extent that the business continues to pick up and to the extent that the economy continues to do better, that we’ll have the ability to live within the organic top line growth rate in being able to fund investments in SG&A and R&D that don’t force those expenses to grow at the same rate as sales. 
Now, whether they can grow a point, two points less than sales or more is obviously dependent on how high that top line is. But I don’t foresee that we’re going to be needing to grow SG&A and R&D faster certainly than sales based on what we currently see in the pipeline. 
That does afford us to put some personnel in place, principally service-type people that come into the cost of sales line but other support people as well, and we’ve been doing some of that, even as we’ve made our way through the first half of the year, principally international folks. So I’d say we’re not in a dire need there. Yes, we’ll make investments in headcount if the business grows and I’m confident it will be contained within what you expect from us in being able to leverage our base of costs.

We are pleased with the top line performance of our business in the third quarter.

We are pleased with the top line performance of our business in the third quarter. Our consistent order momentum throughout the quarter and continued positive acceptance of our new systems offerings are both encouraging signs as we look toward the fourth quarter and 2011.
For the Waters Division, momentum continued to build in the third quarter and the Division's sales grew organically at 8%. From a product line perspective, instrument systems sales growth approached 10% organically, while our recurring revenues, the combination of our chemistry and services businesses, grew at a mid single-digit rate. This increase in instrument systems sales was highlighted by the continued strong uptake of ACQUITY H-Class UPLC and our high-end mass spectrometry technology.
Looking at our end markets, we saw strong growth from pharmaceutical and chemical accounts in the quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were strongest among medium and small sized firms, with our largest pharmaceutical accounts delivering somewhat mixed results and an overall flattish year-over-year performance. Sequentially, however, sales to these large accounts improved significantly over the second quarter results. So that's a trend that's encouraging as we look towards year-end spending volumes.
Waters Division sales to chemical and applied market segments were up at a double-digit rate, and that was led by our industrial chemical customers. The strong performance by this Group represents both a nice recovery from last year's economically challenged spending levels as well as high interest in advanced research systems, such as our SYNAPT and Xevo mass spectrometry platforms.
Government and university sales were less robust in the quarter as the base quarter in 2009 included international stimulus-related business. A decline in sales volume to government labs was most apparent in Western European markets, while government spending in Asia and in the U.S. fared better. We're expecting the sales to government agencies in Europe will remain under pressure for the foreseeable future, but we are encouraged by the high level of interest for our research systems by government and university labs in the U.S. and in Asia.
Geographically, Asia and the Americas performed well in the quarter. Asia benefited from very strong sales growth in China and India, while our growth in Japan was moderately positive. The strength that we saw in Asia was primarily related to generic drug end markets in India and to overall pharmaceutical spending in China.
Sales in the U.S. grew at a double-digit rate with nearly all market segments exhibiting robust demand. Sales of systems incorporating high-end mass spectrometry technology were particularly strong in the quarter as we began shipping new systems that were introduced at this year's ASMS Conference in the middle of the year.
Early in the third quarter, there were concerns about European economic stability and the impact of potentially faltering national economies on analytical instruments sales. But throughout the quarter, we were reading economic reports and closely monitoring the pace of our business in Europe, and as the summer passed, our concerns about a significant displacement in demand diminished and the demand level not too dissimilar from our initial expectations really materialized.
In Western Europe, government spending was significantly reduced in the quarter, while pharmaceutical and industrial spending held steady. All-in, our European sales growth in the quarter was only slightly negative with Western Europe weakness largely offset by growth in Eastern Europe. We are expecting that government spending will remain weak in larger European countries. However, as this government segment represents a relatively small part of our sales mix and we are very confident in the strength of our new products, we feel that we can at least maintain or moderately grow our European business in upcoming quarters.
Looking more closely at product trends within the Waters Division, there were interesting dynamics affecting our chromatography and mass spectrometry offerings. On the chromatography front, most competitors have now introduced systems that claim performance advantages of UPLC. This is a move that we expected, and frankly, we welcome as we believe that the largest business growth opportunity in analytical instrumentation may involve the broad conversion of a large HPLC installed base of instruments to UPLC-type capability. Furthermore, we feel that if this conversion materializes and we continue to both define and drive demand with new generation UPLC system offerings, Waters is best positioned to increase market share.
Our ACQUITY H-Class is a key enabler in driving UPLC across HPLC market segments. Introduced earlier this year, the H-Class system is designed to allow laboratories, especially those running regulated testing protocols, to smoothly convert from HPLC to UPLC at a rate that best fits with their current workflow demands and their capital budgets. If you look at the third quarter, ACQUITY UPLC system sales were strong with demand growing in the double-digit rates and with higher penetrations in regulated testing applications by our ACQUITY H-Class System.
Recent trends suggest that the H-Class is helping to initiate a long awaited replacement cycle for applications, such as pharmaceutical QA/QC, and we believe that this replacement cycle has the potential to augment LC system growth over a multiyear period. In addition, strong sales of ACQUITY columns indicate continued high attach rates for UPLC columns.
Turning to our systems that incorporate mass spectrometry technology, we saw higher sales growth for our SYNAPT G2 and Xevo G2 platforms. Our Xevo TQ-S, which is a new high performance tandem quadrupole system that was introduced at this year's ASMS Conference, incorporates innovative ion optics that helps deliver industry-leading tandem quadrupole sensitivity for the most demanding quantitative analysis.
I am pleased to tell you that we began shipping the Xevo TQ-S late in the third quarter. We expect to ramp shipments in the fourth quarter to reduce our current order backlog and to fulfill new TQ-S orders that are booked in the quarter.
Our TA Division's organic sales grew more than 20% in the third quarter. As in the Waters Division, sales in the Americas and Asia were stronger than in Europe. In addition, sales growth was balanced across TA product line. 
During the third quarter, TA delivered this strong performance at the same time they were introducing a significant new product platform, the Discovery DSC. DSC, for those of you who are interested, is differential scanning calorimetry and it accounts for a meaningful proportion of this Division's overall sales and the new Discovery DSC offers a level or precision, accuracy and sensitivity not available from any other research-grade DSC instrument. We are confident that with the introduction of the Discovery DSC, TA will further solidify its leading market position in 2011.
Though John will soon be walking you through the details of our financial results, I'd like to highlight a few points at this time.
Our financial performance in the third quarter demonstrates the operational strength and versatility of our organization. In the quarter, we delivered an impressive adjusted EPS growth of 21% and have set the stage for full year 2010 free cash flow that's roughly $400 million.
You look more broadly at our business including our plans for capital allocation and I feel very comfortable with the path that we are on. We will continue to stay conservative on the M&A front, we'll make the investments required to maintain our technological leadership and deploy excess free cash toward our ongoing share repurchases, a program that over the past several years has reduced our outstanding share count by more than a third.
Lastly, I want to reiterate our growing confidence in top line growth in the upcoming quarters. We acknowledge the concerns that are prevalent regarding the tightening of global government spending programs and the potential for near-term slower growth in specific countries. However, overall demand in our opinion is continuing to improve and we feel that our products and market positions are sufficiently strong to grow our sales at a higher than market rate as we look toward 2011.
With that, I'd now like to turn it over to John for the financial details.

On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.02 this quarter compared to $0.7",966,"Thank you, Doug and good morning. Third quarter sales increased by 7% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 21% at $0.98 this quarter compared to earnings of $0.81 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.02 this quarter compared to $0.79 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.
This quarter's GAAP results contain the effects of two audit settlements resulting from concluded audits in the U.K. and with the State of Delaware. The net of these settlements increased EPS by $0.06 this quarter.
Reviewing Q3 sales results compared to Q3 last year, sales were up 9% this quarter before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth by 2% this quarter. 
Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 11%, Europe sales were down 3%, sales within Japan were up 3%, and sales in Asia, outside of Japan, were up 28%.
Turning to the product front, within the Waters Division, instrument systems sales increased by 9% and recurring revenues grew by 6% this quarter before foreign exchange effects. Within our TA Instruments Division, sales continued to grow strongly and increased by 21% versus prior year.
Now I would like to comment on our Q3 non-GAAP reported financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in at 59.4%, a little lighter than expected, but up 40 basis points from Q3 last year. Gross margins were depressed a little this quarter, largely as a result of a product mix shift as we built a backlog of our higher margin tandem quadrupoles.
Foreign exchange translation was slightly less favorable than earlier anticipated as the stronger British pound reduced gross margins, but this was partially offset by a stronger yen this quarter. SG&A and R&D expenses increased about as expected and grew by 5% and 6%, respectively, this quarter compared to prior year. 
Our full year effective income tax rate came in better than projected at about 17%. A continued shift in estimated production levels in favor of our operations located in lower tax rate geographies reduced our anticipated full year tax rate by about 1%. The year-to-date effect of this change in the third quarter brought the quarter's rate down to 14.5%. This provided about $0.04 of benefit to our Q3 EPS.
On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $837 million and debt totaled $792 million, bringing us to a net cash position of about $45 million. On the stock buyback front, we continued to purchase our shares in the open market, and during the second quarter we purchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock for $65 million.
We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus any non-cash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual non-recurring items. For Q3, free cash flow remained strong and came in at $84 million after funding $26 million of CapEx and adding back $1 million of non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Comparable free cash flow in Q3 last year was $102 million.
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 77 days this quarter, up 6 days versus Q3 last year. This quarter's shipments occurred later in the quarter as newly released products ramped up heavily in September and skewed our DSO comparison. We expect to see this metric improve as we exit the year.
Inventories were up $30 million from year end. Foreign currency translation increased inventories by $5 million and the remaining increase is related to an inventory build associated with the ramp up of our new products and the typical midyear inventory increase in preparation for larger Q4 shipments. Inventories are expected to drop back to more normal levels by year end.
As we look to the close of the year, our sales momentum continues to build as our new products continue to gain traction and customer demand continues to recover from the depressed levels we saw last year. The combination of generally stable demand across Q3 and into early Q4 and the order build coming into the quarter give us confidence that we should see our currency neutral sales grow between 7% and 8% for Q4.
This growth assumption contemplates the continuation of the sales trajectory we have seen through three quarters and adjusts for a bit stronger base of comparison in Q4 last year where business conditions began to improve. Currency at today's rates should add about 1% to sales growth in Q4.
Moving down to P&L, we expect gross margins on newly released products to be favorably affected by product cost reductions this quarter and current foreign exchange rates should provide for a favorable translation environment as well. Additionally, product mix is expected to be much more favorable in the fourth quarter as we significantly ramp up shipments of our new tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer. Gross margins in Q4 are expected to be between 60.5% and 61%.
Operating expenses are expected to grow at a slower rate than sales growth and net interest expense is expected to be approximately $3.5 million. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect our operating tax rate to be approximately 17%. Our fully diluted average outstanding share count for Q4 is currently estimated to be about 93 million shares. Rolling all of these together, we currently expect our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for Q4 to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.33 per share.
For the full year then, we expect organic sales growth of about 8%, currency translation at today's level is expected to be about neutral to sales growth for the full year and our full year non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $4 and $4.05 per fully diluted share.
Doug?

We are seeing a number--in the last year or so, we have seen more of our competitors meaningfully start to talk about UPLC. However, in almost all of those cases, we continue to see our customers go through many of the same evaluation procedures, long-term evaluation procedures that they went through with ACQUITY for us many years ago. So the actual uptake in the competitors we still think is pretty slow, but it's clearly changing the share of mind with customers to focus more on the UPLC technology rather than the traditional HPLC technology. We're clearly seeing more and more examples of our customers saying to us things like, 'We are not going to invest any more strategic monies in HPLC, we're only adding more technology in the UPLC arena.' 
What is particularly encouraging is I'd say in the last two quarters and particularly in the third quarter where we have traditionally seen a greater level of uptake of ACQUITY in the front end of  both development activities and R&D, and less uptake in the regulated applications in pharmaceutical QA/QC, we're now seeing a much stronger uptake in that downstream activities in QA/QC and that, of course, has a higher preponderance of instrumentation there and that's why you hear us to be optimistic about the long-term dynamics of that move into UPLC in those regulated applications.

I think if you look at it geographically, I'd say, what you see now is pretty much what we expect, maybe improving a little bit as we move into 2011. We continue to see very strong conditions throughout Asia. We continue to see strong conditions in the generic drug accounts in India, and we see a fairly significant improving situation in the Unites States, where in the past 12 months we've moved from low single digit activity levels, moving up towards the double-digit activity levels. If you look at it from a product and technology perspective, the reaction to H-Class is probably the single most important thing on the chromatography side. We are very, very pleased with the reaction that we've had from that, from our traditional HPLC customers. I think there's no question with that offering, we're well ahead of the competitive offerings. 
In the same way, coming out of ASM, as in particular, with both our high-end QToF like SYNAPT and G2 applications, and importantly, with this new TQ-S tandem quadrupole, our initial reactions on the part of both our accounts and competitive accounts makes us pretty confident that those products have strong legs going into 2011. So, geographically and in product position, we you look at it from a customer point of view. We're still probably most cautious about government spending, particularly in Western Europe, but outside of Western Europe that government academic community continues to look reasonably robust to us.

I wouldn't point to any of the large territories being meaningful points off the line. They are all kind of in that flattish overall demand arena. I think, interestingly, if you look at the pharmaceutical marketplace, it's important to know that a lot of those pharmaceutical customers are outsourcing significant parts. You probably saw that Sanofi Covance announcement of earlier this quarter. And that's just one example of big pharma moving some of their operations to third-parties and in many cases, to non-Western Europe geographies. So, they are moving it into Eastern Europe, Poland, Czech, and in some cases, into Asia. So, the capital is still maybe coming from the big pharma in Western Europe, but we would score that revenue outside those traditional areas. So, it gets a little bit hazy when we talk about how did big pharma react in a particular quarter versus specialty pharma or third-party testing laboratories. We know that that dynamic has been operating and probably is operating at a higher degree because we are doing very well with some of these outsourced third-party testing laboratories. So, that just muddies the picture a little bit. In the applied markets, we're seeing pretty good performance in the European theater, and again, we're most cautious about those things that rely on government spending. It remains to be seen just how much available government money there will be as we go into 2011. Right now, we'd say we're thinking whether the current momentum is going to continue.

It's been somewhat difficult to call the pattern of big pharma capital spending. We're seeing more diversity in a lot of these large accounts in terms of when they are releasing their capital budgets and we are seeing particularly in the past 9 to 12 months we had several big mergers going on and the pace at which they resolve their organizational strategies and their spending strategies varies. One of the things we saw this quarter was that some of the companies that were undergoing those merger activities came out of it earlier and started to spend some capital with us. I'd say that might have been the single most positive dynamic that spending that we thought might come earlier in the year didn't come and it started to come in reasonable amounts in the third quarter from those large pharma accounts.

The service revenue is a slower growth than the consumables business and I think what's positive is that our consumables business has built momentum from the beginning of the year. Again, the service business is a little bit bigger than the chemistry business, but that chemistry business driven I think by the success of UPLC, the H-Class and the ACQUITY technologies, as well as the return of things like the generic drug business in India, so that our sample prep business is growing very nicely, so that business started off reasonably strong in the quarter and continued at a good pace, so I think it's very encouraging. Last year, during the downturn our chemical business, which as you may remember, is our most profitable in terms of its operating margins, slowed and now we're seeing a very positive track that I think continues as we go into 2011.

We've been changing out demand to the new TQ-S so that we've been shipping many fewer of the legacy product, obviously, as we've been building a backlog as this product has been making its way from R&D into production. So, the lack of that bolus of high-end triples in the base caused about almost a 50 basis point reduction in our overall margins in the quarter versus a traditional mix in the base year. 
The other thing, the other piece, which is a little bit more of a net, is that we did see a bit of a strengthening of the pound across the quarter versus where we started. That raised the cost of some of the high-end mass spec coming out of the UK upon translation. That was offset to some extent with the strengthening yen, but the net effect of both of those was to reduce our overall margin associated with FX by about 10 to 20 basis points. So, between those two, that's the difference between a 60% margin that we had been running closer to versus a 59.4%.

As we look at how much of that dynamic winds up in the inventory at the end of the quarter, how much of a sales effect flows through to bottom line is a simultaneous equation, all of that came together to be a little less favorable than we might have expected. We think that all washes through in a more positive dynamic in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year.

I think when you hear us about growing confidence, we're growing confident about our ability to sustain that high single digit level of business and what would it take to get us more confident over and above that is a sustained picture that the H-Class is having the broad effect in the marketplace of moving the HPLC market more aggressively into a UPLC phenomenon. That's probably the single most important element I think. 
We're seeing very nice dynamics in that, but if it's as good as we think it is and is broad, then that will move that picture up. We're also in the front end of what we think is this mass spectrometry, particularly the relatively higher end mass spectrometry. We are seeing--even with a relatively weak Western Europe picture, we are seeing record intake of orders on high-end mass spectrometry. It's very strong reaction to our new products and so, we're really only seeing about a little over a quarter of that. As we move into next year that dynamic could be very significant. I think that's most of it. 
We've seen a quarter and a half of strength in the U.S. market, if we're right and that momentum continues a pace, then you're going to see full year of that dynamic next year. We anticipate that the U.S. applied markets in the food and beverage area has a great deal of opportunity for us.

I'd say we are anticipating that the strength that we see in Asia continues. I think that's a fair conclusion. It's not without certain risks, but I think it's not a huge risk that we'll see much disruption to the momentum that we're seeing in Asia.

Actually H-Class is what we would describe within our organization as a zero lag launch, which meant that product was introduced worldwide within a three-week time period. Within that three-week, every field person was trained, every demonstration lab was equipped with demonstration units and the product was available for delivery within 30 days. So, it was a broad-based introduction, we've seen broad-based sales in that product, and to be totally frank, the ramp up in adoption of that product, a large piece of that was - keep in mind we had about seven years of the traditional ACQUITY being sold globally and that product basically in that phase was utilized to establish the transition for methods into the routine and downstream applications. The arrival of H-class was essentially looked on as an excellent implementation tool that could do both, HPLC or UPLC, and enable that implementation and we saw that largely from a broad base. Some markets are slower to adopt newer technology like this as you get into some of the emerging markets, but we have sales across every segment globally with that particular product.

The other opportunities for TA in India are in industrial applications and those are smaller served markets for us. So, you would never expect TA to have anywhere near the same size business that Waters has. On the other hand, the China opportunities are significant. In fact, the TA growth in China, as well as in other areas of Asia, is very strong, probably the strongest part of the geographies in the last two or three quarters.
