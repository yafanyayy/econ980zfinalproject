Our third quarter results built upon the successful performance we delivered in the first half of the fiscal year.

Our third quarter results built upon the successful performance we delivered in the first half of the fiscal year. Despite a market that is still on recovery, we achieved both solid business and financial performance in the third quarter. We're particularly pleased with the continuing ramp up in new business bookings, which we believe affirms the marketability and innovativeness of our expanding offerings and solution sets. These offerings, coupled with our focus on selected high-growth sectors, have increased our opportunity pipeline and positioned us for the accomplishment of our long-term financial objective of growth with improved profitability.Slide 5 summarizes the major highlights of the third quarter's performance. We achieved significant new business bookings, delivered solid EPS growth, continued to expand our operating margins, held year-over-year revenue stable, delivered cash performance ahead of our plan, and most importantly, we continue to deliver real results and value to our growing list of clients.Continually improving profitability has been a consistent objective of this management team. All three lines of business expanded operating margins sequentially, yielding an improvement of 110 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin improved 15 basis points. This continued expansion derives from improved operational performance, recurring benefits from our cost structure improvement programs and ongoing proactive management of expenses.We anticipate that the net effect of these efforts will be margin improvement at the upper end of our target range of 25 to 50 basis points for the full fiscal year. Revenue of $4 billion, net of a non-core disposition, was in line with our expectation and on track with our full year guidance of $16 billion to $16.5 billion. We anticipate a ramping up of revenues in our fourth quarter, with about half of the growth coming from seasonal productivity factors and the rest coming from a combination of existing contract growth and new business wins.  Mike Mancuso will have more in-depth review of our third quarter results in his commentary.Turning to Slide 6, in New Business Bookings, as I said earlier, new business bookings continued at a robust pace, reflecting continuing demand for CSC's innovative solutions and mission-critical delivery. For the third quarter, we delivered bookings of $6.8 billion. This result is up $4.1 billion over last year's third quarter performance and also up $2.2 billion sequentially.Year-to-date, through the third quarter, new business bookings totaled $14.9 billion, which puts us in an excellent position to meet or exceed our bookings guidance of $17 billion to $18 billion for the full year. In aggregate, new business awards give us a positive book-to-revenue ratio of 1.7 for the third quarter and 1.3 year-to-date.Importantly, we're also growing our client base. Through the third quarter, we have signed over 96 new client accounts across our commercial businesses. Our strong book-to-revenue ratios and our expanding set of clients will contribute to the fiscal year revenue growth profile.Within our lines of business, our Managed Services Sector posted strong third quarter bookings of $5.2 billion, including new client wins, as well as the extension and expansion of our work with Raytheon and Zurich Financial Services. Through the end of the third quarter, MSS bookings totaled $6.6 billion. This is a 57% increase over last year's sum of $4.2 billion.NPS [North American Public Sector] bookings of $800 million were modest for the quarter, reflecting the delay of approximately $2.7 billion of awards expected to occur within our third quarter. These delays, plus the additional delays from the protest of announced awards, have elongated the Federal procurement process for the industry as a whole. For CSC, these delays impacted both our bookings and our revenue for the quarter. However, for year-to-date through the end of the third quarter, NPS bookings of $5.7 billion in new business and achieved a constructive book-to-revenue ratio of 1.2.Moving to Slide 7, I'd like to share our perspective on the market and comment on our business outlook. Across our global commercial businesses, we continue to see encouraging signs of market recovery. More specifically, the pipeline of our Managed Services business remains strong, with about $14 billion in opportunities scheduled to be decided by the end of our fiscal year '11. For the fourth quarter, we expect MSS to deliver continued new business success and positive sequential and year-over-year revenue growth.The Outsourcing market, including application, appears stronger than it has been for the last two years. And we anticipate that clients' escalating concerns with vendor lock-in and their growing interest in Trusted Cloud, virtualization, hosting and system management solutions and services will continue to fuel our bookings. The growing concern and visibility regarding cyber-security issues is also a significant opportunity for us. We are leveraging our considerable government expertise to assist commercial clients in the protection of their computing environments, networks, data and applications.Our Business Solutions and Services line of business has, for the most part, remain stable, with increasing signs of recovery in the transformation and application space. Overall, utilization has been stable for three quarters, with an expected uptick in Q4. Pipeline activity is headed in a positive direction, although geographic markets are at different stages of recovery. Within EMEA, we're seeing a steady market in France and an improving markets in the United Kingdom and the Nordics. Public sector demand is particularly strong in the U.K. and France. Australia's economy appears to be back to its trend growth, and Asia is leading the economic recovery. Economics uncertainties continue to impact the German and some U.S. markets.In Latin America, the integration of our recent acquisition in Brazil has been well received by customers in that market. And we recently closed two significant ERP integration contracts with Brazilian utilities. We also signed several ERP integration engagements in France, with clients in manufacturing, pharmaceutical and construction industries. We view these transformational initiatives as a constructive sign of market recovery.For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that BSS revenues will show a positive growth sequentially and year-over-year. The degree of growth will be influenced by client's confidence as they begin to eschew their budgets within their new calendar years. We continue to believe the drivers for their budget initiatives will remain cost control and regulatory compliance, along with the gradual return to those transformational initiatives that improve compare to the market position and grow their businesses.Our MPS [Managed Print Services] new business pipeline remains strong, with some $21 billion awards currently scheduled to be announced by the end of our fiscal year '11. Our pipeline includes 33 qualified opportunities, over $100 million in value and provides us with a platform for revenue growth. Our initial evaluation of the newly-released Obama budget renews our confidence that the breadth of our market footprint and our selected strategic focus areas should enable us to deliver continued growth, as the administration's priorities shift spending profiles.The administration has described spending in terms of two categories: Security and non-security spending. Security spending will increase about 5% to $719 billion, while non-security spending will decrease by about $5 billion or 1% to $441 billion. Our strong business base across all areas related to security will benefit, as Defense, Intelligence and Homeland Security budgets remain intact or are increased. In the non-security area, most agencies' budgets are expected to be frozen. Here, we see opportunities for growth by targeting initiatives in those specific areas where funding is provided. To illustrate, the new NASA budget realigns the manned space flight budget elements and direct spending towards research and development, rather than building vehicles. This is a positive for service providers rather than for hardware platform providers. Additionally, the Science budget, particularly for earth sciences is increased. And we view climate change and the supporting science as a future growth area.Lastly, major IT consolidation programs do not seem to be affected in any major way. Other civil areas offering growth potential for CSC include a whole range of health initiatives, among others.The President's budget specifically included $79.4 billion for IT. Key projects in this portion of the budget include initiatives in cloud computing, cyber security, procurement transparency, performance management and data center consolidation. Our high-growth initiatives are well aligned with these specific areas of spending increases. Within the new budget, there are proposed terminations, savings and reductions affecting some 126 programs. These targeted areas of spending decline move [ph] to have little to no impact on our business.Lastly, the administration's new budget proposal also calls for a significant increase in the size of the acquisition workforce, which will hopefully address the issues of procurement delays and protest I mentioned earlier.Overall, we expect to see continued opportunity and success in the U.S. Federal market and an expanding presence in state and local markets. Led by our high-growth initiatives, we believe that the U.S. public sector will continue to be a healthy productive market for CSC. To that end, we expect MPS to deliver mid-single digit growth this fiscal year and mid- to upper-single digit growth next fiscal year.A few words on the NHS [National Health Service)] program, within our NHS program, we continue to deliver and expand our production operations. In the third quarter, three additional trusts went live on Lorenzo Release 1, bringing the total number of Lorenzo production sites to seven, with several more in flight. For our healthcare solution for general practitioners, we now have over 1,100 systems in production operations supporting over 458,000 active users who provide care for over 15 million English citizens. As we discussed on our last call, we successfully went live with the Lorenzo Care Management at Bury. Our next significant NHS event is the planned appointment of Lorenzo Care Management at Morecambe Bay. This is scheduled to occur towards the end of our fourth quarter, and we are currently on track. Lastly, we're in discussion with NHS authority regarding the government's announced intention to reduce the spending profile of their overall program. We expect to achieve an outcome regarding CSC's portion of the program that is constructive for all parties by the end of the fourth quarter.Looking forward, our third quarter results enable us to reaffirm our full year guidance for all key financial metrics and to guide to the upper end of our EPS range.  At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mancuso for further detail on this quarter's financials and for our outlook for the fourth quarter and our full year."
263093,97562425,49329,"Computer Sciences Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Feb-10-2010",2010-02-10,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before I get into the numbers, as most of you are aware, the timing of this year's press release and analyst call marks a significant departure from CSC's past practice. Historically, we have released",1427,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before I get into the numbers, as most of you are aware, the timing of this year's press release and analyst call marks a significant departure from CSC's past practice. Historically, we have released our financial results at the end of the day after the market closed, and then almost immediately thereafter, initiating the call. That of course did not allow much time for you to parse the numbers and formulate your questions. Hopefully, this current routine will help facilitate more targeted discussions. In any event, we certainly invite your feedback on the timing of this call. Now I'll get to the numbers. First of all, as Mike Laphen does, I feel very good about the quarter. We are on track to meet or beat all of the financial targets we set for ourselves this year. And as you'll see, we are further strengthening the balance sheet and are very well positioned for next year. If you'll turn to Chart 9, Chart 9 delineates what we see as the more significant accomplishments in the quarter. Mike has already addressed the new business awards, so I won't dwell further on that, except to suggest that this bodes well for our future revenue growth.As you can see, EPS of $1.36. That's about $0.11 higher than the top end of our guidance. I'll have more to say about this. Our tax rate for the quarter has dropped by roughly eight percentage points from our previous estimate. And our annual rate will drop from our previously-discussed 28% to 24%. Sequential revenue stability, sequentially for the first three quarters of this year, our revenue has been at constant at roughly $4 billion per quarter. And our third quarter revenue was comparable to last year. We view this stable revenue as a positive in a difficult economic times. And as you'll see later, we do anticipate meaningful revenue growth in our fourth quarter.  Operating income growth and margin rate improvement, operating income is up both sequentially and year-over-year and the same is true of our margin rates. And we remain on track to achieve the high end of our full year guidance.Now if you'll turn to Chart 10, Revenue by Line of Business (sic) [Revenue by Lines of Business], you can see the third quarter sector revenue this year is comparable to last year. In NPS, the delayed new program starts and protest had slowed growth. MSS, slightly higher than last year, has been able to offset the impact of contract completions and scope reductions by troubled clients. And BSS, most impacted by the economic downturn, is holding its own, and in fact, has been able to offset about a $40 million reduction in revenue due to having sold our value-added reseller business in Hong Kong at the end of last year.Chart 11 shows income by line of business. MSS and BSS are comparable to last year, with the uptick provided by NPS. Roughly, one full percentage point of NPS' margin or about $14 million is attributable to a net one-time pickup from a contract modification. And anticipating questions along these lines, I can tell you that we do expect further margin rate expansion in MSS and BSS in the fourth quarter, coupled with revenue growth. And as I said earlier, we also expect to meet our 25 to 50 basis point margin improvement goal for this fiscal year, more likely closer to a 50-basis point gain. Chart 12, Selected Financial Information, gives you the snapshot high-level P&L. Increased operating income and $11 million favorable swing in other income and the tax rate change drive the EPS growth.Chart 13, the Selected Balance Sheet Items, the short message on this chart is that we have more cash, improved the receivables, less debt and our debt-to-capital ratios have improved.Chart 14, which displays our days receivable outstanding (sic) [days sales outstanding] or DSOs, reflects the continuing improvement in receivables. In absolutes, we are five days better than last year. On average, six days better; and thus, in position to meet our annual goal of at least a five-day reductionChart 15, Selected Cash Flow Items, what this Chart doesn't show is where we are relative to our internal plan. We are almost $200 million favorable to our internal plan and expect to meet our full year goal of free cash flow at or above 90% of net income. As you can see, when compared to last year, net earnings are higher, depreciation is lower, capital expenditures are also lower. The non-receivables portion of working capital has increased, and that's predominantly work-in-process, lower advances and accrued expenses.  And to reiterate, we fully expect to meet our annual cash flow guidance of free cash flow in excess of 90% of net income. Now that brings us to Chart 16 and a discussion of EPS, including a forecast for the fourth quarter. If you will focus on quarter 3, you can see the $1.36 result. And as indicated below the bar, our guidance was between $1.20 and $1.25. So we exceeded the high end of our guidance by $0.11.Looking ahead to quarter 4, we are forecasting $1.37, which is within our guidance. Now included in the $1.37 estimate are two unrelated discretionary actions that, when combined, lower EPS by approximately $0.33. You can see on the bar, and as I understand it may be difficult to see from the webcast charts, the very top end of that fourth quarter bar, would've been higher than $1.37 by about $0.33 if we did not intend to execute these discretionary items.The two items I referred to as discretionary are a discretionary contribution of $25 million to our 401(k) plan and the early retirement of $500 million of 7 3/8% coupon term notes that are otherwise due in June of 2011. We have considered the 401(k) contribution throughout this year, and it was embodied in the contribution guidance we discussed on this call in May of last year, when we announced the freeze of our U.S. defined benefit plan.The debt retirement increases interest expense in the fourth quarter by about $45 million and lowers FY '11's interest expense by a comparable amount. Whether or not we replace that debt with additional borrowings next year is yet to be determined, as we are working our way through our FY '11 detailed financial plans. So if you'll now turn to Chart 17, it reflects a full year EPS of $4.98, which is at the high end of our guidance.Chart 18 is the detailed P&L for the year, with the year-to-date actual on the left through the third quarter and the details of our fourth quarter estimate. For the fourth quarter estimate, operating income and interest expense are highlighted. Revenue for the quarter is estimated at $4.4 billion, roughly a 10% sequential increase and 7% above fourth quarter of last year.OI income of $445 million is net of the $25 million discretionary 401(k) contribution. Interest expense of $91 million includes the $45 million additional debt retirement-related interest expense.  The far right-hand column details our full year. Revenue, margin rate and EPS are all well within the guidance parameters we have shared with you throughout the year. And as far as next year is concerned, we think we are postured for meaningful revenue growth as the economic recovery continues. We do not intend on this call to offer any specific guidance or commentary regarding next year. That will come in our May call, when we wrap up this year and offer guidance on next year.Internally, we are in the early stages of our FY '11 detailed budget preparation, and that exercise will be completed in late March. However, there is one important aspect affecting next year that you should incorporate into your thinking. This year, our effective tax rate is roughly 24%. Next year's rate will likely be in the low-30s. 32% is probably a good number for now. Accelerating this term debt pay off will reduce interest expense next year, assuming for the moment no additional borrowings, somewhat offsetting the effect of the tax rate increase. So please keep that in mind as you think about next year.So on Chart 19, going into the fourth quarter, we feel good about this year and are well positioned going into next year. And to reiterate, we do expect to meet all the FY '10 financial guidance we set out earlier this year with more value to come.  So with that said, I'll turn it back to Bryan to begin the questions."

We exit fiscal year 2010 feeling very good about last year's performance, and we begin fiscal 2011 optimistic on the prospects for the new year.  Fueling our optimism are generally improving market conditions, along with our improved competitive position, validated by this year's record bookings. Our continued focus on meeting our customers' mission-critical requirements resulted in fiscal '10's successes highlighted on Slide 5.
As Mike Mancuso will detail shortly, CSC had a very solid fourth quarter and an outstanding fiscal year '10. All of the key financial metrics, including operating margin, free cash flow and earnings per share were impressive. We successfully managed through a period that was extremely challenging for both our clients and ourselves. Our marketplace and competitive landscape continues to evolve at a quickening pace. 
For its part, CSC enjoyed the most successful year of our 50-year history with respect to new business bookings. Led by significant awards with Zurich Financial Services Group, United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon, we closed fiscal year '10 with a record-high $19.2 billion in bookings. 70% of these bookings are attributable to new logos and/or new services. A testimonial, I believe, to our ability to innovate and adapt to an ever-changing environment.
Across the business, over 170 new logos were signed in fiscal year '10. The majority of these signings occurred in our third and fourth quarters, demonstrating real improvement in market conditions.  CSC also improved its position in the Fortune 500 standings by moving up to number 138. This progression was accompanied by a significant strengthening of our financial position as we materially reduced the long-term debt, while increasing our final cash balance to $2.8 billion, up almost $500 million year-over-year.
Notwithstanding the difficult economic times, we remain true to our strategic direction. We expanded our footprint in the growing markets of Latin America and China. Benefiting from strong marketplace synergies, we closed our first outsourcing deals since our recent acquisition in Brazil. A new service center in Tianjin, China expands our capabilities in this important market. We are also seeing a healthcare services market emerge in China, where with CSC is very well-positioned.
During fiscal year '10, we continued to expand and improve our product offerings across the business. This included new industry-specific offerings from each of our verticals and a comprehensive suite of cyber offerings to assist clients in protecting their most sensitive data and defeating emerging threats. We launched an integrated portfolio of applications offerings and an array of Trusted Cloud and hosting services. Five new managed services offerings were also developed, including an exciting new virtual desktop and dynamic server offerings. Our new business success in fiscal year '10 provides solid evidence that these new offerings are being well received, not just by industry analysts but by clients in the real marketplace.
Turning to Slide 6, I'd like to note the improvements we have achieved through our long-term focus on profitability. For the last several years, this management team has focused on improving the company's profitability, as well as cash performance and we have delivered real results. Operating margins again expanded this year, resulting in a 50 basis points improvement year-over-year. Over the last five years, our continuing long-term focus on profitability has elevated our operating margin some 195 basis points. 
These improvements have resulted from a host of factors, including improved operational execution, relocating work to wherever it is most efficiently and effectively performed, strictly managing our bids and bid decisions, exiting lower-margin businesses, improving the portfolio of business mix, and just proven old-fashioned monitoring and controlling costs, and we are not done. We've identified further fiscal year '11 initiatives in each of these areas, resulting in our guidance for an additional improvement in operating margin of 25 to 50 basis points.
Turning to Slide 7, in our status on the NHS [National Health Service] program. CSC now has a significant positive impact on the delivery of healthcare in England. Our deployed systems facilitate the provisioning of care to over 15 million of its citizens. Our NHS program was very active in fiscal year '10. We deployed our systems and solutions to an additional 320 general practitioners' offices, 11 hospices, seven child health systems, 16 prisons and 15 out-of-hours facilities. Through our PACS [Picture Archiving and
Communications Systems] contract, we now manage over 800 million digital medical images and studies. Through these deployments, we have created a significant install-based of healthcare solutions across the NHS in England.
Turning to secondary care in our Lorenzo solution and its releases, I'd like to provide an update as to our current status and plans. Our first release of Lorenzo was Release 1.0. The clinical functionality contained within this release is now installed and operational at seven NHS trusts. In sharp contrast to the first go-live events at the early adapters, Release 1 deployment now occur with little press, although they remain quite important to the facilities involved [ph]. This and the initial go-live events, all seven NHS trusts, have chosen to expand their use of the Release 1 system, providing evidence that the product is delivering real value. Release 1.9 is the backbone of Lorenzo solutions. 
Significantly, NHS Bury, a primary care trust, went live in November as the first early adopter to use Lorenzo's care management functionality. Substantial progress has been made on the high-profile deployment of Release 1.9 at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay. UHMB has successfully completed their evaluation program. As has been reported in the media, there was a successful dress rehearsal test concluded this past weekend. And we're planning for a go-live at the end of May on a three-day weekend. 
In addition, we are proceeding with deployment preparations at several other trusts for subsequent go-live events. We are seeing a growing demand for the Lorenzo solution, and expect that subsequent trust go-live dates will be confirmed over the next month. Successful deployment of Release 1.9 will fundamentally shift the focus of this portion of the NHS program from the early adopter phase to the full-scale program of deployment. Through these deployments, the benefits of the program will be realized by the NHS, its patients and CSC.
Elections were recently held in the U.K. and the change in the government has now taken place. The new government is looking to achieve budget efficiencies and value for money, while improving the services they deliver to their citizens. As you know, we've been engaged in contract realignment discussions that are consistent with these stated goals. With the changing government and personnel, we anticipate these discussions could extend into the summer months.
Moving to Slide 8. I would like to share our perspective of the market and comments on our business outlook. Of course our Global Commercial business, we continue to see positive signs of recovery. While conditions vary by geography and industry, discretionary projects are returning and customers are more actively engaging in exploration of newer initiatives. We are seeing the U.S. market recover faster than those of Europe with the manufacturer sector still lagging. As these vertical and consulting markets continue to recover, we are projecting positive top line growth in fiscal year '11. We've expanded our portfolio of industry-specific offerings, includes such varied value proposition to SAP's solutions for the fashion industry, petroleum enterprise intelligence for the digital oilfield and pre-built scalable PLM [product lifecycle management] appliances for the manufacturing sector. At the same time, market awareness of CSC continues to strengthen. We continue to receive independent third-party awards that serve to validate CSC's leadership position with an important vertical and consulting market segments and demonstrate the growing strength of our brand equity.
Our Outsourcing business remains strong. Applications, cloud computing, infrastructure virtualization and cybersecurity services are all active segments of the current market. We are also seeing the corporate restructuring resulting from the economic difficulty to the last two years, and stimulating demand for both BPO [business process outsourcing] and ITO [information technology outsourcing] services. Entering fiscal year '11, our qualified pipeline of outsourcing opportunities stands at $12 billion, up $2 billion year-over-year. Within our federal marketplace, federal budgets for Defense, Intelligence and Homeland Security remain constructive. While the headwinds of a prolonged federal procurement process persists, our Federal business pipeline remains strong with some $20 billion of awards currently scheduled to be announced by the end of fiscal year '11, again, up $4 billion year-over-year. This pipeline includes 41 qualified opportunities, over $100 million in value and provides us with a platform for revenue growth.
Turning to Slide 9. Fiscal year '10 was an excellent year for CSC. With the difficulties of the markets over the last several years, many of our competitors have disappeared or have assumed different identities. While our competitive landscape has changed dramatically, CSC is exiting fiscal year '10 as a stronger and better company than we were just one year ago. Our product lines have been strengthened, important business have been secured, our balance sheet has been materially improved and we are enhancing shareholder returns by declaring a dividend. This management team takes particular pride in the dividend announcement. The confidence that we can adequately fund the necessary investments in technology and strategic acquisitions, while enhancing our returns to investors is a direct result of our long-term focus on improving margin performance and cash generation.
Looking forward, we expect our progress to continue. We are projecting bookings in excess of $18 billion, top line growth of 4% to 7%, a further expansion of 25 to 50 basis points in operating margin, EPS of $5.30 to $5.40 and free cash flow greater than 90% of net income. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mancuso for further details on our fourth quarter, and our full year financials and our outlook for fiscal year '11."

As Mike Laphen indicated, we are extremely proud with our fourth quarter and full year results. In a tough economy, we did well, attribute to the strength and diversity of our business portfolio offerings and customer client confidence. 
If you'll turn to Chart 11, I'll quickly review our FY '10 accomplishments. Our revenue held steady sequentially quarter-after-quarter throughout the year, with a 7% sequential uptick in the fourth quarter. Our operating income increased each quarter sequentially, and our margin rate increased each quarter. Our strong free cash flow presented us with the opportunity to early retire $500 million of 7 3/8% coupon term debt, and to make approximately $200 million of additional deficit reducing defined benefit pension plan contributions. This was in addition to the $25 million discretionary 401(k)  contribution in this quarter that we discussed earlier in the year. 
It is also important to point out that while all this occurred, our ending fourth quarter cash balance is $500 million above our FY '10 starting point. We also demonstrated another four quarters of consistency and predictability in terms of meeting or beating our thrice-updated increased earnings guidance. And last but not least, our $19.2 billion of new business award well positions us for FY '11 and beyond.
Chart 12, essentially repeats what I just said, with one notable additional accomplishment. With the cooperation and understanding of our U.K. employees, we were able to successfully negotiate a freeze to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan effective this July. As we did with our U.S. plan last July, this removes the risk of a growing liability, which would otherwise require potentially significant cash contributions, as well as rising P&L expense. 
Now if you'll turn to Chart 13, which is really our report card P&L for the fourth quarter, comparing our actual results to the estimates I gave on this call three months ago. As you can see, our actual revenue of $4,236,000,000 is well within the $4.4 billion guidance. The causes of the variance are many, including the delayed NHS Morecambe Bay milestone. Our margin rate was on target. 
The increased EPS is a result of a lower tax rate. Our final tax rate for the full year is 19.7% versus the 24% annual rate embodied in our previous guidance.
Chart 14, depicts fourth quarter revenue by line of business. The year-over-year total increase of GAAP rates was driven by NPS [North American Public Sector] and MSS [Managed Services Sector]. The relative revenue percent contribution of each business is unchanged year-over-year.
Chart 15, reflects operating income by line of business. While year-over-year total revenue is higher, overall income is lower, primarily in BSS [Business Solutions and Services]. One of the more significant contributing factors is the $25 million discretionary 401(k) pension contribution expense from the FY '10 fourth quarter. And while the fourth quarter has a lower margin rate, our full year FY '10 rate increased by 50 basis points. And full year FY '10 operating income is above last year, despite revenue being lower by over $600 million.
Moving to Chart 16. Our EPS throughout FY '10 grew significantly as our tax rate decreased from our original guidance to 37%, to our final annual rate of 19.7%. If we adjusted the $5.28 EPS using the original 37.2% rate and added back the accelerated interest expense on the early debt retirement, you can see that we would have slightly exceeded our original midpoint guidance of $4.25, and important to point out for those who might otherwise suggest we got there through the tax rate. The obvious message is that we came in where we said we would. 
Chart 17, selected balance sheet items. I'd like you to focus on the shaded numbers in the Q4 FY '10 column. Our cash balance is about $500 million above last year. Accounts payable is a remarkable $227 million lower than last year. Remarkable in the sense that we exceeded our cash flow target without growing our accounts payable balance. This positions us for a better FY '11 free cash flow start and focus on our commitment to improve the quarterly volatility of inflows and outflows. And finally, you can see that the reduction in the debt balance, which manifests itself in a significant improvement in our leverage ratios.
Chart 18, delivers on another commitment we made to improve receivables and DSOs. We are four days better than a year ago and eight days better than last quarter.
Chart 19, displays selected cash flow items that make up free cash flow. As you can see this year, FY '10 working capital reductions fueled the performance.
Chart 21, lays out guidance for FY '11 and is relatively self-explanatory. The only point I would make is that implicit in the EPS range is a tax rate of 32%. And I'll be very disappointed if somebody doesn't have a question on tax rates.
Chart 22, is a comparison of EPS from FY '10 to the midpoint of our FY '11 guidance. The purpose of the chart is to point out that while our year-over-year FY '11 absolute EPS only increased to $0.07. If you'll apply the FY '11 tax rate to FY '10, the FY '11 EPS of $5.35 represents a 20% increase over FY '10.
Chart 23, gives you some idea how we see EPS rolling out by quarter in FY '11. This is our best guess at the time and, of course, could change. 
Before I get to my final summary chart and we open up the call for questions, I would like to offer some additional color around the NHS contract, its accounting and its general impact on our financials.  The NHS contract is essentially, not totally, but essentially, a long-term fixed-price contract accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis. Revenue and earnings are recognized upon completion of milestones, each of which have a predetermined value. The overall profitability of the contract is derived by comparing frequently updated estimates of total contract cost at completion to the latest negotiated contract value. 
Profitability is then expressed as a percentage of revenue, and incrementally recognized as the milestones complete. The Morecambe Bay go-live event is a milestone. Not a significant milestone in terms of revenue value, and its delay to late May had a relatively minor impact on our fourth quarter revenue and profitability.
As Mike Laphen pointed out, the progress in positive technical accomplishments of CSC and the NHS are frankly staggering. The deployments will begin in earnest by the end of FY '11. Throughout FY '10 we were, and in FY '11, expect to be cash neutral, meaning our balance sheet investment in the program is not expected to grow and will begin to decrease as deployments increase. The NHS is an important customer and we will continue to work hand-in-hand with the authority to ensure the continued success of the program. 
I hope you find it helpful in terms of how you should think about the NHS contract and to keep it in the proper context. We would also like to thank our investors and the sell-side community for your patience these last several weeks, leading up to this call. As you know, the regulations do not permit us to comment or discuss financial matters selectively with individual investors. Needless to say, it was difficult for us to remain silent, while the press speculated widely and inaccurately on the status of the NHS program.
So in summary, as Chart 24 suggests, we feel good about FY '10 performance. I think we substantially strengthened our business. We are excited about the dividend and excited about FY '11 outlook. We continue to remain committed to the principle of transparency. And it's our hope that this material supports that objective. That being said, I'll turn it back over to Bryan to begin the Q&A."

We're anticipating a more significant pickup in the second half of the fiscal year than the first half of the fiscal year. One of the indicators we saw was that the local wins that I was talking about earlier in my comments, the vast majority of those happened in the third and fourth quarter as opposed to the first and second quarter last year. So that was a clear indication that we're seeing people come back into the market. We're not seeing them come back in a big spending way yet.

So that, discretely then, defines what our obligation is to fully fund the obligation kind of thing. So we have a cash profile. I will tell you that we expect today, based on today's numbers, that the renegotiation of the plan over a five-year period should save us about $50 million or so in pension contributions over this five-year period, FY '11 to '15.

So we've re-won that, if you will, again and that's breaking news kind of thing. So as Mike indicated, we feel pretty good about NPS. In terms of constant currency, I'm looking at a detailed chart in front of me and it fundamentally says that -- and I probably was a little bit too aggressive in my earlier response, that we grow about 5% roughly in constant currency using the midpoint of our guidance. So since the midpoint of our -- since our guidance is 4% to 7% and the midpoint would be $17 billion of our guidance, it pretty much says that both at GAAP rates and constant currency, we're looking at the same kind of growth.

We've given you the window of 4% to 7%. And with what we know on currency today and the impact on currency that occurred since we put the budget process, we're still comfortable with that 4% to 7% range. I think what Mike was trying to say is if there's incremental negative impact on the currency, then we'd have to look at it at that point in time. But right now, we're comfortable in that 4% to 7% range that we've given you. In terms of the NPS, we're feeling pretty good about our NPS. We had bookings of $7 billion last year, that's a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15. We achieved a 90% win rate on our re-competes. We have a pipeline of $20 billion to be awarded by the end of the fiscal year, with $6.7 billion of that already in the evaluation stage. As Mike mentioned, just as late as yesterday, the Transportation Security Administration awarded us an almost $500 million contract. That's on the heels of the recently announced NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] contract for climate evaluation that was over $300 million. We believe we're extremely well situated in our high-budget areas for the government including cyber, health and data center consolidation. We have one of the Homeland Security's -- one of the two data centers where the consolidation would take place for the Homeland Security agency over the next several years. So we feel we're in very good position with NPS and I would emphasize a little bit that our moneys come not only from the IT budget but also from the O&M budget. And the O&M budget continues to be well supportive."

So you shouldn't imply from that because it didn't carry a lot of cash around with it, too. Looking at the balance sheet, most of the cash came from earnings and working capital improvement, again, in the face of not seeing a buildup in the quarter in our payables. So it was the old-fashion, hard way, frankly. Our receivables, obviously, improved. So beyond that, we're not getting into account-by-account, Karl. It was a growing achievement. It's not unnatural if you go back to our fourth quarter of last year. I believe our free cash flow number was over $1 billion in the quarter. So we're capable of significant improvement. Obviously, all we want to do is take some of the excitement out of it. And Karl, if I may, I just want to add to something Mike said and remind all of you -- the folks on the call. As we talked about constant currency, roughly round numbers, 40% of our revenue comes out of NPS, which is in, obviously, in U.S. dollars. So our exposure to currency fluctuations is not perhaps as significant as some of our competitors and respective peers, so another thing to keep in mind as folks have anxiety around currency fluctuations."

We exit fiscal year 2010 feeling very good about last year's performance, and we begin fiscal 2011 optimistic on the prospects for the new year.  Fueling our optimism are generally improving market conditions, along with our improved competitive position, validated by this year's record bookings. Our continued focus on meeting our customers' mission-critical requirements resulted in fiscal '10's successes highlighted on Slide 5.
As Mike Mancuso will detail shortly, CSC had a very solid fourth quarter and an outstanding fiscal year '10. All of the key financial metrics, including operating margin, free cash flow and earnings per share were impressive. We successfully managed through a period that was extremely challenging for both our clients and ourselves. Our marketplace and competitive landscape continues to evolve at a quickening pace. 
For its part, CSC enjoyed the most successful year of our 50-year history with respect to new business bookings. Led by significant awards with Zurich Financial Services Group, United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon, we closed fiscal year '10 with a record-high $19.2 billion in bookings. 70% of these bookings are attributable to new logos and/or new services. A testimonial, I believe, to our ability to innovate and adapt to an ever-changing environment.
Across the business, over 170 new logos were signed in fiscal year '10. The majority of these signings occurred in our third and fourth quarters, demonstrating real improvement in market conditions.  CSC also improved its position in the Fortune 500 standings by moving up to number 138. This progression was accompanied by a significant strengthening of our financial position as we materially reduced the long-term debt, while increasing our final cash balance to $2.8 billion, up almost $500 million year-over-year.
Notwithstanding the difficult economic times, we remain true to our strategic direction. We expanded our footprint in the growing markets of Latin America and China. Benefiting from strong marketplace synergies, we closed our first outsourcing deals since our recent acquisition in Brazil. A new service center in Tianjin, China expands our capabilities in this important market. We are also seeing a healthcare services market emerge in China, where with CSC is very well-positioned.
During fiscal year '10, we continued to expand and improve our product offerings across the business. This included new industry-specific offerings from each of our verticals and a comprehensive suite of cyber offerings to assist clients in protecting their most sensitive data and defeating emerging threats. We launched an integrated portfolio of applications offerings and an array of Trusted Cloud and hosting services. Five new managed services offerings were also developed, including an exciting new virtual desktop and dynamic server offerings. Our new business success in fiscal year '10 provides solid evidence that these new offerings are being well received, not just by industry analysts but by clients in the real marketplace.
Turning to Slide 6, I'd like to note the improvements we have achieved through our long-term focus on profitability. For the last several years, this management team has focused on improving the company's profitability, as well as cash performance and we have delivered real results. Operating margins again expanded this year, resulting in a 50 basis points improvement year-over-year. Over the last five years, our continuing long-term focus on profitability has elevated our operating margin some 195 basis points. 
These improvements have resulted from a host of factors, including improved operational execution, relocating work to wherever it is most efficiently and effectively performed, strictly managing our bids and bid decisions, exiting lower-margin businesses, improving the portfolio of business mix, and just proven old-fashioned monitoring and controlling costs, and we are not done. We've identified further fiscal year '11 initiatives in each of these areas, resulting in our guidance for an additional improvement in operating margin of 25 to 50 basis points.
Turning to Slide 7, in our status on the NHS [National Health Service] program. CSC now has a significant positive impact on the delivery of healthcare in England. Our deployed systems facilitate the provisioning of care to over 15 million of its citizens. Our NHS program was very active in fiscal year '10. We deployed our systems and solutions to an additional 320 general practitioners' offices, 11 hospices, seven child health systems, 16 prisons and 15 out-of-hours facilities. Through our PACS [Picture Archiving and
Communications Systems] contract, we now manage over 800 million digital medical images and studies. Through these deployments, we have created a significant install-based of healthcare solutions across the NHS in England.
Turning to secondary care in our Lorenzo solution and its releases, I'd like to provide an update as to our current status and plans. Our first release of Lorenzo was Release 1.0. The clinical functionality contained within this release is now installed and operational at seven NHS trusts. In sharp contrast to the first go-live events at the early adapters, Release 1 deployment now occur with little press, although they remain quite important to the facilities involved [ph]. This and the initial go-live events, all seven NHS trusts, have chosen to expand their use of the Release 1 system, providing evidence that the product is delivering real value. Release 1.9 is the backbone of Lorenzo solutions. 
Significantly, NHS Bury, a primary care trust, went live in November as the first early adopter to use Lorenzo's care management functionality. Substantial progress has been made on the high-profile deployment of Release 1.9 at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay. UHMB has successfully completed their evaluation program. As has been reported in the media, there was a successful dress rehearsal test concluded this past weekend. And we're planning for a go-live at the end of May on a three-day weekend. 
In addition, we are proceeding with deployment preparations at several other trusts for subsequent go-live events. We are seeing a growing demand for the Lorenzo solution, and expect that subsequent trust go-live dates will be confirmed over the next month. Successful deployment of Release 1.9 will fundamentally shift the focus of this portion of the NHS program from the early adopter phase to the full-scale program of deployment. Through these deployments, the benefits of the program will be realized by the NHS, its patients and CSC.
Elections were recently held in the U.K. and the change in the government has now taken place. The new government is looking to achieve budget efficiencies and value for money, while improving the services they deliver to their citizens. As you know, we've been engaged in contract realignment discussions that are consistent with these stated goals. With the changing government and personnel, we anticipate these discussions could extend into the summer months.
Moving to Slide 8. I would like to share our perspective of the market and comments on our business outlook. Of course our Global Commercial business, we continue to see positive signs of recovery. While conditions vary by geography and industry, discretionary projects are returning and customers are more actively engaging in exploration of newer initiatives. We are seeing the U.S. market recover faster than those of Europe with the manufacturer sector still lagging. As these vertical and consulting markets continue to recover, we are projecting positive top line growth in fiscal year '11. We've expanded our portfolio of industry-specific offerings, includes such varied value proposition to SAP's solutions for the fashion industry, petroleum enterprise intelligence for the digital oilfield and pre-built scalable PLM [product lifecycle management] appliances for the manufacturing sector. At the same time, market awareness of CSC continues to strengthen. We continue to receive independent third-party awards that serve to validate CSC's leadership position with an important vertical and consulting market segments and demonstrate the growing strength of our brand equity.
Our Outsourcing business remains strong. Applications, cloud computing, infrastructure virtualization and cybersecurity services are all active segments of the current market. We are also seeing the corporate restructuring resulting from the economic difficulty to the last two years, and stimulating demand for both BPO [business process outsourcing] and ITO [information technology outsourcing] services. Entering fiscal year '11, our qualified pipeline of outsourcing opportunities stands at $12 billion, up $2 billion year-over-year. Within our federal marketplace, federal budgets for Defense, Intelligence and Homeland Security remain constructive. While the headwinds of a prolonged federal procurement process persists, our Federal business pipeline remains strong with some $20 billion of awards currently scheduled to be announced by the end of fiscal year '11, again, up $4 billion year-over-year. This pipeline includes 41 qualified opportunities, over $100 million in value and provides us with a platform for revenue growth.
Turning to Slide 9. Fiscal year '10 was an excellent year for CSC. With the difficulties of the markets over the last several years, many of our competitors have disappeared or have assumed different identities. While our competitive landscape has changed dramatically, CSC is exiting fiscal year '10 as a stronger and better company than we were just one year ago. Our product lines have been strengthened, important business have been secured, our balance sheet has been materially improved and we are enhancing shareholder returns by declaring a dividend. This management team takes particular pride in the dividend announcement. The confidence that we can adequately fund the necessary investments in technology and strategic acquisitions, while enhancing our returns to investors is a direct result of our long-term focus on improving margin performance and cash generation.
Looking forward, we expect our progress to continue. We are projecting bookings in excess of $18 billion, top line growth of 4% to 7%, a further expansion of 25 to 50 basis points in operating margin, EPS of $5.30 to $5.40 and free cash flow greater than 90% of net income. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mancuso for further details on our fourth quarter, and our full year financials and our outlook for fiscal year '11.

As Mike Laphen indicated, we are extremely proud with our fourth quarter and full year results.

As Mike Laphen indicated, we are extremely proud with our fourth quarter and full year results. In a tough economy, we did well, attribute to the strength and diversity of our business portfolio offerings and customer client confidence. 
If you'll turn to Chart 11, I'll quickly review our FY '10 accomplishments. Our revenue held steady sequentially quarter-after-quarter throughout the year, with a 7% sequential uptick in the fourth quarter. Our operating income increased each quarter sequentially, and our margin rate increased each quarter. Our strong free cash flow presented us with the opportunity to early retire $500 million of 7 3/8% coupon term debt, and to make approximately $200 million of additional deficit reducing defined benefit pension plan contributions. This was in addition to the $25 million discretionary 401(k)  contribution in this quarter that we discussed earlier in the year. 
It is also important to point out that while all this occurred, our ending fourth quarter cash balance is $500 million above our FY '10 starting point. We also demonstrated another four quarters of consistency and predictability in terms of meeting or beating our thrice-updated increased earnings guidance. And last but not least, our $19.2 billion of new business award well positions us for FY '11 and beyond.
Chart 12, essentially repeats what I just said, with one notable additional accomplishment. With the cooperation and understanding of our U.K. employees, we were able to successfully negotiate a freeze to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan effective this July. As we did with our U.S. plan last July, this removes the risk of a growing liability, which would otherwise require potentially significant cash contributions, as well as rising P&L expense. 
Now if you'll turn to Chart 13, which is really our report card P&L for the fourth quarter, comparing our actual results to the estimates I gave on this call three months ago. As you can see, our actual revenue of $4,236,000,000 is well within the $4.4 billion guidance. The causes of the variance are many, including the delayed NHS Morecambe Bay milestone. Our margin rate was on target. 
The increased EPS is a result of a lower tax rate. Our final tax rate for the full year is 19.7% versus the 24% annual rate embodied in our previous guidance.
Chart 14, depicts fourth quarter revenue by line of business. The year-over-year total increase of GAAP rates was driven by NPS [North American Public Sector] and MSS [Managed Services Sector]. The relative revenue percent contribution of each business is unchanged year-over-year.
Chart 15, reflects operating income by line of business. While year-over-year total revenue is higher, overall income is lower, primarily in BSS [Business Solutions and Services]. One of the more significant contributing factors is the $25 million discretionary 401(k) pension contribution expense from the FY '10 fourth quarter. And while the fourth quarter has a lower margin rate, our full year FY '10 rate increased by 50 basis points. And full year FY '10 operating income is above last year, despite revenue being lower by over $600 million.
Moving to Chart 16. Our EPS throughout FY '10 grew significantly as our tax rate decreased from our original guidance to 37%, to our final annual rate of 19.7%. If we adjusted the $5.28 EPS using the original 37.2% rate and added back the accelerated interest expense on the early debt retirement, you can see that we would have slightly exceeded our original midpoint guidance of $4.25, and important to point out for those who might otherwise suggest we got there through the tax rate. The obvious message is that we came in where we said we would. 
Chart 17, selected balance sheet items. I'd like you to focus on the shaded numbers in the Q4 FY '10 column. Our cash balance is about $500 million above last year. Accounts payable is a remarkable $227 million lower than last year. Remarkable in the sense that we exceeded our cash flow target without growing our accounts payable balance. This positions us for a better FY '11 free cash flow start and focus on our commitment to improve the quarterly volatility of inflows and outflows. And finally, you can see that the reduction in the debt balance, which manifests itself in a significant improvement in our leverage ratios.
Chart 18, delivers on another commitment we made to improve receivables and DSOs. We are four days better than a year ago and eight days better than last quarter.
Chart 19, displays selected cash flow items that make up free cash flow. As you can see this year, FY '10 working capital reductions fueled the performance.
Chart 21, lays out guidance for FY '11 and is relatively self-explanatory. The only point I would make is that implicit in the EPS range is a tax rate of 32%. And I'll be very disappointed if somebody doesn't have a question on tax rates.
Chart 22, is a comparison of EPS from FY '10 to the midpoint of our FY '11 guidance. The purpose of the chart is to point out that while our year-over-year FY '11 absolute EPS only increased to $0.07. If you'll apply the FY '11 tax rate to FY '10, the FY '11 EPS of $5.35 represents a 20% increase over FY '10.
Chart 23, gives you some idea how we see EPS rolling out by quarter in FY '11. This is our best guess at the time and, of course, could change. 
Before I get to my final summary chart and we open up the call for questions, I would like to offer some additional color around the NHS contract, its accounting and its general impact on our financials.  The NHS contract is essentially, not totally, but essentially, a long-term fixed-price contract accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis. Revenue and earnings are recognized upon completion of milestones, each of which have a predetermined value. The overall profitability of the contract is derived by comparing frequently updated estimates of total contract cost at completion to the latest negotiated contract value. 
Profitability is then expressed as a percentage of revenue, and incrementally recognized as the milestones complete. The Morecambe Bay go-live event is a milestone. Not a significant milestone in terms of revenue value, and its delay to late May had a relatively minor impact on our fourth quarter revenue and profitability.
As Mike Laphen pointed out, the progress in positive technical accomplishments of CSC and the NHS are frankly staggering. The deployments will begin in earnest by the end of FY '11. Throughout FY '10 we were, and in FY '11, expect to be cash neutral, meaning our balance sheet investment in the program is not expected to grow and will begin to decrease as deployments increase. The NHS is an important customer and we will continue to work hand-in-hand with the authority to ensure the continued success of the program. 
I hope you find it helpful in terms of how you should think about the NHS contract and to keep it in the proper context. We would also like to thank our investors and the sell-side community for your patience these last several weeks, leading up to this call. As you know, the regulations do not permit us to comment or discuss financial matters selectively with individual investors. Needless to say, it was difficult for us to remain silent, while the press speculated widely and inaccurately on the status of the NHS program.
So in summary, as Chart 24 suggests, we feel good about FY '10 performance. I think we substantially strengthened our business. We are excited about the dividend and excited about FY '11 outlook. We continue to remain committed to the principle of transparency. And it's our hope that this material supports that objective. That being said, I'll turn it back over to Bryan to begin the Q&A.

I think fortunately for us, we play on both the outsourcing world and the consulting and services world. We're continuing to see a significant appetite for outsourcing opportunities in Europe. And I think if the market does erode there, I think, we'll see continued and maybe even greater strength in the outsourcing market, which will offset, I think, to a significant portion on the discretionary side.

And kidding aside, we're still trying to clean up the mess Bryan left. The reality is that what we know now, obviously, you know the company. We do business in almost 100 of taxing jurisdictions, et cetera, et cetera. We've had a history of a high tax rate, but for the last 24 or 36 months. So we're working diligently to position the corporation to pay only that amount of taxes that we're legally responsible to pay obviously. So we're restructuring the ownership of the corporation around the world to position us favorably in different jurisdictions, as our mix of income moves up and down, it's going to swing. And remind you that we're in the middle of the IRS audit of our 2005 to 2007 tax years. And we expect some things will come rolling out of that. So long-winded answer to tell you, today, 32% is a very good number. If you're asking me which direction it's going to go, I'm not going to try and speculate. But we're confident that that's the mark starting the year with. And as events mature, we'll see.

Specifically, the qualitative comments that you made seem to suggest a little bit of incremental improvement more so in the U.S. than Europe, which I guess isn't surprising to folks. But if you look at the numbers, the BSS bookings, I believe, in the March quarter were down about 10% or 11% year-over-year. Last year, was a pretty easy comparison. I think, that was kind of the depth and trough of the recession. So is this just an anomaly from a timing perspective? Is there anything company specific going on? Are there other factors that work here? I just want to get a sense of -- then looking forward, what kind of contributions to the total bookings target in fiscal '11 would you expect to come from BSS, and when we'll start seeing a pick up there here in the June quarter?

First of all, just to reaffirm my comment around the U.S. market, being a bit more robust than the European market, we are seeing pick up. We're not seeing large transformational opportunities popping on the horizon. We are getting more discretionary projects from an exploratory standpoint, so that's obviously helping us. We're anticipating a more significant pickup in the second half of the fiscal year than the first half of the fiscal year. One of the indicators we saw was that the local wins that I was talking about earlier in my comments, the vast majority of those happened in the third and fourth quarter as opposed to the first and second quarter last year. So that was a clear indication that we're seeing people come back into the market. We're not seeing them come back in a big spending way yet. But the exploratory projects, typically, to a pick up on bigger projects over time and we're painting that about a six-month window. In reality, I think, that will be driven very much by whether the recovery continues or whether recovery stumbles. That level of business is very dynamic.

And then secondly, could you give a little color around how we get to that 7%, 8% by business unit? And specifically, if you're still comfortable with a high-single digit growth rate funding in NPS unit?

One of the more recent events, recent in the last 24 hours, that adds to our confidence there is the announcement this morning from the TSA [Transportation Security Administration] that they have re-awarded to us the IT infrastructure contract that had been delayed by protest. So we've re-won that, if you will, again and that's breaking news kind of thing. So as Mike indicated, we feel pretty good about NPS. In terms of constant currency, I'm looking at a detailed chart in front of me and it fundamentally says that -- and I probably was a little bit too aggressive in my earlier response, that we grow about 5% roughly in constant currency using the midpoint of our guidance. So since the midpoint of our -- since our guidance is 4% to 7% and the midpoint would be $17 billion of our guidance, it pretty much says that both at GAAP rates and constant currency, we're looking at the same kind of growth. Now detail by quarter, I don't have that detail in front of me, Karl, how it's going to fluctuate either by quarter or by business. But in a macro sense, those are the kind of numbers we see, again, assuming what we know today.

We've given you the window of 4% to 7%. And with what we know on currency today and the impact on currency that occurred since we put the budget process, we're still comfortable with that 4% to 7% range. I think what Mike was trying to say is if there's incremental negative impact on the currency, then we'd have to look at it at that point in time. But right now, we're comfortable in that 4% to 7% range that we've given you. In terms of the NPS, we're feeling pretty good about our NPS. We had bookings of $7 billion last year, that's a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15. We achieved a 90% win rate on our re-competes. We have a pipeline of $20 billion to be awarded by the end of the fiscal year, with $6.7 billion of that already in the evaluation stage. As Mike mentioned, just as late as yesterday, the Transportation Security Administration awarded us an almost $500 million contract. That's on the heels of the recently announced NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] contract for climate evaluation that was over $300 million. We believe we're extremely well situated in our high-budget areas for the government including cyber, health and data center consolidation. We have one of the Homeland Security's -- one of the two data centers where the consolidation would take place for the Homeland Security agency over the next several years. So we feel we're in very good position with NPS and I would emphasize a little bit that our moneys come not only from the IT budget but also from the O&M budget. And the O&M budget continues to be well supportive.

So you shouldn't imply from that because it didn't carry a lot of cash around with it, too. Looking at the balance sheet, most of the cash came from earnings and working capital improvement, again, in the face of not seeing a buildup in the quarter in our payables. So it was the old-fashion, hard way, frankly. Our receivables, obviously, improved. So beyond that, we're not getting into account-by-account, Karl. It was a growing achievement. It's not unnatural if you go back to our fourth quarter of last year. I believe our free cash flow number was over $1 billion in the quarter. So we're capable of significant improvement. Obviously, all we want to do is take some of the excitement out of it. And Karl, if I may, I just want to add to something Mike said and remind all of you -- the folks on the call. As we talked about constant currency, roughly round numbers, 40% of our revenue comes out of NPS, which is in, obviously, in U.S. dollars. So our exposure to currency fluctuations is not perhaps as significant as some of our competitors and respective peers, so another thing to keep in mind as folks have anxiety around currency fluctuations.

We exit fiscal year 2010 feeling very good about last year's performance, and we begin fiscal year 2011 optimistic on the prospects for the new year.  Fueling our optimism are generally improving market conditions, along with our improved competitive position, validated by this year's record bookings. Our continued focus on meeting our customers' mission-critical requirements resulted in fiscal '10's successes highlighted on Slide 5.
As Mike Mancuso will detail shortly, CSC had a very solid fourth quarter and an outstanding fiscal year '10. All of the key financial metrics, including operating margin, free cash flow and earnings per share were impressive. We successfully managed through a period that was extremely challenging for both our clients and ourselves. Our marketplace and competitive landscape continues to evolve at a quickening pace. 
For its part, CSC enjoyed the most successful year of our 50-year history with respect to new business bookings. Led by significant awards with Zurich Financial Services Group, United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon, we closed fiscal year '10 with a record-high $19.2 billion in bookings. 70% of these bookings are attributable to new logos and/or new services. A testimonial, I believe, to our ability to innovate and adapt to an ever-changing environment.
Across the business, over 170 new logos were signed in fiscal year '10. The majority of these signings occurred in our third and fourth quarters, demonstrating real improvement in market conditions.  CSC also improved its position in the Fortune 500 standings by moving up to number 138. This progression was accompanied by a significant strengthening of our financial position as we materially reduced the long-term debt, while increasing our final cash balance to $2.8 billion, up almost $500 million year-over-year.
Notwithstanding the difficult economic times, we remain true to our strategic direction. We expanded our footprint in the growing markets of Latin America and China. Benefiting from strong marketplace synergies, we closed our first outsourcing deals since our recent acquisition in Brazil. A new service center in Tianjin, China expands our capabilities in this important market. We are also seeing a healthcare services market emerge in China, where with CSC is very well-positioned.
During fiscal year '10, we continued to expand and improve our product offerings across the business. This included new industry-specific offerings from each of our verticals and a comprehensive suite of cyber offerings to assist clients in protecting their most sensitive data and defeating emerging threats. We launched an integrated portfolio of applications offerings and an array of Trusted Cloud and hosting services. Five new managed services offerings were also developed, including an exciting new virtual desktop and dynamic server offerings. Our new business success in fiscal year '10 provides solid evidence that these new offerings are being well received, not just by industry analysts but by clients in the real marketplace.
Turning to Slide 6, I'd like to note the improvements we have achieved through our long-term focus on profitability. For the last several years, this management team has focused on improving the company's profitability, as well as cash performance and we have delivered real results. Operating margins again expanded this year, resulting in a 50 basis points improvement year-over-year. Over the last five years, our continuing long-term focus on profitability has elevated our operating margin some 195 basis points. 
These improvements have resulted from a host of factors, including improved operational execution, relocating work to wherever it is most efficiently and effectively performed, strictly managing our bids and bid decisions, exiting lower-margin businesses, improving the portfolio's business mix, and just prudent old-fashioned monitoring and controlling costs, and we are not done. We've identified further fiscal year '11 initiatives in each of these areas, resulting in our guidance for an additional improvement in operating margin of 25 to 50 basis points.
Turning to Slide 7, in our status on the NHS [National Health Service] program. CSC now has a significant positive impact on the delivery of healthcare in England. Our deployed systems facilitate the provisioning of care to over 15 million of its citizens. Our NHS program was very active in fiscal year '10. We deployed our systems and solutions to an additional 320 general practitioners' offices, 11 hospices, seven child health systems, 16 prisons and 15 out-of-hours facilities. Through our PACS [Picture Archiving and
Communications Systems] contract, we now manage over 800 million digital medical images and studies. Through these deployments, we have created a significant install-based of healthcare solutions across the NHS in England.
Turning to secondary care in our Lorenzo solution and its releases, I'd like to provide an update as to our current status and plans. Our first release of Lorenzo was Release 1.0. The clinical functionality contained within this release is now installed and operational at seven NHS trusts. In sharp contrast to the first go-live events at the early adapters, Release 1 deployment now occur with little press, although they remain quite important to the facilities involved [ph]. This and the initial go-live events, all seven NHS trusts, have chosen to expand their use of the Release 1 system, providing evidence that the product is delivering real value. Release 1.9 is the backbone of Lorenzo solutions. 
Significantly, NHS Bury, a primary care trust, went live in November as the first early adopter to use Lorenzo's care management functionality. Substantial progress has been made on the high-profile deployment of Release 1.9 at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay. UHMB has successfully completed their evaluation program. As has been reported in the media, there was a successful dress rehearsal test concluded this past weekend. And we're planning for a go-live at the end of May on a three-day weekend. 
In addition, we are proceeding with deployment preparations at several other trusts for subsequent go-live events. We are seeing a growing demand for the Lorenzo solution, and expect that subsequent trust go-live dates will be confirmed over the next month. Successful deployment of Release 1.9 will fundamentally shift the focus of this portion of the NHS program from the early adopter phase to the full-scale program of deployment. Through these deployments, the benefits of the program will be realized by the NHS, its patients and CSC.
Elections were recently held in the U.K. and the change in the government has now taken place. The new government is looking to achieve budget efficiencies and value for money, while improving the services they deliver to their citizens. As you know, we've been engaged in contract realignment discussions that are consistent with these stated goals. With the changing government and personnel, we anticipate these discussions could extend into the summer months.
Moving to Slide 8. I would like to share our perspective of the market and comments on our business outlook. Of course our Global Commercial business, we continue to see positive signs of recovery. While conditions vary by geography and industry, discretionary projects are returning and customers are more actively engaging in exploration of newer initiatives. We are seeing the U.S. market recover faster than those of Europe with the manufacturer sector still lagging. As these vertical and consulting markets continue to recover, we are projecting positive top line growth in fiscal year '11. We've expanded our portfolio of industry-specific offerings, includes such varied value proposition to SAP's solutions for the fashion industry, petroleum enterprise intelligence for the digital oilfield and pre-built scalable PLM [product lifecycle management] appliances for the manufacturing sector. At the same time, market awareness of CSC continues to strengthen. We continue to receive independent third-party awards that serve to validate CSC's leadership position with an important vertical and consulting market segments and demonstrate the growing strength of our brand equity.
Our Outsourcing business remains strong. Applications, cloud computing, infrastructure virtualization and cybersecurity services are all active segments of the current market. We are also seeing the corporate restructuring resulting from the economic difficulty to the last two years, and stimulating demand for both BPO [business process outsourcing] and ITO [information technology outsourcing] services. Entering fiscal year '11, our qualified pipeline of outsourcing opportunities stands at $12 billion, up $2 billion year-over-year. Within our federal marketplace, federal budgets for Defense, Intelligence and Homeland Security remain constructive. While the headwinds of a prolonged federal procurement process persists, our Federal business pipeline remains strong with some $20 billion of awards currently scheduled to be announced by the end of fiscal year '11, again, up $4 billion year-over-year. This pipeline includes 41 qualified opportunities, over $100 million in value and provides us with a platform for revenue growth.
Turning to Slide 9. Fiscal year '10 was an excellent year for CSC. With the difficulties of the markets over the last several years, many of our competitors have disappeared or have assumed different identities. While our competitive landscape has changed dramatically, CSC is exiting fiscal year '10 as a stronger and better company than we were just one year ago. Our product lines have been strengthened, important business have been secured, our balance sheet has been materially improved and we are enhancing shareholder returns by declaring a dividend. This management team takes particular pride in the dividend announcement. The confidence that we can adequately fund the necessary investments in technology and strategic acquisitions, while enhancing our returns to investors is a direct result of our long-term focus on improving margin performance and cash generation.
Looking forward, we expect our progress to continue. We are projecting bookings in excess of $18 billion, top line growth of 4% to 7%, a further expansion of 25 to 50 basis points in operating margin, EPS of $5.30 to $5.40 and free cash flow greater than 90% of net income. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mancuso for further details on our fourth quarter, and our full year financials and our outlook for fiscal year '11."

In a tough economy, we did well, attribute to the strength and diversity of our business portfolio offerings and customer client confidence. 
If you'll turn to Chart 11, I'll quickly review our FY '10 accomplishments. Our revenue held steady sequentially quarter-after-quarter throughout the year, with a 7% sequential uptick in the fourth quarter. Our operating income increased each quarter sequentially, and our margin rate increased each quarter. Our strong free cash flow presented us with the opportunity to early retire $500 million of 7 3/8% coupon term debt, and to make approximately $200 million of additional deficit reducing defined benefit pension plan contributions. This was in addition to the $25 million discretionary 401(k)  contribution in this quarter that we discussed earlier in the year. 
It is also important to point out that while all this occurred, our ending fourth quarter cash balance is $500 million above our FY '10 starting point. We also demonstrated another four quarters of consistency and predictability in terms of meeting or beating our thrice-updated increased earnings guidance. And last but not least, our $19.2 billion of new business award well positions us for FY '11 and beyond.
Chart 12, essentially repeats what I just said, with one notable additional accomplishment. With the cooperation and understanding of our U.K. employees, we were able to successfully negotiate a freeze to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan effective this July. As we did with our U.S. plan last July, this removes the risk of a growing liability, which would otherwise require potentially significant cash contributions, as well as rising P&L expense. 
Now if you'll turn to Chart 13, which is really our report card P&L for the fourth quarter, comparing our actual results to the estimates I gave on this call three months ago. As you can see, our actual revenue of $4,236,000,000 is well within the $4.4 billion guidance. The causes of the variance are many, including the delayed NHS Morecambe Bay milestone. Our margin rate was on target. 
The increased EPS is a result of a lower tax rate. Our final tax rate for the full year is 19.7% versus the 24% annual rate embodied in our previous guidance.
Chart 14, depicts fourth quarter revenue by line of business. The year-over-year total increase of GAAP rates is driven by NPS [North American Public Sector] and MSS [Managed Services Sector]. The relative revenue percent contribution of each business is unchanged year-over-year.
Chart 15, reflects operating income by line of business. While year-over-year total revenue is higher, overall income is lower, primarily in BSS [Business Solutions and Services]. One of the more significant contributing factors is the $25 million discretionary 401(k) pension contribution expense from the FY '10 fourth quarter. And while the fourth quarter has a lower margin rate, our full year FY '10 rate increased by 50 basis points. And full year FY '10 operating income is above last year, despite revenue being lower by over $600 million.
Moving to Chart 16. Our EPS throughout FY '10 grew significantly as our tax rate decreased from our original guidance to 37%, to our final annual rate of 19.7%. If we adjusted the $5.28 EPS using the original 37.2% rate and added back the accelerated interest expense on the early debt retirement, you can see that we would have slightly exceeded our original midpoint guidance of $4.25. It's important to point out to those who might otherwise suggest we got there through the tax rate. The obvious message is that we came in where we said we would. 
Chart 17, selected balance sheet items. I'd like you to focus on the shaded numbers in the Q4 FY '10 column. Our cash balance is about $500 million above last year. Accounts payable is a remarkable $227 million lower than last year. Remarkable in the sense that we exceeded our cash flow target without growing our accounts payable balance. This positions us for a better FY '11 free cash flow start and focus on our commitment to improve the quarterly volatility of inflows and outflows. And finally, you can see that the reduction in the debt balance, which manifests itself in a significant improvement in our leverage ratios.
Chart 18, delivers on another commitment we made to improve receivables and DSOs. We are four days better than a year ago and eight days better than last quarter.
Chart 19, displays selected cash flow items that make up free cash flow. As you can see this year, FY '10 working capital reductions fueled the performance.
Chart 21, lays out guidance for FY '11 and is relatively self-explanatory. The only point I would make is that implicit in the EPS range is a tax rate of 32%. And I'll be very disappointed if somebody doesn't have a question on tax rates.
Chart 22, is a comparison of EPS from FY '10 to the midpoint of our FY '11 guidance. The purpose of the chart is to point out that while our year-over-year FY '11 absolute EPS only increased to $0.07, if you'll apply the FY '11 tax rate to FY '10, the FY '11 EPS of $5.35 represents a 20% increase over FY '10.
Chart 23, gives you some idea how we see EPS rolling out by quarter in FY '11. This is our best guess at the time and, of course, could change. 
Before I get to my final summary chart and we open up the call for questions, I would like to offer some additional color around the NHS contract, its accounting and its general impact on our financials.  The NHS contract is essentially, not totally, but essentially, a long-term fixed-price contract accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis. Revenue and earnings are recognized upon completion of milestones, each of which have a predetermined value. The overall profitability of the contract is derived by comparing frequently updated estimates of total contract cost at completion to the latest negotiated contract value. 
Profitability is then expressed as a percentage of revenue, and incrementally recognized as the milestones complete. The Morecambe Bay go-live event is a milestone. Not a significant milestone in terms of revenue value, and its delay to late May had a relatively minor impact on our fourth quarter revenue and profitability.
As Mike Laphen pointed out, the progress in positive technical accomplishments of CSC and the NHS are frankly staggering. The deployments will begin in earnest by the end of FY '11. Throughout FY '10 we were, and in FY '11, expect to be cash neutral, meaning our balance sheet investment in the program is not expected to grow and will begin to decrease as deployments increase. The NHS is an important customer and we will continue to work hand-in-hand with the authority to ensure the continued success of the program. 
I hope you find it helpful in terms of how you should think about the NHS contract and to keep it in the proper context. We would also like to thank our investors and the sell-side community for your patience these last several weeks, leading up to this call. As you know, the regulations do not permit us to comment or discuss financial matters selectively with individual investors. Needless to say, it was difficult for us to remain silent, while the press speculated widely and inaccurately on the status of the NHS program.
So in summary, as Chart 24 suggests, we feel good about FY '10 performance. I think we substantially strengthened our business. We are excited about the dividend and excited about FY '11 outlook. We continue to remain committed to the principle of transparency. And it's our hope that this material supports that objective. That being said, I'll turn it back over to Bryan to begin the Q&A."

And remind you that we're in the middle of the IRS audit of our 2005 to 2007 tax years. And we expect some things will come rolling out of that.

So we've re-won that, if you will, again and that's breaking news kind of thing. So as Mike indicated, we feel pretty good about NPS. In terms of constant currency, I'm looking at a detailed chart in front of me and it fundamentally says that -- and I probably was a little bit too aggressive in my earlier response, that we grow about 5% roughly in constant currency using the midpoint of our guidance. So since the midpoint of our -- since our guidance is 4% to 7% and the midpoint would be $17 billion of our guidance, it pretty much says that both at GAAP rates and constant currency, we're looking at the same kind of growth.

But right now, we're comfortable in that 4% to 7% range that we've given you. In terms of the NPS, we're feeling pretty good about our NPS. We had bookings of $7 billion last year, that's a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15. We achieved a 90% win rate on our re-competes. We have a pipeline of $20 billion to be awarded by the end of the fiscal year, with $6.7 billion of that already in the evaluation stage. As Mike mentioned, just as late as yesterday, the Transportation Security Administration awarded us an almost $500 million contract. That's on the heels of the recently announced NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] contract for climate evaluation that was over $300 million. We believe we're extremely well situated in our high-budget areas for the government including cyber, health and data center consolidation. We have one of the Homeland Security's -- one of the two data centers where the consolidation would take place for the Homeland Security agency over the next several years. So we feel we're in very good position with NPS and I would emphasize a little bit that our moneys come not only from the IT budget but also from the O&M budget.

It's not unnatural if you go back to our fourth quarter of last year. I believe our free cash flow number was over $1 billion in the quarter. So we're capable of significant improvement. Obviously, all we want to do is take some of the excitement out of it. And Karl, if I may, I just want to add to something Mike said and remind all of you -- the folks on the call. As we talked about constant currency, roughly round numbers, 40% of our revenue comes out of NPS, which is in, obviously, in U.S. dollars.

And thank you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter financial results. My remarks this morning will focus on three areas: First, I will share with you my assessment of our first quarter financial performance. Second, I'll address some topics we believe are on the minds of our investors and finally, I will provide our overall sense of the broader marketplace and the resulting implications on our business for the remainder of our fiscal year '11. As usual, when I finish, Mike Mancuso will add some color and detail to our numbers. And then we'll move on to take your questions.
On our last call, we reported very strong fiscal year-end performance and indicated that we were optimistic about our prospects for the new fiscal year. We can now report a solid result for our first quarter, and that our optimism for continued improvement this fiscal year remains intact. 
The highlights of our first quarter are shown on Slide 5. In line with our expectations, we continued to see top line improvement this quarter, achieving positive growth year-over-year as reported. Both our North American Public Sector and our Managed Services Sector reported 2.2% increases in revenue. Our Business Solutions & Services Sector revenues experienced a slight decline of 2%. However, net of the effects from a disposition, it also grew by 2.5%. So all three lines of businesses demonstrated top line growth.
Our long-term profitability program again delivered results. Operating income increased by 5.7% and operating margin rose to 7.1%, a 32 basis point improvement year-over-year. With the improved operational performance, EPS grew at a rate greater than revenue and increased to $0.91, up 7% year-over-year. This positive EPS result was achieved despite an effective tax rate increase of some 300 basis points year-over-year. 
Cash performance also improved, as we reduced the variability of our quarterly cash flows. While cash flow was negative, as is the norm for our first quarter, free cash flow improved by some $144 million year-over-year. This improvement reflects our continued focus and success in cash management across the corporation.
On the new business front, bookings were $3.2 billion, down $300 million year-over-year. Continuing delays in the U.S. government's acquisition process were the primary cause of the lower bookings number. Some particularly noteworthy bookings included important wins at UBS, the Swiss financial services giant, and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA. UBS is now one of our largest outsourcing relationships in the banking and capital markets industry. At NOAA, our North American Public Sector was awarded a prestigious $317 million high-performance computing contract in support of NOAA's environmental modeling program to improve the accuracy of global and regional climate models. These wins, as well as other recent startups including Zurich, will contribute to our revenue profile in the second half.
Turning to Slide 6. I would now like to discuss the investor topics I referenced earlier. There have been numerous media reports on the potential effect that growing deficits might have on government spending. In addition, there have been several announced directives related to government contracting in general, and some on IT specifically. Since the U.S. government is our largest Public Sector customer, I will start there. 
On the civil side of the federal business, the new OMB or Office of Management and Budget directive on IT reform focuses on several areas including financial systems and high-risk IT programs. Of the 30 financial systems targeted for review, CSC has two monosized [ph] (19:49) programs. They are the IRS integrated financial system, which is in production and highly regarded, and a new startup with the Department of Agriculture. Both programs are scheduled for government review within the next 30 days. Impact, if any, should be minimal, and second half revenues for these two programs combined amount to less than $10 million.
In regard to high-risk IT programs, we believe there should be improvements in federal IT acquisition and management practices, and agree that OMB's efforts to reform these regulations and processes are important. Plans for agency reviews are still being formulated, so the assessment process is still in its early stages of definition. As troubled programs are restructured to introduce commercial IT practices, we see potential business opportunities for CSC. We believe CSC's strength in bringing commercial best practices in technology to the federal government over a wide range of successful programs gives us advantages over competitors, and we view this as a key differentiator for us in the marketplace.
Long awaited government healthcare initiatives are generating opportunity at both the federal and state levels. The Affordable Care Act is now moving into the implementation phase. This is driving an increase in contract activities across many federal civil agencies including HHS, SSA and the Treasury. In addition, both the VA and the DoD are planning major monetization efforts for their health systems. There will also be significant opportunities at the state level as mandates such as health insurance gateways must be implemented. I would note that CSC developed Health Insurance Gateway for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and it's the first of its kind in the country.
For the next several years, the outlook for the U.S. defense spending, particularly in the key areas of intelligence logistics systems support, data center consolidation and cybersecurity are positive. These are all mission critical markets in which CSC is well entrenched. Having said this, Secretary Gates has announced his goal of reducing DoD spending by $100 billion to [ph] (22:10) increased efficiency and the elimination of unnecessary programs. We've already seen the beginning of reductions in major weapons programs with more likely to come. This particular area of defense spending cutbacks is not anticipated to impact us in a material way although we expect further program reductions from Defense Secretary Gates' ongoing efficiency studies, we also believe the DoD's interest in leveraging commercial practices to improve productivity will play to our strengths. So with the high level of noise surrounding U.S. defense spending, it's important to use a filter when assessing the impacts. CSC continues to see the U.S. defense market as healthy and a solid contributor to our business.
Turning now to Europe. In the U.K., the new government is looking to achieve budget efficiencies and value for money, while improving the services they deliver to their citizens. Our business with the U.K., exclusive of NHS, is limited to about 2% of CSC revenue. Our U.K. management team has met with principal government partners, and we have offered a number of innovative proposals that could enable both parties to achieve their objectives. We anticipate these discussions to continue and expect to achieve resolution across our contract base, including the NHS program, in the September time frame.
With regard to NHS specifically, our NHS program has continued to deliver successfully through the first quarter. In primary care, our footprint has expanded with 57 new GP deployments this quarter, giving us a total of 1,350 fully operational GP systems. 16 million patient records are now expertly and accurately managed through our Primary Care Solution. I'm pleased to report that the high-profile deployment at the University Hospital at Morecambe Bay, the first acute hospital trust [ph] (24:04) to operate with our Lorenzo Release 1.9 solution, successfully went live at the end of May. The earlier deployment of [indiscernible] (24:14) has also been updated with this latest incremental functionality.
We are proceeding with deployment preparations at our final two early-adopter trust [ph] (24:23) during our Q2 and Q3. This will complete the early adopter phase for Lorenzo Release 1.9. We would then anticipate a quickening pace of full-scale deployments. 
Outside of the U.K., our business in EMEA from a macro perspective is concentrated in the more economically robust countries including France, Germany, the Nordics and Switzerland. The euro's weakness has aided the exporting economies, especially Germany, and our businesses in France and Switzerland are healthy and growing. Only 1.2% of our business is in Southern Europe, mostly in Italy. We have little if any exposure to the national markets of Portugal, Spain, Ireland or Greece.
Across Europe, currency effects will probably produce a top line headwind for us this year. At current spot rates, CSC's fiscal year revenues will be negatively impacted by about 1%. 
Looking across the border market at our global commercial businesses, we see some signs of recovery. Pipelines are building constructively. Customers are more actively engaging in exploration of new initiatives. Altogether, decisions are still cautious. We anticipate this activity will translate to top line uplift in our second half.
Demand for managed services is positive and we experienced an increase in RFI and RFP activity in Q1. Primary drivers are cost efficiency, globalization and increased privacy and security regulations and concerns. Developments in virtualization and cloud are driving the adaptation of new business models in the forms of technology as a service, which plays to CSC's strengths. 
Demand for applications management was strong. Our revenue in this business was up over 10% year-over-year. Overall the qualified pipeline of sourcing opportunities to be awarded through fiscal year '11 stands at $12 billion, up from $11 billion year-over-year.
Within our federal market, NPS delivered positive first quarter growth of 2.2%. Importantly, two protests of significant contracts have recently been resolved, which should benefit growth in our second half. We now have the transition activities on the TSA ITIP contract, the $492 million award we won over a year ago, to begin in early September. The Army's R23G contract is a significant ID/IQ vehicle with a $16.4 billion ceiling. It's predecessor contract was one of our largest contract vehicles. And the lack of new task order flow over the last 18 months has been a headwind for the business. Now that this protest has been resolved, we expect task orders to begin to flow again over the next several months.
Other key first quarter wins for NPS include three significant ID/IQ contracts from the Department of State, the Missile Defense Agency and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agencies. These vehicles have a combined ceiling of $4 billion. While we do not include TCV estimates for these wins in our new business bookings disclosure, second half revenues will benefit as task orders from these vehicles start to flow. While the frustrations of a prolonged federal procurement process persist, our federal business pipeline remains strong, with some $19 billion awards currently scheduled to be announced by the end of fiscal year '11.
Turning to Slide 7 and looking forward. Complementing our pipeline of new business opportunities is our strong backlog position. CSC's diverse portfolio of public sector and commercial business generates a substantial revenue backlog that provides stability and predictability to our financial results. Excluding short-term project revenues, our current backlog stands at approximately $42 billion and represents approximately three years of revenue, essentially evenly split between commercial and NPS. Added to this backlog, there is a substantial revenue potential from our broad portfolio of U.S. Government ID/IQ contracts. Mike Mancuso will provide additional details in his remarks.
We are reaffirming our guidance for bookings in excess of $18 billion, and top line growth of 4% to 7%, an expansion of 25 to 50 basis points for the year in the operating margin, and EPS of $5.30 to $5.40 and free cash flow greater than 90% of net income. Additionally, we are affirming a dividend of $0.15 to our shareholders of record as of the 9th of September 2010. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mancuso for further details on our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year '11."

If you'll turn to Chart 9, which should look familiar to you since it was Mike Laphen's opening chart. I am using it again because I want to strongly emphasize to all of our shareholders that as a management team, we are focused on and committed to continuous improvement. And each of the financial metrics referenced on this chart have favorably, and not insignificantly, improved over the last year. And at the risk of dwelling on the macroeconomic outlook and the pace of a somewhat uncertain recovery, we are doing everything we can to improve operations and position CSC for accelerated and profitable growth, as the global economic recovery accelerates. We are controlling what we can control, competing vigorously, winning a fair share of the business that is being awarded, investing in the key growth areas of cloud computing, cybersecurity and healthcare, and enhancing our horizontal capability as evidenced by our recently announced Bass acquisition, which broadens our footprint in the chemical energy and natural resources market.
To support growth, we need a strong foundation. Mike Laphen in his opening remarks mentioned the fact that at the quarter end, we have a backlog of $42 billion. Up to now, we have not talked about our backlog or offered insight into its composition. So if you will turn to Chart 10, I'll talk about that backlog in the context of our FY '11 revenue guidance. The midpoint of our revenue guidance for FY '11 is $17 billion. If you will direct your attention to the blue-shaded area at the bottom of the pyramid, including our first quarter revenue, we see 76% of our FY '11 revenue, or roughly $13 billion, coming from existing backlog. Our shorter-term project and consulting work, which is essentially our BSS segment excluding the NHS contract, which is in backlog, is very predictable and we will produce 18% of our FY '11 revenue, which is another $3 billion. Therefore, the sum of the FY '11 revenue from backlog, plus the short-term consulting project work, gets us $16 billion, meaning that we only need generate another 6% or $1 billion from new business. We see this as quite doable, considering our pipeline and our ID/IQ portfolio. And as the top of the chart suggests, we have a new business qualified pipeline of $34 billion of FY '11 potential awards. And in addition, we also have qualified for another $5 billion of ID/IQ awards which is not in backlog, but that our track record and historical performance suggests will generate a significant number of task orders which will also help fill the FY '11 new business revenue estimate. The message from this chart is that we believe our FY '11 guidance is achievable. And further that between our NPS segment, MSS segment and the NHS contract, we have $42 billion in backlog, which equates to over three years of revenue for those businesses and provides a solid foundation for future revenue growth beyond FY '11.
Now moving on. In an attempt to address the inevitable constant currency question, we will introduce Charts 11 and 12. Chart 11 breaks down our last fiscal year's revenue by currency. With the U.S. at 63%, the British pound at 12%, Europe or the euro at 9%, Australia at 5%, and 11% of All Other. This should help frame your thinking with regard to currency exposure. And I also want to remind you, most of our currency exposure is translation risk, not cost and revenue in disparate currencies.
Now if you'll turn to Chart 12, this now takes FY '11 first quarter revenue by currency, which closely approximate the FY '10 full year numbers, and on a weighted basis using the August 9 spot rate, projects the full year potential of currency impact to be roughly one point of revenue or about $170 million. The bottom line here is that if the rates hang where they are now, we don't see a significant currency impact in FY '11.
Chart 13, revenue by line of business, shows you that NPS and MSS grew by over 2%, while BSS, comprised of consulting and project work, declined by 2%. Keep in mind that NHS is in BSS and was relatively revenue-constant year-over-year. The decline in BSS is primarily the result of the divestiture of our Hong Kong break-fix business, which was sold in the second quarter of last year.
Chart 14 displays operating income by line of business. Operating income has improved 6% overall, and you can see where the gains occurred.
Chart 15 is the comparative P&L. The key takeaways are the improvement in operating income and margin rate, lower corporate G&A and interest expense more than offsetting the higher tax rate. Applying the FY '11 higher tax rate to FY '10, would yield an 11% year-over-year growth in EPS versus the reported 7%.
Chart 16 displays selected balance sheet items year-over-year. The message here is simple: more cash, less receivables, less debt and better ratios. Speaking of receivables, if you turn to Chart 17, you can see the downward migration in days receivables continues, a result of lots of hard work with tedious attention to detail. Using a baseball analogy, it's the result of a lot of singles and stolen bases, sacrifice bunts and an occasional squeeze play. However, we are not done and we think there is still room for further improvement.
Chart 18 is selected cash flow items. Cash flow from earnings has increased. The year-over-year change in working capital was less severe than in the past, although there is some growth in CapEx. However, before someone asks the question, we do not see CapEx growing this year, and we maintain our focus on being less capital-intensive as we grow. Free cash flow was much improved over last year, as we continue our focus on reducing the seasonality of free cash. We got a very good start toward that goal.
Chart 19 reiterates our quarterly EPS guidance for the rest of the year, noting that our guidance to you for Q1 was $0.88, which we were able to exceed. But at this point, we think the ranges for the next three quarters are reasonable. 
So in summary on Chart 20, I think the words speak for themselves. We had a good start to the year. Several improvements have been recorded. Yes, there are more challenges ahead. But from our perspective, optimism abounds and we look forward to another solid year. So with that said, I'll turn it back to Bryan to begin the Q&A."

Incremental to that, I identified several major contracts including the State Department Missile Defense Agency and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, where we don't announce the full value of those contracts because they are ID/IQ contracts. But we know there is a considerable backlog and pipeline there within those contracts and expect that they hit fairly quickly.

I think it's like how high is up? I mean we're going to keep working on the balance sheet, keep grinding. We have still significant room to improve in receivables alone, regardless of business mix. So right now, free cash flow has a high correlation with our net earnings and I think prospectively, as we continue to work the equation that, that shouldn't change significantly. We may hit a quarter, for example, where there may be an abnormal free cash flow or an abnormal investment requirement, if you will, CapEx spend or something like that, I can't tell you when that would be but start-up on new outsourcing contracts might cause those kind of perturbations, but over the long haul I think we can still keep generating 90%-plus and still keep investing where we need to invest, both in capital equipment as well as technology."

My remarks this morning will focus on three areas
First, I will share with you my assessment of our first quarter financial performance. Second, I’ll address some topics we believe are on the minds of our investors. And finally, I will provide our overall sense of broader marketplace and the resulting implications on our business for the remainder of our fiscal year ‘11. As usual, when I finish Mike Mancuso will add some color and detail to our numbers. And then we’ll move on to take your questions.
On our last call we reported very strong fiscal year performance, and indicate that we were optimistic about our prospects for the new fiscal year. We can now report a solid result for our first quarter and then our optimism for continued improvement this fiscal year remains intact.
The highlights of our first quarter are shown on slide five. In line with our expectations we continue to see top line improvement this quarter achieving positive growth year-over-year as reported.
Both our North American public sector and our managed services sector reported 2.2% increases in revenue. Our business solutions and services sector revenues experienced a slight decline of 2%, however net of the effects from a disposition it also grew by 2.5%.
So, all three lines of businesses demonstrated top line growth. Our long-term profitability program again delivered results. Operating income increased by 5.7% and operating margin rose to 7.1% a 32 basis point improvement year-over-year.
With the improved operational performance, EPS grew at a rate greater than revenue and increased to $0.91, up 7% year-over-year. This positive EPS result was achieved despite an effective tax rate increase of some 300 basis points year-over-year.
Cash performance also improved as we reduced the variability of our quarterly cash flows. While cash flow was negative as it is the norm for our first quarter, free cash flow improved by some $144 million year-over-year. This improvement reflects our continued focus and success in cash management across the corporation.
On the new business front, bookings were $3.2 billion, down $300 million year-over-year. Continuing delays in the U.S. Government’s acquisition process were the primary cause of the lower bookings number.
Some particularly noteworthy bookings included important wins at UBS, the Swiss financial services giant and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA. UBS is now one of our largest outsourcing relationships in the banking and capital markets industry.
At NOAA, our North American Public Sector was awarded a prestigious $317million high performance computing contract that supported NOAA’s environmental modeling program to improve the accuracy of global and regional climate models. These wins as well as other recent start-ups, including Zurich will contribute to our revenue profile in the second half.
Turning to slide six; I would now like to discuss the investor topics, I referenced earlier. There have been numerous media reports on the potential effect that growing deficits might have on government spending. In addition, there have been several announced directives related to government contracting in general and some on IT specifically.
This U.S. government is our largest public sector customer, and I will start there. On the civil side of federal business, the new OMB or Office of Management and Budget directive on IT reform focuses on several areas including financial systems and high risk IT programs.
Of the 30 financial systems targeted for review, CSC has two minor size programs. They are IRS integrated financial system, which is in production and highly regarded and a new start-up with the Department of Agriculture. Both programs are scheduled for government review within the next 30 days. Impact, if any, should be minimal as second half revenues for this two programs combined amount to less than $10 million.
In regard to high risk IT programs, we believe there should be improvements in federal IT acquisition and management practices and agree that OMBs efforts to reform this regulations and process are important. Plans for agency reviews are still being formulated, so the assessment process is still in its early stages of definition. As troubled programs are restructured to introduce commercial IT practices, we see potential business opportunities for CSC.
We believe CSC’s strength in bringing commercial best practices in technology to the federal government over a wide range of successful programs, gives us advantages over competitors and we view this as a key differentiator for us in the marketplace.
Along the way, the government healthcare initiatives are generating opportunity at both the federal and state levels. The Affordable Care Act is now moving into the implementation phase. This is driving an increase in contract activities across many federal civil agencies including HHS, SSA, and the Treasury. In addition, both the VA and DOD are planning major monetization efforts for their health systems.
There will also be significant opportunities at the state level as mandates such as health insurance gateways must be implemented. I would note that CSC developed health insurance gateway for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and it’s the first of its kind in the country.
For the next several years, the outlook for the U.S. defense spending, particularly in the key areas of intelligence, logistic systems or data center consolidation in cyber security are positive. These are all mission-critical markets in which CSC is well entrenched.
Having said this, Secretary Gates has announced his goal of reducing DOD spending by $100 billion through increased efficiency and the elimination of unnecessary programs. We’ve already seen the beginning of reductions in major weapons programs with more likely to come. This particular area of defense spending capacity is not anticipated to impact us in a material way.
Although we expect further program reductions from the Defense Secretary Gates’ ongoing efficiency studies, we also believe DOD’s interest in leveraging commercial practices to improve productivity will play to our strengths.
Still with the high level of noise surrounding U.S. defense spending, it’s important to use a filter when accessing the impacts. CSC continues to see the U.S. defense market as healthy and a solid contributor to our business.
Turning now to Europe, in the U.K., the new government is looking to achieve budget efficiencies and value for money while improving the services they delivered to their citizens. Our business with the U.K., exclusive of NHS is limited to about 2% of CSC revenue. Our U.K. management team has met with principal government partners and we have offered a number of innovative proposals that could enable both parties to achieve their objectives. We anticipate these discussions to continue and expect to achieve resolution across our contract base including the NHS program in the September timeframe.
With regard to NHS specifically, our NHS program has continued to deliver successfully through the first quarter. In primary care our footprint has expanded with 57 new GP deployments this quarter, giving us a total of 1,350 fully operational GP systems.
16 million patient records are now expertly and accurately manage through our primary care solutions. I’m pleased to report that the high profile deployment at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay, the first acute hospital trust to operate with our Lorenzo Release 1.9 solution successfully went live at the end of May. The earlier deployment of Bury Trust has also been updated with this latest incremental functionality.
We are proceeding with deployment preparations at our final two early adopter trust during our Q2 and Q3. This will complete the early adopter phase for Lorenzo Release 1.9. We would then anticipate a quickening pace of full scale deployments.
Outside of the U.K. our business in EMEA from a macro perspective is concentrated in the more economically robust countries including France, Germany, the Nordics and Switzerland. Euro’s weakness has aided the exporting economy, especially Germany and our businesses in France and Switzerland are healthy and growing. Only 1.2% of our business is in Southern Europe, mostly in Italy. We have little, if any exposure to the national markets of Portugal, Spain, Ireland or Greece.
Across Europe, currency effects will probably produce a top line headwind for us this year. At current spot rates CSC’s fiscal year revenues will be negatively impacted by about 1%.
Looking across the broader market and our global commercial businesses, we see some signs of recovery. Pipelines are building constructively, customers are more actively engaging in exploration of newer initiatives, although their decisions are still cautious. We anticipate this activity will translate through top line uplift in our second half.
Demand for managed services is positive and we experienced an increase in RFI and RFP activity in Q1. Primary drivers are cost efficiency, globalization and increased privacy and security regulations and concerns.
Developments in virtualization and cloud are driving the adaptation of new business models in the forms of technology as a service, which plays to CSC’s strengths. Demand for applications management was strong. Our revenue in this business was up over 10% year-over-year.
Overall, the qualified pipeline of outsourcing opportunities to be awarded in fiscal year ‘11 came to $12 billion, up from $11 billion year-over-year.
Within our federal market NPS delivered positive first quarter growth of 2.2%. Importantly, two protests of significant contracts have recently been resolved which should benefit growth in our second half. We now have the transition activities on the TSA, ITIP contract of $492 million award we won over a year ago to begin in early September.
The Army’s R23G contract is a significant IDIQ vehicle with a $16.4 billion ceiling. Its predecessor contract was one of our largest contract vehicles and the lack of new test would have flowed over the last 18 months has been a headwind for the business. Now, that this protest has been resolved, we expect task force to begin to flow again over the next several months.
Other key first quarter wins for NPS, include three significant IDIQ contracts from the Department of State, The Missile Defense Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. These vehicles have a combined ceiling of $4 billion.
While we do not include TCD estimates for these wins in our new business bookings disclosure, second half revenues will benefit as past quarters in these vehicles start to flow. While the frustrations of a prolonged federal procurement process persists, our federal business pipeline remains strong with some $19 billion of orders currently scheduled to be announced by the end of fiscal year ‘11.
Turning to slide seven and looking forward. Complementing our pipeline of new business opportunities is our strong backlog position. CSC’s diverse portfolio of public sector and commercial business generates a substantial revenue backlog that provides stability and predictability to our financial results.
Excluding short-term project revenues, our current backlog stands at approximately $42 billion and represents approximately three years of revenue, essentially evenly split between commercial and NPS. Additive to this backlog, there is substantial revenue potential from our broad portfolio of U.S. government IDIQ contracts. Mike Mancuso will provide additional details in his remarks.
We are reaffirming our guidance for bookings in excess of $18 billion and top line growth of 4% to 7%, an expansion of 25 basis points to 50 basis points for the year in the operating margin, and EPS of $5.30 to $5.40 and free cash flow greater than 90% of net income. Additionally, we are affirming a dividend of $0.15 to our shareholders of record as of 9 September 2010.
At this point, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike Mancuso for further details on our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year ‘11.

If you turn to chart nine, which should look familiar to you since it was Mike Laphen’s opening chart.

If you turn to chart nine, which should look familiar to you since it was Mike Laphen’s opening chart. I am using it again because I want to strongly emphasize to all of our shareholders that as a management team, we are focused on and committed to continuous improvement and each of the financial metrics referenced on this chart have favorably and not insignificantly improved over last year, and at the risk of growing on the macroeconomic outlook and the pace of a somewhat uncertain recovery, we are doing everything we can to improve operations and position CSC for accelerated and profitable growth as the global economic recovery accelerates.
We are controlling what we can control, competing vigorously, wining a fair share of the new business that is being awarded, investing in the key growth areas in cloud computing, cyber security and healthcare and enhancing our horizontal capabilities as evidenced by our recently announced Bass acquisition, which broadens our footprint in the chemical, energy and natural resources market.
To support growth, we need a strong foundation. Mike Laphen, in his opening remarks, mentioned the fact that at the quarter end, we have a backlog of $42 billion. Up to now, we have not talked about our backlog or offered insight into its composition.
So, if you will turn to chart 10, I’ll talk about that backlog in the context of our FY ‘11 revenue guidance. The midpoint of our revenue guidance for FY ‘11 is $17 billion. If you will direct your attention to the blue shaded area at the bottom of the pyramid, including our first quarter revenue we see 76% of our FY ‘11 revenue or roughly $13 billion coming from existing backlog.
Our shorter term project and consulting work which is essentially our BSS segment, excluding the NHS contract which is in backlog is very predictable and we will produce 18% of our FY ‘11 revenue which is another $3 billion.
Therefore, the sum of the FY ‘11 revenue from backlog plus the short term consulting project work gets us $16 billion, meaning that we only need to generate another 6% or $1 billion from new business.
We see this as quite doable considering our pipeline and our IDIQ portfolio. And as the top of the top of the chart suggests, we have a new business qualified pipeline of $34 billion of FY ‘11 potential awards.
And in addition, we also have qualified for another $5 billion of IDIQ awards which is not in backlog, but that our track record and historical performance suggests will generate a significant number of task orders which will also help fill the FY ‘11 new business revenue estimate.
The message from this chart is that we believed our FY ‘11 guidance is achievable and further that between our NPS segment, MSS segment and the NHS contract, we have $42 billion in backlog which equates to over three years of revenue for those businesses and provides a solid foundation for future revenue growth beyond FY ‘11.
Now, moving on, in an attempt to address the inevitable constant currency question, we have introduced charts 11 and 12. Chart 11 breakdowns our last fiscal year’s revenue by currency. For the U.S. at 63%, the British pound at 12%, Europe or the Euro at 9%, Australia at 5%, and 11% of all other. This should help frame your thinking with regard to currency exposure.
And I also want to remind you, most of our currency exposure is translation risk, not cost and revenue in disparate currencies.
Now, if you’ll turn to chart 12, this now takes FY ‘11 first quarter revenue by currency which closely approximates the FY ‘10 fully year numbers, and on a weighted basis, using the August 9 spot rate projects the full year potential of currency impact to be roughly one point of revenue or about $170 million. The bottom line here is that if the rates hang where they are now, we don’t see a significant currency impact in FY ‘11.
Chart 13, revenue by line of business, shows you that NPS and MSS grew by over 2%, while BSS comprised of consulting and project work, declined by 2%. Keep in mind that NHS is in BSS and was relatively revenue constant year-over-year. The decline in BSS is primarily the result of the divestiture of our Hong Kong break-and-fix business, which was sold in the second quarter of last year.
Chart 14, displays operating income by line of the business. Operating income has improved 6% overall and you can see where the gains occurred.
Chart 15, is the comparative P&L. The key takeaways are the improvement in operating income and margin rate, lower corporate G&A and interest expense more than offsetting the higher tax rate. Applying the FY ‘11 higher tax rate to FY ‘10 would yield an 11% year-over-year growth in EPS versus the reported 7%.
Chart 16, displays selected balance sheet items year-over-year. The message here is simple, more cash, less receivables, less debt and better ratios.
Speaking of receivables, if you turn to chart 17, you can see the downward migration in days receivables continues, a result of lots of hard work with tedious attention in detail. Using a baseball analogy, it’s the result of a lot of singles in stolen bases, sacrifice bunts and an occasional squeeze play. However, we’re not done and we think there is still room for further improvement.
Chart 18, is selected cash flow items. Cash flow from earnings has increased. The year-over-year change in working capital is less severe than in the past, although there is some growth in CapEx. However, before someone ask the question, we do not see CapEx growing this year and as we maintain our focus on being less capital intensive as we grow.
Free cash flow is much improved over last year as we continue our focus on reducing the seasonality of free cash. We got a very good start towards that goal.
Chart 19 reiterates our quarterly EPS guidance for the rest of the year. Noting that our guidance to you for Q1 was $0.88, which we were able to exceed, but at this point we think the ranges for the next three quarters are reasonable.
So, in summary on chart 20, I think the words speak for themselves. We had a good start to the year. Several improvements have been recorded. Yes, there are more challenges ahead, but from our perspective, optimism abounds and we look forward to another solid year.
So with that said, I’ll turn it back to Bryan to begin the Q&A.

Number one, is two significant programs that have been signed up in protest for an over a year have been freed up and they will begin to contribute immediately. So that’s a positive in and of itself.
Incremental to that, I identified several major contracts including the Department of Missile Defense Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency where we don’t announce the full value of those contracts because they are IDIQ contracts. But we know there is a considerable backlog and pipeline there within those contacts and expect that they hit fairly quickly. So with the visibility we have, we think there is a good opportunity for some uplift to come in the second half as these combinations of contracts come online.

I think, it’s like how high it’s up and we’re going to keep working on the balance sheet, keep grinding. We have still significant room to improve in the receivables alone regardless of the business mix.
So, right now, free cash flow has a high correlation with our net earnings and I think prospectively as we continue to work the equation as that shouldn’t change significantly. We may hit a quarter, for example, where they might be an abnormal free cash flow or an abnormal investment requirement, if you will, CapEx spend or something like that. I can’t tell you when that would be, but startup on new outsourcing contracts might cause those kind of perturbations, but over the long haul, I think we can still keep generating 90% plus and still keep investing where we need to invest both in capital equipment as well as technology.

So, it leads us to believe that barring again macroeconomic considerations or significant changes in the economy coming that we’re going to see a pick up in the second half of this year relative to the projects. There is a lot more activity out there than there has been. I don’t think people are going to commit to big projects until some of the uncertainty is eliminated from the broader picture, including the whole tax picture.
I just think there is too many uncertainties out there for people to go out with big types of capital spending, including in the capital spending of major capital IT projects. So I think they’re going to continue to be bite-size, but we’re seeing more of the medium size opportunities building out there. So we do see a build in the pipeline.

And thank you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter financial results. My remarks this morning will focus on three areas: First, I will share with you my assessment of our first quarter financial performance. Second, I'll address some topics we believe are on the minds of our investors and finally, I will provide our overall sense of the broader marketplace and the resulting implications on our business for the remainder of our fiscal year '11. As usual, when I finish, Mike Mancuso will add some color and detail to our numbers. And then we'll move on to take your questions.
On our last call, we reported very strong fiscal year-end performance and indicated that we were optimistic about our prospects for the new fiscal year. We can now report a solid result for our first quarter, and that our optimism for continued improvement this fiscal year remains intact. 
The highlights of our first quarter are shown on Slide 5. In line with our expectations, we continued to see top line improvement this quarter, achieving positive growth year-over-year as reported. Both our North American Public Sector and our Managed Services Sector reported 2.2% increases in revenue. Our Business Solutions & Services Sector revenues experienced a slight decline of 2%. However, net of the effects from a disposition, it also grew by 2.5%. So all three lines of businesses demonstrated top line growth.
Our long-term profitability program again delivered results. Operating income increased by 5.7% and operating margin rose to 7.1%, a 32 basis point improvement year-over-year. With the improved operational performance, EPS grew at a rate greater than revenue and increased to $0.91, up 7% year-over-year. This positive EPS result was achieved despite an effective tax rate increase of some 300 basis points year-over-year. 
Cash performance also improved, as we reduced the variability of our quarterly cash flows. While cash flow was negative, as is the norm for our first quarter, free cash flow improved by some $144 million year-over-year. This improvement reflects our continued focus and success in cash management across the corporation.
On the new business front, bookings were $3.2 billion, down $300 million year-over-year. Continuing delays in the U.S. government's acquisition process were the primary cause of the lower bookings number. Some particularly noteworthy bookings included important wins at UBS, the Swiss financial services giant, and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA. UBS is now one of our largest outsourcing relationships in the banking and capital markets industry. At NOAA, our North American Public Sector was awarded a prestigious $317 million high-performance computing contract in support of NOAA's environmental modeling program to improve the accuracy of global and regional climate models. These wins, as well as other recent startups including Zurich, will contribute to our revenue profile in the second half.
Turning to Slide 6. I would now like to discuss the investor topics I referenced earlier. There have been numerous media reports on the potential effect that growing deficits might have on government spending. In addition, there have been several announced directives related to government contracting in general, and some on IT specifically. Since the U.S. government is our largest Public Sector customer, I will start there. 
On the civil side of the federal business, the new OMB or Office of Management and Budget directive on IT reform focuses on several areas including financial systems and high-risk IT programs. Of the 30 financial systems targeted for review, CSC has two monosized [ph] (19:49) programs. They are the IRS integrated financial system, which is in production and highly regarded, and a new startup with the Department of Agriculture. Both programs are scheduled for government review within the next 30 days. Impact, if any, should be minimal, and second half revenues for these two programs combined amount to less than $10 million.
In regard to high-risk IT programs, we believe there should be improvements in federal IT acquisition and management practices, and agree that OMB's efforts to reform these regulations and processes are important. Plans for agency reviews are still being formulated, so the assessment process is still in its early stages of definition. As troubled programs are restructured to introduce commercial IT practices, we see potential business opportunities for CSC. We believe CSC's strength in bringing commercial best practices in technology to the federal government over a wide range of successful programs gives us advantages over competitors, and we view this as a key differentiator for us in the marketplace.
Long awaited government healthcare initiatives are generating opportunity at both the federal and state levels. The Affordable Care Act is now moving into the implementation phase. This is driving an increase in contract activities across many federal civil agencies including HHS, SSA and the Treasury. In addition, both the VA and the DoD are planning major monetization efforts for their health systems. There will also be significant opportunities at the state level as mandates such as health insurance gateways must be implemented. I would note that CSC developed Health Insurance Gateway for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and it's the first of its kind in the country.
For the next several years, the outlook for the U.S. defense spending, particularly in the key areas of intelligence logistics systems support, data center consolidation and cybersecurity are positive. These are all mission critical markets in which CSC is well entrenched. Having said this, Secretary Gates has announced his goal of reducing DoD spending by $100 billion to [ph] (22:10) increased efficiency and the elimination of unnecessary programs. We've already seen the beginning of reductions in major weapons programs with more likely to come. This particular area of defense spending cutbacks is not anticipated to impact us in a material way although we expect further program reductions from Defense Secretary Gates' ongoing efficiency studies, we also believe the DoD's interest in leveraging commercial practices to improve productivity will play to our strengths. So with the high level of noise surrounding U.S. defense spending, it's important to use a filter when assessing the impacts. CSC continues to see the U.S. defense market as healthy and a solid contributor to our business.
Turning now to Europe. In the U.K., the new government is looking to achieve budget efficiencies and value for money, while improving the services they deliver to their citizens. Our business with the U.K., exclusive of NHS, is limited to about 2% of CSC revenue. Our U.K. management team has met with principal government partners, and we have offered a number of innovative proposals that could enable both parties to achieve their objectives. We anticipate these discussions to continue and expect to achieve resolution across our contract base, including the NHS program, in the September time frame.
With regard to NHS specifically, our NHS program has continued to deliver successfully through the first quarter. In primary care, our footprint has expanded with 57 new GP deployments this quarter, giving us a total of 1,350 fully operational GP systems. 16 million patient records are now expertly and accurately managed through our Primary Care Solution. I'm pleased to report that the high-profile deployment at the University Hospital at Morecambe Bay, the first acute hospital trust to operate with our Lorenzo Release 1.9 solution, successfully went live at the end of May. The earlier deployment of Bury Trust has also been updated with this latest incremental functionality.
We are proceeding with deployment preparations at our final two early-adopter trusts during our Q2 and Q3. This will complete the early adopter phase for Lorenzo Release 1.9. We would then anticipate a quickening pace of full-scale deployments. 
Outside of the U.K., our business in EMEA from a macro perspective is concentrated in the more economically robust countries including France, Germany, the Nordics and Switzerland. The euro's weakness has aided the exporting economies, especially Germany, and our businesses in France and Switzerland are healthy and growing. Only 1.2% of our business is in Southern Europe, mostly in Italy. We have little if any exposure to the national markets of Portugal, Spain, Ireland or Greece.
Across Europe, currency effects will probably produce a top line headwind for us this year. At current spot rates, CSC's fiscal year revenues will be negatively impacted by about 1%. 
Looking across the border market at our global commercial businesses, we see some signs of recovery. Pipelines are building constructively. Customers are more actively engaging in exploration of new initiatives, although their decisions are still cautious. We anticipate this activity will translate to top line uplift in our second half.
Demand for managed services is positive and we experienced an increase in RFI and RFP activity in Q1. Primary drivers are cost efficiency, globalization and increased privacy and security regulations and concerns. Developments in virtualization and cloud are driving the adaptation of new business models into forms of technology as a service, which plays to CSC's strengths. 
Demand for applications management was strong. Our revenue in this business was up over 10% year-over-year. Overall the qualified pipeline of sourcing opportunities to be awarded in fiscal year '11 stands at $12 billion, up from $11 billion year-over-year.
Within our federal market, NPS delivered positive first quarter growth of 2.2%. Importantly, two protests of significant contracts have recently been resolved, which should benefit growth in our second half. We now have the transition activities on the TSA ITIP contract, the $492 million award we won over a year ago, to begin in early September. The Army's R2-3G contract is a significant ID/IQ vehicle with a $16.4 billion ceiling. Its predecessor contract was one of our largest contract vehicles. And the lack of new task order flow over the last 18 months has been a headwind for the business. Now that this protest has been resolved, we expect task orders to begin to flow again over the next several months.
Other key first quarter wins for NPS include three significant ID/IQ contracts from the Department of State, the Missile Defense Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. These vehicles have a combined ceiling of $4 billion. While we do not include CCV estimates [ph](27:42) for these wins in our new business bookings disclosure, second half revenues will benefit as task orders from these vehicles start to flow. While the frustrations of a prolonged federal procurement process persist, our federal business pipeline remains strong, with some $19 billion awards currently scheduled to be announced by the end of fiscal year '11.
Turning to Slide 7 and looking forward. Complementing our pipeline of new business opportunities is our strong backlog position. CSC's diverse portfolio of public sector and commercial business generates a substantial revenue backlog that provides stability and predictability to our financial results. Excluding short-term project revenues, our current backlog stands at approximately $42 billion and represents approximately three years of revenue, essentially evenly split between commercial and NPS. Added to this backlog, there is a substantial revenue potential from our broad portfolio of U.S. Government ID/IQ contracts. Mike Mancuso will provide additional details in his remarks.
We are reaffirming our guidance for bookings in excess of $18 billion, and top line growth of 4% to 7%, an expansion of 25 to 50 basis points for the year in the operating margin, and EPS of $5.30 to $5.40 and free cash flow greater than 90% of net income. Additionally, we are affirming a dividend of $0.15 to our shareholders of record as of the 9th of September 2010. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mancuso for further details on our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year '11."

If you'll turn to Chart 9, which should look familiar to you since it was Mike Laphen's opening chart. I am using it again because I want to strongly emphasize to all of our shareholders that as a management team, we are focused on and committed to continuous improvement. And each of the financial metrics referenced on this chart have favorably, and not insignificantly, improved over the last year. And at the risk of dwelling on the macroeconomic outlook and the pace of a somewhat uncertain recovery, we are doing everything we can to improve operations and position CSC for accelerated and profitable growth, as the global economic recovery accelerates. We are controlling what we can control, competing vigorously, winning a fair share of the business that is being awarded, investing in the key growth areas of cloud computing, cybersecurity and healthcare, and enhancing our horizontal capability as evidenced by our recently announced Bass acquisition, which broadens our footprint in the chemical energy and natural resources market.
To support growth, we need a strong foundation. Mike Laphen in his opening remarks mentioned the fact that at the quarter end, we have a backlog of $42 billion. Up to now, we have not talked about our backlog or offered insight into its composition. So if you will turn to Chart 10, I'll talk about that backlog in the context of our FY '11 revenue guidance. The midpoint of our revenue guidance for FY '11 is $17 billion. If you will direct your attention to the blue-shaded area at the bottom of the pyramid, including our first quarter revenue, we see 76% of our FY '11 revenue, or roughly $13 billion, coming from existing backlog. Our shorter-term project and consulting work, which is essentially our BSS segment excluding the NHS contract, which is in backlog, is very predictable and we will produce 18% of our FY '11 revenue, which is another $3 billion. Therefore, the sum of the FY '11 revenue from backlog, plus the short-term consulting project work, gets us $16 billion, meaning that we only need generate another 6% or $1 billion from new business. We see this as quite doable, considering our pipeline and our ID/IQ portfolio. And as the top of the chart suggests, we have a new business qualified pipeline of $34 billion of FY '11 potential awards. And in addition, we also have qualified for another $5 billion of ID/IQ awards which is not in backlog, but that our track record and historical performance suggests will generate a significant number of task orders which will also help fill the FY '11 new business revenue estimate. The message from this chart is that we believe our FY '11 guidance is achievable. And further that between our NPS segment, MSS segment and the NHS contract, we have $42 billion in backlog, which equates to over three years of revenue for those businesses and provides a solid foundation for future revenue growth beyond FY '11.
Now moving on. In an attempt to address the inevitable constant currency question, we will introduce Charts 11 and 12. Chart 11 breaks down our last fiscal year's revenue by currency. With the U.S. at 63%, the British pound at 12%, Europe or the euro at 9%, Australia at 5%, and 11% of All Other. This should help frame your thinking with regard to currency exposure. And I also want to remind you, most of our currency exposure is translation risk, not cost and revenue in disparate currencies.
Now if you'll turn to Chart 12, this now takes FY '11 first quarter revenue by currency, which closely approximate the FY '10 full year numbers, and on a weighted basis using the August 9 spot rate, projects the full year potential of currency impact to be roughly one point of revenue or about $170 million. The bottom line here is that if the rates hang where they are now, we don't see a significant currency impact in FY '11.
Chart 13, revenue by line of business, shows you that NPS and MSS grew by over 2%, while BSS, comprised of consulting and project work, declined by 2%. Keep in mind that NHS is in BSS and was relatively revenue-constant year-over-year. The decline in BSS is primarily the result of the divestiture of our Hong Kong break-fix business, which was sold in the second quarter of last year.
Chart 14 displays operating income by line of business. Operating income has improved 6% overall, and you can see where the gains occurred.
Chart 15 is the comparative P&L. The key takeaways are the improvement in operating income and margin rate, lower corporate G&A and interest expense more than offsetting the higher tax rate. Applying the FY '11 higher tax rate to FY '10, would yield an 11% year-over-year growth in EPS versus the reported 7%.
Chart 16 displays selected balance sheet items year-over-year. The message here is simple: more cash, less receivables, less debt and better ratios. Speaking of receivables, if you turn to Chart 17, you can see the downward migration in days receivables continues, a result of lots of hard work with tedious attention to detail. Using a baseball analogy, it's the result of a lot of singles and stolen bases, sacrifice bunts and an occasional squeeze play. However, we are not done and we think there is still room for further improvement.
Chart 18 is selected cash flow items. Cash flow from earnings has increased. The year-over-year change in working capital was less severe than in the past, although there is some growth in CapEx. However, before someone asks the question, we do not see CapEx growing this year, and we maintain our focus on being less capital-intensive as we grow. Free cash flow was much improved over last year, as we continue our focus on reducing the seasonality of free cash. We got a very good start toward that goal.
Chart 19 reiterates our quarterly EPS guidance for the rest of the year, noting that our guidance to you for Q1 was $0.88, which we were able to exceed. But at this point, we think the ranges for the next three quarters are reasonable. 
So in summary on Chart 20, I think the words speak for themselves. We had a good start to the year. Several improvements have been recorded. Yes, there are more challenges ahead. But from our perspective, optimism abounds and we look forward to another solid year. So with that said, I'll turn it back to Bryan to begin the Q&A."

So again we don't have clarity or visibility on where that's going to be. But certainly, mission-critical will be part of that."

And thank you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter financial results. My remarks this morning will focus on three areas: First, I will share with you my assessment of our first quarter financial performance. Second, I'll address some topics we believe are on the minds of our investors and finally, I will provide our overall sense of the broader marketplace and the resulting implications on our business for the remainder of our fiscal year '11. As usual, when I finish, Mike Mancuso will add some color and detail to our numbers. And then we'll move on to take your questions.
On our last call, we reported very strong fiscal year-end performance and indicated that we were optimistic about our prospects for the new fiscal year. We can now report a solid result for our first quarter, and that our optimism for continued improvement this fiscal year remains intact. 
The highlights of our first quarter are shown on Slide 5. In line with our expectations, we continued to see top line improvement this quarter, achieving positive growth year-over-year as reported. Both our North American Public Sector and our Managed Services Sector reported 2.2% increases in revenue. Our Business Solutions & Services Sector revenues experienced a slight decline of 2%. However, net of the effects from a disposition, it also grew by 2.5%. So all three lines of businesses demonstrated top line growth.
Our long-term profitability program again delivered results. Operating income increased by 5.7% and operating margin rose to 7.1%, a 32 basis point improvement year-over-year. With the improved operational performance, EPS grew at a rate greater than revenue and increased to $0.91, up 7% year-over-year. This positive EPS result was achieved despite an effective tax rate increase of some 300 basis points year-over-year. 
Cash performance also improved, as we reduced the variability of our quarterly cash flows. While cash flow was negative, as is the norm for our first quarter, free cash flow improved by some $144 million year-over-year. This improvement reflects our continued focus and success in cash management across the corporation.
On the new business front, bookings were $3.2 billion, down $300 million year-over-year. Continuing delays in the U.S. government's acquisition process were the primary cause of the lower bookings number. Some particularly noteworthy bookings included important wins at UBS, the Swiss financial services giant, and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA. UBS is now one of our largest outsourcing relationships in the banking and capital markets industry. At NOAA, our North American Public Sector was awarded a prestigious $317 million high-performance computing contract in support of NOAA's environmental modeling program to improve the accuracy of global and regional climate models. These wins, as well as other recent startups including Zurich, will contribute to our revenue profile in the second half.
Turning to Slide 6. I would now like to discuss the investor topics I referenced earlier. There have been numerous media reports on the potential effect that growing deficits might have on government spending. In addition, there have been several announced directives related to government contracting in general, and some on IT specifically. Since the U.S. government is our largest Public Sector customer, I will start there. 
On the civil side of the federal business, the new OMB or Office of Management and Budget directive on IT reform focuses on several areas including financial systems and high-risk IT programs. Of the 30 financial systems targeted for review, CSC has two monosized [ph] (19:49) programs. They are the IRS integrated financial system, which is in production and highly regarded, and a new startup with the Department of Agriculture. Both programs are scheduled for government review within the next 30 days. Impact, if any, should be minimal, and second half revenues for these two programs combined amount to less than $10 million.
In regard to high-risk IT programs, we believe there should be improvements in federal IT acquisition and management practices, and agree that OMB's efforts to reform these regulations and processes are important. Plans for agency reviews are still being formulated, so the assessment process is still in its early stages of definition. As troubled programs are restructured to introduce commercial IT practices, we see potential business opportunities for CSC. We believe CSC's strength in bringing commercial best practices in technology to the federal government over a wide range of successful programs gives us advantages over competitors, and we view this as a key differentiator for us in the marketplace.
Long awaited government healthcare initiatives are generating opportunity at both the federal and state levels. The Affordable Care Act is now moving into the implementation phase. This is driving an increase in contract activities across many federal civil agencies including HHS, SSA and the Treasury. In addition, both the VA and the DoD are planning major monetization efforts for their health systems. There will also be significant opportunities at the state level as mandates such as health insurance gateways must be implemented. I would note that CSC developed Health Insurance Gateway for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and it's the first of its kind in the country.
For the next several years, the outlook for the U.S. defense spending, particularly in the key areas of intelligence logistics systems support, data center consolidation and cybersecurity are positive. These are all mission critical markets in which CSC is well entrenched. Having said this, Secretary Gates has announced his goal of reducing DoD spending by $100 billion to [ph] (22:10) increased efficiency and the elimination of unnecessary programs. We've already seen the beginning of reductions in major weapons programs with more likely to come. This particular area of defense spending cutbacks is not anticipated to impact us in a material way although we expect further program reductions from Defense Secretary Gates' ongoing efficiency studies, we also believe the DoD's interest in leveraging commercial practices to improve productivity will play to our strengths. So with the high level of noise surrounding U.S. defense spending, it's important to use a filter when assessing the impacts. CSC continues to see the U.S. defense market as healthy and a solid contributor to our business.
Turning now to Europe. In the U.K., the new government is looking to achieve budget efficiencies and value for money, while improving the services they deliver to their citizens. Our business with the U.K., exclusive of NHS, is limited to about 2% of CSC revenue. Our U.K. management team has met with principal government partners, and we have offered a number of innovative proposals that could enable both parties to achieve their objectives. We anticipate these discussions to continue and expect to achieve resolution across our contract base, including the NHS program, in the September time frame.
With regard to NHS specifically, our NHS program has continued to deliver successfully through the first quarter. In primary care, our footprint has expanded with 57 new GP deployments this quarter, giving us a total of 1,350 fully operational GP systems. 16 million patient records are now expertly and accurately managed through our Primary Care Solution. I'm pleased to report that the high-profile deployment at the University Hospital at Morecambe Bay, the first acute hospital trust to operate with our Lorenzo Release 1.9 solution, successfully went live at the end of May. The earlier deployment of Bury Trust has also been updated with this latest incremental functionality.
We are proceeding with deployment preparations at our final two early-adopter trusts during our Q2 and Q3. This will complete the early adopter phase for Lorenzo Release 1.9. We would then anticipate a quickening pace of full-scale deployments. 
Outside of the U.K., our business in EMEA from a macro perspective is concentrated in the more economically robust countries including France, Germany, the Nordics and Switzerland. The euro's weakness has aided the exporting economies, especially Germany, and our businesses in France and Switzerland are healthy and growing. Only 1.2% of our business is in Southern Europe, mostly in Italy. We have little if any exposure to the national markets of Portugal, Spain, Ireland or Greece.
Across Europe, currency effects will probably produce a top line headwind for us this year. At current spot rates, CSC's fiscal year revenues will be negatively impacted by about 1%. 
Looking across the border market at our global commercial businesses, we see some signs of recovery. Pipelines are building constructively. Customers are more actively engaging in exploration of new initiatives, although their decisions are still cautious. We anticipate this activity will translate to top line uplift in our second half.
Demand for managed services is positive and we experienced an increase in RFI and RFP activity in Q1. Primary drivers are cost efficiency, globalization and increased privacy and security regulations and concerns. Developments in virtualization and cloud are driving the adaptation of new business models into forms of technology as a service, which plays to CSC's strengths. 
Demand for applications management was strong. Our revenue in this business was up over 10% year-over-year. Overall the qualified pipeline of sourcing opportunities to be awarded in fiscal year '11 stands at $12 billion, up from $11 billion year-over-year.
Within our federal market, NPS delivered positive first quarter growth of 2.2%. Importantly, two protests of significant contracts have recently been resolved, which should benefit growth in our second half. We now have the transition activities on the TSA ITIP contract, the $492 million award we won over a year ago, to begin in early September. The Army's R2-3G contract is a significant ID/IQ vehicle with a $16.4 billion ceiling. Its predecessor contract was one of our largest contract vehicles. And the lack of new task order flow over the last 18 months has been a headwind for the business. Now that this protest has been resolved, we expect task orders to begin to flow again over the next several months.
Other key first quarter wins for NPS include three significant ID/IQ contracts from the Department of State, the Missile Defense Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. These vehicles have a combined ceiling of $4 billion. While we do not include CCV estimates [ph](27:42) for these wins in our new business bookings disclosure, second half revenues will benefit as task orders from these vehicles start to flow. While the frustrations of a prolonged federal procurement process persist, our federal business pipeline remains strong, with some $19 billion awards currently scheduled to be announced by the end of fiscal year '11.
Turning to Slide 7 and looking forward. Complementing our pipeline of new business opportunities is our strong backlog position. CSC's diverse portfolio of public sector and commercial business generates a substantial revenue backlog that provides stability and predictability to our financial results. Excluding short-term project revenues, our current backlog stands at approximately $42 billion and represents approximately three years of revenue, essentially evenly split between commercial and NPS. Added to this backlog, there is a substantial revenue potential from our broad portfolio of U.S. Government ID/IQ contracts. Mike Mancuso will provide additional details in his remarks.
We are reaffirming our guidance for bookings in excess of $18 billion, and top line growth of 4% to 7%, an expansion of 25 to 50 basis points for the year in the operating margin, and EPS of $5.30 to $5.40 and free cash flow greater than 90% of net income. Additionally, we are affirming a dividend of $0.15 to our shareholders of record as of the 9th of September 2010. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Mancuso for further details on our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year '11."

If you'll turn to Chart 9, which should look familiar to you since it was Mike Laphen's opening chart. I am using it again because I want to strongly emphasize to all of our shareholders that as a management team, we are focused on and committed to continuous improvement. And each of the financial metrics referenced on this chart have favorably, and not insignificantly, improved over the last year. And at the risk of dwelling on the macroeconomic outlook and the pace of a somewhat uncertain recovery, we are doing everything we can to improve operations and position CSC for accelerated and profitable growth, as the global economic recovery accelerates. We are controlling what we can control, competing vigorously, winning a fair share of the business that is being awarded, investing in the key growth areas of cloud computing, cybersecurity and healthcare, and enhancing our horizontal capability as evidenced by our recently announced Bass acquisition, which broadens our footprint in the chemical energy and natural resources market.
To support growth, we need a strong foundation. Mike Laphen in his opening remarks mentioned the fact that at the quarter end, we have a backlog of $42 billion. Up to now, we have not talked about our backlog or offered insight into its composition. So if you will turn to Chart 10, I'll talk about that backlog in the context of our FY '11 revenue guidance. The midpoint of our revenue guidance for FY '11 is $17 billion. If you will direct your attention to the blue-shaded area at the bottom of the pyramid, including our first quarter revenue, we see 76% of our FY '11 revenue, or roughly $13 billion, coming from existing backlog. Our shorter-term project and consulting work, which is essentially our BSS segment excluding the NHS contract, which is in backlog, is very predictable and we will produce 18% of our FY '11 revenue, which is another $3 billion. Therefore, the sum of the FY '11 revenue from backlog, plus the short-term consulting project work, gets us $16 billion, meaning that we only need generate another 6% or $1 billion from new business. We see this as quite doable, considering our pipeline and our ID/IQ portfolio. And as the top of the chart suggests, we have a new business qualified pipeline of $34 billion of FY '11 potential awards. And in addition, we also have qualified for another $5 billion of ID/IQ awards which is not in backlog, but that our track record and historical performance suggests will generate a significant number of task orders which will also help fill the FY '11 new business revenue estimate. The message from this chart is that we believe our FY '11 guidance is achievable. And further that between our NPS segment, MSS segment and the NHS contract, we have $42 billion in backlog, which equates to over three years of revenue for those businesses and provides a solid foundation for future revenue growth beyond FY '11.
Now moving on. In an attempt to address the inevitable constant currency question, we will introduce Charts 11 and 12. Chart 11 breaks down our last fiscal year's revenue by currency. With the U.S. at 63%, the British pound at 12%, Europe or the euro at 9%, Australia at 5%, and 11% of All Other. This should help frame your thinking with regard to currency exposure. And I also want to remind you, most of our currency exposure is translation risk, not cost and revenue in disparate currencies.
Now if you'll turn to Chart 12, this now takes FY '11 first quarter revenue by currency, which closely approximate the FY '10 full year numbers, and on a weighted basis using the August 9 spot rate, projects the full year potential of currency impact to be roughly one point of revenue or about $170 million. The bottom line here is that if the rates hang where they are now, we don't see a significant currency impact in FY '11.
Chart 13, revenue by line of business, shows you that NPS and MSS grew by over 2%, while BSS, comprised of consulting and project work, declined by 2%. Keep in mind that NHS is in BSS and was relatively revenue-constant year-over-year. The decline in BSS is primarily the result of the divestiture of our Hong Kong break-fix business, which was sold in the second quarter of last year.
Chart 14 displays operating income by line of business. Operating income has improved 6% overall, and you can see where the gains occurred.
Chart 15 is the comparative P&L. The key takeaways are the improvement in operating income and margin rate, lower corporate G&A and interest expense more than offsetting the higher tax rate. Applying the FY '11 higher tax rate to FY '10, would yield an 11% year-over-year growth in EPS versus the reported 7%.
Chart 16 displays selected balance sheet items year-over-year. The message here is simple: more cash, less receivables, less debt and better ratios. Speaking of receivables, if you turn to Chart 17, you can see the downward migration in days receivables continues, a result of lots of hard work with tedious attention to detail. Using a baseball analogy, it's the result of a lot of singles and stolen bases, sacrifice bunts and an occasional squeeze play. However, we are not done and we think there is still room for further improvement.
Chart 18 is selected cash flow items. Cash flow from earnings has increased. The year-over-year change in working capital was less severe than in the past, although there is some growth in CapEx. However, before someone asks the question, we do not see CapEx growing this year, and we maintain our focus on being less capital-intensive as we grow. Free cash flow was much improved over last year, as we continue our focus on reducing the seasonality of free cash. We got a very good start toward that goal.
Chart 19 reiterates our quarterly EPS guidance for the rest of the year, noting that our guidance to you for Q1 was $0.88, which we were able to exceed. But at this point, we think the ranges for the next three quarters are reasonable. 
So in summary on Chart 20, I think the words speak for themselves. We had a good start to the year. Several improvements have been recorded. Yes, there are more challenges ahead. But from our perspective, optimism abounds and we look forward to another solid year. So with that said, I'll turn it back to Bryan to begin the Q&A."

I think it's like how high is up? I mean we're going to keep working on the balance sheet, keep grinding. We have still significant room to improve in receivables alone, regardless of business mix. So right now, free cash flow has a high correlation with our net earnings and I think prospectively, as we continue to work the equation that, that shouldn't change significantly. We may hit a quarter, for example, where there may be an abnormal free cash flow or an abnormal investment requirement, if you will, CapEx spend or something like that, I can't tell you when that would be but start-up on new outsourcing contracts might cause those kind of perturbations, but over the long haul I think we can still keep generating 90%-plus and still keep investing where we need to invest, both in capital equipment as well as technology."

There's a lot more activity out there than there has been. I don't think people are going to commit to big projects until some of the uncertainty is eliminated from the broader picture, including the whole tax picture. I just think there's too many uncertainties out there for people to go out with big types of capital spending, and including in the capital spending major capitalized key projects. So I think they're going to continue to be bite-size, but we're seeing more of the bite-sized, more of the medium-sized opportunities building out there. So we do see a build in the pipeline."

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today, as we discuss our financial results for the second quarter. We ended our last earnings call indicating that we expected our second quarter revenue to be similar to that of the first quarter and that the majority of this year's growth would occur in the second half. Consistent with that earlier view, we delivered modest sequential revenue growth in our second quarter. However, ongoing market improvements, the resolution of a protest on some key public sector awards and the ramp up of new business initiated in the first half, all reinforce our belief that we will experience meaningful top line growth in our second half. 
On the new business front, bookings strengthened to $4.5 billion for the quarter and $7.7 billion for the first half. Based on this first half performance, as well as current activity, we've increased our full-year bookings estimate by $500 million. Across our Global Commercial businesses, we see definite signs of recovery, pipelines are building constructively, customers are actively engaging in the exploration of new initiatives, and most importantly, buying decisions are being made. Business utilization and billing rates have improved and demand for services has increased.
Our consulting pipelines are robust and totaled 3x trailing 12 months revenue. Win rates remained strong, indicating market acceptance of our vertical and consulting solutions and traction for our BPO and industry-focused value propositions. Accordingly, BSS delivered second quarter year-over-year growth of 6%, net of M&A and in constant currency. We expect this growth to continue, if not accelerate, in the second half. 
Demand for outsourcing services remains positive. MSS revenues increased 2% for the quarter and 2.1% for the half in constant currency and we expect this growth to continue in the second half. The demand for application management services is particularly strong and we projected that this segment of the business will grow at low double-digit rates year-over-year.
The outsourcing pipeline for qualified opportunities scheduled for award by the close of our fiscal year '11 down to $12 billion, driving our optimism for a strong second half bookings. We are particularly pleased to start off our third quarter by welcoming BF Corporation, the world's largest apparel company as a new CSC client. 
Demand for cloud services continues across our markets, and we achieved a number of significant accomplishments. First, we successfully transitioned over 15,000 users across 36 of the city of Los Angeles's 40 departments to our Google-based cloud platform. 
We also recently announced our win on the state of California program for Microsoft BPOS cloud services. Additionally, we were selected by AMP, one of Australia's leading wealth management companies to implement our cloud based solution for email and collaborative services. This solution is based on the Dblock [ph] technology resulting from our announced alliance with the VCE coalition, a collaboration of Cisco, TMC and VMware.
For our ground breaking implementation of cloud-based other services to 28,000 Royal Mail Group employees, CSC just received the National Outsourcing Association's award for innovation in outsourcing. These accomplishments evidenced CSC's leadership position in the implementation of cloud services across both the public and private sectors. 
Within our Cyber business, we won several new contracts having a combined TCV of $50 million. We're continuing to see a growing pipeline of Cyber opportunities across both the public and commercial sectors. This strengthened our portfolio of Cyber IP and to expand into some new market segments within the world of Cyber. We recently completed the strategic acquisition of a small, but important Cyber company, VRL. This transaction has already generated considerable positive discussion within the community.
Our Federal Sector business, MPS, delivered strong second quarter bookings, totaling approximately $2.9 billion, which provides a good foundation for second half growth. These second quarter new business bookings include over $600 million of new TCV across the federal healthcare market space, with wins at the Health and Human Services centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense Health Affairs and the Department of Labor Office of Workers compensation programs.
Other important second quarter NPS wins totaling over $1 billion in TCV include delivery orders for the Department of State Visa support services in Mexico, the U.S. Army flight school 21, IT infrastructure services for a major intelligence agency and an important win at the Social Security Agency for information technology support. In addition to the solid first half bookings result, the MPS pipeline remains strong with $18 billion of qualified opportunities that are scheduled to be awarded over the next 12 months, $9 billion of which is scheduled for award by the end of CSC's fiscal year.
Our constructive view of MPS growth in the second half is also based on a resolution of two important protests, including the TSA ITIP program. We're finally starting on this program in September and its now in its late stages of the planned 90 day transition phase. I would now like to provide some updates to several of the investor topics of interest we discussed during our last earnings call.
With respect to our business with the U.S. federal government, we divested at the end of the quarter a subsidiary of MPS, Mission Solutions Engineering Inc. Resolving government concerns of conflicts of interest with other currency CSC programs at the Missile Defense Agency and the U.S. Navy. The recent U.S. midterm elections bring in a new Congress that we expect will prove to be a moderating force on reforms such as the government's insourcing initiatives, but one that will attempt to address concerns over budget deficits and their impact on the discretionary spending across the government. We continued to believe that our capabilities in delivering cost-effective, operational services and IT solutions which improved productivity are well aligned with the leadership objectives to achieved more request in government programs.
During last quarter's call, we also discussed the U.S. federal government's IT reform initiatives that focused on financial systems and high-profile IT programs. I thought it would be useful to take a couple of minutes on this call to provide some color on two of CSC's mission critical programs. CSC's Army Logistics Modernization Program, LMP, is one of the largest, if not the largest, ERP implementation in the world, with over 21,000 users globally. After the system successfully closed its financial books for the government fiscal year ending in September, this solution was deployed to its final tranche of users stationed at 29 locations across the globe. This massive go live event successfully completes the LMP deployments which now transition upon approval to operations and support. 
Release Three of the FAA's traffic flow management modernization program went live on the 21st of August. Since then, if you have flown anywhere within the continental United States, both the air traffic controllers and your flight crew have relied on this software release to help ensure your safe and timely flight. Each of these mission critical systems is essential to the function of its agency and to the delivery of the goods and services we expect from government. As such, we strongly believe that responses of mission-critical undertakings will continue to ensure their success, including the prioritization and allocation of scarce resources.
Turning to NHS. We've been engaged with NHS in detailed discussions over the past quarter. We are optimistic that an agreed MOU is forthcoming on CSC's local service provider contract for the North England and East of England. This program is built and end up being realized in light of the NHS changed agenda and in response to the U.K. government's initiative to significantly reduce its overall expenditure. As previously announced by the NHS, the contract value will be reduced by approximately 500 million pounds and includes scope adjustments. Our revised guidance reflects the expected impact of this realignment.
After successfully completing the Lorenzo Release 1.9 implementation at the poor early adopted trust, CSC will then move on to the full deployment of this solution. To this end, I am pleased to note that Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust became the third early adopter of our Lorenzo Release 1.9 solution as they went live on November 1. Early indications are positive and demonstrate further progress in the maturation of this solution and the go live process that has resulted from the early adoptive program.
In summary, we look forward to a positive second half and solid full year results. I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our second quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year '11, including guidance modifications and the Nordic accounting adjustments reflected in our press release."

I think Mike wrap in his opening remarks very clearly articulated the healthy status of our markets, our solid positioning in those markets, and the very favorable outlook for CSC as this economic reco",1193,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I think Mike wrap in his opening remarks very clearly articulated the healthy status of our markets, our solid positioning in those markets, and the very favorable outlook for CSC as this economic recovery gains momentum. My mission this morning is to provide you with the necessary insight into our financial results for the quarter to enhance your understanding of our performance. I will start out by saying we feel good about the quarter, we feel good about where we stand at the halfway point of our fiscal year, and we remain optimistic we will achieve the full year targets we have set for ourselves. I'll begin with Chart 7.
Sequentially, we achieved our goal of continuous improvement in each quarter throughout the year. Every important financial metric is better than the previous quarter. Year-over-year comparisons of revenue, operating earnings, margin and EPS requires several adjustments to normalize the divestitures, claim settlements, the Nordics adjustment and a significantly different tax rate. 
If you'll turn now to Chart 8. This chart entailed backlogs to revenue is intended to support our revenue forecast by laying out how much in the year revenue will come from existing backlog. The message on the chart can be found at the top of the pyramid in that only 2% of our in year revenue is dependent on new business that is not now in backlog.
Chart 9 displays the new bookings profile over the last six quarters. Our positioning for the first two quarters of this year is quite similar to last year's pattern, where we achieved over $19 billion in new business for the year. Our identified qualified pipeline that Mike Laphen referred to gives us the confidence that our $18.5 billion-plus guidance target is achievable.
Chart #10 addresses currency. 64% of our cost and revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars and as you can see, our second largest currency is the British pound at 11%. Assuming the November 8 spot rate, we do not see currency as an issue for us in FY '11. Also worthy to note is that the bulk of our costs is denominated in paid for in local currency, creating a natural hedge. Our primary risk, such that it is, is translation for reporting purposes.
Chart 11 displays year-over-year revenue by our three lines of business. NPS has the only negative variance from last year, a result of the slowdown of federal government awards in the first half and the large one-time $65 million claim settlement reflected in the FY '10 revenue. BSS would have a more significant increase if adjusted for a divestiture. I also want to point out that the Nordics margin adjustments also included a $36 million revenue reversal. Adjusting both years for the claims settlement, divestiture impact and the Nordic reversal, year-over-year revenue would have increased by $70 million or 2%.
Slide 12 reflects operating income by line of business. The message on this chart is threefold. NPS, despite lower revenue is $22 million better than last year. MSS is dramatically lower, predominately impacted by the charges taken in our Nordics business to correct misapplication of internal accounting policies, U.S. GAAP and accounting irregularities. And BSS has increased over $10 million on very modest revenue growth.
Chart 13 presents the year-over-year P&L comparison. There are two important points to be made. If you focus on the other income expense line, you will see income of $35 million this year, roughly 2/3 represents the gain on the sale of our MS e-business that Mike Laphen mentioned. The second item is the tax rate which is significantly higher this year. The MSE gain somewhat offsets the Nordics adjustments impact on operating income and normalizing for the tax rate makes for a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results.
Chart 14 intends to further normalize for the year-over-year variations, including margin rates. But for the Nordics events, our rate would compare more favorably to last year. 
Chart 15 first half results. First half to first half, we are about where we were last year, but better positioned this year for second half revenue growth in a recovering economy.
Chart 16 reflects the balance sheet comparisons to last year. Cash is $250 million higher at quarter end, liabilities are much lower, less higher equity and much improved ratios. Not reflected on this chart is the fact that earlier this quarter, using our cash, we paid down $750 million of our drawn $1.5 billion bank line.
Turning to Chart 17, it displays our days receivable for the last five quarters, while our trend line is good, we did have an uptick in days from last quarter. There are no underlying issues and we expect to meet our reduction target for the year.
Chart 18, selected cash flow items for the first half versus last year. Cash flow from earnings is unchanged. Operating cash flow has improved, but offset by the increased CapEx, which accounts for the variance in free cash flow. This is a timing variance and we expect CapEx to decline in the second half.
Chart 19 is our quarterly EPS guidance. We have increased our EPS guidance for the full year by $0.05. Our third and fourth quarter range is not dramatically different from prior guidance. We expect our tax rate for the full year to decrease from our prior guidance of 32% to below 30%. And for those of you that are looking for a specific number, I would use 29% for now.
Chart 20 reflects our updated guidance. Our strong pipeline gives us the confidence to raise our bookings number to $18.5 billion plus from the $18 billion-plus prior. We still believe revenue will grow appreciably in the second half of the year, but because of the delays in the federal procurement awards, the MSE divestiture and an anticipated modest reduction in NHS revenue, we have lowered the top-end of our range from $17.2 billion to $17 billion and the lower end from $16.8 billion to $16.5 billion. The Nordics issue and its lingering cost structure issues cost us to adjust the margin range downward for now. You'll recall we expected 25 to 50 basis points of improvement for the year, and 9.25% was our top end. We have adjusted it to 9%.
We have increased our EPS and the strength of our tax rate reduction and remain confident that free cash flow will exceed 90% of net income. Reflecting on how you should think about the Nordics adjustment, try to keep in mind that the business is geographically dispersed desires will present controlled challenges from time to time, and we are in 94 countries.  The good news is, we found it, we fixed it and put it behind us. 
So again, to summarize how we feel, we are still bullish on the year. We feel good about our second half revenue growth. The accounting issues in the Nordics are nonrecurring, and should be thought of as a bump in the road for an otherwise positive first half. That being said, I'll turn it now back to Bryan to kick off the Q&A."

But the margin, there's not a change in the margin, it's just the contribution and the NHS in the year for margin will be less than it was and less anticipated in the prior guidance. As far as the other impacts, the Nordics was $40 plus million, fortyish was the problem there. Other than that, margins are intact. We don't have any other issues, underperforming business, et cetera. The Nordics Region itself is soft, frankly. It's lagging the European recovery. We have what we refer to as redundancy issues there. We have excess staff to the amount of business that they've been able to capture for the moment. That's creating a going forward drain on our margins. We have to deal with that. As you know, the European federal insurers are rather expensive than if we shed the workforce. It comes with the price tag. If we shed this workforce, and then there's an uptick in revenue, we have to bring them back. So it's a balancing act.

We ended our last earnings call indicating that we expected our second quarter revenue to be similar to that of the first quarter and that the majority of this year’s growth would occur in the second half.
Consistent with that earlier view, we delivered modest sequential revenue growth in our second quarter. However, ongoing market improvements, the resolution of a protest on some key public sector awards and the ramp-up of new business initiated in the first half, all reinforce our belief that we will experience meaningful top line growth in our second half.
On the new business front, bookings strengthened to $4.5 billion for the quarter and $7.7 billion for the first half. Based on this first half performance as well as current activity we’ve increased our full year bookings estimate by $500 million.
Across our global commercial businesses, we see definite signs of recovery. Pipelines are building constructively, customers are actively engaging in the exploration of new initiatives, and most importantly buying decisions are being made.
Business utilization and billing rates have improved, and demand for services has increased. Our Consulting pipelines are robust and total three times trailing 12 months revenue.
Win rates remained strong, indicating market acceptance of our vertical and consulting solutions and traction for our BPO and industry focused value propositions.
Accordingly, BSS delivered second quarter year-over-year growth of 6% net of M&A and in constant currency. We expect this growth to continue, if not accelerate in the second half.
Demand for outsourcing services remains positive. MSS revenues increased 2% for the quarter and 2.1% for the half in constant currency. We expect this growth to continue in the second half.
The demand for application management services is particularly strong, and we project that this segment of the business will grow at low double-digit rates year-over-year. The outsourcing pipeline for qualified opportunities scheduled for award by the close of our fiscal year ‘11 $10 to $12 billion, driving our optimism for strong second half bookings.
We are particularly pleased to start off our third quarter by welcoming VF Corporation, the world’s largest apparel company as a new CSC client. Demand for cloud services continues across our markets, and we achieved a number of significant accomplishments.
First, we successfully transitioned over 15,000 users across 36 of the city of Los Angeles’s 40 departments through our Google-based cloud platform. We also recently announced our win on the State of California program for Microsoft BPOS cloud services.
Additionally, we were selected by AMP one of Australia’s leading wealth management companies to implement our cloud based solution for email and collaborative services. This solution is based on the debug technology resulting from our announced alliance with the DCE coalition, a collaboration of CISCO, EMC and VMware.
For our groundbreaking implementation of cloud based to all of services to 28,000 Royal Mail Group employees CSC just received a National Outsourcing Association’s award for innovation in outsourcing. These accomplishments evidence CSC’s leadership position in the implementation of clod services across both the public and private sectors.
Within our cyber business, we won several new contracts having a combined TCV of $50 million. We are continuing to see a growing pipeline of cyber opportunities across both the public and commercial sectors.
The strength in our portfolio of fiber IP and to expand into some new market segments within the world of cyber, we’ve recently completed the strategic acquisition of a small but important cyber company VRL. This transaction has already generated considerable positive discussion within the community.
Our Federal Sector business MPS delivered strong second quarter bookings totaling approximately $2.9 billion which provides a good foundation for second half growth. These second quarter new business bookings included over $600 million of new TCV across the federal healthcare market space with wins at the health and human services centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense Health Affairs and the Department of Labor Office Of Workers’ Compensation Programs.
Other important second quarter NPS wins totaling over $1 billion in TCV include deliver orders for the Department of State visa support services in Mexico, the U.S. Army Flight School XXI, IT infrastructure services for a major intelligence agency and an important win at the Social Security Agency for information technology support.
In addition to this solid first half bookings results, the NPS pipeline remains strong with $18 billion of qualified opportunities that are scheduled to be awarded over the next 12 months, $9 billion of which is scheduled for award by the end of CSC’s fiscal year.
Our constructive view of NPS growth in the second half is also based on the resolution of two important protests including the TSA ITIP program. Work finally started on this program in September and it’s now in its late stages of the planned 90-day transition phase.
I would now like to provide some updates to several of the investor topics of interest we discussed during our last earnings call. With respect to our business with the U.S. federal government, we divested at the end of the quarter a subsidiary of NPS, Mission Solutions Engineering Inc. resolving government concerns of conflicts of interest with other current CSC programs at the Missile Defense Agency and the U.S. Navy.
The recent U.S. midterm elections bring in a new congress that we expect will prove to be a moderating force on reforms such as the government’s insourcing initiative but one that will attempt to address concerns over budget deficits and their impact on the discretionary spending across the government.
We continue to believe that our capabilities in delivering cost effective operational services and IT solutions which improve productivity are well aligned with the leadership objectives to achieve more with less government programs.
During last quarter’s call, we also discussed the U.S. federal government’s IT reform initiative that focused on financial systems and high profile IT programs. I thought it would be useful to take a couple of minutes on this call to provide some color on two of CSC’s mission-critical programs.
CSC’s Army Logistics Modernization Program, LMP, is one of the largest if not the largest ERP implementation in the world with over 21,000 users globally. After the system successfully closed its financial books for the government fiscal year ending in September, this solution was deployed through its final tranche of users stationed at 29 locations across the globe. This massive go-live event successfully completes the LMP deployment which now will transition upon approval to operations and support.
Release 3 of the FAA’s Traffic Flow Management Modernization Program went live on the 21st of August. Since then if you have gone anywhere within the continental United States, both the air traffic controllers and your flight crew have relied on this software release to help ensure your safe and timely flight.
Each of these mission-critical systems is essential to the functioning of its agency and the delivery of the goods and services we expect from government. As such, we strongly believe that the sponsors of mission-critical undertakings will continue to ensure their success, including the prioritization and allocation of scarce resources.
Turning to NHS, we’ve been engaged with NHS in detailed discussions over the past quarter. We are optimistic that an agreed MOU is forthcoming on CSC’s local service provider contract for the North Midland and East of England. This program has been realigned in light of the NHS’s changed agenda and in response to the U.K. government initiative to significantly reduce its overall expenditure.
As previously announced by the NHS, the contract value will be reduced by approximately £500 million and includes scope adjustments. Our revised guidance reflects the expected impact of this realignment.
After successfully completing the Lorenzo Release 1.9 implementation at the four early adopted trust CSC will then move on to the full deployment of this solution. I am pleased to the note that Birmingham Women’s NHS Foundation Trust became the third early adopter of our Lorenzo Release 1.9 solution as they went live on November 1.
Early indications are positive and demonstrate further progress in the maturation of the solution and the go-live process that has resulted from the early adopter program. In summary, we look forward to a positive second half and solid full year results.
I’ll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our second quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year ‘11 including guidance modifications and the Nordic accounting adjustments reflected in our press release.

I think Mike Laphen’s remarks very clearly articulated the healthy status of our markets, our solid positioning in those markets, and the very favorable outlook for CSC, as this economic recovery gain",1197,"Thanks, Mike and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I think Mike Laphen’s remarks very clearly articulated the healthy status of our markets, our solid positioning in those markets, and the very favorable outlook for CSC, as this economic recovery gains momentum.
My mission this morning is to provide you with the necessary insight into our financial results for the quarter, to enhance your understanding of our performance. I’ll start out by saying we feel good about the quarter. We feel good about where we stand at the halfway point of our fiscal year, and we remain optimistic we will achieve the full year targets we have set for ourselves.
I’ll begin with chart number 7; sequentially, we achieved our goal of continuous improvement in each quarter throughout the year. Every important financial metric is better than the previous quarter. Year-over-year comparisons of revenue, operating earnings, margin and EPS require several adjustments to normalize the divestitures, claim settlements, the Nordics adjustment, and a significantly different tax rate.
If you’ll turn now to chart number 8; this chart entitled backlog to revenue is intended to support our revenue forecast by laying out how much in year revenue will come from existing backlog. The message on the chart can be found at the top of the pyramid in that only 2% of our in year revenue is dependent on new business that is not now in backlog.
Chart number 9 displays the new bookings profile over the last six quarters. Our positioning through the first two quarters of this year is quite similar to last year’s pattern, where we achieved over $19 billion in new business for the year. Our identified qualified pipeline that Mike Laphen referred to gives us the confidence that our $18.5 billion plus guidance target is achievable.
Chart number 10 addresses currency. 64% of our cost and revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars and as you can see our second largest currency is the British pound at 11%. Assuming the November 8th spot rate, we do not currency as an issue for us in FY ‘11. Also worthy to note is that the bulk of our cost is denominated and paid for in local currency creating a natural hedge. Our primary risk, such that it is, is translation for reporting purposes.
Chart number 11 displays year-over-year revenue by our three lines of business. NPS has the only negative variance from last year, a result of the slowdown of federal government awards in the first half and the large one-time $65 million claim settlement reflected in the FY ‘10 revenue. BSS would have a more significant increase if adjusted for divestiture.
I also want to point out that the Nordics margin adjustments also included a $36 million revenue reversal. Adjusting both years for the claim settlement, divestiture impact and the Nordic reversal, year-over-year revenue would have increased by $70 million or 2%.
Chart number 12 reflects operating income by line of business. The message on this chart is threefold. NPS despite lower revenue is $22 million better than last year. MSS is dramatically lower, predominantly impacted by the charges taken in our Nordics business to correct misapplication of internal accounting policies, U.S. GAAP and accounting irregularities, and BSS has increased over $10 million on very modest revenue growth.
Chart number 13 presents the year-over-year P&L comparison. There are two important points to be made. If you focus on the other income/expense line, you’ll see income of $35 million this year. Roughly two-third represents the gain on the sale of our MSE business that Mike Laphen mentioned.
The second item is the tax rate which is significantly higher this year. The MSE gain somewhat offsets to Nordics adjustment impact on operating income and normalizing for the tax rate makes for a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results.
Chart number 14 attempts to further normalize for the year-over-year variations including margin rates, but for the Nordics events, our rate would compare more favorably to last year.
Chart number 15, first half results, first half to first half we are about where we were last year but better positioned this year for second half revenue growth in a recovering economy.
Chart number 16 reflects the balance sheet comparison with the last year. Cash is $250 million higher at quarter end. Liabilities are much lower, thus higher equity and much improved ratios. Not reflected on this chart is the fact that earlier this quarter using our cash we paid down $750 million of our drawn $1.5 billion bank loan.
Turning to chart number 17, it displays our days receivable for the last five quarters. While our trend line is good, we did have enough picking days from last quarter. There are no underlying issues and we expect to meet our reduction target for the year.
Chart number 18 selected cash flow items for the first half versus last year. Cash flow from earnings is unchanged. Operating cash flow has improved, but offset by the increased CapEx which accounts for the variance in free cash flow. This is a timing variance, and we expect CapEx to decline in the second half.
Chart number 19 is our quarterly EPS guidance. We have increased our EPS guidance for the full year by $0.05. Our third and fourth quarter range is not dramatically different from prior guidance. We expect our tax rate for the full year to decrease from our prior guidance of 32% to below 30%. For those of you that are looking for a specific number, I would use 29% for now.
Chart number 20, reflects our updated guidance. Our strong pipeline gives us the confidence to raise our bookings number to $18.5 billion plus from the $18 billion plus prior. We still believe revenue will grow appreciably in the second half of the year, but because of the delays in the federal procurement awards the MSE divestiture and an anticipated modest reduction in NHS revenue, we have lowered the top end of our range from $17.2 to $17 billion and the lower end from $16.8 billion to $16.5 billion.
The Nordics issue and its lingering cost structure issues caused us to adjust the margin range downward for now. You’ll recall we expected 25 to 50 basis points of improvements for the year, and 9.25% was our top end. We have adjusted it to 9%.
We have increased our EPS in the strength of our tax rate reduction and remain confident that free cash flow will exceed 90% of net income. Reflecting on how you should think about the Nordics in adjustments, try to keep in mind that a business is geographically dispersed as ours, will present controlled challenges from time to time, and we are in 94 countries. The good news is we found it, fixed it, and put it behind us.
So, again to summarize how we feel, we are still bullish on the year. We feel good about our second half revenue growth. The accounting issues at Nordics are non-recurring and should be thought of as a bump in the road to an otherwise positive first half.
That being said, I’ll turn it back to Bryan to kick-off the Q&A.

As far as the other impacts, the Nordics was $40 million plus, 40-ish was the problem there. Other than that, margins are intact. We don’t have any other issues, underperforming businesses, etc., etc., The Nordics region itself is soft frankly. It’s lagging the European recovery. We have what we refer to as redundancy issues there. We have excess staff to the amount of business that they have been able to capture for the moment. That’s creating a going forward drain on our margins. We have to deal with that. As you know the European government’s rule are rather expensive and if we shed the workforce it comes with a price tag. If we shed this workforce and then there is an uptick in revenue, we have to bring them back. So it’s a balancing act. So that’s about the best color I can give you on the numbers.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today, as we discuss our financial results for the second quarter. We ended our last earnings call indicating that we expected our second quarter revenue to be similar to that of the first quarter and that the majority of this year's growth would occur in the second half. Consistent with that earlier view, we delivered modest sequential revenue growth in our second quarter. However, ongoing market improvements, the resolution of a protest on some key public sector awards and the ramp up of new business initiated in the first half, all reinforce our belief that we will experience meaningful top line growth in our second half. 
On the new business front, bookings strengthened to $4.5 billion for the quarter and $7.7 billion for the first half. Based on this first half performance, as well as current activity, we've increased our full-year bookings estimate by $500 million. Across our Global Commercial businesses, we see definite signs of recovery, pipelines are building constructively, customers are actively engaging in the exploration of new initiatives, and most importantly, buying decisions are being made. Business utilization and billing rates have improved and demand for services has increased.
Our consulting pipelines are robust and totaled 3x trailing 12 months revenue. Win rates remained strong, indicating market acceptance of our vertical and consulting solutions and traction for our BPO and industry-focused value propositions. Accordingly, BSS delivered second quarter year-over-year growth of 6%, net of M&A and in constant currency. We expect this growth to continue, if not accelerate, in the second half. 
Demand for outsourcing services remains positive. MSS revenues increased 2% for the quarter and 2.1% for the half in constant currency and we expect this growth to continue in the second half. The demand for application management services is particularly strong and we projected that this segment of the business will grow at low double-digit rates year-over-year.
The outsourcing pipeline for qualified opportunities scheduled for award by the close of our fiscal year '11 stands at $12 billion, driving our optimism for a strong second half bookings. We are particularly pleased to start off our third quarter by welcoming BF Corporation, the world's largest apparel company as a new CSC client. 
Demand for cloud services continues across our markets, and we achieved a number of significant accomplishments. First, we successfully transitioned over 15,000 users across 36 of the city of Los Angeles's 40 departments to our Google-based cloud platform. 
We also recently announced our win on the state of California program for Microsoft BPOS cloud services. Additionally, we were selected by AMP, one of Australia's leading wealth management companies to implement our cloud based solution for email and collaborative services. This solution is based on the Dblock [ph] technology resulting from our announced alliance with the VCE coalition, a collaboration of Cisco, TMC and VMware.
For our ground breaking implementation of cloud-based other [ph] services to 28,000 Royal Mail Group employees, CSC just received the National Outsourcing Association's award for innovation in outsourcing. These accomplishments evidenced CSC's leadership position in the implementation of cloud services across both the public and private sectors. 
Within our Cyber business, we won several new contracts having a combined TCV of $50 million. We're continuing to see a growing pipeline of Cyber opportunities across both the public and commercial sectors. This strengthened our portfolio of Cyber IP and to expand into some new market segments within the world of Cyber. We recently completed the strategic acquisition of a small, but important Cyber company, VRL. This transaction has already generated considerable positive discussion within the community.
Our Federal Sector business, MPS, delivered strong second quarter bookings, totaling approximately $2.9 billion, which provides a good foundation for second half growth. These second quarter new business bookings include over $600 million of new TCV across the federal healthcare market space, with wins at the Health and Human Services centers for Medicare and Medicaid services, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense Health Affairs and the Department of Labor Office of Workers compensation programs.
Other important second quarter NPS wins totaling over $1 billion in TCV include delivery orders for the Department of State Visa support services in Mexico, the U.S. Army flight school 21, IT infrastructure services for a major intelligence agency and an important win at the Social Security Agency for information technology support. In addition to the solid first half bookings result, the MPS pipeline remains strong with $18 billion of qualified opportunities that are scheduled to be awarded over the next 12 months, $9 billion of which is scheduled for award by the end of CSC's fiscal year.
Our constructive view of MPS growth in the second half is also based on a resolution of two important protests, including the TSA ITIP program. We're finally starting on this program in September and its now in its late stages of the planned 90 day transition phase. I would now like to provide some updates to several of the investor topics of interest we discussed during our last earnings call.
With respect to our business with the U.S. federal government, we divested at the end of the quarter a subsidiary of MPS, Mission Solutions Engineering Inc. Resolving government concerns of conflicts of interest with other currency CSC programs at the Missile Defense Agency and the U.S. Navy. The recent U.S. midterm elections bring in a new Congress that we expect will prove to be a moderating force on reforms such as the government's insourcing initiatives, but one that will attempt to address concerns over budget deficits and their impact on the discretionary spending across the government. We continue to believe that our capabilities in delivering cost-effective, operational services and IT solutions which improved productivity are well aligned with the leadership objectives to achieved more request in government programs.
During last quarter's call, we also discussed the U.S. federal government's IT reform initiatives that focused on financial systems and high-profile IT programs. I thought it would be useful to take a couple of minutes on this call to provide some color on two of CSC's mission critical programs. CSC's Army Logistics Modernization Program, LMP, is one of the largest, if not the largest, ERP implementation in the world, with over 21,000 users globally. After the system successfully closed its financial books for the government fiscal year ending in September, this solution was deployed to its final tranche of users stationed at 29 locations across the globe. This massive go live event successfully completes the LMP deployments which will now transition upon approval to operations and support. 
Release Three of the FAA's traffic flow management modernization program went live on the 21st of August. Since then, if you have flown anywhere within the continental United States, both the air traffic controllers and your flight crew have relied on this software release to help ensure your safe and timely flight. Each of these mission critical systems is essential to the function of its agency and to the delivery of the goods and services we expect from government. As such, we strongly believe that sponsors of mission-critical undertakings will continue to ensure their success, including the prioritization and allocation of scarce resources.
Turning to NHS. We've been engaged with NHS in detailed discussions over the past quarter. We are optimistic that an agreed MOU is forthcoming on CSC's local service provider contract for the north, midlands, and east of England. This program is built and end up [ph] being realigned in light of the NHS changed agenda and in response to the U.K. government's initiative to significantly reduce its overall expenditure. As previously announced by the NHS, the contract value will be reduced by approximately 500 million pounds and includes scope adjustments. Our revised guidance reflects the expected impact of this realignment.
After successfully completing the Lorenzo Release 1.9 implementation at the four early adopted trusts, CSC will then move on to the full deployment of this solution. To this end, I am pleased to note that Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust became the third early adopter of our Lorenzo Release 1.9 solution as they went live on November 1. Early indications are positive and demonstrate further progress in the maturation of this solution and the go live process that has resulted from the early adoptive program.
In summary, we look forward to a positive second half and solid full year results. I'll now turn it over to Mike Mancuso for further details of our second quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year '11, including guidance modifications and the Nordic accounting adjustments reflected in our press release."

I think Mike Laphin’s remarks very clearly articulated the healthy status of our markets, our solid positioning in those markets, and the very favorable outlook for CSC as this economic recovery gain",1187,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I think Mike Laphin’s remarks very clearly articulated the healthy status of our markets, our solid positioning in those markets, and the very favorable outlook for CSC as this economic recovery gains momentum. My mission this morning is to provide you with the necessary insight into our financial results for the quarter to enhance your understanding of our performance. I will start out by saying we feel good about the quarter, we feel good about where we stand at the halfway point of our fiscal year, and we remain optimistic we will achieve the full year targets we have set for ourselves. I'll begin with Chart 7.
Sequentially, we achieved our goal of continuous improvement in each quarter throughout the year. Every important financial metric is better than the previous quarter. Year-over-year comparisons of revenue, operating earnings, margin and EPS requires several adjustments to normalize the divestitures, claim settlements, the Nordics adjustment and a significantly different tax rate. 
If you'll turn now to Chart 8. This chart entailed backlogs to revenue is intended to support our revenue forecast by laying out how much in-year revenue will come from existing backlog. The message on the chart can be found at the top of the pyramid in that only 2% of our in-year revenue is dependent on new business that is not now in backlog.
Chart 9 displays the new bookings profile over the last six quarters. Our positioning for the first two quarters of this year is quite similar to last year's pattern, where we achieved over $19 billion in new business for the year. Our identified qualified pipeline that Mike Laphen referred to gives us the confidence that our $18.5 billion-plus guidance target is achievable.
Chart #10 addresses currency. 64% of our cost and revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars and as you can see, our second largest currency is the British pound at 11%. Assuming the November 8 spot rate, we do not see currency as an issue for us in FY '11. Also worthy to note is that the bulk of our costs is denominated in paid for in local currency, creating a natural hedge. Our primary risk, such that it is, is translation for reporting purposes.
Chart 11 displays year-over-year revenue by our three lines of business. NPS has the only negative variance from last year, a result of the slowdown of federal government awards in the first half and the large one-time $65 million claim settlement reflected in the FY '10 revenue. BSS would have a more significant increase if adjusted for a divestiture. I also want to point out that the Nordics margin adjustments also included a $36 million revenue reversal. Adjusting both years for the claims settlement, divestiture impact and the Nordic reversal, year-over-year revenue would have increased by $70 million or 2%.
Slide 12 reflects operating income by line of business. The message on this chart is threefold. NPS, despite lower revenue is $22 million better than last year. MSS is dramatically lower, predominately impacted by the charges taken in our Nordics business to correct misapplication of internal accounting policies, U.S. GAAP and accounting irregularities. And BSS has increased over $10 million on very modest revenue growth.
Chart 13 presents the year-over-year P&L comparison. There are two important points to be made. If you focus on the other income expense line, you will see income of $35 million this year, roughly 2/3 represents the gain on the sale of our MS e-business that Mike Laphen mentioned. The second item is the tax rate which is significantly higher this year. The MSE gain somewhat offsets the Nordics adjustments impact on operating income and normalizing for the tax rate makes for a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results.
Chart 14 intends to further normalize for the year-over-year variations, including margin rates. But for the Nordics events, our rate would compare more favorably to last year. 
Chart 15 first half results. First half to first half, we are about where we were last year, but better positioned this year for second half revenue growth in a recovering economy.
Chart 16 reflects the balance sheet comparisons to last year. Cash is $250 million higher at quarter end, liabilities are much lower, less higher equity and much improved ratios. Not reflected on this chart is the fact that earlier this quarter, using our cash, we paid down $750 million of our drawn $1.5 billion bank line.
Turning to Chart 17, it displays our days receivable for the last five quarters, while our trend line is good, we did have an uptick in days from last quarter. There are no underlying issues and we expect to meet our reduction target for the year.
Chart 18, selected cash flow items for the first half versus last year. Cash flow from earnings is unchanged. Operating cash flow has improved, but offset by the increased CapEx, which accounts for the variance in free cash flow. This is a timing variance and we expect CapEx to decline in the second half.
Chart 19 is our quarterly EPS guidance. We have increased our EPS guidance for the full year by $0.05. Our third and fourth quarter range is not dramatically different from prior guidance. We expect our tax rate for the full year to decrease from our prior guidance of 32% to below 30%. And for those of you that are looking for a specific number, I would use 29% for now.
Chart 20 reflects our updated guidance. Our strong pipeline gives us the confidence to raise our bookings number to $18.5 billion plus from the $18 billion-plus prior. We still believe revenue will grow appreciably in the second half of the year, but because of the delays in the federal procurement awards, the MSE divestiture and an anticipated modest reduction in NHS revenue, we have lowered the top-end of our range from $17.2 billion to $17 billion and the lower end from $16.8 billion to $16.5 billion. The Nordics issue and its lingering cost structure issues cost us to adjust the margin range downward for now. You'll recall we expected 25 to 50 basis points of improvement for the year, and 9.25% was our top end. We have adjusted it to 9%.
We have increased our EPS and the strength of our tax rate reduction and remain confident that free cash flow will exceed 90% of net income. Reflecting on how you should think about the Nordics adjustment, try to keep in mind that the business is geographically dispersed desires will present controlled challenges from time to time, and we are in 94 countries. The good news is, we found it, we fixed it and put it behind us. 
So again, to summarize how we feel, we are still bullish on the year. We feel good about our second half revenue growth. The accounting issues in the Nordics are nonrecurring, and should be thought of as a bump in the road for an otherwise positive first half. That being said, I'll turn it now back to Bryan to kick off the Q&A."

First of all, I'm not going to get into the revenue impact on the NHS, but I would tell you that the margin rate itself is not affected in terms of its rate. The revenue line will be smaller to some degree, not much, but some. But the margin, there's not a change in the margin, it's just the contribution and the NHS in the year for margin will be less than it was and less anticipated in the prior guidance. As far as the other impacts, the Nordics was $40 plus million, fortyish was the problem there. Other than that, margins are intact. We don't have any other issues, underperforming business, et cetera. The Nordics Region itself is soft, frankly. It's lagging the European recovery. We have what we refer to as redundancy issues there. We have excess staff to the amount of business that they've been able to capture for the moment. That's creating a going forward drain on our margins. We have to deal with that. As you know, the European federal [ph] rules are rather expensive than if we shed the workforce. It comes with the price tag. If we shed this workforce, and then there's an uptick in revenue, we have to bring them back. So it's a balancing act. So that's about the best color I can give you on the numbers."
