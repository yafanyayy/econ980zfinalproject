Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on our second quarter call.

Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on our second quarter call. For those of you following along with the presentation materials, my comments today will largely connect with Slides 4 through 6 and Jeff will cover the others in his remarks.Let me start by saying that I'm really pleased with our performance during the second quarter and throughout the first half of fiscal 2010. Our businesses across the enterprise are executing well against our key initiatives and our people continue to demonstrate their commitment to doing the things necessary to drive long-term and sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. The company, we reported a 3% increase in revenues for Q2 and a non-GAAP EPS number of $0.57, up 12% over the prior year period. Our overall operating performance was better than we originally expected, with a number of our key initiatives already taking hold and with Q2 numbers receiving some benefit from external factors that were more pronounced than we had anticipated.Our Medical segment has had particularly strong year-over-year performance to date and our Pharmaceutical segment has continued its momentum performing considerably better than we expected in the second quarter. Having said this, we all recognize that this is a marathon, not a sprint and we have both opportunities and challenges in front of us. I do believe that we're clear about our course and we're making the progress I had hope to see.Customer focus remains the order of the day. As you've heard me say before, we continue to work on further improving the customer experience and we are seeing these efforts show up in our customer loyalty scores with notable gains over the past four quarters in reselling in tenant pharmacy [ph] and hospital supplies. Before I talk about each segment specifically, let me comment briefly on our overall results.Our results reflect strong performance in our base business and that was driven by a number of things including: Early positive results from our generic initiatives, solid performance under our branded manufacture agreements, expansion of our retail independent book of business, exceptional performance in nuclear despite ongoing supply shortages. Continued strong performance in lab, ambulatory and Canada, more effective selling strategies across the enterprise and disciplined expense control. I should mentioned here that we did receive some significant benefit from external factor which I'll touch on in my segment discussion and that Jeff will cover in more detail during his remarks. Now let me comment on each segment separately, starting with Pharmaceutical.Our Pharma segment continues its momentum in Q2. Sales increased by 3% versus prior year with segment profit down 1%. This decline was less than we expected. The segment profit decline was driven primarily by the impact of the Medicine Shoppe franchise model transition, the drop in generic launch value versus the prior year period and the effect of contract repricing. These items were partially offset by the benefits we are seeing from our generic sourcing and selling initiatives. Some earlier than expected brand price increases and excellent expense management. Our Pharma segment sales mix in the quarter was 49% to bulk customers and 51% to non-bulk customers. We saw an uptick in sales growth to non-bulk customers at 7% versus the prior year period and a decline of 1% in sales to bulk customers.Within our bulk customer group, we renewed a multi-year contract with Express Scripts during the quarter to supply pharmaceuticals through mid 2012. As you know, we have a large and very important business supplying national retail chain and I'm very pleased with the strength of those relationships. But I've also indicated our desire to grow our Retail Independent Direct Store business. This is an important group of customers for us and we've seen both sequential and year-over-year sales growth. Additionally, generic sales to retail independent pharmacies we're up 10% in Q2 versus the prior period. By the way our generic sales growth across all channels was also up 10%. In the generic penetration rate or as we call it share of wallet, continue to expand, reaching its highest levels in 18 months. We're also very pleased to announce earlier this month a new multi-year agreement with American Associated Pharmacies or AAP to remain the exclusive pharmaceutical distribution for its nearly 2,000 independent pharmacy members, which includes the network of Associated Pharmacies and United Drugs. On the generic sourcing side, we are tracking well in the implementation of our redesign sourcing model under the source program, which we believe provides incremental value to our customers, to Cardinal Health and to our generic partners.You may remember from our last call last August that we expected a difficult year-over-year comparison on generics, primarily due to fewer generic launches in our fiscal 2010 and generic price deflation on certain key products. Our current full year view is that we are running favorable to that projected impact. Jeff will cover this in more detail.The restructuring of our Medicine Shoppe business model is ongoing. We did add new franchises to the network for the first time in a long time. However, the conversion rate of existing stores moving from the old model to the new model is still lower than I'd like it to be. Despite the headwind as we transitioned from some franchisees from a royalty centric model to a deeper long-term partnership on the supply side, we continue to believe that this change is the right strategic move for our customers and for Cardinal Health.Our Nuclear business performed very well in Q2 under extremely difficult circumstances. While raw material supply shortages had an impact on overall volume, the team continued to take care of customers and deliver excellent bottom line growth. Our nuclear team is very focused on the fact that there's an individual patient awaiting a critical diagnostic test connected to every dose they prepare and they work very closely with our customers to manage the supply constraints by staging orders and adjusting patients scheduled where possible. Jeff will be providing an update on the nuclear generator supply situation in his remarks.Also of note, we continue to build our pet footprint on the integration of the cyclotron assets we acquired in Q1 from Biotech Pharmacy and cyclotron is almost complete. Turning to Medical, this segment had an extremely strong quarter with revenue growth of 9% and segment profit growth of 38%. We continue to be excited about our unique capabilities in both category and channel management and the potential for our portfolio of brands, sub-manufactured and private label products. While we're delighted with the future results, the rate of profit growth was unusually high, listed by a significantly lower commodity prices and some benefit from the demand for flu-related products. That said, the underlying businesses are performing well.We saw another quarter of double-digit revenue growth and profit growth in lab, as the channel continued its strong track record of performance helped somewhat by sales of flu-related products. Ambulatory continues to pursue ways to grow both its customer footprint and share of wallet and also saw another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Additionally, our collaboration with Allscripts for electronic health record is progressing well with a strong lead pipeline and a number of deals closed today.Canada had another exceptional quarter, posting both revenue and profit growth well in excess of 20%. New product and supplier agreements with some upside from foreign exchange and the demand for flu-related products fueled this outstanding growth. We're also making solid progress in our Kitting business with a third consecutive quarter of profit growth and strong profit growth versus prior year. We've devoted considerable energy to improving its operational performance to a number of lean Six Sigma projects. In the quarter, we also signed this five-year exclusive distribution agreement to co-market the SurgiCount Safety-Sponge System. This system utilizes data matrix bar code to tag each item with a unique serial number to help prevent the retention of sponges and towels unintentionally left in patients during surgical procedures. Sales in hospital supply were slightly positive and in line with our expectations. Margin improvement is a particular focus for this business. We continue to build out our preferred product categories of brands, self manufacture and private label products. This is an important strategic initiative and driver of margin improvement going forward.To further improve our hospital penetration and support our customers, we'd established a dedicated nursing sales organization focused on products used in the nursing profession and are beginning to see traction there. And we're also on track to achieve the savings we've targeted in our medical sourcing initiatives. Our work on our Medical business transformation continues to meet our timeline and budget expectations and our Q2 investment spending was in line with our forecast. We are quickly moving from the design stage to build stages of this project. This transformation forms the underpinning of our efforts to further reduce supply-chain cost while driving substantial improvement in our customer and supplier experiences, and we have some of our best and brightest assigned to this important work.At the enterprise level, as I mentioned last quarter, expense and capital management remained key areas of focus. We are also managing our balance sheet carefully with a strong emphasis on reducing inventory days, particularly in our Pharmaceutical Distribution business and we've been able to do this while maintaining high service levels. Jeff will cover the balance sheet in greater detail in a moment.Based on our performance in the first half of fiscal 2010 and our best assessment of the current environment, our review of the year has improved considerably. As a result, we increased our full-year guidance and now expect our non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of 208 to 218. Jeff will walk you through our core assumptions underlying this.Before I turn the call over to him, I'd like to mention a few more things.First, our Board of Directors recently added another two directors, Dr. James Mongan and Carrie Cox bringing the board to 12 members. Jim is a well-known hospital CEO, most recently leading Partners HealthCare System until his retirement last month and a visionary leader and educator. Carrie brings wealth of experience from her 30 years in biopharmaceuticals and healthcare, most recently serving as President of Global Pharmaceuticals of Schering-Plough. We've built an exceptional board and the additions we've made over the past six months bring additional expertise and perspectives from across many dimensions of health care including pharma, biotech, generics and healthcare providers, and I look forward to working closely with the entire board as we continue to move the company forward.Second, on the topic of healthcare reform. It's been an extraordinary couple of months and an eventful last two weeks. I will say that the fundamental challenges that are healthcare system faces are no different today than they were last quarter. With a system capable of delivering superb medical care but we also have tens of millions of people in this country who are unable to access the portable healthcare. Whether the system evolves by a market-based forces or through the legislative process, we do believe that this issue will need to be tackled and we will continue to be deeply engaged in Washington as things move forward.Third, I did want to comment briefly on the situation in Haiti. Like all of you, we've observed the aftermath of the massive earthquake in Haiti with horror. We prefer not to say too much about our support but I do want to remind our shareholders that we take our responsibilities as a healthcare company seriously. And we've acted immediately and directly with relief organizations, the Department of Defense and their partners to do our part to help address for critical needs. I'm proud that the people of Cardinal Health once again responded instantly and in meaningful ways and I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge their tireless efforts.And finally, let me end by saying that I feel good about our progress and what we've accomplished to this point. Our organization is fully aligned around our strategic priorities with a strong focus on execution, and improving the customers experience. And while the results are beginning to show, we know not to get too far ahead of ourselves as there's still much to do. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff for more details on the quarter."

I'm very pleased and encouraged by our results in the second quarter and the first half of our fiscal year. George provided a good overview of our Q2 results and key drivers so rather than a rehash on the financials. I'm going to focus my presentation this morning on providing some additional details related to Q2 and spend some time going through your outlook for the remainder of the year.First, some added comments on the business performance.As you may recall, at the beginning of the year, we identified a couple of key performance metrics that we needed to focus our attention on in a related like fashion, margin expansion and working capital. Due to a number of performance initiatives that George has already referenced, including our generic programs, focusing on Retail independent growth and penetration, strong performance in Nuclear Medical businesses, expense controls and working capital efficiency, we have made some great progress which I'd like to elaborate on.First, on margins. I'll be the first to say that when of our two quarter worth of margin trends doesn't necessarily tell a complete story. Particularly given a quarterly volatility, we can often see based on external factors. However, margin trends in our key drivers remain an extremely closely monitored metric for us. So I believe it's important to comment on our status here at this midpoint in our year. Both sequentially and year-on-year, we have seen our gross margin rate and operating margin rate expansion as an overall company. In fact, consolidated gross margin and operating margin rates are up five and four basis points, respectively versus last year. This is in spite of the fact that our very large Pharma bulk business, which represent close to 50% of the Pharma segment revenue had experienced declining margins due to large customer of reprices.Some of the biggest profit margin gains are being seen in our Medical, Nuclear and Pharma Retail Independent lines of business, all of which have been key areas of focus. Medical segment profit is up almost 100 basis points to 4.59%, driven by both strong performance in a number of our channels and by external factors such as raw material cost and a strong flu season.Within the Pharma Retail independent customers channel, segment profit margins are up 37 basis points versus last year, a very direct consequence of our focus on continuing to build that important business and increased generic penetration. Turning to working capital, we have continued to see the focus in this area by dividends. Although sequentially, days of inventory were up in Q2 due to the normal seasonal built account at year end. The year and year comparison showed the reduction of another day due to the efforts of our Pharma distribution operating team and its Lean Six Sigma programs. At the same time, our accounts receivable days have reduced slightly. These combined with our earnings performance, help to generate $524 million of operating cash flow in Q2, bringing our year-to-date number to $931 million.In summary, we're making some real progress with that performance initiatives. And it's showing in the key metrics we track. Now to continue on Q2, let me add a couple of additional details to what George covered. Let's start with the business segments.As George said, we are pleased with the business and financial progress in our Pharma segment, which was better than we anticipate. Revenue in the segment was up 3% comprised of 7% growth for non-bulk and a 1% decline for bulk customers. The decline in bulk was driven by both timing of orders versus last year and the impact of a large mail order customer that we have referenced in previous communications.From a segment profit perspective, we are meaningfully benefited by the progress in our generic initiatives, which helped to offset a portion of the headwind we experienced in the decline in value of generic launches versus last year. We also had a strong quarter from our branded by margin standpoint. As brand inflation and fees contributed materially to growth offsetting much of the negative impact in the Medicine Shoppe transition. Some margin erosion was largely as originally modeled driven by some previous large contract repricings, with some of the impact being later than originally anticipated. This last factor benefited the first half of the year including Q2.  Finally, due to strong expense controls, SG&A in this segment was down over 4% year-on-year.In the Medical segment, in addition to strong business performance, our Q2 benefit from certain external factors, including commodity price changes which are worth close to $19 million of benefit and material cost versus last year and a continued strong flu season, which was worth about $6 million incrementally. These benefits largely offset the increase in segment expense during the quarter, which was driven by a significant transformational project spend. Regarding the flu season, I will say that we are starting to see that impact moderate considerably as we go through January.  Finally, at the overall corporate level, let me cover a few items.Non-GAAP operating expense is up over 3% of last year, driven by our considerable investment spend, incentive compensation accruals and the impact of acquisitions. If you exclude those drivers, which represent about 6% point of growth, our core SG&A is down meaningfully, reflecting the continued focus we have in this area. In our other income section of the income statement, you may note that we reported $6 million of non-GAAP other income, a fairly large improvement compared to last year's expense of almost $20 million. The favorable compare is somewhat unique to this quarter and is primarily due to the impact of deferred compensation and foreign exchange swaps in last year's Q2. Both these items were decidedly negative in FY '09 due to the extraordinary financial market events that transpired that quarter.Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 38.5% versus 38 flat last year. The higher rate in the current quarter was attributable to changes in income mix and a couple of small discrete items. Also during the quarter, we repurchased approximately $50 million of Cardinal Health shares under our current $500 million share authorization program leaving average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter at $361 million.On the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with over $1.7 billion of cash, approximately $400 million of which is overseas. Also we had a $350 million note come due during October, which leaves us with a long-term debt balance of $2.1 billion.Now let me turn you to Slide 7 and take a moment to walk through the items that accounted for the difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS numbers. We have several items this quarter that caused our GAAP earnings to be higher than our non-GAAP. All these figures that I'll review are on after-tax basis.The biggest item in this category was a $20 million gain from sales of 5.5 million shares of CareFusion stock. I'll expand in this item in more detail shortly. We also had $60 million of income from an insurance recovery that was a result of an escrow release from a previously settled lawsuit. Restructuring and employee severance along with other spinoff related cost made up approximately $12 million and partially offset by two gains I just mention.The total positive impact to GAAP EPS in these items was $0.07 for the quarter, taking our GAAP EPS in continuing operations up from $0.57 to $0.64. Turning to Slide 8 and more detail on our CareFusion stake.I've mentioned earlier, during Q2, we sold 5.5 million shares that generated $135 million of proceeds and a gain of $20 million. We had accrued no tax in the proceeds of this sale. After these share sales, we now hold 35.9 million of shares of CareFusion stock, which had a value of $897 million at December 31.During Q2, we had a pretax unrealized gain in this remaining ownership of $115 million, which is not have an earnings impact until shares actually have sold and capital gains and losses are recognized. Having said in the past, in order to maintain a tax-free nature to spin-off, we need to divest of the remaining shares within five years from the spin-off date. We intend to complete this within the next 18 months and are continuing to assess the best method and timing to do this based on market condition and other factors.Now, let's review our FY10 outlook. Before I turn to Slides 10 to 13, let me begin with some framing comments about how we now view the full year from a forecast prospective, particularly given our strong financial performance in the first half of the year.Clearly, we're off to a good start in the first half. Much stronger than we anticipated heading into the year. This is being driven by two major categories of items: First, we've had very good execution against our key initiatives in the first half of the year, including our generic programs, our progress in retail independence and strong performance in our Medical businesses. I would fully expect that we continue that operational momentum into the second half. We've also had benefit from certain external factors, including generic launches that I are happening at higher value level that we had planned, less deflation on a few specific generic products, compensation from our branded vendors that led to relative to price increases of fee timing and a demand created from a stronger and early flu season. For the full year, although we'll get some net benefit from those factors. We are assuming that they largely normalize out in the second half of the year.So in total, the sum of these items is a considerable improvement in our view for the full year, which is reflected in our guidance being raised. However, we are also seeing a change in our distribution of earnings for the year, with the first half being disproportionately benefited from some of the external factors I just outlined.Net overall backdrop, let me provide some more specific assumptions by segment. Our Pharmaceutical segment assumptions are shown on Slide 10. The market factors and headwinds for the year are the same ones that we have spoken about previously although as I indicated, the amount and timing of the realization may have shifted somewhat. First, as I mentioned, earlier than anticipated branded by margin, we realized in the first half represents what we believe to be a pull forward of $0.04 to $0.05 into the first half of our fiscal year from our second half. The negative year-on-year impact of generic launches and deflation was better in the first half than we anticipated, again due to several unplanned launches and a slower deflation on a couple of products launched last year. We now expect full year negative impact of this headwind to be approximately $75 million. This compares to the $100 million figure we spoke off on our August 2009 call. The financial impact of the Medicine Shoppe transition is happening generally in line with our expectation.Finally, let me comment on the nuclear generator supply situation as we see it. With the shutdown of the Chalk River Reactor in Canada, technician  supply levels remain challenging and can range anywhere from 20% to 80% of normal supply levels. Based on recent reports from Atomic Energy of Canada, we expect that their reactor will not be fully operational until April. At the same time, the reactor in the Netherlands is scheduled for maintenance in mid February and is expected to be down for approximately 180 days. We have aggressive action plans underway to mitigate its impact for our customers and their patients as much as possible. However, there will likely be some impact in this disruption and our updated guidance reflects at unfavorable EPS impact of $0.01 to $0.02 in the first half.Our Medical segment assumptions on Slide 11 are largely unchanged from August 2009 when we present them. First half actual results shows segment revenue growth to be above the overall market, driven by our mix shifts and strong growth in Canada inventory and lab. We expect this to continue for the full year. However, as you recall in Q1, we also benefited from accelerated revenue in income recognition related to the CareFusion spin. Obviously, that one-time benefit doesn't repeat itself.Also in the first half of 2010, we saw greater benefit from commodity raw material prices and flu-related sales at a greater level than we had originally projected. These are expected to continue at the same rate into Q3. In fact, given oil price movement over the past six months and nine months, second half year-over-year benefits from commodity prices will be significantly less than we realized in the first half of the year.A final important word in the earnings outlook for the Medical segment during Q3. As you've seen, the segment has reported robust growth for the first half of the year and is expected to finish the year with strong full year results. However, Q3 will be an anomaly in this regard, as we are actually expecting a segment profit declined during this quarter despite underlying improving fundamentals. This is driven by a particularly strong Q3 we reported last year that led to some one-time customer rebates and other items, which improved our cost of goods sold, making for our tough year-on-year compare. This is exacerbated by continued high investment spend in this year's Q3 and a lessened benefit from commodity prices that are previously mentioned. That all said, we do expect the Medical segment to grow its Q3 earnings sequentially from Q2.We've updated our corporate assumptions for fiscal 2010 on Slide 12. Note that we now expect to end the year with a non-GAAP tax rate north of 37% although we should point out that there could be a few isolated events each quarter that may affect it in either direction. We expect weighted average shares outstanding to come in around $361 million. We now expect the combination of net interest expense and other to be approximately $110 million. We continue to forecast our capital expenditures to be in the range of $200 million $250 million. Finally, although we don't generally give regular guidance on cash flow, I didn't want to update my answer to a question from earlier in the year where I indicated the FY '10 operating cash flow would be less than $1 billion. Given the favorability in our cash flow during the first half of our fiscal year, we now anticipate that number to be north of $1 billion.So, taking all these items into account, and as George referenced year earlier, we are changing our expected non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.18. I know that was a lot of detail. Hopefully, it was helpful. I'll turn the call over to George now for Q&A."

So we're seeing some increase there. That's good news for us. Our existing stores are doing pretty well. Where we've seen some underperformance let's say we'd be the number of stores converting underperformance there, meaning we'd like to see more stores convert. It's a very personal decision for the franchisees. And I'd probably add that each of these franchises in different situation. And so we really worked at engaging them in a dialogue in terms of explaining what the opportunities are. So at this point, there are some that have chosen not to convert or taking more time to consider that option. Generally, I'd say the program is going well. We've added some franchises, but the number of converting is a little bit lower than we modeled. Beyond that, there's probably not a lot I can add."

The truth is that you have to think about it in an integrated whole, and it's one of the things we're actually doing much better. So on a sourcing model change, we've made tremendous progress, you've heard me say that our goal is to move this from a somewhat transactional approach to a much more strategic approach. We've done that, that transition is going well. And actually quite quickly, we're pleased with the way that's working. I wanted to clarify one thing that's very important because some folks have asked us about this. We have substantially reduced the number of generic suppliers in our source program, that is a preferred program. But I should also add that we continue to do business with all generic suppliers across the generic spectrum. So what we've done is really reduce the number of players in that particular program. So number one, I want [ph] to clarify that. The second part is that having a great sourcing program is not effective unless you're selling in the right way. And so we've tried to make sure that we're integrating our selling and our sourcing model in a way that we think is valuable. And I think we're making terrific progress here. Our compliance is going up around the right -- the trend line is going in the right direction. Our generic program is attractive, it's flexible and our selling organization is better trained and better incentivized to drive the sales and to articulate the benefits of the program. So I would say, I'd hold this [ph] -- taken in its entirely, our generic effort is better from sourcing to selling. And I think that's a component of our progress here."

As George said, this is really a part of an integrated package that we have to get right from sourcing all the way through to the end customer. But that all said, let me sort of break it down into three major components and just give you some directional idea of how we did in Q2, and most of these we've already referenced. First of all, on the sourcing side, I think we've made great strides in that partnership. And I would say we're slightly ahead of schedule in that regard, and probably Q2 was the first quarter that we started to see some meaningful financial benefits from that revised sourcing philosophy. On the sales side, we experienced 10% generics growth during Q2, including 10% growth within, specifically within our Retail Independent channel. And we also saw continued progress and penetration within our Retail Independent channel, which also bodes well for generic sales both in Q2 and the future. On the third element sort of launches, we did experience some launches in Q2 that we hadn't necessarily forecast, and that provided us some unexpected benefits. I would also say that some of the deflation we had predicted based on some of last year's launches was not as deep as we might have feared, which gave us a benefit and that was the reason why I said, the total headwind this year from the combination of the generic launch compare and deflation had improved from what was previously about $100 million to about $75 million. One thing I'd say about launches is, that it's not just about the launches occurring, it's about how well we can execute on. And we've done a much better job at executing on the launches and getting the products to market very quickly, which is obviously a very important thing for both our Pharmacy customers, but also our suppliers as well. So again, we're seeing some great progress in all elements [ph] there."

So, we are pretty far down the task in terms of executing and implementing the program.

Let start by saying that important part. The underlying fundamentals of the business, all the things that we think are important in terms of driving the progress that you want to see.

And so largely, what we've been talking about is the shifting of some external factors primarily accounting for any differences, but let me see if Jeff wants to add anything to that."

All the headwinds that we had described earlier are still there. Like I said, the Bio margin one is a bit of a timing issue. The other one that I would add is the DSA transition that we spoke about in the beginning of the year. Hits us in H2, it hasn't hit us in H1 because second half of the year is typically when we would realize the most from branding price inflation. And given the conversion to a fee-for-service arrangement, we've taken a direct hit in that compare in the second half of the year. The last thing I would say is that the year-on-year commodity price compare within the Medical segment, that was a very favorable compare in the first half of the year. That compare is much less favorable, although still positive, it's much less favorable in the second half of the year and that's simply due to the movement of oil prices and the related commodities over the last six to nine months. One other thing, I'd mention, Larry, is that some of our investments spend has been pushed more on to the second half of the year compared to the first half."

It is a very interesting collection of businesses and assets. Largely, as we see the differentiated features, we have an unusual footprint across channels and very strong in Acute-Care, growing in Ambulatory, very present in labs. As the system evolves and we have this confluence of some of the channels, movement across channels, we really like the way we are positioned in that business. We also have access to sort of what I would describe as a vertical capability. Tremendous capability for product management and category management. We're able to source and in some cases, produce our own products through a global manufacturing and sourcing infrastructure. So this combination of category/product and channel, we think as a very powerful tool. And the customer base, it's under all kinds of challenges and pressures and we believe that we've got the tools that help them and put their cost effectiveness.

172207,100100998,58457,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our third quarter call. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our performance during the March quarter, and our continued momentum throughout the first nine months of fiscal 2",2194,"Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our third quarter call. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our performance during the March quarter, and our continued momentum throughout the first nine months of fiscal 2010. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities as we reposition our business, and this is resulting in stronger bonds with our customers, better financial performance, and growing enthusiasm from our employees around our overall mission and greater optimism for the future. 
For Q3, revenue was $24.3 billion, up 1% over the prior period. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down 8%, while non-GAAP operating earnings decreased by 7% over the prior Q3 results. 
Our overall operating performance was better than we originally expected. And I'm pleased with the progress we are making to deliver sustainable growth and value to both our customers and to our shareholders.
As a company, our results reflect solid performance in both segments driven by several key highlights. Significant ongoing improvement in our Generic business, of particular note is a further increase in generic penetration rate, or what we refer to as share of wallet; continued stellar performance under our branded manufacture agreements; strong performance in Nuclear, particularly given the ongoing global supply shortages; solid growth on our Medical segment’s preferred products; and excellent revenue and profit growth in Canada from new suppliers and products. We have also been very successful with our working capital improvement and had another a very strong quarter of operating cash flow. 
Now let me comment on each segment separately, starting with Pharmaceutical. Continuing a strong momentum in Q3, our Pharma segment delivered strong performance and improving margins. Segment sales increased slightly versus the prior-year periods. The sales growth was in line with our expectations, dampened by the previously disclosed loss of two customers in the first half of this fiscal year. Segment profit improved, increasing 7% in the quarter versus Q3 of fiscal 2009. This was driven primarily by an increase in overall margin rates due to excellent performance in our generic initiatives, continued solid performance under our branded manufacture agreements and disciplined expense management within the segment as a whole. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see good progress in our Generics program, both on the sales and sourcing side. We have developed a highly attractive offering for our customers and they are responding enthusiastically. Last June, we set a target for ourselves to increase our generic penetration rate by 10%. We have already exceeded that annual improvement goal. And our customer loyalty scores further validate that we are on the right path.
We saw a healthy 10% increase in overall Generic sales this quarter, driven by continued progress in our retail independent customer base. And Generic sales for our Medicine Shoppe customers in the first nine months of the fiscal year have exceeded full year 2009 Generic sales. 
We believe that improving sales effectiveness is key to further increasing share of wallet with our existing customers as well as capturing more new business. Our sales college [ph], launched earlier this year, take the best-practices approach to building these capabilities. It provides comprehensive on-boarding training for all new sales reps, as well as ongoing training for all reps and managers in an integrated curriculum model, positioning us to serve our customers with an even higher degree of satisfaction. 
Additionally, several months ago, we began a purposeful cross-selling effort in the Ambulatory Care channel with our Medical segment sales force. While still early, this effort is beginning to deliver benefits to both our customers and to Cardinal Health. 
It has been an unusual stretch for our Nuclear business, and I'd like to take a little extra time today to discuss this part of our Pharmaceutical segment. I'm extremely proud of what this team has done to manage an incredibly difficult raw material shortage. While supply constraints had an impact in overall volume, the team continued to take care of our customers and deliver solid bottom-line growth. 
In response to the supply shortage, the nuclear team engaged several of our own Six Sigma operational excellence black belts to maximize the available product through just-in-time delivery, working closely with our customers to adjust patient schedules and calibrate delivery times, to help meet the needs of the most critical patients first. And where appropriate, customers have substituted a different imaging modality using thallium, a compound that we also supply. 
Our people have been working around the clock to compensate for these extraordinary circumstances, and our customer loyalty scores, already at a high level, have actually increased during this difficult time, a testament to the trusted-advisor role that our team has earned with their customers.
But that's not the end of the story. In the category of “You Can't Make This Stuff Up”, the volcanic eruption in Iceland further hindered the ability of raw material as suppliers of European-processed Moly-99 were unable to ship to U.S. manufacturers technesium [ph] generator. Our current expectations regarding supply is that the production from the Petten reactor in the Netherlands and the Chalk River reactor in Canada will normalize no earlier than late August/early September timeframe. The impact of the volcanic eruption and our expectations on nuclear generator supply are reflected in our forecast for Q4.
In the quarter, we also achieved strong results in our small but growing positron emissions tomography business through continued sales growth, clinical trial support and operational efficiencies. This is an exciting area, as PET imaging agents are being developed to detect and treat diseases such as Alzheimer's and other neurological and aging-related diseases. We play a key role in supporting these clinical trial efforts and are well positioned to future growth in this space, through the manufacturing, dispensing and distribution of these and other products. And just a reminder that the technesium [ph] generator supply issue does not affect the PET business.
Turning to the Medical segment, the quarter came in about as we expected. Revenue grew a respectable 7%, largely based on strong performance from our business in Canada, growth in both Ambulatory Care and Lab, and increased sales of our self-manufactured products. While segment profit was down 16% compared to last year's strong third quarter, it was up sequentially from Q2, as we forecasted on last quarter's call. An unusual year-over-year comparison in the cost of goods sold created a tough comparison versus the prior period. 
Further influencing our results from the Medical segment were higher expenses in the period, primarily driven by year-over-year comparison in performance compensation accruals and by our Medical Business Transformation investment. Apart from this investment we continue to tightly manage our core expenses. 
We are closely watching hospital admissions and procedures as this does influence demand for our products. There were clear signs that consumers have been cautious with their medical spending, with both inpatient and outpatient volumes down slightly. This along with a weak flu season did somewhat dampen our hospital supply business in the third quarter. We will monitor these factors carefully and are hopeful that the job growth data and other signs of some economic recovery will begin to translate into higher utilization.
We are extremely focused on improving the Hospital channel and continue to build out our preferred products categories, including self-manufactured and private label products. Progress during the quarter in our private label initiative included the launch of new OR and nursing products, and in the first nine months of the year our portfolio of private label products has grown at double the rate of the rest of our Hospital Supply business. 
We believe that these preferred product programs will create benefits for our customers and have a positive impact on our margins. We have recently realigned our resources within the entire Medical segment around customer channels and product categories in order to leverage our collective capabilities in manufacturing, distribution and sourcing in order to bring a higher level of value and service to our customers.
Canada had another excellent quarter, posting both revenue and profit growth well in excess of 20%. New products and supplier agreements, with some upside from foreign exchange, fueled this outstanding growth. Ambulatory Care and Lab also continued to perform well this quarter, although showed slower revenue growth due to lower flu volumes. And work on our Medical Business Transformation continues to meet our timeline and budget expectations. We completed the design stage and are now in the build stage of this important project to enhance our technology platform and processes. In short, further reducing supply chain costs will make it easier for our customers and suppliers to do business with us.
As is true with the segments, at the Cardinal Health enterprise level, we continue to focus on tight expense controls and the prudent use of capital. We continue to manage our balance sheet carefully with a strong emphasis on reducing working capital. I'm particularly proud that we were able to continue to reduce inventory days while keeping our service-level rates high. 
Operating cash flow was very robust, bullied by our business performance and working capital focus. Given this performance, the cash we have on hand and the additional cash we expect to generate from the sale of CareFusion stock, many of you have asked how we intend to deploy our capital going forward. With the exception of our policy on and our commitment to a solid dividend, we do not bring a fixed formula to our capital deployment strategy. Our goal is twofold: To ensure that we are well positioned for sustainable competitive advantage; and two, to create shareholder value. The investments we are making are focused on those two things. To the extent that we need to complement our internal capabilities or scale with an external move to achieve our goals, we will explore acquisitions. And in this mix, we will consider other strategies such as share repurchases. 
Based on our performance during the first nine months of this year and our visibility into what is effectively the remaining 60 days of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2010 to a range of $2.15 to $2.20. The implication is that our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter will be weaker than last year's fourth quarter. This is as we expected. And Jeff will walk you through our assumptions around the remainder of the year in a moment. 
Consistent with the comments I made in the first and second quarters, we came into this transition year with clarity about what we needed to do to put the company on the path for sustainable long-term growth. What we expected to face on that journey in fiscal 2010 and a determination to get the work done. Our renewal of the company has progressed at a more accelerated pace than we originally anticipated, and I'm delighted that coming out of fiscal 2010, we expect earnings growth off a larger and more stable base than we originally anticipated. 
Although we don't typically provide annual guidance at the end of the third quarter, this has been an unusual year, and we would like to provide investors with our early thoughts on fiscal 2011 on this call. Given the data we have at this stage and the progress on our underlying business performance, our initial outlook for fiscal 2011 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45. On our fourth quarter call, after we have finalized our annual budget, we will provide more details. Jeff will walk you through our core assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2010 and for our preliminary view of fiscal 2011. 
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to make a few comments on healthcare reform. As you are well aware, since we last spoke on our second quarter call in January, this historical legislation has been passed. It is important to note that the Patient Protection And Affordable Care Act marks the beginning of healthcare reform, not the end. With more than 2,700 pages of legislation to interpret and implement, there will be a long administrative, regulatory and legal process, as the appropriate agencies work through to the details of implementation. This will be a very interactive and iterative process in which Cardinal Health plans to participate. 
While there is much work to be done, we are well positioned to address healthcare reform's two main goals: coverage and costs. Clearly, adding more than 30 million new patients will put greater demand on the U.S. healthcare system, a system already under stress. This additional pressure will increase the relevance of our capabilities to improve the cost effectiveness, quality and safety for our customers' operations, allowing them to focus on patient care. 
Finally, let me end by saying that I feel very good about our performance in the quarter, and our rate of progress to this point. Our organization is tightly aligned around our strategic priorities, intently focused on execution, and our people are passionate about continuing to improve the customer experience. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff to provide more details in the quarter. Jeff?"

First, I'll",2669,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to be reporting our Q3 end results, and I'm very proud of the organizational execution and financial performance we have delivered in the third quarter and fiscal year to date. First, I'll provide an overview of our Q3 results and key drivers. Let me build on those as well as touch on our revised FY '10 guidance and preliminary fiscal '11 outlook.
To begin, as you may recall, before the start of this year, we identified a few key financial metrics that we needed to focus on to win, specifically margin expansion and working capital improvements. Driven by a number of the performance initiatives that George has already referenced, we have made some great progress in both of these areas. 
First, we are pleased that after the second quarter in a row, consolidated gross margin rates have increased year-on-year. In Q3, this rate increased five basis points versus last year to 4.15%. And non-bulk profit margins within our Pharma segment were 2.24% versus 2.05% in Q3 of FY '09. 
Second, regarding working capital, we've continued to see the hard work of our people pay dividends. Both year-on-year and sequentially, inventory declined by two days largely due to the efforts of our operating teams and our lean Six Sigma programs. At the same time, our accounts receivables days outstanding improved versus last year. These initiatives, combined with our earnings performance, helped to generate $879 million of operating cash flow in Q3, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to just over $1.8 billion. And in the timing of payments, our cumulative operating cash flow for the full year will likely be below this in a range of $1.5 billion or so. But it still represents a significant number and is much higher than we projected coming into the year.
To summarize, we're making great progress with our performance initiatives as beginning to consistently show in our key metrics. Although we’ll always see some quarterly fluctuations and margin rate trends and working capital levels, due to the nature of our business and external factors, we feel we have the actions in place to continue to move these in the right direction over time. 
Now let me add a few more details regarding our Q3 performance starting with the segments.  As George said, we are pleased with the business progress and financial results in Pharma. Revenue increased by 0.5%, split almost equally between non-bulk and bulk customers. [Indiscernible] of a relationship with two significant customers in the first half of the year, there had been sales growth by approximately 150 basis points. These are the same two low-margin accounts we had referenced in previous calls. 
Certain of our large customers also grew their orders less than market in the third quarter which further impacted the growth rate. Within the Pharma margins in the quarter, we saw strong performance under our brand agreements, particularly related to brand inflation from our price contingent vendors as well as our generic programs. This benefit was partially offset by the continued Medicine Shoppe and Pfizer DSA transitions and previously referenced contract repricings which are largely pulling [ph] through as anticipated.
In the Medical segment, profit declined 16% versus last year to $108 million, primarily due to an unusual year-on-year comparison and the cost of goods sold, the year-on-year impact of performance-based employee compensation, and increased investment spend associated with the Medical Business Transformation. The decline was partially offset by revenue growth from our Canadian lab and ambulatory services and our portfolio of preferred products. Segment profit increased sequentially, by $5 million, despite that left benefit from commodity price changes and the absence of a significant Q3 flu season. In fact, after a much higher than usual positive impact in the flu in the first half of fiscal '10, that trend pretty much reversed itself in Q3. 
Let me now cover a few items in the consolidated level. Non-GAAP operating expense is up over 9% from last year, largely driven by funding our performance-based employee compensation programs that did not occur in the prior year period, and to a lesser extent, investments spend on key initiatives. If you exclude those drivers, our core SG&A is down year-on-year, reflecting the continued tight focus we have on this area.
Let me spend a few more moments in this composition issue given its significance to our expense line [ph] in this quarter. As I’m sure you’ll recall, last year in late Q2 and Q3, we were in the midst of the global financial crisis. At that time, we had not yet spun off our CareFusion capital equipment businesses. The economic crisis had begun having a very negative impact on hospital capital equipment orders, significantly impacting our CareFusion business. As we recognized this downturn in our full year financial forecast for FY '09, we also brought down our management bonus accruals across the entire company commensurately and as particularly impacted Q3 ’09. This year, our bonus accruals have increased based on strong performance versus target. The net year-on-year impact of those accruals moving in opposite directions is reflected in our SG&A growth this quarter. 
Compiling this increase is the decision we made heading into FY '10 to tie more of our employee-related expenses to company financial performance and hence make more variable. Specifically, we replaced a portion of our 401k benefit that was a fixed employer contribution with a variable contribution linked to financial performance. And again, better-than-planned performance this year resulted in higher accruals for his expense in Q3.
Moving on, our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 38.2% versus 37.3% last year. A higher rate in the current quarter was attributable to changes in income mix and a few discreet items. On the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with over $2.6 billion of cash, approximately $400 million of which is overseas. 
Now let me turn to Slide 7 and take a moment to walk you through the items that accounted for the difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS numbers. It always figures that our reviews ar on an after-tax basis. The biggest item in this category is a $23 million gain from sales of 5.4 million shares of CareFusion stock in the quarter. This accounted for approximately $0.06. The next item is the impairments and loss sale of assets of approximately $0.04. The majority of this relates to the closure of  a facility, as well as final tax true-ups related to a divestiture. The other three items, restructuring and severance, litigation charges, and other spin-off costs netted to approximately $0.01. The [indiscernible] of all these items resulted in a GAAP EPS of $0.62 versus non-GAAP of $0.61.
Now turning to Slide 8, an update on the status of our CareFusion stake. As mentioned earlier, during Q3, we sold 5.4 million shares that generated $136 million in proceeds and a gain of $23 million. We’ve accrued no tax on the proceeds of the sale. After these sales, we now hold 30.5 million shares of CareFusion stock which had a value of $805 million on March 31.  During Q3, we had a pretax unrealized gain of its remaining [ph] ownership of $43 million, which does not have an earnings impact until shares are actually sold and capital gains or losses are recognized.
As we’ve said in the past, in order to maintain the tax-free nature of this spin-off, we need to divest of the remaining shares within five years from the spin-off date. We intend to complete this by the end of fiscal '11, and are continuing to assess the best method and timing to do this based on market conditions and other factors.
Also during the quarter, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of Martindale in the U.K., and are expecting to close this by the end of fiscal 2010. This, along with the sale of Specialty Scripts, the closing of which we announced earlier, complete the portfolio rationalization activity that we projected for this year.
Now let’s [ph] review our revised FY '10 outlook. Let me begin with some [indiscernible] comments about how we now view the full year from a forecast perspective, particularly given our [indiscernible] strong financial results in the first three quarters. Certainly our performance thus far has been better than anticipated heading into the year. This is being driven by two major categories of items. First, we've had very good execution against our key initiatives this year, including our Medical supply chain strategy, generics programs, our progress in retail independence and strong performance in nuclear, despite supply shortage issues. But we’ve also benefited from certain external factors including generic launches that happened at a higher level than we had planned, lower deflation on certain generic products, accelerated compensation from our branded vendors relative to price increases and a higher demand for certain med surge products resulting from a stronger and earlier flu season in the first half of the year. 
For the full year, although we will get some net benefit from those factors, we are assuming that they are largely normalized in the fourth quarter. In total, the sum of these items has added up to solid performance in the first nine months of the fiscal year, and this is reflected in our increased guidance of $2.15 to $2.20. [Indiscernible] is that Q4 will be down from last year based upon several factors which I’ll attempt to walk through. 
Our Pharmaceutical segment assumptions for Q4 include the following: the headwinds of the Pfizer DSA and Medicine Shoppe transitions continue to play out as anticipated. The earlier-than-anticipated [indiscernible] price inflation realized in the first three quarters is not [ph] expected to continue in the fourth quarter. In fact, we had originally expected price increases from a major branded contingent vendor in Q4 which we no longer anticipate. The negative year-on-year impact of the generic launches in deflation was not as significant in the first three quarters as we anticipated, again due to several unplanned launches and slower deflation on certain products launched. However, we are not projecting any significant high-value generic launches in Q4.
Finally, let me comment on the financial impact of the nuclear generator supply situation which George covered in some detail. The supply shortage had unfavorable EPS impact of $0.01 to $0.02 in Q3 and based on what we’re seeing so far, we’ll have at least $0.02 impact in Q4. 
Turning to our Medical segment: the first three quarters' results show revenue growth to be above overall market trends, driven by our mix shift, strong growth in Canada ambulatory and lab, an exceptional flu season in Q1 and Q2 and a one-time revenue recognition benefit from the CareFusion spend.
In Q4, we expect that segment revenue growth may moderate somewhat, given the absence of a few of these unique items and a slightly cautious view of the market due to some softness in utilization we saw during part of Q3. 
In the first half of 2010, this segment also saw greater benefit from commodity raw material prices and higher flu-related sales than we had originally projected. These did not continue in Q3. In fact, all [ph] prices moved higher over the past months, and as you recall, there's a lag effect regarding the impact of these movements in our income statement. These factors make for a harder second half comparison. That all said, after a tough [ph] compare in Q3, we do expect the Medical segment to return to year-on-year profit growth in Q4.
On Slide 10, we provided our corporate assumptions for fiscal 2010, which are identical to what we have shared previously. The only comment I’ll make in this area is that we expect that our full-year tax rate will likely be north of 37%, which implies a fourth quarter that could be four percentage points or so higher than last year's unusually low Q4 rate. Taking all of this into account and based on our performance during the first three quarters of this year, as George had mentioned, we are increasing and narrowing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for FY '10 to $2.15 to $2.20.
Now let's turn to Slides 12 to 14 and have a look at our preliminary FY '11 guidance. As George mentioned, we thought it made sense to provide you all with an early look at next year given the somewhat unique circumstances of 2010. Our initial thoughts for fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share range are between $2.35 and $2.45. Implicit in this is our expectation for relatively modest revenue growth on a consolidated basis. 
Now that said, let's spend a few moments going through some of the segment-specific assumptions in more detail. On Slide 13, you can see the Pharmaceutical segment assumptions. Let me hit on a few highlights. Importantly, our FY '11 guidance assumes a renewal of all existing major customer contracts. Brand inflation is projected to be on a comparable level to FY '10.  We do not anticipate a significant change from FY '10 related to the year-on-year comparison of generic launches and price deflation. We do, however, expect continued benefit from our generic sourcing programs. And as we did heading into this year, we have risk-adjusted a basket of potential at-risk launches losses in FY '11 to come up with our forecast. In the Nuclear business, we expect the Moly [ph] supply shortage to moderate during the first half of next year. The Nuclear will likely face a tough first half due to the supply shortage.
Now let's turn to Slide 14 and our assumptions for the Medical segment. We expect to benefit from increased preferred product sales and customer mix shifts to higher margin classes such as ambulatory care. We do project a negative impact from rising commodity prices that we saw over the last several quarters, as the increased cost slowed through our P&L through FY '11. We did not anticipate the extraordinary demand from the pandemic flu season that we experienced in the first half of this year. Our Medical Transformation initiative expense will continue at a similar level to FY '10 as we continue to position our Medical segment for long-term growth.
And we are also making some further strategic moves in the Medical segment related to sourcing and category management which derive [ph] long-term benefit. In addition to the segment-specific items noted, I want to highlight that we will continue to take additional broad-based actions to improve the cost and capital profile of our businesses.  As you would expect, we will be providing an updated look with additional details at our Q4 call. But I hope this preliminary look at FY '11 is helpful. 
Let me conclude with some final remarks on healthcare reform, building on what George commented on earlier. At this point, it is difficult to accurately quantify the impact that some elements of the reform package will have on volumes or margins, although we are optimistic that increased access will provide an overall benefit to us in the medium to longer term. Further, there are two areas that are a bit easier to quantify. First, with regard to the cost of our employee benefits, we expect the ongoing impact to be relatively minimal, and we'll be taking no charge for postretirement healthcare as we do not have a company funded retiree healthcare program. 
With regard to the 2.3% tax on sales by med device manufacturers, we expect to see, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2013, will have some impact on us. The final language, as [indiscernible] devices to include in this tax application, was a little more inclusive than we would have liked. [Indiscernible] for you, based on today's look at business and after any actions we may take to mitigate or share the impact hit to our Med/Surg manufacturing business would be about $20 million to $25 million annually. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin our Q&A."

There were two major transformational initiatives going on this year that we invested in.  One was our overall Med Transformation which was a multiyear, pretty significant overhaul of our processes and systems with our Med supply and manufacturing business. Incrementally, this year, we're going to spend about $25 million more on that program than we did last year, and last year's spend was relatively minimal. The spend next year will be about the same. So there won't be a positive benefit from it next year, but it will be pretty much neutral in terms of the year-on-year spend. The other major transformation within the Med segment was in our ambulatory space, particularly related to customer-facing IT systems and ordering platforms. The bulk of that investment has happened already. There will be a little bit still to be finished up next year, but I would actually expect that to be a net positive next year both due to lessened  investment but also because we're reaping the benefits of that transformation that we've done over the past year and a half. On the Pharma side, the biggest investment we've made this year has to do with our ordering systems that we put in our customers’ pharmacies. We're in the midst of rolling that out to our customers across the U.S. There was significant spend related to that this year. I would expect the spend next year to be about equivalent for that implementation. So again, neutral impact from FY '10 to '11. And then, as always, there's a certain amount of investment spend that sort of hold at Corporate to fund certain initiatives and strategic imperatives over the course of the year. That was a negative variance from FY '09 to FY '11 –- I’m sorry, from FY ’09 to FY '10 in the range of I’d say $15 million or so. I would say it would be largely neutral going into next year. So hopefully, that helps."

Quite honestly, in Q4, we are expecting very, very little of that. In fact, one of our largest contingent vendors that typically would do a fairly significant price increase in Q4, our expectations are that price increase will not happen. So again, our income from brand inflation from contingent vendors is a very conservative view of Q4. That both is responsible for the largest step-down from Q3 to Q4 in terms of farm income. It's also the largest driver of the decline from last year to this year. But there's a few other factors in Q4 as well. Clearly, we still face the headwinds related to the Pfizer DSA transition, which also impacted Q3. But the impact on Q4 is slightly higher. We expect fewer generic launches this year versus last year. As you may recall, Adderall launched in Q4 of last year, which was a fairly significant value generic launch for us. We don't see anything of even comparable size in our Q4. And then as we indicated, our nuclear supply shortage continues to be quite severe. That impacted us for part of Q3. It's going to impact us for the entire Q4, and it has turned out to be a pretty big challenge for us. So those would be the big factors. Again, the other thing I'd point out is that our tax rate in Q4 will be about four percentage points higher than it was in Q4 of last year."

There's just the general market inflation, which tracks very closely to what you would see in the published reports, which I think by most published reports this year have been in the sort of high-single digits. But more importantly, from sort of a quarterly swing factor perspective, we also track the brand inflation from our contingent vendors. And that does differ from the overall market. And this year has been more in the mid-single digits as we've commented on before. But we think that most of that happened in the first three quarters of the year, which is why we're not projecting much in Q4. Regarding whether we'll see those price increases happen next year, don't know. I mean we always assume a certain level of contingent branded price increase in each year. Now exactly the timing of those and which ones will happen at which rate, again, we sort of look at it largely as an overall portfolio.

First of all, I wouldn't view it as us taking down Q4. I would view it as taking up the year and recognizing that there were shifts between quarters and probably some of the stuff that we were expecting in Q4 before happened in Q3. But let me be a little bit more specific regarding some of the year-on-year negative drivers in Q4. First of all, the headwinds from the Pfizer DSA and MSI transitions that we've been talking about all year probably hit us to the largest degree in Q4, given past timing of Pfizer price increases. And that's worth $0.03 to $0.04 of negative impact year-on-year. Other brand inflation that we think sort of got shifted primarily earlier and that's in the $0.04 range. Lack of generic launches is $0.01 to $0.02, again versus last year. The impact of the nuclear supply shortage, as we've said, was at least $0.02, so I'll put that in the $0.02 to $0.03 range. The tax rate increase is worth about $0.03. And then, we'll probably be occurring at higher performance compensation rates as well in Q4, which could be worth another $0.03 or so. So I think as you add those up, you can quickly get to the difference between growth and the negative growth we'll be anticipating. The final thing I'll point out, and obviously, you know this, Larry, but just to state it, our Q4 is traditionally always lower than our Q3 due to just the nature of our business."

Given the very large nature of some of our customers, particularly on the bulk side, you can sometimes get a fairly significant swing in the cord [ph] just because of timing of orders. It may not necessarily track their demand, but they may place a very large order on December 29 and that may shift something from Q3 to Q2. So with our very large customers, it's always hard to read too much into the timing of the orders. Regarding our view going forward, I'd say within the Pharma side, we're generally going to track the market, although recognizing that those two large customer losses or terminations that we had earlier this year still haven't lapsed. So we'll still feel the effect from that going into Q2 of next year. But if you sort of adjust for that, we expect to generally track the market and exactly how close we'll track the market will depend on how our customers perform in terms of market share versus the broader market. On the Med/Surg side, again, we had a few unusual events this year that for the first three quarters tended to abnormally elevate our revenue growth. Again, we had the recognition of revenue related to the CareFusion spin in Q1. We had a extraordinary flu season in Q1 and Q2. Those events clearly won't repeat in Q4 and probably into next year. So I would say generally, we expect to track the market and the markets we participate in. And I'd say we have a somewhat cautious view for the next couple quarters until we see exactly where the economy settles out, et cetera. But I'd say in general, we see modest growth for the current periods."

172207,100100998,58473,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our third quarter call. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our performance during the March quarter, and our continued momentum throughout the first nine months of fiscal 2",2194,"Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our third quarter call. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our performance during the March quarter, and our continued momentum throughout the first nine months of fiscal 2010. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities as we reposition our business, and this is resulting in stronger bonds with our customers, better financial performance, and growing enthusiasm from our employees around our overall mission and greater optimism for the future. 
For Q3, revenue was $24.3 billion, up 1% over the prior period. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down 8%, while non-GAAP operating earnings decreased by 7% over the prior Q3 results. 
Our overall operating performance was better than we originally expected. And I'm pleased with the progress we are making to deliver sustainable growth and value to both our customers and to our shareholders.
As a company, our results reflect solid performance in both segments driven by several key highlights. Significant ongoing improvement in our Generic business, of particular note is a further increase in generic penetration rate, or what we refer to as share of wallet; continued stellar performance under our branded manufacture agreements; strong performance in Nuclear, particularly given the ongoing global supply shortages; solid growth on our Medical segment’s preferred products; and excellent revenue and profit growth in Canada from new suppliers and products. We have also been very successful with our working capital improvement and had another a very strong quarter of operating cash flow. 
Now let me comment on each segment separately, starting with Pharmaceutical. Continuing a strong momentum in Q3, our Pharma segment delivered strong performance and improving margins. Segment sales increased slightly versus the prior-year periods. The sales growth was in line with our expectations, dampened by the previously disclosed loss of two customers in the first half of this fiscal year. Segment profit improved, increasing 7% in the quarter versus Q3 of fiscal 2009. This was driven primarily by an increase in overall margin rates due to excellent performance in our generic initiatives, continued solid performance under our branded manufacture agreements and disciplined expense management within the segment as a whole. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see good progress in our Generics program, both on the sales and sourcing side. We have developed a highly attractive offering for our customers and they are responding enthusiastically. Last June, we set a target for ourselves to increase our generic penetration rate by 10%. We have already exceeded that annual improvement goal. And our customer loyalty scores further validate that we are on the right path.
We saw a healthy 10% increase in overall Generic sales this quarter, driven by continued progress in our retail independent customer base. And Generic sales for our Medicine Shoppe customers in the first nine months of the fiscal year have exceeded full year 2009 Generic sales. 
We believe that improving sales effectiveness is key to further increasing share of wallet with our existing customers as well as capturing more new business. Our sales college [ph], launched earlier this year, take the best-practices approach to building these capabilities. It provides comprehensive on-boarding training for all new sales reps, as well as ongoing training for all reps and managers in an integrated curriculum model, positioning us to serve our customers with an even higher degree of satisfaction. 
Additionally, several months ago, we began a purposeful cross-selling effort in the Ambulatory Care channel with our Medical segment sales force. While still early, this effort is beginning to deliver benefits to both our customers and to Cardinal Health. 
It has been an unusual stretch for our Nuclear business, and I'd like to take a little extra time today to discuss this part of our Pharmaceutical segment. I'm extremely proud of what this team has done to manage an incredibly difficult raw material shortage. While supply constraints had an impact in overall volume, the team continued to take care of our customers and deliver solid bottom-line growth. 
In response to the supply shortage, the nuclear team engaged several of our own Six Sigma operational excellence black belts to maximize the available product through just-in-time delivery, working closely with our customers to adjust patient schedules and calibrate delivery times, to help meet the needs of the most critical patients first. And where appropriate, customers have substituted a different imaging modality using thallium, a compound that we also supply. 
Our people have been working around the clock to compensate for these extraordinary circumstances, and our customer loyalty scores, already at a high level, have actually increased during this difficult time, a testament to the trusted-advisor role that our team has earned with their customers.
But that's not the end of the story. In the category of “You Can't Make This Stuff Up”, the volcanic eruption in Iceland further hindered the ability of raw material as suppliers of European-processed Moly-99 were unable to ship to U.S. manufacturers technesium [ph] generator. Our current expectations regarding supply is that the production from the Petten reactor in the Netherlands and the Chalk River reactor in Canada will normalize no earlier than late August/early September timeframe. The impact of the volcanic eruption and our expectations on nuclear generator supply are reflected in our forecast for Q4.
In the quarter, we also achieved strong results in our small but growing positron emissions tomography business through continued sales growth, clinical trial support and operational efficiencies. This is an exciting area, as PET imaging agents are being developed to detect and treat diseases such as Alzheimer's and other neurological and aging-related diseases. We play a key role in supporting these clinical trial efforts and are well positioned to future growth in this space, through the manufacturing, dispensing and distribution of these and other products. And just a reminder that the technesium [ph] generator supply issue does not affect the PET business.
Turning to the Medical segment, the quarter came in about as we expected. Revenue grew a respectable 7%, largely based on strong performance from our business in Canada, growth in both Ambulatory Care and Lab, and increased sales of our self-manufactured products. While segment profit was down 16% compared to last year's strong third quarter, it was up sequentially from Q2, as we forecasted on last quarter's call. An unusual year-over-year comparison in the cost of goods sold created a tough comparison versus the prior period. 
Further influencing our results from the Medical segment were higher expenses in the period, primarily driven by year-over-year comparison in performance compensation accruals and by our Medical Business Transformation investment. Apart from this investment we continue to tightly manage our core expenses. 
We are closely watching hospital admissions and procedures as this does influence demand for our products. There were clear signs that consumers have been cautious with their medical spending, with both inpatient and outpatient volumes down slightly. This along with a weak flu season did somewhat dampen our hospital supply business in the third quarter. We will monitor these factors carefully and are hopeful that the job growth data and other signs of some economic recovery will begin to translate into higher utilization.
We are extremely focused on improving the Hospital channel and continue to build out our preferred products categories, including self-manufactured and private label products. Progress during the quarter in our private label initiative included the launch of new OR and nursing products, and in the first nine months of the year our portfolio of private label products has grown at double the rate of the rest of our Hospital Supply business. 
We believe that these preferred product programs will create benefits for our customers and have a positive impact on our margins. We have recently realigned our resources within the entire Medical segment around customer channels and product categories in order to leverage our collective capabilities in manufacturing, distribution and sourcing in order to bring a higher level of value and service to our customers.
Canada had another excellent quarter, posting both revenue and profit growth well in excess of 20%. New products and supplier agreements, with some upside from foreign exchange, fueled this outstanding growth. Ambulatory Care and Lab also continued to perform well this quarter, although showed slower revenue growth due to lower flu volumes. And work on our Medical Business Transformation continues to meet our timeline and budget expectations. We completed the design stage and are now in the build stage of this important project to enhance our technology platform and processes. In short, further reducing supply chain costs will make it easier for our customers and suppliers to do business with us.
As is true with the segments, at the Cardinal Health enterprise level, we continue to focus on tight expense controls and the prudent use of capital. We continue to manage our balance sheet carefully with a strong emphasis on reducing working capital. I'm particularly proud that we were able to continue to reduce inventory days while keeping our service-level rates high. 
Operating cash flow was very robust, bullied by our business performance and working capital focus. Given this performance, the cash we have on hand and the additional cash we expect to generate from the sale of CareFusion stock, many of you have asked how we intend to deploy our capital going forward. With the exception of our policy on and our commitment to a solid dividend, we do not bring a fixed formula to our capital deployment strategy. Our goal is twofold: To ensure that we are well positioned for sustainable competitive advantage; and two, to create shareholder value. The investments we are making are focused on those two things. To the extent that we need to complement our internal capabilities or scale with an external move to achieve our goals, we will explore acquisitions. And in this mix, we will consider other strategies such as share repurchases. 
Based on our performance during the first nine months of this year and our visibility into what is effectively the remaining 60 days of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2010 to a range of $2.15 to $2.20. The implication is that our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter will be weaker than last year's fourth quarter. This is as we expected. And Jeff will walk you through our assumptions around the remainder of the year in a moment. 
Consistent with the comments I made in the first and second quarters, we came into this transition year with clarity about what we needed to do to put the company on the path for sustainable long-term growth. What we expected to face on that journey in fiscal 2010 and a determination to get the work done. Our renewal of the company has progressed at a more accelerated pace than we originally anticipated, and I'm delighted that coming out of fiscal 2010, we expect earnings growth off a larger and more stable base than we originally anticipated. 
Although we don't typically provide annual guidance at the end of the third quarter, this has been an unusual year, and we would like to provide investors with our early thoughts on fiscal 2011 on this call. Given the data we have at this stage and the progress on our underlying business performance, our initial outlook for fiscal 2011 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45. On our fourth quarter call, after we have finalized our annual budget, we will provide more details. Jeff will walk you through our core assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2010 and for our preliminary view of fiscal 2011. 
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to make a few comments on healthcare reform. As you are well aware, since we last spoke on our second quarter call in January, this historical legislation has been passed. It is important to note that the Patient Protection And Affordable Care Act marks the beginning of healthcare reform, not the end. With more than 2,700 pages of legislation to interpret and implement, there will be a long administrative, regulatory and legal process, as the appropriate agencies work through to the details of implementation. This will be a very interactive and iterative process in which Cardinal Health plans to participate. 
While there is much work to be done, we are well positioned to address healthcare reform's two main goals: coverage and costs. Clearly, adding more than 30 million new patients will put greater demand on the U.S. healthcare system, a system already under stress. This additional pressure will increase the relevance of our capabilities to improve the cost effectiveness, quality and safety for our customers' operations, allowing them to focus on patient care. 
Finally, let me end by saying that I feel very good about our performance in the quarter, and our rate of progress to this point. Our organization is tightly aligned around our strategic priorities, intently focused on execution, and our people are passionate about continuing to improve the customer experience. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff to provide more details in the quarter. Jeff?

First, I'll",2669,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to be reporting our Q3 end results, and I'm very proud of the organizational execution and financial performance we have delivered in the third quarter and fiscal year to date. First, I'll provide an overview of our Q3 results and key drivers. Let me build on those as well as touch on our revised FY '10 guidance and preliminary fiscal '11 outlook.
To begin, as you may recall, before the start of this year, we identified a few key financial metrics that we needed to focus on to win, specifically margin expansion and working capital improvements. Driven by a number of the performance initiatives that George has already referenced, we have made some great progress in both of these areas. 
First, we are pleased that after the second quarter in a row, consolidated gross margin rates have increased year-on-year. In Q3, this rate increased five basis points versus last year to 4.15%. And non-bulk profit margins within our Pharma segment were 2.24% versus 2.05% in Q3 of FY '09. 
Second, regarding working capital, we've continued to see the hard work of our people pay dividends. Both year-on-year and sequentially, inventory declined by two days largely due to the efforts of our operating teams and our lean Six Sigma programs. At the same time, our accounts receivables days outstanding improved versus last year. These initiatives, combined with our earnings performance, helped to generate $879 million of operating cash flow in Q3, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to just over $1.8 billion. And in the timing of payments, our cumulative operating cash flow for the full year will likely be below this in a range of $1.5 billion or so. But it still represents a significant number and is much higher than we projected coming into the year.
To summarize, we're making great progress with our performance initiatives as beginning to consistently show in our key metrics. Although we’ll always see some quarterly fluctuations and margin rate trends and working capital levels, due to the nature of our business and external factors, we feel we have the actions in place to continue to move these in the right direction over time. 
Now let me add a few more details regarding our Q3 performance starting with the segments.  As George said, we are pleased with the business progress and financial results in Pharma. Revenue increased by 0.5%, split almost equally between non-bulk and bulk customers. [Indiscernible] of a relationship with two significant customers in the first half of the year, there had been sales growth by approximately 150 basis points. These are the same two low-margin accounts we had referenced in previous calls. 
Certain of our large customers also grew their orders less than market in the third quarter which further impacted the growth rate. Within the Pharma margins in the quarter, we saw strong performance under our brand agreements, particularly related to brand inflation from our price contingent vendors as well as our generic programs. This benefit was partially offset by the continued Medicine Shoppe and Pfizer DSA transitions and previously referenced contract repricings which are largely pulling [ph] through as anticipated.
In the Medical segment, profit declined 16% versus last year to $108 million, primarily due to an unusual year-on-year comparison and the cost of goods sold, the year-on-year impact of performance-based employee compensation, and increased investment spend associated with the Medical Business Transformation. The decline was partially offset by revenue growth from our Canadian lab and ambulatory services and our portfolio of preferred products. Segment profit increased sequentially, by $5 million, despite that left benefit from commodity price changes and the absence of a significant Q3 flu season. In fact, after a much higher than usual positive impact in the flu in the first half of fiscal '10, that trend pretty much reversed itself in Q3. 
Let me now cover a few items in the consolidated level. Non-GAAP operating expense is up over 9% from last year, largely driven by funding our performance-based employee compensation programs that did not occur in the prior year period, and to a lesser extent, investments spend on key initiatives. If you exclude those drivers, our core SG&A is down year-on-year, reflecting the continued tight focus we have on this area.
Let me spend a few more moments in this composition issue given its significance to our expense line [ph] in this quarter. As I’m sure you’ll recall, last year in late Q2 and Q3, we were in the midst of the global financial crisis. At that time, we had not yet spun off our CareFusion capital equipment businesses. The economic crisis had begun having a very negative impact on hospital capital equipment orders, significantly impacting our CareFusion business. As we recognized this downturn in our full year financial forecast for FY '09, we also brought down our management bonus accruals across the entire company commensurately and as particularly impacted Q3 ’09. This year, our bonus accruals have increased based on strong performance versus target. The net year-on-year impact of those accruals moving in opposite directions is reflected in our SG&A growth this quarter. 
Compiling this increase is the decision we made heading into FY '10 to tie more of our employee-related expenses to company financial performance and hence make more variable. Specifically, we replaced a portion of our 401k benefit that was a fixed employer contribution with a variable contribution linked to financial performance. And again, better-than-planned performance this year resulted in higher accruals for his expense in Q3.
Moving on, our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 38.2% versus 37.3% last year. A higher rate in the current quarter was attributable to changes in income mix and a few discreet items. On the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with over $2.6 billion of cash, approximately $400 million of which is overseas. 
Now let me turn to Slide 7 and take a moment to walk you through the items that accounted for the difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS numbers. It always figures that our reviews ar on an after-tax basis. The biggest item in this category is a $23 million gain from sales of 5.4 million shares of CareFusion stock in the quarter. This accounted for approximately $0.06. The next item is the impairments and loss sale of assets of approximately $0.04. The majority of this relates to the closure of  a facility, as well as final tax true-ups related to a divestiture. The other three items, restructuring and severance, litigation charges, and other spin-off costs netted to approximately $0.01. The [indiscernible] of all these items resulted in a GAAP EPS of $0.62 versus non-GAAP of $0.61.
Now turning to Slide 8, an update on the status of our CareFusion stake. As mentioned earlier, during Q3, we sold 5.4 million shares that generated $136 million in proceeds and a gain of $23 million. We’ve accrued no tax on the proceeds of the sale. After these sales, we now hold 30.5 million shares of CareFusion stock which had a value of $805 million on March 31.  During Q3, we had a pretax unrealized gain of its remaining [ph] ownership of $43 million, which does not have an earnings impact until shares are actually sold and capital gains or losses are recognized.
As we’ve said in the past, in order to maintain the tax-free nature of this spin-off, we need to divest of the remaining shares within five years from the spin-off date. We intend to complete this by the end of fiscal '11, and are continuing to assess the best method and timing to do this based on market conditions and other factors.
Also during the quarter, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of Martindale in the U.K., and are expecting to close this by the end of fiscal 2010. This, along with the sale of Specialty Scripts, the closing of which we announced earlier, complete the portfolio rationalization activity that we projected for this year.
Now let’s [ph] review our revised FY '10 outlook. Let me begin with some [indiscernible] comments about how we now view the full year from a forecast perspective, particularly given our [indiscernible] strong financial results in the first three quarters. Certainly our performance thus far has been better than anticipated heading into the year. This is being driven by two major categories of items. First, we've had very good execution against our key initiatives this year, including our Medical supply chain strategy, generics programs, our progress in retail independence and strong performance in nuclear, despite supply shortage issues. But we’ve also benefited from certain external factors including generic launches that happened at a higher level than we had planned, lower deflation on certain generic products, accelerated compensation from our branded vendors relative to price increases and a higher demand for certain med surge products resulting from a stronger and earlier flu season in the first half of the year. 
For the full year, although we will get some net benefit from those factors, we are assuming that they are largely normalized in the fourth quarter. In total, the sum of these items has added up to solid performance in the first nine months of the fiscal year, and this is reflected in our increased guidance of $2.15 to $2.20. [Indiscernible] is that Q4 will be down from last year based upon several factors which I’ll attempt to walk through. 
Our Pharmaceutical segment assumptions for Q4 include the following: the headwinds of the Pfizer DSA and Medicine Shoppe transitions continue to play out as anticipated. The earlier-than-anticipated [indiscernible] price inflation realized in the first three quarters is not [ph] expected to continue in the fourth quarter. In fact, we had originally expected price increases from a major branded contingent vendor in Q4 which we no longer anticipate. The negative year-on-year impact of the generic launches in deflation was not as significant in the first three quarters as we anticipated, again due to several unplanned launches and slower deflation on certain products launched. However, we are not projecting any significant high-value generic launches in Q4.
Finally, let me comment on the financial impact of the nuclear generator supply situation which George covered in some detail. The supply shortage had unfavorable EPS impact of $0.01 to $0.02 in Q3 and based on what we’re seeing so far, we’ll have at least $0.02 impact in Q4. 
Turning to our Medical segment: the first three quarters' results show revenue growth to be above overall market trends, driven by our mix shift, strong growth in Canada ambulatory and lab, an exceptional flu season in Q1 and Q2 and a one-time revenue recognition benefit from the CareFusion spend.
In Q4, we expect that segment revenue growth may moderate somewhat, given the absence of a few of these unique items and a slightly cautious view of the market due to some softness in utilization we saw during part of Q3. 
In the first half of 2010, this segment also saw greater benefit from commodity raw material prices and higher flu-related sales than we had originally projected. These did not continue in Q3. In fact, all [ph] prices moved higher over the past months, and as you recall, there's a lag effect regarding the impact of these movements in our income statement. These factors make for a harder second half comparison. That all said, after a tough [ph] compare in Q3, we do expect the Medical segment to return to year-on-year profit growth in Q4.
On Slide 10, we provided our corporate assumptions for fiscal 2010, which are identical to what we have shared previously. The only comment I’ll make in this area is that we expect that our full-year tax rate will likely be north of 37%, which implies a fourth quarter that could be four percentage points or so higher than last year's unusually low Q4 rate. Taking all of this into account and based on our performance during the first three quarters of this year, as George had mentioned, we are increasing and narrowing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for FY '10 to $2.15 to $2.20.
Now let's turn to Slides 12 to 14 and have a look at our preliminary FY '11 guidance. As George mentioned, we thought it made sense to provide you all with an early look at next year given the somewhat unique circumstances of 2010. Our initial thoughts for fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share range are between $2.35 and $2.45. Implicit in this is our expectation for relatively modest revenue growth on a consolidated basis. 
Now that said, let's spend a few moments going through some of the segment-specific assumptions in more detail. On Slide 13, you can see the Pharmaceutical segment assumptions. Let me hit on a few highlights. Importantly, our FY '11 guidance assumes a renewal of all existing major customer contracts. Brand inflation is projected to be on a comparable level to FY '10.  We do not anticipate a significant change from FY '10 related to the year-on-year comparison of generic launches and price deflation. We do, however, expect continued benefit from our generic sourcing programs. And as we did heading into this year, we have risk-adjusted a basket of potential at-risk launches losses in FY '11 to come up with our forecast. In the Nuclear business, we expect the Moly [ph] supply shortage to moderate during the first half of next year. The Nuclear will likely face a tough first half due to the supply shortage.
Now let's turn to Slide 14 and our assumptions for the Medical segment. We expect to benefit from increased preferred product sales and customer mix shifts to higher margin classes such as ambulatory care. We do project a negative impact from rising commodity prices that we saw over the last several quarters, as the increased cost slowed through our P&L through FY '11. We did not anticipate the extraordinary demand from the pandemic flu season that we experienced in the first half of this year. Our Medical Transformation initiative expense will continue at a similar level to FY '10 as we continue to position our Medical segment for long-term growth.
And we are also making some further strategic moves in the Medical segment related to sourcing and category management which derive [ph] long-term benefit. In addition to the segment-specific items noted, I want to highlight that we will continue to take additional broad-based actions to improve the cost and capital profile of our businesses.  As you would expect, we will be providing an updated look with additional details at our Q4 call. But I hope this preliminary look at FY '11 is helpful. 
Let me conclude with some final remarks on healthcare reform, building on what George commented on earlier. At this point, it is difficult to accurately quantify the impact that some elements of the reform package will have on volumes or margins, although we are optimistic that increased access will provide an overall benefit to us in the medium to longer term. Further, there are two areas that are a bit easier to quantify. First, with regard to the cost of our employee benefits, we expect the ongoing impact to be relatively minimal, and we'll be taking no charge for postretirement healthcare as we do not have a company funded retiree healthcare program. 
With regard to the 2.3% tax on sales by med device manufacturers, we expect to see, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2013, will have some impact on us. The final language, as [indiscernible] devices to include in this tax application, was a little more inclusive than we would have liked. [Indiscernible] for you, based on today's look at business and after any actions we may take to mitigate or share the impact hit to our Med/Surg manufacturing business would be about $20 million to $25 million annually. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin our Q&A.

There were two major transformational initiatives going on this year that we invested in.  One was our overall Med Transformation which was a multiyear, pretty significant overhaul of our processes and systems with our Med supply and manufacturing business. Incrementally, this year, we're going to spend about $25 million more on that program than we did last year, and last year's spend was relatively minimal. The spend next year will be about the same. So there won't be a positive benefit from it next year, but it will be pretty much neutral in terms of the year-on-year spend. The other major transformation within the Med segment was in our ambulatory space, particularly related to customer-facing IT systems and ordering platforms. The bulk of that investment has happened already. There will be a little bit still to be finished up next year, but I would actually expect that to be a net positive next year both due to lessened  investment but also because we're reaping the benefits of that transformation that we've done over the past year and a half. On the Pharma side, the biggest investment we've made this year has to do with our ordering systems that we put in our customers’ pharmacies. We're in the midst of rolling that out to our customers across the U.S. There was significant spend related to that this year. I would expect the spend next year to be about equivalent for that implementation. So again, neutral impact from FY '10 to '11. And then, as always, there's a certain amount of investment spend that sort of hold at Corporate to fund certain initiatives and strategic imperatives over the course of the year. That was a negative variance from FY '09 to FY '11 -- I’m sorry, from FY ’09 to FY '10 in the range of I’d say $15 million or so. I would say it would be largely neutral going into next year. So hopefully, that helps.

Quite honestly, in Q4, we are expecting very, very little of that. In fact, one of our largest contingent vendors that typically would do a fairly significant price increase in Q4, our expectations are that price increase will not happen. So again, our income from brand inflation from contingent vendors is a very conservative view of Q4. That both is responsible for the largest step-down from Q3 to Q4 in terms of farm income. It's also the largest driver of the decline from last year to this year. But there's a few other factors in Q4 as well. Clearly, we still face the headwinds related to the Pfizer DSA transition, which also impacted Q3. But the impact on Q4 is slightly higher. We expect fewer generic launches this year versus last year. As you may recall, Adderall launched in Q4 of last year, which was a fairly significant value generic launch for us. We don't see anything of even comparable size in our Q4. And then as we indicated, our nuclear supply shortage continues to be quite severe. That impacted us for part of Q3. It's going to impact us for the entire Q4, and it has turned out to be a pretty big challenge for us. So those would be the big factors. Again, the other thing I'd point out is that our tax rate in Q4 will be about four percentage points higher than it was in Q4 of last year.

There's just the general market inflation, which tracks very closely to what you would see in the published reports, which I think by most published reports this year have been in the sort of high-single digits. But more importantly, from sort of a quarterly swing factor perspective, we also track the brand inflation from our contingent vendors. And that does differ from the overall market. And this year has been more in the mid-single digits as we've commented on before. But we think that most of that happened in the first three quarters of the year, which is why we're not projecting much in Q4. Regarding whether we'll see those price increases happen next year, don't know. I mean we always assume a certain level of contingent branded price increase in each year. Now exactly the timing of those and which ones will happen at which rate, again, we sort of look at it largely as an overall portfolio. So it's hard to say which specific ones will happen in Q1 or not.

First of all, I wouldn't view it as us taking down Q4. I would view it as taking up the year and recognizing that there were shifts between quarters and probably some of the stuff that we were expecting in Q4 before happened in Q3. But let me be a little bit more specific regarding some of the year-on-year negative drivers in Q4. First of all, the headwinds from the Pfizer DSA and MSI transitions that we've been talking about all year probably hit us to the largest degree in Q4, given past timing of Pfizer price increases. And that's worth $0.03 to $0.04 of negative impact year-on-year. Other brand inflation that we think sort of got shifted primarily earlier and that's in the $0.04 range. Lack of generic launches is $0.01 to $0.02, again versus last year. The impact of the nuclear supply shortage, as we've said, was at least $0.02, so I'll put that in the $0.02 to $0.03 range. The tax rate increase is worth about $0.03. And then, we'll probably be occurring at higher performance compensation rates as well in Q4, which could be worth another $0.03 or so. So I think as you add those up, you can quickly get to the difference between growth and the negative growth we'll be anticipating. The final thing I'll point out, and obviously, you know this, Larry, but just to state it, our Q4 is traditionally always lower than our Q3 due to just the nature of our business.

And we think that will provide a margin expansion for us as well.

Given the very large nature of some of our customers, particularly on the bulk side, you can sometimes get a fairly significant swing in the cord [ph] just because of timing of orders. It may not necessarily track their demand, but they may place a very large order on December 29 and that may shift something from Q3 to Q2. So with our very large customers, it's always hard to read too much into the timing of the orders. Regarding our view going forward, I'd say within the Pharma side, we're generally going to track the market, although recognizing that those two large customer losses or terminations that we had earlier this year still haven't lapsed. So we'll still feel the effect from that going into Q2 of next year. But if you sort of adjust for that, we expect to generally track the market and exactly how close we'll track the market will depend on how our customers perform in terms of market share versus the broader market. On the Med/Surg side, again, we had a few unusual events this year that for the first three quarters tended to abnormally elevate our revenue growth. Again, we had the recognition of revenue related to the CareFusion spin in Q1. We had a extraordinary flu season in Q1 and Q2. Those events clearly won't repeat in Q4 and probably into next year. So I would say generally, we expect to track the market and the markets we participate in. And I'd say we have a somewhat cautious view for the next couple quarters until we see exactly where the economy settles out, et cetera. But I'd say in general, we see modest growth for the current periods.

172207,100100998,59659,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our third quarter call. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our performance during the March quarter, and our continued momentum throughout the first nine months of fiscal 2",2191,"Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our third quarter call. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our performance during the March quarter, and our continued momentum throughout the first nine months of fiscal 2010. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities as we reposition our business, and this is resulting in stronger bonds with our customers, better financial performance, and growing enthusiasm from our employees around our overall mission and greater optimism for the future. 
For Q3, revenue was $24.3 billion, up 1% over the prior period. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down 8%, while non-GAAP operating earnings decreased by 7% over the prior Q3 results. 
Our overall operating performance was better than we originally expected. And I'm pleased with the progress we are making to deliver sustainable growth and value to both our customers and to our shareholders.
As a company, our results reflect solid performance in both segments driven by several key highlights. Significant ongoing improvement in our Generic business, of particular note is a further increase in generic penetration rate, or what we refer to as share of wallet; continued stellar performance under our branded manufacture agreements; strong performance in Nuclear, particularly given the ongoing global supply shortages; solid growth on our Medical segment’s preferred products; and excellent revenue and profit growth in Canada from new suppliers and products. We have also been very successful with our working capital improvement and had another a very strong quarter of operating cash flow. 
Now let me comment on each segment separately, starting with Pharmaceutical. Continuing a strong momentum in Q3, our Pharma segment delivered strong performance and improving margins. Segment sales increased slightly versus the prior-year periods. The sales growth was in line with our expectations, dampened by the previously disclosed loss of two customers in the first half of this fiscal year. Segment profit improved, increasing 7% in the quarter versus Q3 of fiscal 2009. This was driven primarily by an increase in overall margin rates due to excellent performance in our generic initiatives, continued solid performance under our branded manufacture agreements and disciplined expense management within the segment as a whole. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see good progress in our Generics program, both on the sales and sourcing side. We have developed a highly attractive offering for our customers and they are responding enthusiastically. Last June, we set a target for ourselves to increase our generic penetration rate by 10%. We have already exceeded that annual improvement goal. And our customer loyalty scores further validate that we are on the right path.
We saw a healthy 10% increase in overall Generic sales this quarter, driven by continued progress in our retail independent customer base. And Generic sales to our Medicine Shoppe customers in the first nine months of the fiscal year have exceeded full year 2009 Generic sales. 
We believe that improving sales effectiveness is key to further increasing share of wallet with our existing customers as well as capturing more new business. Our sales college, launched earlier this year, take the best-practices approach to building these capabilities. It provides comprehensive on-boarding training for all new sales reps, as well as ongoing training for all reps and managers in an integrated curriculum model, positioning us to serve our customers with an even higher degree of satisfaction. 
Additionally, several months ago, we began a purposeful cross-selling effort in the Ambulatory Care channel with our Medical segment sales force. While still early, this effort is beginning to deliver benefits to both our customers and to Cardinal Health.
It has been an unusual stretch for our Nuclear business, and I'd like to take a little extra time today to discuss this part of our Pharmaceutical segment. I'm extremely proud of what this team has done to manage an incredibly difficult raw material shortage. While supply constraints had an impact in overall volume, the team continued to take care of our customers and deliver solid bottom line growth. 
In response to the supply shortage, the nuclear team engaged several of our own Six Sigma operational excellence black belts to maximize the available product through just-in-time delivery, working closely with our customers to adjust patient schedules and calibrate delivery times, to help meet the needs of the most critical patients first. And where appropriate, customers have substituted a different imaging modality using thallium, a compound that we also supply. 
Our people have been working around the clock to compensate for these extraordinary circumstances, and our customer loyalty scores, already at a high level, have actually increased during this difficult time, a testament to the trusted-advisor role that our team has earned with their customers.
But that's not the end of the story. In the category of “You Can't Make This Stuff Up”, the volcanic eruption in Iceland further hindered the ability of raw material as suppliers of European-processed Moly-99 were unable to ship to U.S. manufacturers’ technetium generator. Our current expectations regarding supply is that the production from the Petten reactor in the Netherlands and the Chalk River reactor in Canada will normalize no earlier than late August/early September timeframe. The impact of the volcanic eruption and our expectations on nuclear generator supply are reflected in our forecast for Q4.
In the quarter, we also achieved strong results in our small but growing positron emissions tomography business through continued sales growth, clinical trial support and operational efficiencies. This is an exciting area, as PET imaging agents are being developed to detect and treat diseases such as Alzheimer's and other neurological and aging-related diseases. We play a key role in supporting these clinical trial efforts and are well positioned for future growth in this space, through the manufacturing, dispensing and distribution of these and other products. And just a reminder that the technetium generator supply issue does not affect the PET business.
Turning to the Medical segment, the quarter came in about as we expected. Revenue grew a respectable 7%, largely based on strong performance from our business in Canada, growth in both Ambulatory Care and Lab and increased sales of our self-manufactured products. While segment profit was down 16% compared to last year's strong third quarter, it was up sequentially from Q2, as we forecasted on last quarter's call. An unusual year-over-year comparison in the cost of goods sold created a tough comparison versus the prior period. 
Further influencing our results in the Medical segment were higher expenses in the period, primarily driven by year-over-year comparison in performance compensation accruals and by our Medical Business Transformation investment. Apart from this investment we continue to tightly manage our core expenses. 
We are closely watching hospital admissions and procedures as this does influence demand for our products. There were clear signs that consumers have been cautious with their medical spending, with both inpatient and outpatient volumes down slightly. This along with a weak flu season did somewhat dampen our hospital supply business in the third quarter. We will monitor these factors carefully and are hopeful that job growth data and other signs of some economic recovery will begin to translate into higher utilization.
We are extremely focused on improving the Hospital channel and continue to build out our preferred products categories, including self-manufactured and private label products. Progress during the quarter in our private label initiative included the launch of new OR and nursing products, and in the first nine months of the year our portfolio of private label products has grown at double the rate of the rest of our Hospital Supply business. 
We believe that these preferred product programs will create benefits for our customers and have a positive impact on our margins. We have recently realigned our resources within the entire Medical segment around customer channels and product categories in order to leverage our collective capabilities in manufacturing, distribution and sourcing in order to bring a higher level of value and service to our customers.
Canada had another excellent quarter, posting both revenue and profit growth well in excess of 20%. New products and supplier agreements, with some upside from foreign exchange, fueled this outstanding growth. Ambulatory Care and Lab also continued to perform well this quarter, although showed slower revenue growth due to lower flu volumes. And work on our Medical Business Transformation continues to meet our timeline and budget expectations. We completed the design stage and are now in the build stage of this important project to enhance our technology platform and processes. In short, further reducing supply chain costs will make it easier for our customers and suppliers to do business with us.
As is true with the segments, at the Cardinal Health enterprise level, we continue to focus on tight expense controls and the prudent use of capital. We continue to manage our balance sheet carefully with a strong emphasis on reducing working capital. I'm particularly proud that we were able to continue to reduce inventory days while keeping our service level rates high. 
Operating cash flow was very robust, buoyed by our business performance and working capital focus. Given this performance, the cash we have on hand and the additional cash we expect to generate from the sale of CareFusion stock, many of you have asked how we intend to deploy our capital going forward. With the exception of our policy on and our commitment to a solid dividend, we do not bring a fixed formula to our capital deployment strategy. Our goal is twofold: To ensure that we are well positioned for sustainable competitive advantage; and two, to create shareholder value. The investments we are making are focused on those two things. To the extent that we need to complement our internal capabilities or scale with an external move to achieve our goals, we will explore acquisitions. And in this mix, we will consider other strategies such as share repurchases. 
Based on our performance during the first nine months of this year and our visibility into what is effectively the remaining 60 days of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2010 to a range of $2.15 to $2.20. The implication is that our fiscal 2010 fourth quarter will be weaker than last year's fourth quarter. This is as we expected. And Jeff will walk you through our assumptions around the remainder of the year in a moment. 
Consistent with the comments I made in the first and second quarters, we came into this transition year with clarity about what we needed to do to put the company on the path for sustainable long-term growth, what we expected to face on that journey in fiscal 2010 and a determination to get the work done. Our renewal of the company has progressed at a more accelerated pace than we originally anticipated, and I'm delighted that coming out of fiscal 2010, we expect earnings growth off a larger and more stable base than we originally anticipated. 
Although we don't typically provide annual guidance at the end of the third quarter, this has been an unusual year, and we would like to provide investors with our early thoughts on fiscal 2011 on this call. Given the data we have at this stage and the progress on our underlying business performance, our initial outlook for fiscal 2011 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45. On our fourth quarter call, after we have finalized our annual budget, we will provide more details. Jeff will walk you through our core assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2010 and for our preliminary view of fiscal 2011. 
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to make a few comments on healthcare reform. As you are well aware, since we last spoke on our second quarter call in January, this historical legislation has been passed. It is important to note that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act marks the beginning of healthcare reform, not the end. With more than 2,700 pages of legislation to interpret and implement, there will be a long administrative, regulatory and legal process, as the appropriate agencies work through the details of implementation. This will be a very interactive and iterative process in which Cardinal Health plans to participate. 
While there is much work to be done, we are well positioned to address healthcare reform's two main goals: coverage and costs. Clearly, adding more than 30 million new patients will put greater demand on the U.S. healthcare system, a system already under stress. This additional pressure will increase the relevance of our capabilities to improve the cost effectiveness, quality and safety for our customers' operations, allowing them to focus on patient care. 
Finally, let me end by saying that I feel very good about our performance in the quarter, and our rate of progress to this point. Our organization is tightly aligned around our strategic priorities, intently focused on execution, and our people are passionate about continuing to improve the customer experience. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff to provide more details in the quarter. Jeff?"

It's a pleasure to be reporting our Q3 end results, and I'm very proud of the organizational execution and financial performance we have delivered in the third quarter and fiscal year to date. First, I'll",2667,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to be reporting our Q3 end results, and I'm very proud of the organizational execution and financial performance we have delivered in the third quarter and fiscal year to date. First, I'll provide an overview of our Q3 results and key drivers. Let me build on those as well as touch on our revised FY '10 guidance and preliminary fiscal '11 outlook.
To begin, as you may recall, before the start of this year, we identified a few key financial metrics that we needed to focus on to win, specifically margin expansion and working capital improvements. Driven by a number of the performance initiatives that George has already referenced, we have made some great progress in both of these areas. 
First, we are pleased that after the second quarter in a row, consolidated gross margin rates have increased year-on-year. In Q3, this rate increased five basis points versus last year to 4.15%. And non-bulk profit margins within our Pharma segment were 2.24% versus 2.05% in Q3 of FY '09. 
Second, regarding working capital, we've continued to see the hard work of our people pay dividends. Both year-on-year and sequentially, inventory declined by two days largely due to the efforts of our operating teams and our lean Six Sigma programs. At the same time, our accounts receivables days outstanding improved versus last year. These initiatives, combined with our earnings performance, helped to generate $879 million of operating cash flow in Q3, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to just over $1.8 billion. And in the timing of payments, our cumulative operating cash flow for the full year will likely be below this in a range of $1.5 billion or so. But it still represents a significant number and is much higher than we projected coming into the year.
To summarize, we're making great progress with our performance initiatives and it’s beginning to consistently show in our key metrics. Although we’ll always see some quarterly fluctuations and margin rate trends and working capital levels, due to the nature of our business and external factors, we feel we have the actions in place to continue to move these in the right direction over time. 
Now let me add a few more details regarding our Q3 performance starting with the segments.  As George said, we are pleased with the business progress and financial results in Pharma. Revenue increased by 0.5%, split almost equally between non-bulk and bulk customers. The ending of a relationship with two significant customers in the first half of the year dampened sales growth by approximately 150 basis points. These are the same two low-margin accounts we had referenced in previous calls. 
Certain of our large customers also grew their orders less than market in the third quarter which further impacted the growth rate. Within the Pharma margins in the quarter, we saw strong performance under our brand agreements, particularly related to brand inflation from our price contingent vendors, as well as our generic programs. This benefit was partially offset by the continued Medicine Shoppe and Pfizer DSA transitions and previously referenced contract re-pricings which are largely flowing through as anticipated.
In the Medical segment, profit declined 16% versus last year to $108 million, primarily due to an unusual year-on-year comparison and the cost of goods sold, the year-on-year impact of performance-based employee compensation and increased investment spend associated with the Medical Business Transformation. The decline was partially offset by revenue growth from our Canadian Lab and Ambulatory businesses and our portfolio of preferred products. Segment profit increased sequentially, by $5 million, despite less benefit from commodity price changes and the absence of a significant Q3 flu season. In fact, after a much higher than usual positive impact in the flu in the first half of fiscal '10, that trend pretty much reversed itself in Q3. 
Let me now cover a few items at the consolidated level. Non-GAAP operating expense is up over 9% from last year, largely driven by funding our performance-based employee compensation programs that did not occur in the prior year period, and to a lesser extent, investments spend on key initiative. If you exclude those drivers, our core SG&A is down year-on-year, reflecting the continued tight focus we have in this area.
Let me spend a few more moments on this compensation issue given its significance to our expense line this quarter. As I’m sure you’ll recall, last year in late Q2 and Q3, we were in the midst of the global financial crisis. At that time, we had not yet spun off our CareFusion capital equipment businesses. The economic crisis had begun having a very negative impact on hospital capital equipment orders, significantly impacting our CareFusion business. As we recognized this downturn in our full year financial forecast for FY '09, we also brought down our management bonus accruals across the entire company commensurately and this particularly impacted Q3 ’09. This year, our bonus accruals have increased based on strong performance versus target. The net year-on-year impact of those accruals moving in opposite directions is reflected in our SG&A growth this quarter. 
Compounding this increase is the decision we made heading into FY '10 to tie more of our employee-related expenses to company financial performance and hence make more variable. Specifically, we replaced a portion of our 401k benefit that was a fixed employer contribution with a variable contribution linked to financial performance. And again, better-than-planned performance this year resulted in higher accruals for this expense in Q3.
Moving on, our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 38.2% versus 37.3% last year. The higher rate in the current quarter was attributable to changes in income mix and a few discreet items. On the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with over $2.6 billion of cash, approximately $400 million of which is overseas. 
Now let me turn to Slide 7 and take a moment to walk you through the items that accounted for the difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS numbers. All these figures that I’ll review are on an after-tax basis. The biggest item in this category is a $23 million gain from sales of 5.4 million shares of CareFusion stock in the quarter. This accounted for approximately $0.06. The next item is the impairments and loss on sale of assets of approximately $0.04. The majority of this relates to the closure of a facility, as well as final tax true-ups related to a divestiture. The other three items, restructuring and severance, litigation charges and other spin-off costs netted to approximately $0.01. The net of all these items resulted in a GAAP EPS of $0.62 versus non-GAAP of $0.61.
Now turning to Slide 8, an update on the status of our CareFusion stake. As mentioned earlier, during Q3, we sold 5.4 million shares that generated $136 million in proceeds and a gain of $23 million. We’ve accrued no tax on the proceeds of this sale. After these sales, we now hold 30.5 million shares of CareFusion stock which had a value of $805 million at March 31.  During Q3, we had a pretax unrealized gain in this remaining ownership of $43 million, which does not have an earnings impact until shares are actually sold and capital gains or losses are recognized.
As we’ve said in the past, in order to maintain the tax-free nature of this spin-off, we need to divest of the remaining shares within five years from the spin-off date. We intend to complete this by the end of fiscal '11, and are continuing to assess the best method and timing to do this based on market conditions and other factors.
Also during the quarter, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of Martindale in the U.K., and are expecting to close this by the end of fiscal 2010. This, along with the sale of Specialty Scripts, the closing of which we announced earlier, completes the portfolio rationalization activity that we projected for this year.
Now let’s review our revised FY '10 outlook. Let me begin with some framing comments about how we now view the full year from a forecast perspective, particularly given our [indiscernible] strong financial results in the first three quarters. Certainly our performance thus far has been better than anticipated heading into the year. This is being driven by two major categories of items. First, we've had very good execution against our key initiatives this year, including our Medical supply chain strategy, generics programs, our progress in retail independence and strong performance in nuclear, despite supply shortage issues. But we’ve also benefited from certain external factors including generic launches that happened at a higher level than we had planned, lower deflation on certain generic products, accelerated compensation from our branded vendors relative to price increases and a higher demand for certain med surge products resulting from a stronger and earlier flu season in the first half of the year. 
For the full year, although we will get some net benefit from those factors, we are assuming that they are largely normalized in the fourth quarter. In total, the sum of these items has added up to solid performance in the first nine months of the fiscal year, and this is reflected in our increased guidance of $2.15 to $2.20. [Indiscernible] is that Q4 will be down from last year based upon several factors which I’ll attempt to walk through. 
Our Pharmaceutical segment assumptions for Q4 include the following: the headwinds of the Pfizer DSA and Medicine Shoppe transitions continue to play out as anticipated. The earlier-than-anticipated [indiscernible] price inflation realized in the first three quarters is not [ph] expected to continue in the fourth quarter. In fact, we had originally expected price increases from a major branded contingent vendor in Q4 which we no longer anticipate. The negative year-on-year impact of the generic launches in deflation was not as significant in the first three quarters as we anticipated, again due to several unplanned launches and slower deflation on certain products launched. However, we are not projecting any significant high-value generic launches in Q4.
Finally, let me comment on the financial impact of the nuclear generator supply situation which George covered in some detail. The supply shortage had unfavorable EPS impact of $0.01 to $0.02 in Q3 and based on what we’re seeing so far, we’ll have at least $0.02 impact in Q4. 
Turning to our Medical segment: the first three quarters' results show revenue growth to be above overall market trends, driven by our mix shift, strong growth in Canada ambulatory and lab, an exceptional flu season in Q1 and Q2 and a one-time revenue recognition benefit from the CareFusion spend.
In Q4, we expect that segment revenue growth may moderate somewhat, given the absence of a few of these unique items and a slightly cautious view of the market due to some softness in utilization we saw during part of Q3. 
In the first half of 2010, this segment also saw greater benefit from commodity raw material prices and higher flu-related sales than we had originally projected. These did not continue in Q3. In fact, all [ph] prices moved higher over the past months, and as you recall, there's a lag effect regarding the impact of these movements in our income statement. These factors make for a harder second half comparison. That all said, after a tough [ph] compare in Q3, we do expect the Medical segment to return to year-on-year profit growth in Q4.
On Slide 10, we provided our corporate assumptions for fiscal 2010, which are identical to what we have shared previously. The only comment I’ll make in this area is that we expect that our full-year tax rate will likely be north of 37%, which implies a fourth quarter that could be four percentage points or so higher than last year's unusually low Q4 rate. Taking all of this into account and based on our performance during the first three quarters of this year, as George had mentioned, we are increasing and narrowing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for FY '10 to $2.15 to $2.20.
Now let's turn to Slides 12 to 14 and have a look at our preliminary FY '11 guidance. As George mentioned, we thought it made sense to provide you all with an early look at next year given the somewhat unique circumstances of 2010. Our initial thoughts for fiscal 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share range are between $2.35 and $2.45. Implicit in this is our expectation for relatively modest revenue growth on a consolidated basis. 
Now that said, let's spend a few moments going through some of the segment-specific assumptions in more detail. On Slide 13, you can see the Pharmaceutical segment assumptions. Let me hit on a few highlights. Importantly, our FY '11 guidance assumes a renewal of all existing major customer contracts. Brand inflation is projected to be on a comparable level to FY '10.  We do not anticipate a significant change from FY '10 related to the year-on-year comparison of generic launches and price deflation. We do, however, expect continued benefit from our generic sourcing programs. And as we did heading into this year, we have risk-adjusted a basket of potential at-risk launches losses in FY '11 to come up with our forecast. In the Nuclear business, we expect the Moly supply shortage to moderate during the first half of next year, but Nuclear will likely face a tough first half due to the supply shortage.
Now let's turn to Slide 14 and our assumptions for the Medical segment. We expect to benefit from increased preferred product sales and customer mix shifts to higher margin classes such as ambulatory care. We do project a negative impact from rising commodity prices that we saw over the last several quarters, as the increased costs flow through our P&L during FY '11. We do not anticipate the extraordinary demand for the pandemic flu season that we experienced in the first half of this year. Our Medical Transformation initiative expense will continue at a similar level to FY '10 as we continue to position our Medical segment for long-term growth.
And we’re also making some further strategic moves in the Medical segment related to sourcing and category management which drive long-term benefit. In addition to the segment-specific items noted, I want to highlight that we will continue to take additional broad-based actions to improve the cost and capital profile of our businesses.  As you would expect, we will be providing an updated look with additional details at our Q4 call. But we hope this preliminary look at FY '11 is helpful. 
Let me conclude with some final remarks on healthcare reform, building on what George commented on earlier. At this point, it is difficult to accurately quantify the impact that some elements of the reform package will have on volumes or margins, although we are optimistic that increased access will provide an overall benefit to us in the medium to longer term. However, there are two areas that are a bit easier to quantify. First, with regard to the cost of our employee benefits, we expect the ongoing impact to be relatively minimal, and we'll be taking no charge for postretirement healthcare as we do not have a company funded retiree healthcare program. 
With regard to the 2.3% tax on sales by med device manufacturers, we expect this fee, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2013, will have some impact on us. The final language as to the classes of devices to include in this tax application was a little more inclusive than we would have liked. To size this for you, based on today's book of business and absent any actions we may take to mitigate or share the impact, the hit to our Med/Surg manufacturing business would be about $20 million to $25 million annually. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin our Q&A."

There were two major transformational initiatives going on this year that we invested in.  One was our overall Med Transformation which was a multiyear, pretty significant overhaul of our processes and systems with our Med supply and manufacturing business. Incrementally, this year, we're going to spend about $25 million more on that program than we did last year, and last year's spend was relatively minimal. The spend next year will be about the same. So there won't be a positive benefit from it next year, but it will be pretty much neutral in terms of the year-on-year spend. The other major transformation within the Med segment was in our ambulatory space, particularly related to customer-facing IT systems and ordering platforms. The bulk of that investment has happened already. There will be a little bit still to be finished up next year, but I would actually expect that to be a net positive next year both due to lessened  investment but also because we're reaping the benefits of that transformation that we've done over the past year and a half. On the Pharma side, the biggest investment we've made this year has to do with our ordering systems that we put in our customers’ pharmacies. We're in the midst of rolling that out to our customers across the U.S. There was significant spend related to that this year. I would expect the spend next year to be about equivalent for that implementation. So again, neutral impact from FY '10 to '11. And then, as always, there's a certain amount of investment spend that sort of hold at Corporate to fund certain initiatives and strategic imperatives over the course of the year. That was a negative variance from FY '09 to FY '11 –- I’m sorry, from FY ’09 to FY '10 in the range of I’d say $15 million or so. I would say it would be largely neutral going into next year. So hopefully, that helps."

Quite honestly, in Q4, we are expecting very, very little of that. In fact, one of our largest contingent vendors that typically would do a fairly significant price increase in Q4, our expectations are that price increase will not happen. So again, our income from brand inflation from contingent vendors is a very conservative view of Q4. That both is responsible for the largest step-down from Q3 to Q4 in terms of farm income. It's also the largest driver of the decline from last year to this year. But there's a few other factors in Q4 as well. Clearly, we still face the headwinds related to the Pfizer DSA transition, which also impacted Q3. But the impact on Q4 is slightly higher. We expect fewer generic launches this year versus last year. As you may recall, Adderall launched in Q4 of last year, which was a fairly significant value generic launch for us. We don't see anything of even comparable size in our Q4. And then as we indicated, our nuclear supply shortage continues to be quite severe. That impacted us for part of Q3. It's going to impact us for the entire Q4, and it has turned out to be a pretty big challenge for us. So those would be the big factors. Again, the other thing I'd point out is that our tax rate in Q4 will be about four percentage points higher than it was in Q4 of last year."

There's just the general market inflation, which tracks very closely to what you would see in the published reports, which I think by most published reports this year have been in the sort of high-single digits. But more importantly, from sort of a quarterly swing factor perspective, we also track the brand inflation from our contingent vendors. And that does differ from the overall market. And this year has been more in the mid-single digits as we've commented on before. But we think that most of that happened in the first three quarters of the year, which is why we're not projecting much in Q4. Regarding whether we'll see those price increases happen next year, don't know. I mean we always assume a certain level of contingent branded price increase in each year.

First of all, I wouldn't view it as us taking down Q4. I would view it as taking up the year and recognizing that there were shifts between quarters and probably some of the stuff that we were expecting in Q4 before happened in Q3. But let me be a little bit more specific regarding some of the year-on-year negative drivers in Q4. First of all, the headwinds from the Pfizer DSA and MSI transitions that we've been talking about all year probably hit us to the largest degree in Q4, given past timing of Pfizer price increases. And that's worth $0.03 to $0.04 of negative impact year-on-year. Other brand inflation that we think sort of got shifted primarily earlier and that's in the $0.04 range. Lack of generic launches is $0.01 to $0.02, again versus last year. The impact of the nuclear supply shortage, as we've said, was at least $0.02, so I'll put that in the $0.02 to $0.03 range. The tax rate increase is worth about $0.03. And then, we'll probably be occurring at higher performance compensation rates as well in Q4, which could be worth another $0.03 or so. So I think as you add those up, you can quickly get to the difference between growth and the negative growth we'll be anticipating. The final thing I'll point out, and obviously, you know this, Larry, but just to state it, our Q4 is traditionally always lower than our Q3 due to just the nature of our business."

Given the very large nature of some of our customers, particularly on the bulk side, you can sometimes get a fairly significant swing in a quarter just because of timing of orders. It may not necessarily track their demand, but they may place a very large order on December 29 and that may shift something from Q3 to Q2. So with our very large customers, it's always hard to read too much into the timing of the orders. Regarding our view going forward, I'd say within the Pharma side, we're generally going to track the market, although recognizing that those two large customer losses or terminations that we had earlier this year still haven't lapsed. So we'll still feel the effect from that going into Q2 of next year. But if you sort of adjust for that, we expect to generally track the market and exactly how close we'll track the market will depend on how our customers perform in terms of market share versus the broader market. On the Med/Surg side, again, we had a few unusual events this year that for the first three quarters tended to abnormally elevate our revenue growth. Again, we had the recognition of revenue related to the CareFusion spin in Q1. We had a extraordinary flu season in Q1 and Q2. Those events clearly won't repeat in Q4 and probably into next year. So I would say generally, we expect to track the market in the markets we participate in. And I'd say we have a somewhat cautious view for the next couple quarters until we see exactly where the economy settles out, et cetera. But I'd say in general, we see modest growth for the coming periods."

This morning's call offers me the opportunity to reflect on our first year, as what I'll describe for the last time, as the new Cardinal Health. It has been an important year for us in many ways, and this morning, I'",2403,"Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone. This morning's call offers me the opportunity to reflect on our first year, as what I'll describe for the last time, as the new Cardinal Health. It has been an important year for us in many ways, and this morning, I'll give you my observations about the year we just completed as well as my perspective on the year in front of us. I'll devote most of my commentary to the state of our transformation and our overall positioning, and let Jeff cover in detail, the numbers for the quarter and for the full year.
I will, however, start with a few numbers. We ended fiscal 2010 with non-GAAP EPS of $2.22, down slightly versus fiscal 2009 and considerably better than we anticipated back in August of last year. Full year revenue was up 3% to $98.5 billion. Our organization did an outstanding job managing our working capital, and we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations. Overall, these were significant accomplishment, given the considerable strategic changes and investments we made on the business.
Some of you have asked me during the course of the year, how I feel about the extent and rate of our progress. As you know, we entered the fiscal year with a commitment to take action to improve our performance, our strategic positioning, our internal culture to shift our center of gravity more decisively out to the customer and, of course, our trajectory. 
We also knew there were some systemic issues that we would have to weather, some mechanical challenges like the large year-over-year negative comp in generic launches. Having said all that, if you'd ask me a year ago, whether or not I'd be pleased with where we are today, the answer would clearly be yes. We've made enormous progress on our road to position the company for renewed growth, and we've moved the needle considerably faster than we had anticipated. This is still a journey, but I believe we have a lot to be excited about.
Certainly, it was not a year of perfection. We hate to lose a single customer and we lost very few. But in the earlier part of the year, we did fail to renew a few key customers on the Hospital side, as well as one on the Retail Chain side, and that was disappointing. We stabilized our margin rate in Hospital Supply, however, would have liked to have seen it moving up. And while we made enormous progress in our efforts to simplify the lives of our customers, we know we can do even better. Nonetheless, our customers are telling us that we're on the right path. Our employees are telling us that as well, that they believe in where we're going and are energized by the journey.
As we told you at the beginning of the fiscal year, our focus in FY '10 was on strengthening the core of our business, and we have done just that. In our Pharmaceutical segment, we renewed many of our largest chain customer contracts well into fiscal 2012. We also renewed and entered into new agreements with a number of very important large branded manufacturer partners. All of this is critical to stabilizing our Pharmaceutical segment base and putting us in a position to move margin in the right direction.
Pharmaceutical segment profit declined 3% for the full year. This performance was considerably better than we anticipated, driven by strong execution on key initiatives, some of which I'll cover in a moment, disciplined cost management and aided somewhat by the positive impact from some unplanned generic launches. We've placed a great deal of emphasis on our retail independent pharmacy channel, and after a patchy couple of years, we return this part of the business to full year growth for the first time, since fiscal 2008.
Just a couple of weeks ago, we held our 20th annual and largest ever Retail Business Conference for our retail independent pharmacy customers. Well over 4,000 stores were represented at the event in Denver. We launched a number of offerings designed to help pharmacists run their businesses more efficiently, including Order Express, which provides retail pharmacies with a more convenient and user-friendly online buying experience. Feedback from customers has been very positive. 
We made great strides in our generic sourcing initiative, and we developed a highly attractive generic offering for our customers. As a result, we exceeded our full year improvement target of 10% in generic penetration or what we refer to as share of wallet. And our focus on driving sales force effectiveness through initiatives like our Sales College has provided us with additional traction and speed. We recognize that our sales reps are crucial to delivering an even higher level of service to our customers, and we continue to invest in their ongoing training and skill development.
We also reevaluated our Pharmaceutical segment portfolio and made a number of key decisions. We felt that the Medicine Shoppe network could be enhanced by providing an alternative model for our franchisees that moves them from a royalty-centric model to a more flexible fee-based model. We decided to divest Specialty Scripts and Martindale, and we made a meaningful move into the fast-growing area of Specialty Pharmaceutical Services. As we discussed previously, our goal was to enter the Specialty Service area in a differentiated way, and we're convinced that the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions or P4, as it is known in the oncology community, provides us with that platform.
The commercial activities within Healthcare Solutions serve key participants across the chain of specialty care, including physicians, pharmaceutical companies and payers, by providing essential tools, services and data to help improve patient outcome and increase efficiency in the delivery of healthcare. While this acquisition will have only a modest impact on FY '11, it positions us to participate in the growth of specialty category going forward. We're very excited about the growth potential in specialty and about the enthusiasm of the Healthcare Solutions' leadership team to help us achieve our goals in this area, and also, about how they're working with us to integrate these activities into Cardinal Health. We expect the integration to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of FY '11.
We also made investments in our relatively small but growing positron emission tomography unit, and are well-positioned through the manufacturing, dispensing and distribution of PET imaging agents and a key role we play in supporting clinical trials. And in the space of exceedingly difficult raw material shortages, our Nuclear Pharmacy organization performed extremely well in FY '10.  I'm very proud of this group and how they work so closely with our customers to ensure the needs of patients were met. We're looking forward to return to more normalized levels of supply in the September timeframe from both the Chalk River reactor in Canada and the Petten reactor in the Netherlands.
Our Medical segment had a busy and successful year. We finished the fourth quarter of 22% over prior year in segment profit and up 11% for the year. Additionally, we achieved a number of key goals and moved forward with several important transformational initiatives. We developed our segment strategy around channel and category management, which we believe, will better align with our customers' needs and enhance our ability to apply our core capabilities. And we completely rebuilt our sourcing model for medical products, expanding our global sourcing capabilities and our leadership there. I believe this will be an increasingly important asset for us and for our customers.
We made good progress on our substantial commitment to simplifying the customer experience and made critical investments in IT and customer-facing activities. In particular, we began the Medical Business Transformation work to enhance our technology platform and processes, and we are progressing well against our critical milestones. We returned our Presource kitting unit back to positive growth trajectory, enabled by our Lean Six Sigma and operational excellence initiative and our expanded presence in surgery centers. 
We made investments focused on growing our Ambulatory footprint and we expanded our sales organization, while at the same time, enhancing our Web ordering capabilities to better meet the needs of this channel. We also established a cross-selling effort with the Pharmaceutical segment, which is off to a good start. 
Our lab channel grew both revenue and profit by mid-single digits for the year, helped by demand for flu-related products in the first half. And Canada had an exceptional year, with double-digit revenue and profit growth, also helped by the demand for flu-related products, along with some upside from foreign exchange. In all, Medical segment revenue was up 3% in the quarter and up 7.2% for the full year. 
I should say something here about demand, as a number of companies have noted the softness in the hospital and physician office channels. We commented in last quarter's call that demand was somewhat soft there, and we can report that we saw no real improvement from a macro standpoint in our June quarter.
At the Cardinal Health enterprise level, in addition to our effort to strengthen our strategic positioning, drive performance management and revitalize our culture, I'm particularly proud of how we manage our capital in an extraordinary environment. During this past year, we were able to raise our dividend as well as do some share repurchases, as Jeff will discuss. We've invested in areas of our business critical to supporting our customers and driving future positioning, and we've used capital opportunistically to make moves that enhance our strategic positioning and shareholder value. We entered 2011 with a very strong balance sheet, which gives us excellent financial flexibility.
In keeping with our commitment to drive shareholder value, we've launched total shareholder return, or TSR, internally as a capstone metric for measuring our performance. And I'm really pleased that our organization is rallying around this concept. We've been setting internal goals around this metric, and I'm sure you'll hear us reference it in the future. 
Following the spin off, we took the opportunity to recruit four outstanding new independent board members, with exceptional healthcare and consumer background. These individuals have been terrific additions to our Board of Directors. Additionally, we bolstered our management team with several important additions. At the corporate level, we added Mark Blake, EVP of Strategy and Corporate Development; Patty Morrison, CIO; and Gilberto Quintero, Senior Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Compliance. In the Pharmaceutical segment, we added Tim McFadden, EVP of Sales and Marketing. And most recently, in the Medical segment, Lisa Ashby, who has successfully run our Lab business for several years, was promoted to President of Category Management. We did all of this while successfully managing the CareFusion transition, and this was no small feat.
Let me discuss our guidance for fiscal 2011. Jeff will cover our specific assumptions in some detail in a moment. As you know, we provided a preliminary outlook for our fiscal 2011 three months ago when we announced third quarter results. Since that time, we have finalized our budget, and we've been able to get more clarity on several key variables, like the availability of raw material for our Nuclear Pharmacy unit. Of course, one of the variables, which is hard to model is the rate of recovery of the U.S. economy. Although, over the years, healthcare has been relatively insulated from fluctuations in the economy, it is not immune. We've seen consumers alter their behavior regarding their own healthcare consumption, based on their personal economic and employment status. So although, we projected a relatively modest low single-digit growth rate on the revenue side, we do feel that we've come out of fiscal 2010 with some momentum. 
In the Pharmaceutical segment, we entered 2011 with relative stability, and our customer base for many of our strategic initiatives are beginning to take hold, and with pharmaceutical supply agreements on terms, which we feel are right for us and for our business partners. We feel some momentum in our retail independent pharmacy channel and with our generic programs across all customer segments. And in FY '11, we'll continue to focus on increasing generic penetration. Additionally, we'll more effectively utilize all the tools in our tool chest, including the expertise and resources we have in our Pharmacy Solutions business, to improve the customer experience and provide incremental value. And while we're not expecting the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions to have a big economic impact on fiscal 2011, we're very excited about the new platform it gives us in Specialty Pharmaceutical Services.
In the Medical segment, we expect that our new focus on Category Management will enable accelerated growth of our preferred products and private brand program, enhance our ability to provide additional value to our customers and offer potential for margin enhancement. We'll continue to invest in our Medical segment transformation and drive our timelines aggressively, because it's essential to our repositioning in the industry and to delivering on our commitment to our customers. We'll also focus on the Ambulatory channels as we continue to see Healthcare Services move to smaller and more disease-specific units of care. We'll remain an active partner with all players in the system as we help to improve the cost-effectiveness of healthcare, and we'll make sure that our voice is heard in Washington and at the state level as healthcare reform enters the implementation phase.
We'll also continue to look for opportunities to complement our capabilities and grow our strategic position. And finally, we will hold ourselves to ambitious goals on those things we control, while modeling more cautiously on those events we don't control. 
So taking into account all of the non-factors at this point and balancing this with some remaining market uncertainty, we are raising our initial outlook in providing an FY '11 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $2.38 to $2.48. 
We are building momentum and feel good about our progress. As we move through the year, we'll talk about our initiatives on this quarterly calls, and I'll also be sure to comment on the environmental factors that are important for you to understand. I'm very proud of the work that we began in FY '10, and look forward to continued progress in FY '11 and beyond. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Jeff to provide more details in the quarter and the full year and our fiscal 2011 guidance assumptions. Jeff?"

Let me expand in our Q4 and fiscal 2010 performance for a few moments. And then I'll add more color around our FY '11 guidance, including our assumptions in both the corporate and segment standpoint.
Revenue or P&L numbers that are in our earnings release and slide presentation. I'll try to focus more on some of the underlying financial trends and drivers. Let me start with a few comments on segment performance in Q4, referring primarily to Slides 10 and 11 and starting with the Pharma segment. As George said, we are pleased with the business progress and financial results in Pharma. Otherwise, we alluded to back in our April call, the year-on-year segment profit trend is a bit of an anomaly in Q4 due to some timing and other unique issues. More on those in a few moments. 
Pharma segment revenue increased by 0.2%, with non-bulk growing considerably faster than bulk. For the quarter, non-bulk sales rose to 52% of total segment revenues. As previously mentioned on earlier calls, the ending of a relationship with two customers in the first half of fiscal '10 has dampened sales growth throughout the second half of the year. The impact from those two terminations was approximately 1.5 percentage points in Q4. We will began to lap these losses by mid-fiscal 2011. 
Importantly, revenues from retail independents grew 3.3%, a rate which was about the overall market. And overall generics growth was 10%, driven by close to 20% growth in our generic source program for the quarter. From a profit perspective, the segment decline can be attributed to a few expected but somewhat notable factors beyond the drivers and trends we would normally see. As anticipated, we did not see the same level of branded price inflation from our remaining contingent vendors as we experienced in Q4 of FY '09. We continue to face headwinds from Medicine Shoppe transition and the timing impact of a large-vendor DSA transition. Both of which flowed through as anticipated and are worth about $20 million of downside in total for the quarter.
The ongoing severe global supply shortage in our Nuclear business also had a significant negative impact. In fact, the loss of moly isotope availability for much of the quarter was, by itself, worth about $28 million. Although, we were able to offset a portion of this in our Nuclear Pharmacy unit, through the use of alternative imaging isotopes and cost efficiencies. On a positive side, we contained the benefit from the strong performance of our generic programs.
Our Medical segment had another strong quarter, posting a segment profit increase of 22% to $102.5 million. This increase was driven by volume growth with existing customers and solid expense management. We also had a few notable items in our cost of goods sold, which worked in opposite directions. A one-time vendor adjustment, which negatively impacted last year's Q4 by about $5 million, and that's benefited the year-on-year compare by that amount. And that negative impact of commodities worth a little less than $5 million of downside in the quarter versus last year. I pointed out the commodity downside as it represents the distinct reversal from the benefit we are seeing in the first half of the year.
Let me now cover a few items at the consolidated level. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat for the quarter versus last year, with strong expense controls and bad debt accrual reductions offsetting an increase in investment spend and incentive compensation. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 32.6% last year. The higher rate in the current quarter was attributable to changes in income mix and some discreet items both this year and last. Specifically, this quarter's discreet items include adjustments to our FIN 48 reserves, a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to our business in Puerto Rico and a provision true-up related to our state tax returns. The net of discreet items was worth about $4 million of additional tax expense for the quarter. In FY '09, our effective tax rate benefited from a one-time state tax settlement. 
So with those comments behind us, let me reprise the EPS walkdown that I did for you in April, where I tried to explain the drivers of our year-over-year decline in Q4. I'll use most of the same categories I referred to then. Where appropriate, I'll indicate where they may differ from what we had anticipated three months ago. But in most cases, they are quite consistent. The Medicine Shoppe and the Pharma vendor DSA transitions were, together, worth $0.03 of downside. A decline in other contingent brand inflation was worth $0.04. 
Generic launches turn out to have about a neutral impact year-on-year in the quarter, slightly better than the expected $0.01 to $0.02 of downside we had called out previously. The impact of the nuclear supply shortage was as much as $0.04, a little higher than the $0.02 to $0.03 impact we envisioned, really because our supply situation was made even worse by certain air travel restrictions from Europe during the quarter.
The Q4 tax rate resulted in $0.04 of impact compared to last year's unusually low rate, an increased investment spend and was worth about $0.02. Generally speaking, the rest of the business performed better than forecast, and our expense controls remained very tight. So we are able to deliver a final Q4 EPS slightly above the range we have projected in April. Lots of detail, I know. But hopefully, that closes the loop on what was a somewhat unusual Q4 from an earnings standpoint. Now shifting gears slightly, let's talk about cash and balance sheet management.
Earnings and continued focus on working capital efficiency drove an additional $324 million of operating cash flow in Q4. Of note, we finished Q4 with 21 days in inventory on hand versus 23 last year. I might add that this level of inventory is a little lower than even we have expected, and probably represents a pull-ahead of some operating cash flow from Q1 of FY '11. Our days receivable improved to 18.6 from 19.1. And importantly, our account delinquencies reduced by more than $75 million year-on-year, despite a continuing tough climate for many of our customers.
I'd also like to mention a few other items of note that occurred during the quarter. With the Q4 sale of our Martindale business in the U.K., along with the earlier divestitures of Specialty Scripts, we completed the portfolio rationalization activity that we have projected for this fiscal year. We did not sell any of our CareFusion stake in Q4. 
And finally, I won't go through the detailed GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation that appears on Slide 7. I will highlight that the most notable item this quarter is approximately $41 million pretax of litigation income related to an antitrust settlement. As per our usual practice, this type of item has been excluded from our non-GAAP earnings.
Now let me take a few moments to comment on FY '10 in total, starting with the personal reflection that I'm extremely proud of the progress we made during the year, particularly given some of the headwinds, both environmental and the result of some conscious positioning and investment decisions that we knew we'd face when the year began. For the start of the this year, we identified a few key financial metrics in which we needed to focus to win, specifically, margin and working capital improvements. Driven by a number of performance initiatives that George have already referenced, we've made great progress in these areas. 
First, on margin rates. Although, we did see a decline in overall consolidated operating margin versus last year, we performed considerably better than we expected heading into 2010. Let me comment on two key areas in this regard. First, our Medical segment expanded its segment profit margin by 17 basis points for the full year. Contributors to this was a mix impact of the relative growth of our Ambulatory, Canadian and Lab businesses, the recovery of the Presource kitting operations and a continued growth of our preferred products. We also benefited from the positive impact of commodity prices, although, that benefit was primarily limited to the first half of the year. 
Within the Pharma segment, although, segment profit margin was down by 6 basis points, this really was driven by our Bulk business. In fact, Non-Bulk Pharma profit margins remained relatively flat for the full year at 1.94% for FY '10 versus last year's 1.95%.
Regarding working capital, I view this as a tremendous success as we've continued to see the hard work of our employees bear fruit. In every quarter of the year, our inventory levels and days receivable were favorable to FY '09. In fact, changes in net working capital contributed almost $1 billion to operating cash flow for the year. 
Overall, we finished the year with very strong cash flow and a robust balance sheet. Total operating cash flow for the full year was over $2.1 billion. In addition, we sold $271 million of CareFusion shares during the year and generated over $150 million incremental from other asset divestitures. A good portion of this cash flow was invested back in the business as we had capital expenditures of about $260 million, mostly in information-technology-related projects. And we committed to our acquisition of Healthcare Solutions, for which we made a payment of $517 million in July. 
We also returned cash of over $500 million to shareholders, reflecting dividends of $253 million and share repurchases totaling $250 million, including the $200 million we executed in June. By the way, in case you're wondering why our statement of cash flows was $230 million of share repo for the year is because $20 million of it actually is settled after June month end. Our total cash position was about $2.8 billion at year end, of which approximately $400 million is held overseas. Further, our CareFusion stake was valued at approximately $700 million as of June 30.
We remain committed to monetizing the stake in the coming periods, although the specific timing will depend on market conditions and other factors. Our June 30 long-term debt position was $2.1 billion, which is effectively our target level at this time. So we entered fiscal 2011 with a fair degree of balance sheet flexibility. We intend to use it wisely in a balanced and prudent manner to maximize shareholder value for the longer term. 
Now let's turn to Slides 13 to 16 and a look at our FY '11 guidance. Now that we've completed our planning processes and have better visibility into the year, we're updating the preliminary outlook we shared three months ago. As background for our revised non-GAAP EPS range of $2.38 to $2.48, let me expand on some of the information that we have provided back in April, starting with overall company expectations. 
The revenue expectation is for low single-digit growth on a consolidated basis, reflecting our somewhat cautious view of the overall market dynamics. Our focus on expense management will continue. Organic operating expense will be close to flat for the year, but the addition of our Healthcare Solutions business and its expenses related to both the amortization of intangibles and the cost of its primarily customer-focused resources will boost the SG&A growth rate moderately.
We are expecting an annual non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 37%, a little lower than FY '10, although it will no doubt fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding should be in a range of 355 million to 357 million, reflecting total FY '11 share repurchases, which we currently anticipate will approximate our FY '10 levels. In this regard, you should note that we did execute $150 million of repo in July, leaving us $100 million left on our outstanding board authorization.
As you know, the actual diluted shares outstanding we will average for FY '11 will depend on a few factors, including the timing and size of completing any additional repurchases and the impact of share price on the dilutive impact of employee stock options. Finally, our guidance includes no new significant strategic initiatives, either acquisitions or divestitures, beyond our Healthcare Solutions acquisition.
Now let's spend a few minutes going through some of the segment-specific functions in more detail. On Slide 17, you can see the Pharmaceutical segment assumptions. Let me hit on a few highlights. Importantly, our FY '11 guidance assumes the renewal of key customer contracts. We expect the rate of brand inflation to be similar to FY '10. We also expect neutral earnings effect from the generic launches versus FY '10. We have risk-adjusted a basket of potential at-risk launches in FY '11 to come up with our forecast. We do expect continued benefit from our generic sales and sourcing programs, which gained momentum last year. In our Nuclear business, we expect Moly [Molybdenum-99] supply levels to stabilize by the end of Q1. In this respect, let me comment briefly on the latest news of Canada.
Repairs for the Chalk River reactor are complete. However, the reactor has experienced some temporary delays in the start-up process related to instrumentation. We understand that this is being sorted out in the next couple of weeks. But at this point, we believe our assumptions for the resumption of normal supply remain reasonable, and we will keep our unrelenting focus on lean operational excellence initiatives to improve supply-chain efficiency and working capital. However, I anticipate improvements in net working capital at this stage to be much less than what we experienced in FY '10, particularly given the quite low inventory levels we achieved at June end.
Now let's take a look at Slide 16 and the Medical segment. We do anticipate a negative impact on cost of goods sold from commodity price movements. For the full year, we currently estimate that it could be more than $40 million. About half of this relates to oil price movements, with the remainder driven by latex and other commodities, most of which have experienced some pretty significant price increases in the recent past. We expect to benefit from both customer and product mix shifts, including the growth of our higher-margin Ambulatory Care business and increased sales of preferred products.
We do not anticipate the extraordinary demand from our pandemic flu season as we saw in the first half of fiscal '10. Our transformational initiative expense will continue at a similar level to FY '10 as we continue to position our Medical segment for long-term growth. 
Lastly, I did want to touch specifically on Medical's Q1 as it is a somewhat unusual quarter from an earnings trend standpoint. We do expect a significant first quarter segment profit decline due to a tough compare related to unique fiscal '10 Q1 events, namely the early extreme flu season and $14 million of income recognition accelerated by the CareFusion spin, as well as a year-on-year negative impact of commodity prices.
So in summary, as I look forward towards the remainder of fiscal 2011, I'm confident of our ability to execute in our priorities and continue the momentum we began in 2010. There are clearly still uncertainties related to items largely outside of our control, such as the impact of the economy on healthcare consumer behaviors and the ongoing movement of commodity prices. But I feel very positive about our organization's ability to respond and deliver as the year unfolds. Let me make one final administrative comment before we turn to questions. 
In a further effort to make our SEC filings more user-friendly, we've undertaken a review to streamline our reporting. With input from a number of sources, we made an effort to make the upcoming 10-K a little more reader-friendly. Hopefully, you noticed the difference. We've also decided that to be meaningful going forward to report Pharma bulk and non-bulk margins on an annual basis rather than quarterly. If there are unusual or significant trends, we will clearly call those out to you. But periodic fluctuations have rendered these metrics fairly volatile on a quarterly basis and not necessarily representative of longer-term trends. We believe that the annualized rate is more indicative of the company's progress. We'll begin the annualized reporting process in fiscal '11. 
With that, let me turn over to our operator to begin the Q&A session."

We're thinking about a revenue standpoint, revenue growth will be a little bit more back-end loaded. As a reminder, as I said earlier, we're still lapping the termination of two large customers that occurred in Q1 and Q2 of FY '10, so that will tend to slightly depress our revenue growth below market rates in the first half of the year. And also in the second half of the year, we're expecting at least one additional customer to join us, and we'll also begin to see some of the revenue impact of our Healthcare Solutions acquisition as well. So our thinking about a revenue standpoint, again, those factors will tend to make the back end a little bit more revenue-intensive than the first half.

Let me jump in for a second on this, and this is actually not necessarily the case. I think it varies product by product, and so particularly when there are exclusive launches, you have to look at the market characteristics of those launches. So for example, there's just been an approval recently well known out there of LOVENOX. This is a drug with really unusual characteristics. It is a compound with heavy institutional presence, but also a meaningful retail presence. A single-source launch, particularly because it has such a large institutional presence. The competitive behavior between the branded and the generic is quite different. And again, in this case, because there is one generic approval, you're very dependent on the design of any company's plans for how to launch that product, their own launch strategy. So I guess what I'd suggest to you is the economics of single-source launch can actually be quite variable depending on the characteristics of that drug, its channel, the nature of the launch, how much supply is in the system and the innovative response. So I know that's a long answer. But I would just say exercise some caution on assumptions on single-source launches. They can vary quite dramatically. I think when you get into a two- or three-player launch, actually, the characteristics can change and tend to be more favorable. But again, my advice would be exercise caution, and the general sense of Jeff's observations are right on a year-over-year basis. I would say relatively comparable and, Lisa, of course, the part that we don't know exactly is what will happen on some of the at-risk launches. So our approach is to model with a risk adjustment and then about those, well, we've modeled too cautiously, but I think it's the right way to approach this."

We had the CareFusion revenue recognition, and I would say the flu, although not a dramatic impact on us, clearly was unusual last year.

Growth in Nuclear, we are hopeful and at this point, confident that we'll get some material back into normal status and be able to work at a more traditional way with our customers. We're really looking forward to that moment. Growth and performance really across all of our businesses, frankly, a good progress.

We more than offset those in FY '10 to our infrastructure cost-reduction efforts, so they really didn't appear anywhere in FY '10. You probably know it but I didn't call them out as a driver at any point in the year because we were able to more than offset them to reducing infrastructure in the remaining Cardinal business. In FY '11, I'd say, likewise. You'll see a relatively minimal impact, if any, from that. To begin, we've been able to hold and reduced costs related to our infrastructure. I would say, the final potential period there is FY '12 because that is when the final IP transition services agreement is expected to expire. Actually, it expires in the summer, at the start of FY '12. So there is a slight potential there for some fixed cost overhang in the Cardinal Health business, but again our goal is to work to offset most or all of that. So my objective is that I will never call that out as a negative driver year-on-year, because we're striving to offset it. So I would say -- long answer to your question but I would say the progress has been great in terms of making sure those will materialized.

This morning's call offers me the opportunity to reflect on our first year, as what I'll describe for the last time, as the new Cardinal Health. It has been an important year for us in many ways, and this morning, I'",2404,"Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone. This morning's call offers me the opportunity to reflect on our first year, as what I'll describe for the last time, as the new Cardinal Health. It has been an important year for us in many ways, and this morning, I'll give you my observations about the year we just completed as well as my perspective on the year in front of us. I'll devote most of my commentary to the state of our transformation and our overall positioning, and let Jeff cover in detail, the numbers for the quarter and for the full year.
I will, however, start with a few numbers. We ended fiscal 2010 with non-GAAP EPS of $2.22, down slightly versus fiscal 2009 and considerably better than we anticipated back in August of last year. Full year revenue was up 3% to $98.5 billion. Our organization did an outstanding job managing our working capital, and we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations. Overall, these were significant accomplishment, given the considerable strategic changes and investments we made on the business.
Some of you have asked me during the course of the year, how I feel about the extent and rate of our progress. As you know, we entered the fiscal year with a commitment to take action to improve our performance, our strategic positioning, our internal culture to shift our center of gravity more decisively out to the customer and, of course, our trajectory. 
We also knew there were some systemic issues that we would have to weather, some mechanical challenges like the large year-over-year negative comp in generic launches. Having said all that, if you'd ask me a year ago, whether or not I'd be pleased with where we are today, the answer would clearly be yes. We've made enormous progress on our road to position the company for renewed growth, and we've moved the needle considerably faster than we had anticipated. This is still a journey, but I believe we have a lot to be excited about.
Certainly, it was not a year of perfection. We hate to lose a single customer and we lost very few. But in the earlier part of the year, we did fail to renew a few key customers on the Hospital side, as well as one on the Retail Chain side, and that was disappointing. We stabilized our margin rate in Hospital Supply, however, would have liked to have seen it moving up. And while we made enormous progress in our efforts to simplify the lives of our customers, we know we can do even better. Nonetheless, our customers are telling us that we're on the right path. Our employees are telling us that as well, that they believe in where we're going and are energized by the journey.
As we told you at the beginning of the fiscal year, our focus in FY '10 was on strengthening the core of our business, and we have done just that. In our Pharmaceutical segment, we renewed many of our largest chain customer contracts well into fiscal 2012. We also renewed and entered into new agreements with a number of very important large branded manufacturer partners. All of this is critical to stabilizing our Pharmaceutical segment base and putting us in a position to move margin in the right direction.
Pharmaceutical segment profit declined 3% for the full year. This performance was considerably better than we anticipated, driven by strong execution on key initiatives, some of which I'll cover in a moment, disciplined cost management and aided somewhat by the positive impact from some unplanned generic launches. We've placed a great deal of emphasis on our retail independent pharmacy channel, and after a patchy couple of years, we return this part of the business to full year growth for the first time, since fiscal 2008.
Just a couple of weeks ago, we held our 20th annual and largest ever Retail Business Conference for our retail independent pharmacy customers. Well over 4,000 stores were represented at the event in Denver. We launched a number of offerings designed to help pharmacists run their businesses more efficiently, including Order Express, which provides retail pharmacies with a more convenient and user-friendly online buying experience. Feedback from customers has been very positive. 
We made great strides in our generic sourcing initiative, and we developed a highly attractive generic offering for our customers. As a result, we exceeded our full year improvement target of 10% in generic penetration or what we refer to as share of wallet. And our focus on driving sales force effectiveness through initiatives like our Sales College has provided us with additional traction and speed. We recognize that our sales reps are crucial to delivering an even higher level of service to our customers, and we continue to invest in their ongoing training and skill development.
We also reevaluated our Pharmaceutical segment portfolio and made a number of key decisions. We felt that the Medicine Shoppe network could be enhanced by providing an alternative model for our franchisees that moves them from a royalty-centric model to a more flexible fee-based model. We decided to divest Specialty Scripts and Martindale, and we made a meaningful move into the fast-growing area of Specialty Pharmaceutical Services. As we discussed previously, our goal was to enter the Specialty Service area in a differentiated way, and we're convinced that the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions or P4, as it is known in the oncology community, provides us with that platform.
The commercial activities within Healthcare Solutions serve key participants across the chain of specialty care, including physicians, pharmaceutical companies and payers, by providing essential tools, services and data to help improve patient outcome and increase efficiency in the delivery of healthcare. While this acquisition will have only a modest impact on FY '11, it positions us to participate in the growth of specialty category going forward. We're very excited about the growth potential in specialty and about the enthusiasm of the Healthcare Solutions' leadership team to help us achieve our goals in this area, and also, about how they're working with us to integrate these activities into Cardinal Health. We expect the integration to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of FY '11.
We also made investments in our relatively small but growing positron emission tomography unit, and are well-positioned through the manufacturing, dispensing and distribution of PET imaging agents and a key role we play in supporting clinical trials. And in the space of exceedingly difficult raw material shortages, our Nuclear Pharmacy organization performed extremely well in FY '10.  I'm very proud of this group and how they work so closely with our customers to ensure the needs of patients were met. We're looking forward to return to more normalized levels of supply in the September timeframe from both the Chalk River reactor in Canada and the Petten reactor in the Netherlands.
Our Medical segment had a busy and successful year. We finished the fourth quarter of 22% over prior year in segment profit and up 11% for the year. Additionally, we achieved a number of key goals and moved forward with several important transformational initiatives. We developed our segment strategy around channel and category management, which we believe, will better align with our customers' need and enhance our ability to apply our core capabilities. And we completely rebuilt our sourcing model for medical products, expanding our global sourcing capabilities and our leadership there. I believe this will be an increasingly important asset for us and for our customers.
We made good progress on our substantial commitment to simplifying the customer experience and made critical investments in IT and customer-facing activities. In particular, we began the Medical Business Transformation work to enhance our technology platform and processes, and we are progressing well against our critical milestones. We returned our Presource kitting unit back to positive growth trajectory, enabled by our Lean Six Sigma and operational excellence initiative and our expanded presence in surgery centers. 
We made investments focused on growing our Ambulatory footprint and we expanded our sales organization, while at the same time, enhancing our Web ordering capabilities to better meet the needs of this channel. We also established a cross-selling effort with the Pharmaceutical segment, which is off to a good start. 
Our lab channel grew both revenue and profit by mid-single digits for the year, helped by demand for flu-related products in the first half. And Canada had an exceptional year, with double-digit revenue and profit growth, also helped by the demand for flu-related products, along with some upside from foreign exchange. In all, Medical segment revenue was up 3% in the quarter and up 7.2% for the full year. 
I should say something here about demand, as a number of companies have noted the softness in the hospital and physician office channels. We commented in last quarter's call that demand was somewhat soft there, and we can report that we saw no real improvement from a macro standpoint in our June quarter.
At the Cardinal Health enterprise level, in addition to our effort to strengthen our strategic positioning, drive performance management and revitalize our culture, I'm particularly proud of how we manage our capital in an extraordinary environment. During this past year, we were able to raise our dividend as well as do some share repurchases, as Jeff will discuss. We've invested in areas of our business critical to supporting our customers and driving future positioning, and we've used capital opportunistically to make moves that enhance our strategic positioning and shareholder value. We entered 2011 with a very strong balance sheet, which gives us excellent financial flexibility.
In keeping with our commitment to drive shareholder value, we've launched total shareholder return, or TSR, internally as a capstone metric for measuring our performance. And I'm really pleased that our organization is rallying around this concept. We've been setting internal goals around this metric, and I'm sure you'll hear us reference it in the future. 
Following the spin off, we took the opportunity to recruit four outstanding new independent board members, with exceptional healthcare and consumer background. These individuals have been terrific additions to our Board of Directors. Additionally, we bolstered our management team with several important additions. At the corporate level, we added Mark Blake, EVP of Strategy and Corporate Development; Patty Morrison, CIO; and Gilberto Quintero, Senior Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Compliance. In the Pharmaceutical segment, we added Tim McFadden, EVP of Sales and Marketing. And most recently, in the Medical segment, Lisa Ashby, who has successfully run our Lab business for several years, was promoted to President of Category Management. We did all of this while successfully managing the CareFusion's transition, and this was no small feat.
Let me discuss our guidance for fiscal 2011. Jeff will cover our specific assumptions in some detail in a moment. As you know, we provided a preliminary outlook for our fiscal 2011 three months ago when we announced third [ph] quarter results. Since that time, we have finalized our budget, and we've been able to get more clarity on several key variables, like the availability of raw material for our Nuclear Pharmacy unit. Of course, one of the variables, which is hard to model is the rate of recovery of the U.S. economy. Although, over the years, healthcare has been relatively insulated from fluctuations in the economy, it is not immune. We've seen consumers alter their behavior regarding their own healthcare consumption, based on their personal economic and employment status. So although, we projected a relatively modest low single-digit growth rate on the revenue side, we do feel that we've come out of fiscal 2010 with some momentum. 
In the Pharmaceutical segment, we entered 2011 with relative stability in our customer base where many of our strategic initiatives are beginning to take hold, and with pharmaceutical supply agreements on terms, which we feel are right for us and for our business partners. We feel some momentum in our retail independent pharmacy channel and with our generic programs across all customer segments. And in FY '11, we'll continue to focus on increasing generic penetration. Additionally, we'll more effectively utilize all the tools in our tool chest, including the expertise and resources we have in our Pharmacy Solutions business, to improve the customer experience and provide incremental value. And while we're not expecting the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions to have a big economic impact on fiscal 2011, we're very excited about the new platform it gives us in Specialty Pharmaceutical Services.
In the Medical segment, we expect that our new focus on Category Management will enable accelerated growth of our preferred products and private brand program, enhance our ability to provide additional value to our customers and offer potential for margin enhancement. We'll continue to invest in our Medical segment transformation and drive our timelines aggressively, because it's essential to our repositioning in the industry and to delivering on our commitment to our customers. We'll also focus on the Ambulatory channels as we continue to see Healthcare Services move to smaller and more disease-specific units of care. We'll remain an active partner with all players in the system as we help to improve the cost-effectiveness of healthcare, and we'll make sure that our voice is heard in Washington and at the state level as healthcare reform enters the implementation phase.
We'll also continue to look for opportunities to complement our capabilities and grow our strategic position. And finally, we will hold ourselves to ambitious goals on those things we control, while modeling more cautiously on those events we don't control. 
So taking into account all of the non-factors at this point and balancing this with some remaining market uncertainty, we are raising our initial outlook in providing an FY '11 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $2.38 to $2.48. 
We are building momentum and feel good about our progress. As we move through the year, we'll talk about our initiatives on this quarterly calls, and I'll also be sure to comment on the environmental factors that are important for you to understand. I'm very proud of the work that we began in FY '10, and look forward to continued progress in FY '11 and beyond. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Jeff to provide more details in the quarter and the full year and our fiscal 2011 guidance assumptions. Jeff?"

Let me expand in our Q4 and fiscal 2010 performance for a few moments. And then I'll add more color around our FY '11 guidance, including our assumptions in both the corporate and segment standpoint.
Revenue or P&L numbers that are in our earnings release and slide presentation. I'll try to focus more on some of the underlying financial trends and drivers. Let me start with a few comments on segment performance in Q4, referring primarily to Slides 10 and 11 and starting with the Pharma segment. As George said, we are pleased with the business progress and financial results in Pharma. Otherwise, we alluded to back in our April call, the year-on-year segment profit trend is a bit of an anomaly in Q4 due to some timing and other unique issues. More on those in a few moments. 
Pharma segment revenue increased by 0.2%, with non-bulk growing considerably faster than bulk. For the quarter, non-bulk sales rose to 52% of total segment revenues. As previously mentioned on earlier calls, the ending of a relationship with two customers in the first half of fiscal '10 has dampened sales growth throughout the second half of the year. The impact from those two terminations was approximately 1.5 percentage points in Q4. We will began to lap these losses by mid-fiscal 2011. 
Importantly, revenues from retail independents grew 3.3%, a rate which was about the overall market. And overall generics growth was 10%, driven by close to 20% growth in our generic source program for the quarter. From a profit perspective, the segment decline can be attributed to a few expected but somewhat notable factors beyond the drivers and trends we would normally see. As anticipated, we did not see the same level of branded price inflation from our remaining contingent vendors as we experienced in Q4 of FY '09. We continue to face headwinds from Medicine Shoppe transition and the timing impact of a large-vendor DSA transition. Both of which flowed through as anticipated and are worth about $20 million of downside in total for the quarter.
The ongoing severe global supply shortage in our Nuclear business also had a significant negative impact. In fact, the loss of moly isotope availability for much of the quarter was, by itself, worth about $28 million. Although, we were able to offset a portion of this in our Nuclear Pharmacy unit, through the use of alternative imaging isotopes and cost efficiencies. On a positive side, we contained the benefit from the strong performance of our generic programs.
Our Medical segment had another strong quarter, posting a segment profit increase of 22% to $102.5 million. This increase was driven by volume growth with existing customers and solid expense management. We also had a few notable items in our cost of goods sold, which worked in opposite directions. A one-time vendor adjustment, which negatively impacted last year's Q4 by about $5 million, and that's benefited the year-on-year compare by that amount. And that negative impact of commodities worth a little less than $5 million of downside in the quarter versus last year. I pointed out the commodity downside as it represents the distinct reversal from the benefit we are seeing in the first half of the year.
Let me now cover a few items at the consolidated level. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat for the quarter versus last year, with strong expense controls and bad debt accrual reductions offsetting an increase in investment spend and incentive compensation. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 32.6% last year. The higher rate in the current quarter was attributable to changes in income mix and some discreet items both this year and last. Specifically, this quarter's discreet items include adjustments to our FIN 48 reserves, a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to our business in Puerto Rico and a provision true-up related to our state tax returns. The net of discreet items was worth about $4 million of additional tax expense for the quarter. In FY '09, our effective tax rate benefited from a one-time state tax settlement. 
So with those comments behind us, let me reprise the EPS walkdown that I did for you in April, where I tried to explain the drivers of our year-over-year decline in Q4. I'll use most of the same categories I referred to then. Where appropriate, I'll indicate where they may differ from what we had anticipated three months ago. But in most cases, they are quite consistent. The Medicine Shoppe and the Pharma vendor DSA transitions were, together, worth $0.03 of downside. A decline in other contingent brand inflation was worth $0.04. 
Generic launches turn out to have about a neutral impact year-on-year in the quarter, slightly better than the expected $0.01 to $0.02 of downside we had called out previously. The impact of the nuclear supply shortage was as much as $0.04, a little higher than the $0.02 to $0.03 impact we envisioned, really because our supply situation was made even worse by certain air travel restrictions from Europe during the quarter.
The Q4 tax rate resulted in $0.04 of impact compared to last year's unusually low rate, an increased investment spend and was worth about $0.02. Generally speaking, the rest of the business performed better than forecast, and our expense controls remained very tight. So we are able to deliver a final Q4 EPS slightly above the range we have projected in April. Lots of detail, I know. But hopefully, that closes the loop on what was a somewhat unusual Q4 from an earnings standpoint. Now shifting gears slightly, let's talk about cash and balance sheet management.
Earnings and continued focus on working capital efficiency drove an additional $324 million of operating cash flow in Q4. Of note, we finished Q4 with 21 days in inventory on hand versus 23 last year. I might add that this level of inventory is a little lower than even we have expected, and probably represents a pull-ahead of some operating cash flow from Q1 of FY '11. Our days receivable improved to 18.6 from 19.1. And importantly, our account delinquencies reduced by more than $75 million year-on-year, despite a continuing tough climate for many of our customers.
I'd also like to mention a few other items of note that occurred during the quarter. With the Q4 sale of our Martindale business in the U.K., along with the earlier divestitures of Specialty Scripts, we completed the portfolio rationalization activity that we have projected for this fiscal year. We did not sell any of our CareFusion stake in Q4. 
And finally, I won't go through the detailed GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation that appears on Slide 7. I will highlight that the most notable item this quarter is approximately $41 million pretax of litigation income related to an antitrust settlement. As per our usual practice, this type of item has been excluded from our non-GAAP earnings.
Now let me take a few moments to comment on FY '10 in total, starting with the personal reflection that I'm extremely proud of the progress we made during the year, particularly given some of the headwinds, both environmental and the result of some conscious positioning and investment decisions that we knew we'd face when the year began. For the start of the this year, we identified a few key financial metrics in which we needed to focus to win, specifically, margin and working capital improvements. Driven by a number of performance initiatives that George have already referenced, we've made great progress in these areas. 
First, on margin rates. Although, we did see a decline in overall consolidated operating margin versus last year, we performed considerably better than we expected heading into 2010. Let me comment on two key areas in this regard. First, our Medical segment expanded its segment profit margin by 17 basis points for the full year. Contributors to this was a mix impact of the relative growth of our Ambulatory, Canadian and Lab businesses, the recovery of the Presource kitting operations and a continued growth of our preferred products. We also benefited from the positive impact of commodity prices, although, that benefit was primarily limited to the first half of the year. 
Within the Pharma segment, although, segment profit margin was down by 6 basis points, this really was driven by our Bulk business. In fact, Non-Bulk Pharma profit margins remained relatively flat for the full year at 1.94% for FY '10 versus last year's 1.95%.
Regarding working capital, I view this as a tremendous success as we've continued to see the hard work of our employees bear fruit. In every quarter of the year, our inventory levels and days receivable were favorable to FY '09. In fact, changes in net working capital contributed almost $1 billion to operating cash flow for the year. 
Overall, we finished the year with very strong cash flow and a robust balance sheet. Total operating cash flow for the full year was over $2.1 billion. In addition, we sold $271 million of CareFusion shares during the year and generated over $150 million incremental from other asset divestitures. A good portion of this cash flow was invested back in the business as we had capital expenditures of about $260 million, mostly in information-technology-related projects. And we committed to our acquisition of Healthcare Solutions, for which we made a payment of $517 million in July. 
We also returned cash of over $500 million to shareholders, reflecting dividends of $253 million and share repurchases totaling $250 million, including the $200 million we executed in June. By the way, in case you're wondering why our statement of cash flows was $230 million of share repo for the year is because $20 million of it actually is settled after June month end. Our total cash position was about $2.8 billion at year end, of which approximately $400 million is held overseas. Further, our CareFusion stake was valued at approximately $700 million as of June 30.
We remain committed to monetizing the stake in the coming periods, although the specific timing will depend on market conditions and other factors. Our June 30 long-term debt position was $2.1 billion, which is effectively our target level at this time. So we entered fiscal 2011 with a fair degree of balance sheet flexibility. We intend to use it wisely in a balanced and prudent manner to maximize shareholder value for the longer term. 
Now let's turn to Slides 13 to 16 and a look at our FY '11 guidance. Now that we've completed our planning processes and have better visibility into the year, we're updating the preliminary outlook we shared three months ago. As background for our revised non-GAAP EPS range of $2.38 to $2.48, let me expand on some of the information that we have provided back in April, starting with overall company expectations. 
The revenue expectation is for low single-digit growth on a consolidated basis, reflecting our somewhat cautious view of the overall market dynamics. Our focus on expense management will continue. Organic operating expense will be close to flat for the year, but the addition of our Healthcare Solutions business and its expenses related to both the amortization of intangibles and the cost of its primarily customer-focused resources will boost the SG&A growth rate moderately.
We are expecting an annual non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 37%, a little lower than FY '10, although it will no doubt fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding should be in a range of 355 million to 357 million, reflecting total FY '11 share repurchases, which we currently anticipate will approximate our FY '10 levels. In this regard, you should note that we did execute $150 million of repo in July, leaving us $100 million left on our outstanding board authorization.
As you know, the actual diluted shares outstanding we will average for FY '11 will depend on a few factors, including the timing and size of completing any additional repurchases and the impact of share price on the dilutive impact of employee stock options. Finally, our guidance includes no new significant strategic initiatives, either acquisitions or divestitures, beyond our Healthcare Solutions acquisition.
Now let's spend a few minutes going through some of the segment-specific functions in more detail. On Slide 17, you can see the Pharmaceutical segment assumptions. Let me hit on a few highlights. Importantly, our FY '11 guidance assumes the renewal of key customer contracts. We expect the rate of brand inflation to be similar to FY '10. We also expect neutral earnings effect from the generic launches versus FY '10. We have risk-adjusted a basket of potential at-risk launches in FY '11 to come up with our forecast. We do expect continued benefit from our generic sales and sourcing programs, which gained momentum last year. In our Nuclear business, we expect Moly [Molybdenum-99] supply levels to stabilize by the end of Q1. In this respect, let me comment briefly on the latest news of Canada.
Repairs for the Chalk River reactor are complete. However, the reactor has experienced some temporary delays in the start-up process related to instrumentation. We understand that this is being sorted out in the next couple of weeks. But at this point, we believe our assumptions for the resumption of normal supply remain reasonable, and we will keep our unrelenting focus on lean operational excellence initiatives to improve supply-chain efficiency and working capital. However, I anticipate improvements in net working capital at this stage to be much less than what we experienced in FY '10, particularly given the quite low inventory levels we achieved at June end.
Now let's take a look at Slide 16 and the Medical segment. We do anticipate a negative impact on cost of goods sold from commodity price movements. For the full year, we currently estimate that it could be more than $40 million. About half of this relates to oil price movements, with the remainder driven by latex and other commodities, most of which have experienced some pretty significant price increases in the recent past. We expect to benefit from both customer and product mix shifts, including the growth of our higher-margin Ambulatory Care business and increased sales of preferred products.
We do not anticipate the extraordinary demand from our pandemic flu season as we saw in the first half of fiscal '10. Our transformational initiative expense will continue at a similar level to FY '10 as we continue to position our Medical segment for long-term growth. 
Lastly, I did want to touch specifically on Medical's Q1 as it is a somewhat unusual quarter from an earnings trend standpoint. We do expect a significant first quarter segment profit decline due to a tough compare related to unique fiscal '10 Q1 events, namely the early extreme flu season and $14 million of income recognition accelerated by the CareFusion spin, as well as a year-on-year negative impact of commodity prices.
So in summary, as I look forward towards the remainder of fiscal 2011, I'm confident of our ability to execute in our priorities and continue the momentum we began in 2010. There are clearly still uncertainties related to items largely outside of our control, such as the impact of the economy on healthcare consumer behaviors and the ongoing movement of commodity prices. But I feel very positive about our organization's ability to respond and deliver as the year unfolds. Let me make one final administrative comment before we turn to questions. 
In a further effort to make our SEC filings more user-friendly, we've undertaken a review to streamline our reporting. With input from a number of sources, we made an effort to make the upcoming 10-K a little more reader-friendly. Hopefully, you noticed the difference. We've also decided to be more meaningful going forward to report Pharma bulk and non-bulk margins on an annual basis rather than quarterly. If there are unusual or significant trends, we will clearly call those out to you. But periodic fluctuations have rendered these metrics fairly volatile on a quarterly basis and not necessarily representative of longer-term trends. We believe that the annualized rate is more indicative of the company's progress. We'll begin the annualized reporting process in fiscal '11. 
With that, let me turn over to our operator to begin the Q&A session."

We're thinking about a revenue standpoint, revenue growth will be a little bit more back-end loaded. As a reminder, as I said earlier, we're still lapping the termination of two large customers that occurred in Q1 and Q2 of FY '10, so that will tend to slightly depress our revenue growth below market rates in the first half of the year. And also in the second half of the year, we're expecting at least one additional customer to join us, and we'll also begin to see some of the revenue impact of our Healthcare Solutions acquisition as well. So our thinking about a revenue standpoint, again, those factors will tend to make the back end a little bit more revenue-intensive than the first half.

Let me jump in for a second on this, and this is actually not necessarily the case. I think it varies product by product, and so particularly when there are exclusive launches, you have to look at the market characteristics of those launches. So for example, there's just been an approval recently well known out there of LOVENOX. This is a drug with really unusual characteristics. It is a compound with heavy institutional presence, but also a meaningful retail presence. A single-source launch, particularly because it has such a large institutional presence. The competitive behavior between the branded and the generic is quite different. And again, in this case, because there is one generic approval, you're very dependent on the design of any company's plans for how to launch that product, their own launch strategy. So I guess what I'd suggest to you is the economics of single-source launch can actually be quite variable depending on the characteristics of that drug, its channel, the nature of the launch, how much supply is in the system and the innovative response. So I know that's a long answer. But I would just say exercise some caution on assumptions on single-source launches. They can vary quite dramatically. I think when you get into a two- or three-player launch, actually, the characteristics can change and tend to be more favorable. But again, my advice would be exercise caution, and the general sense of Jeff's observations are right on a year-over-year basis. I would say relatively comparable and, Lisa, of course, the part that we don't know exactly is what will happen on some of the at-risk launches. So our approach is to model with a risk adjustment and then if all goes well, we've modeled too cautiously, but I think it's the right way to approach this."

We had the CareFusion revenue recognition, and I would say the flu, although not a dramatic impact on us, clearly was unusual last year. And the positive sense for us, generic programs, I would say across the board on the selling and the sourcing side, really feeling encouraged there. Growth in Nuclear, we are hopeful and at this point, confident that we'll get some material back into normal status and be able to work at a more traditional way with our customers. We're really looking forward to that moment. Growth and performance really across all of our businesses, frankly, a good progress. And the Healthcare Solutions acquisition, I would say, is neutral to slightly positive. On a sort of generally neutral side, I would put year-over-year generic launches. Again, that can vary depending on what happens, particularly on at-risk launches or settlements. And then I would say from the spending standpoint, Med Trans [Medical Transformation] is probably a year-over-year neutral. It's probably no change. So those would be the big moving parts.

We more than offset those in FY '10 to our infrastructure cost-reduction efforts, so they really didn't appear anywhere in FY '10. You probably know it but I didn't call them out as a driver at any point in the year because we were able to more than offset them to reducing infrastructure in the remaining Cardinal business. In FY '11, I'd say, likewise. You'll see a relatively minimal impact, if any, from that. To begin, we've been able to hold and reduced costs related to our infrastructure. I would say, the final potential period there is FY '12 because that is when the final IP transition services agreement is expected to expire. Actually, it expires in the summer, at the start of FY '12. So there is a slight potential there for some fixed cost overhang in the Cardinal Health business, but again our goal is to work to offset most or all of that. So my objective is that I will never call that out as a negative driver year-on-year, because we're striving to offset it. So I would say -- long answer to your question but I would say the progress has been great in terms of making sure those will materialized. 
By the way, before you go out, I want to complete my answer to Larry, other couple of calls ago, related to the medical transformation, just so there's no lack of clarity. When I refer to the bolus of spend in fiscal '11, I was referring to capital expenditures, and this will be the highest year of our capital expenditures related to the medical transformation. But from an expense standpoint, actually, FY '11 versus FY '10 is completely neutral, just to be clear."

That all said, keep in mind that about 20% of our branded pharma income is still is contingent based.

This morning's call offers me the opportunity to reflect on our first year, as what I'll describe for the last time, as the new Cardinal Health. It has been an important year for us in many ways, and this morning, I'",2403,"Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone. This morning's call offers me the opportunity to reflect on our first year, as what I'll describe for the last time, as the new Cardinal Health. It has been an important year for us in many ways, and this morning, I'll give you my observations about the year we just completed as well as my perspective on the year in front of us. I'll devote most of my commentary to the state of our transformation and our overall positioning, and let Jeff cover in detail, the numbers for the quarter and for the full year.
I will, however, start with a few numbers. We ended fiscal 2010 with non-GAAP EPS of $2.22, down slightly versus fiscal 2009 and considerably better than we anticipated back in August of last year. Full year revenue was up 3% to $98.5 billion. Our organization did an outstanding job managing our working capital, and we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations. Overall, these were significant accomplishment, given the considerable strategic changes and investments we made on the business.
Some of you have asked me during the course of the year, how I feel about the extent and rate of our progress. As you know, we entered the fiscal year with a commitment to take action to improve our performance, our strategic positioning, our internal culture to shift our center of gravity more decisively out to the customer and, of course, our trajectory. 
We also knew there were some systemic issues that we would have to weather, some mechanical challenges like the large year-over-year negative comp in generic launches. Having said all that, if you'd ask me a year ago, whether or not I'd be pleased with where we are today, the answer would clearly be yes. We've made enormous progress on our road to position the company for renewed growth, and we've moved the needle considerably faster than we had anticipated. This is still a journey, but I believe we have a lot to be excited about.
Certainly, it was not a year of perfection. We hate to lose a single customer and we lost very few. But in the earlier part of the year, we did fail to renew a few key customers on the Hospital side, as well as one on the Retail Chain side, and that was disappointing. We stabilized our margin rate in Hospital Supply, however, would have liked to have seen it moving up. And while we made enormous progress in our efforts to simplify the lives of our customers, we know we can do even better. Nonetheless, our customers are telling us that we're on the right path. Our employees are telling us that as well, that they believe in where we're going and are energized by the journey.
As we told you at the beginning of the fiscal year, our focus in FY '10 was on strengthening the core of our business, and we have done just that. In our Pharmaceutical segment, we renewed many of our largest chain customer contracts well into fiscal 2012. We also renewed and entered into new agreements with a number of very important large branded manufacturer partners. All of this is critical to stabilizing our Pharmaceutical segment base and putting us in a position to move margin in the right direction.
Pharmaceutical segment profit declined 3% for the full year. This performance was considerably better than we anticipated, driven by strong execution on key initiatives, some of which I'll cover in a moment, disciplined cost management and aided somewhat by the positive impact from some unplanned generic launches. We've placed a great deal of emphasis on our retail independent pharmacy channel, and after a patchy couple of years, we return this part of the business to full year growth for the first time, since fiscal 2008.
Just a couple of weeks ago, we held our 20th annual and largest ever Retail Business Conference for our retail independent pharmacy customers. Well over 4,000 stores were represented at the event in Denver. We launched a number of offerings designed to help pharmacists run their businesses more efficiently, including Order Express, which provides retail pharmacies with a more convenient and user-friendly online buying experience. Feedback from customers has been very positive. 
We made great strides in our generic sourcing initiative, and we developed a highly attractive generic offering for our customers. As a result, we exceeded our full year improvement target of 10% in generic penetration or what we refer to as share of wallet. And our focus on driving sales force effectiveness through initiatives like our Sales College has provided us with additional traction and speed. We recognize that our sales reps are crucial to delivering an even higher level of service to our customers, and we continue to invest in their ongoing training and skill development.
We also reevaluated our Pharmaceutical segment portfolio and made a number of key decisions. We felt that the Medicine Shoppe network could be enhanced by providing an alternative model for our franchisees that moves them from a royalty-centric model to a more flexible fee-based model. We decided to divest Specialty Scripts and Martindale, and we made a meaningful move into the fast-growing area of Specialty Pharmaceutical Services. As we discussed previously, our goal was to enter the Specialty Service area in a differentiated way, and we're convinced that the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions or P4, as it is known in the oncology community, provides us with that platform.
The commercial activities within Healthcare Solutions serve key participants across the chain of specialty care, including physicians, pharmaceutical companies and payers, by providing essential tools, services and data to help improve patient outcome and increase efficiency in the delivery of healthcare. While this acquisition will have only a modest impact on FY '11, it positions us to participate in the growth of specialty category going forward. We're very excited about the growth potential in specialty and about the enthusiasm of the Healthcare Solutions' leadership team to help us achieve our goals in this area, and also, about how they're working with us to integrate these activities into Cardinal Health. We expect the integration to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of FY '11.
We also made investments in our relatively small but growing positron emission tomography unit, and are well-positioned through the manufacturing, dispensing and distribution of PET imaging agents and a key role we play in supporting clinical trials. And in the space of exceedingly difficult raw material shortages, our Nuclear Pharmacy organization performed extremely well in FY '10.  I'm very proud of this group and how they work so closely with our customers to ensure the needs of patients were met. We're looking forward to return to more normalized levels of supply in the September timeframe from both the Chalk River reactor in Canada and the Petten reactor in the Netherlands.
Our Medical segment had a busy and successful year. We finished the fourth quarter of 22% over prior year in segment profit and up 11% for the year. Additionally, we achieved a number of key goals and moved forward with several important transformational initiatives. We developed our segment strategy around channel and category management, which we believe, will better align with our customers' needs and enhance our ability to apply our core capabilities. And we completely rebuilt our sourcing model for medical products, expanding our global sourcing capabilities and our leadership there. I believe this will be an increasingly important asset for us and for our customers.
We made good progress on our substantial commitment to simplifying the customer experience and made critical investments in IT and customer-facing activities. In particular, we began the Medical Business Transformation work to enhance our technology platform and processes, and we are progressing well against our critical milestones. We returned our Presource kitting unit back to positive growth trajectory, enabled by our Lean Six Sigma and operational excellence initiative and our expanded presence in surgery centers. 
We made investments focused on growing our Ambulatory footprint and we expanded our sales organization, while at the same time, enhancing our Web ordering capabilities to better meet the needs of this channel. We also established a cross-selling effort with the Pharmaceutical segment, which is off to a good start. 
Our lab channel grew both revenue and profit by mid-single digits for the year, helped by demand for flu-related products in the first half. And Canada had an exceptional year, with double-digit revenue and profit growth, also helped by the demand for flu-related products, along with some upside from foreign exchange. In all, Medical segment revenue was up 3% in the quarter and up 7.2% for the full year. 
I should say something here about demand, as a number of companies have noted the softness in the hospital and physician office channels. We commented in last quarter's call that demand was somewhat soft there, and we can report that we saw no real improvement from a macro standpoint in our June quarter.
At the Cardinal Health enterprise level, in addition to our effort to strengthen our strategic positioning, drive performance management and revitalize our culture, I'm particularly proud of how we manage our capital in an extraordinary environment. During this past year, we were able to raise our dividend as well as do some share repurchases, as Jeff will discuss. We've invested in areas of our business critical to supporting our customers and driving future positioning, and we've used capital opportunistically to make moves that enhance our strategic positioning and shareholder value. We entered 2011 with a very strong balance sheet, which gives us excellent financial flexibility.
In keeping with our commitment to drive shareholder value, we've launched total shareholder return, or TSR, internally as a capstone metric for measuring our performance. And I'm really pleased that our organization is rallying around this concept. We've been setting internal goals around this metric, and I'm sure you'll hear us reference it in the future. 
Following the spin off, we took the opportunity to recruit four outstanding new independent board members, with exceptional healthcare and consumer background. These individuals have been terrific additions to our Board of Directors. Additionally, we bolstered our management team with several important additions. At the corporate level, we added Mark Blake, EVP of Strategy and Corporate Development; Patty Morrison, CIO; and Gilberto Quintero, Senior Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Compliance. In the Pharmaceutical segment, we added Tim McFadden, EVP of Sales and Marketing. And most recently, in the Medical segment, Lisa Ashby, who has successfully run our Lab business for several years, was promoted to President of Category Management. We did all of this while successfully managing the CareFusion transition, and this was no small feat.
Let me discuss our guidance for fiscal 2011. Jeff will cover our specific assumptions in some detail in a moment. As you know, we provided a preliminary outlook for our fiscal 2011 three months ago when we announced third quarter results. Since that time, we have finalized our budget, and we've been able to get more clarity on several key variables, like the availability of raw material for our Nuclear Pharmacy unit. Of course, one of the variables, which is hard to model is the rate of recovery of the U.S. economy. Although, over the years, healthcare has been relatively insulated from fluctuations in the economy, it is not immune. We've seen consumers alter their behavior regarding their own healthcare consumption, based on their personal economic and employment status. So although, we projected a relatively modest low single-digit growth rate on the revenue side, we do feel that we've come out of fiscal 2010 with some momentum. 
In the Pharmaceutical segment, we entered 2011 with relative stability, and our customer base for many of our strategic initiatives are beginning to take hold, and with pharmaceutical supply agreements on terms, which we feel are right for us and for our business partners. We feel some momentum in our retail independent pharmacy channel and with our generic programs across all customer segments. And in FY '11, we'll continue to focus on increasing generic penetration. Additionally, we'll more effectively utilize all the tools in our tool chest, including the expertise and resources we have in our Pharmacy Solutions business, to improve the customer experience and provide incremental value. And while we're not expecting the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions to have a big economic impact on fiscal 2011, we're very excited about the new platform it gives us in Specialty Pharmaceutical Services.
In the Medical segment, we expect that our new focus on Category Management will enable accelerated growth of our preferred products and private brand program, enhance our ability to provide additional value to our customers and offer potential for margin enhancement. We'll continue to invest in our Medical segment transformation and drive our timelines aggressively, because it's essential to our repositioning in the industry and to delivering on our commitment to our customers. We'll also focus on the Ambulatory channels as we continue to see Healthcare Services move to smaller and more disease-specific units of care. We'll remain an active partner with all players in the system as we help to improve the cost-effectiveness of healthcare, and we'll make sure that our voice is heard in Washington and at the state level as healthcare reform enters the implementation phase.
We'll also continue to look for opportunities to complement our capabilities and grow our strategic position. And finally, we will hold ourselves to ambitious goals on those things we control, while modeling more cautiously on those events we don't control. 
So taking into account all of the non-factors at this point and balancing this with some remaining market uncertainty, we are raising our initial outlook in providing an FY '11 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $2.38 to $2.48. 
We are building momentum and feel good about our progress. As we move through the year, we'll talk about our initiatives on this quarterly calls, and I'll also be sure to comment on the environmental factors that are important for you to understand. I'm very proud of the work that we began in FY '10, and look forward to continued progress in FY '11 and beyond. 
Now I'll hand the call over to Jeff to provide more details in the quarter and the full year and our fiscal 2011 guidance assumptions. Jeff?

Let me expand in our Q4 and fiscal 2010 performance for a few moments. And then I'll add more color around our FY '11 guidance, including our assumptions in both the corporate and segment standpoint.
Revenue or P&L numbers that are in our earnings release and slide presentation. I'll try to focus more on some of the underlying financial trends and drivers. Let me start with a few comments on segment performance in Q4, referring primarily to Slides 10 and 11 and starting with the Pharma segment. As George said, we are pleased with the business progress and financial results in Pharma. Otherwise, we alluded to back in our April call, the year-on-year segment profit trend is a bit of an anomaly in Q4 due to some timing and other unique issues. More on those in a few moments. 
Pharma segment revenue increased by 0.2%, with non-bulk growing considerably faster than bulk. For the quarter, non-bulk sales rose to 52% of total segment revenues. As previously mentioned on earlier calls, the ending of a relationship with two customers in the first half of fiscal '10 has dampened sales growth throughout the second half of the year. The impact from those two terminations was approximately 1.5 percentage points in Q4. We will began to lap these losses by mid-fiscal 2011. 
Importantly, revenues from retail independents grew 3.3%, a rate which was about the overall market. And overall generics growth was 10%, driven by close to 20% growth in our generic source program for the quarter. From a profit perspective, the segment decline can be attributed to a few expected but somewhat notable factors beyond the drivers and trends we would normally see. As anticipated, we did not see the same level of branded price inflation from our remaining contingent vendors as we experienced in Q4 of FY '09. We continue to face headwinds from Medicine Shoppe transition and the timing impact of a large-vendor DSA transition. Both of which flowed through as anticipated and are worth about $20 million of downside in total for the quarter.
The ongoing severe global supply shortage in our Nuclear business also had a significant negative impact. In fact, the loss of moly isotope availability for much of the quarter was, by itself, worth about $28 million. Although, we were able to offset a portion of this in our Nuclear Pharmacy unit, through the use of alternative imaging isotopes and cost efficiencies. On a positive side, we contained the benefit from the strong performance of our generic programs.
Our Medical segment had another strong quarter, posting a segment profit increase of 22% to $102.5 million. This increase was driven by volume growth with existing customers and solid expense management. We also had a few notable items in our cost of goods sold, which worked in opposite directions. A one-time vendor adjustment, which negatively impacted last year's Q4 by about $5 million, and that's benefited the year-on-year compare by that amount. And that negative impact of commodities worth a little less than $5 million of downside in the quarter versus last year. I pointed out the commodity downside as it represents the distinct reversal from the benefit we are seeing in the first half of the year.
Let me now cover a few items at the consolidated level. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat for the quarter versus last year, with strong expense controls and bad debt accrual reductions offsetting an increase in investment spend and incentive compensation. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% versus 32.6% last year. The higher rate in the current quarter was attributable to changes in income mix and some discreet items both this year and last. Specifically, this quarter's discreet items include adjustments to our FIN 48 reserves, a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to our business in Puerto Rico and a provision true-up related to our state tax returns. The net of discreet items was worth about $4 million of additional tax expense for the quarter. In FY '09, our effective tax rate benefited from a one-time state tax settlement. 
So with those comments behind us, let me reprise the EPS walkdown that I did for you in April, where I tried to explain the drivers of our year-over-year decline in Q4. I'll use most of the same categories I referred to then. Where appropriate, I'll indicate where they may differ from what we had anticipated three months ago. But in most cases, they are quite consistent. The Medicine Shoppe and the Pharma vendor DSA transitions were, together, worth $0.03 of downside. A decline in other contingent brand inflation was worth $0.04. 
Generic launches turn out to have about a neutral impact year-on-year in the quarter, slightly better than the expected $0.01 to $0.02 of downside we had called out previously. The impact of the nuclear supply shortage was as much as $0.04, a little higher than the $0.02 to $0.03 impact we envisioned, really because our supply situation was made even worse by certain air travel restrictions from Europe during the quarter.
The Q4 tax rate resulted in $0.04 of impact compared to last year's unusually low rate, an increased investment spend and was worth about $0.02. Generally speaking, the rest of the business performed better than forecast, and our expense controls remained very tight. So we are able to deliver a final Q4 EPS slightly above the range we have projected in April. Lots of detail, I know. But hopefully, that closes the loop on what was a somewhat unusual Q4 from an earnings standpoint. Now shifting gears slightly, let's talk about cash and balance sheet management.
Earnings and continued focus on working capital efficiency drove an additional $324 million of operating cash flow in Q4. Of note, we finished Q4 with 21 days in inventory on hand versus 23 last year. I might add that this level of inventory is a little lower than even we have expected, and probably represents a pull-ahead of some operating cash flow from Q1 of FY '11. Our days receivable improved to 18.6 from 19.1. And importantly, our account delinquencies reduced by more than $75 million year-on-year, despite a continuing tough climate for many of our customers.
I'd also like to mention a few other items of note that occurred during the quarter. With the Q4 sale of our Martindale business in the U.K., along with the earlier divestitures of Specialty Scripts, we completed the portfolio rationalization activity that we have projected for this fiscal year. We did not sell any of our CareFusion stake in Q4. 
And finally, I won't go through the detailed GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation that appears on Slide 7. I will highlight that the most notable item this quarter is approximately $41 million pretax of litigation income related to an antitrust settlement. As per our usual practice, this type of item has been excluded from our non-GAAP earnings.
Now let me take a few moments to comment on FY '10 in total, starting with the personal reflection that I'm extremely proud of the progress we made during the year, particularly given some of the headwinds, both environmental and the result of some conscious positioning and investment decisions that we knew we'd face when the year began. For the start of the this year, we identified a few key financial metrics in which we needed to focus to win, specifically, margin and working capital improvements. Driven by a number of performance initiatives that George have already referenced, we've made great progress in these areas. 
First, on margin rates. Although, we did see a decline in overall consolidated operating margin versus last year, we performed considerably better than we expected heading into 2010. Let me comment on two key areas in this regard. First, our Medical segment expanded its segment profit margin by 17 basis points for the full year. Contributors to this was a mix impact of the relative growth of our Ambulatory, Canadian and Lab businesses, the recovery of the Presource kitting operations and a continued growth of our preferred products. We also benefited from the positive impact of commodity prices, although, that benefit was primarily limited to the first half of the year. 
Within the Pharma segment, although, segment profit margin was down by 6 basis points, this really was driven by our Bulk business. In fact, Non-Bulk Pharma profit margins remained relatively flat for the full year at 1.94% for FY '10 versus last year's 1.95%.
Regarding working capital, I view this as a tremendous success as we've continued to see the hard work of our employees bear fruit. In every quarter of the year, our inventory levels and days receivable were favorable to FY '09. In fact, changes in net working capital contributed almost $1 billion to operating cash flow for the year. 
Overall, we finished the year with very strong cash flow and a robust balance sheet. Total operating cash flow for the full year was over $2.1 billion. In addition, we sold $271 million of CareFusion shares during the year and generated over $150 million incremental from other asset divestitures. A good portion of this cash flow was invested back in the business as we had capital expenditures of about $260 million, mostly in information-technology-related projects. And we committed to our acquisition of Healthcare Solutions, for which we made a payment of $517 million in July. 
We also returned cash of over $500 million to shareholders, reflecting dividends of $253 million and share repurchases totaling $250 million, including the $200 million we executed in June. By the way, in case you're wondering why our statement of cash flows was $230 million of share repo for the year is because $20 million of it actually is settled after June month end. Our total cash position was about $2.8 billion at year end, of which approximately $400 million is held overseas. Further, our CareFusion stake was valued at approximately $700 million as of June 30.
We remain committed to monetizing the stake in the coming periods, although the specific timing will depend on market conditions and other factors. Our June 30 long-term debt position was $2.1 billion, which is effectively our target level at this time. So we entered fiscal 2011 with a fair degree of balance sheet flexibility. We intend to use it wisely in a balanced and prudent manner to maximize shareholder value for the longer term. 
Now let's turn to Slides 13 to 16 and a look at our FY '11 guidance. Now that we've completed our planning processes and have better visibility into the year, we're updating the preliminary outlook we shared three months ago. As background for our revised non-GAAP EPS range of $2.38 to $2.48, let me expand on some of the information that we have provided back in April, starting with overall company expectations. 
The revenue expectation is for low single-digit growth on a consolidated basis, reflecting our somewhat cautious view of the overall market dynamics. Our focus on expense management will continue. Organic operating expense will be close to flat for the year, but the addition of our Healthcare Solutions business and its expenses related to both the amortization of intangibles and the cost of its primarily customer-focused resources will boost the SG&A growth rate moderately.
We are expecting an annual non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 37%, a little lower than FY '10, although it will no doubt fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding should be in a range of 355 million to 357 million, reflecting total FY '11 share repurchases, which we currently anticipate will approximate our FY '10 levels. In this regard, you should note that we did execute $150 million of repo in July, leaving us $100 million left on our outstanding board authorization.
As you know, the actual diluted shares outstanding we will average for FY '11 will depend on a few factors, including the timing and size of completing any additional repurchases and the impact of share price on the dilutive impact of employee stock options. Finally, our guidance includes no new significant strategic initiatives, either acquisitions or divestitures, beyond our Healthcare Solutions acquisition.
Now let's spend a few minutes going through some of the segment-specific functions in more detail. On Slide 17, you can see the Pharmaceutical segment assumptions. Let me hit on a few highlights. Importantly, our FY '11 guidance assumes the renewal of key customer contracts. We expect the rate of brand inflation to be similar to FY '10. We also expect neutral earnings effect from the generic launches versus FY '10. We have risk-adjusted a basket of potential at-risk launches in FY '11 to come up with our forecast. We do expect continued benefit from our generic sales and sourcing programs, which gained momentum last year. In our Nuclear business, we expect Moly [Molybdenum-99] supply levels to stabilize by the end of Q1. In this respect, let me comment briefly on the latest news of Canada.
Repairs for the Chalk River reactor are complete. However, the reactor has experienced some temporary delays in the start-up process related to instrumentation. We understand that this is being sorted out in the next couple of weeks. But at this point, we believe our assumptions for the resumption of normal supply remain reasonable, and we will keep our unrelenting focus on lean operational excellence initiatives to improve supply-chain efficiency and working capital. However, I anticipate improvements in net working capital at this stage to be much less than what we experienced in FY '10, particularly given the quite low inventory levels we achieved at June end.
Now let's take a look at Slide 16 and the Medical segment. We do anticipate a negative impact on cost of goods sold from commodity price movements. For the full year, we currently estimate that it could be more than $40 million. About half of this relates to oil price movements, with the remainder driven by latex and other commodities, most of which have experienced some pretty significant price increases in the recent past. We expect to benefit from both customer and product mix shifts, including the growth of our higher-margin Ambulatory Care business and increased sales of preferred products.
We do not anticipate the extraordinary demand from our pandemic flu season as we saw in the first half of fiscal '10. Our transformational initiative expense will continue at a similar level to FY '10 as we continue to position our Medical segment for long-term growth. 
Lastly, I did want to touch specifically on Medical's Q1 as it is a somewhat unusual quarter from an earnings trend standpoint. We do expect a significant first quarter segment profit decline due to a tough compare related to unique fiscal '10 Q1 events, namely the early extreme flu season and $14 million of income recognition accelerated by the CareFusion spin, as well as a year-on-year negative impact of commodity prices.
So in summary, as I look forward towards the remainder of fiscal 2011, I'm confident of our ability to execute in our priorities and continue the momentum we began in 2010. There are clearly still uncertainties related to items largely outside of our control, such as the impact of the economy on healthcare consumer behaviors and the ongoing movement of commodity prices. But I feel very positive about our organization's ability to respond and deliver as the year unfolds. Let me make one final administrative comment before we turn to questions. 
In a further effort to make our SEC filings more user-friendly, we've undertaken a review to streamline our reporting. With input from a number of sources, we made an effort to make the upcoming 10-K a little more reader-friendly. Hopefully, you noticed the difference. We've also decided that to be meaningful going forward to report Pharma bulk and non-bulk margins on an annual basis rather than quarterly. If there are unusual or significant trends, we will clearly call those out to you. But periodic fluctuations have rendered these metrics fairly volatile on a quarterly basis and not necessarily representative of longer-term trends. We believe that the annualized rate is more indicative of the company's progress. We'll begin the annualized reporting process in fiscal '11. 
With that, let me turn over to our operator to begin the Q&A session.

We focus more on the annual EPS and drivers, but let me provide a little more color in addition to the comments I made about the Q1 for the Medical segment. We're thinking about a revenue standpoint, revenue growth will be a little bit more back-end loaded. As a reminder, as I said earlier, we're still lapping the termination of two large customers that occurred in Q1 and Q2 of FY '10, so that will tend to slightly depress our revenue growth below market rates in the first half of the year. And also in the second half of the year, we're expecting at least one additional customer to join us, and we'll also begin to see some of the revenue impact of our Healthcare Solutions acquisition as well. So our thinking about a revenue standpoint, again, those factors will tend to make the back end a little bit more revenue-intensive than the first half. From an earnings perspective, I really don't want to comment more than what I've already said about the somewhat unusual compare in Q1 for the Medical segment.

Let me jump in for a second on this, and this is actually not necessarily the case. I think it varies product by product, and so particularly when there are exclusive launches, you have to look at the market characteristics of those launches. So for example, there's just been an approval recently well known out there of LOVENOX. This is a drug with really unusual characteristics. It is a compound with heavy institutional presence, but also a meaningful retail presence. A single-source launch, particularly because it has such a large institutional presence. The competitive behavior between the branded and the generic is quite different. And again, in this case, because there is one generic approval, you're very dependent on the design of any company's plans for how to launch that product, their own launch strategy. So I guess what I'd suggest to you is the economics of single-source launch can actually be quite variable depending on the characteristics of that drug, its channel, the nature of the launch, how much supply is in the system and the innovative response. So I know that's a long answer. But I would just say exercise some caution on assumptions on single-source launches. They can vary quite dramatically. I think when you get into a two- or three-player launch, actually, the characteristics can change and tend to be more favorable. But again, my advice would be exercise caution, and the general sense of Jeff's observations are right on a year-over-year basis. I would say relatively comparable and, Lisa, of course, the part that we don't know exactly is what will happen on some of the at-risk launches. So our approach is to model with a risk adjustment and then about those, well, we've modeled too cautiously, but I think it's the right way to approach this.

Growth in Nuclear, we are hopeful and at this point, confident that we'll get some material back into normal status and be able to work at a more traditional way with our customers. We're really looking forward to that moment. Growth and performance really across all of our businesses, frankly, a good progress.

So we got very targeted initiatives to drive the performance of this company, and I think the parts that we just are going to have to watch carefully are the things that are a little bit out of our control, particularly related to economic environment and demand.

And then I would say the commodity impact, although it's slightly above $40 million for the full year, that impact will be a little bit more front-end loaded, because some of the price increases began creeping into our cost of goods sold in the second half of the year. They're quite variable in the first half of FY '10. So I expect that comparison to be a little bit tougher in Q1 and Q2 for Medical.

We more than offset those in FY '10 to our infrastructure cost-reduction efforts, so they really didn't appear anywhere in FY '10. You probably know it but I didn't call them out as a driver at any point in the year because we were able to more than offset them to reducing infrastructure in the remaining Cardinal business. In FY '11, I'd say, likewise. You'll see a relatively minimal impact, if any, from that. To begin, we've been able to hold and reduced costs related to our infrastructure. I would say, the final potential period there is FY '12 because that is when the final IP transition services agreement is expected to expire. Actually, it expires in the summer, at the start of FY '12. So there is a slight potential there for some fixed cost overhang in the Cardinal Health business, but again our goal is to work to offset most or all of that. So my objective is that I will never call that out as a negative driver year-on-year, because we're striving to offset it.

I mean, I think, on a general standpoint, I'd give you some observations. The system is generally growing. As you know, generic penetration continues to increase. We also note that as we model the rate of deflation of the older generic products, we're not noticing or seeing any particular trend one way or the other, so that looks like it's fairly typical. And we hope to continue to grow our position with everyone of our customers as well as picking up new customers. So picking apart the component of that is probably not something I'm comfortable doing. It's hard to -- and the value that you get for making sure you do a very effective launch for your customers contributes to your overall positioning, Ricky. So you have to think of it more as an integrated program, and that's one of the reasons why we don't spend a lot of time highlighting individual products. So I think it's all contributing, but I don't think I could give you the components of that and weigh each one.

And, obviously, for us, there's another component, which is we want to add more customers and we want to add as high a share of a lot of this as we can, and we want all of our customers to source all their generics from us.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter's call. Our fiscal 2011, or Q1 fiscal 2011, is up to a very good start. We reported revenues for the first quarter of $24.4 billion and a non-GAAP EPS number of $0.64, up 19% over the prior year period.
And while we had a slight decline in overall revenues on a year-over-year basis, we generated a healthy expansion in gross margins and held SG&A essentially flat to the prior year. Our strong operating performance in the quarter was driven by excellent results in our Pharmaceutical segment, offsetting an expected difficult year-over-year comparison in our Medical segment. 
Overall, we continued our momentum coming out of fiscal 2010, strengthening the core of our business so we have a strong foundation from which to grow, with particular emphasis on margin expansion, disciplined management of working capital, growing generics at an accelerated rate and enhancing the customer experience. 
Our customer work is beginning to produce results as we look at our record of contract wins and renewals in the Medical segment and a continued strength with our retail independent customer base. We have a very strong balance sheet and continue to manage it carefully. And during the quarter, we demonstrated our commitment to a balanced capital deployment strategy. We increased our quarterly dividend payment. We completed the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions, and we repurchased $250 million in shares. Our operating initiatives are on track, and we continue our progress in positioning our company to deliver sustained growth. 
Now let me provide some additional color on each segment separately.
Performance in our Pharmaceutical segment, and in particular, our Pharma Distribution business, really drove the company's overall operating performance in the quarter. Segment sales were down 1% versus the prior year period due to a drop in sales to existing bulk customers and the impact from the previously disclosed loss of two large-revenue customers last year. We will begin to lap those losses in the second half of fiscal 2011. Despite the slight decline in revenue, segment profit was outstanding, up 42% versus the first quarter of last year. And our segment profit rate increased by a robust 41 basis points.
Our improved profitability was driven primarily by outstanding performance in our Generics business, various initiatives focused on improving margins and solid performance in our branded manufacturer agreements. We continue to build our capabilities and services to support our branded pharma partners. And as a result, these relationships are strong.
As I mentioned, we had an excellent performance across our generic activities, both on the sales and sourcing side. Let me take a moment to provide a little more color on our progress in these areas. 
Our generic penetration continues to be a focus, and the team is executing exceptionally well in our source program across our retail independent customers and with our retail buying groups. The SOURCE program is our most comprehensive generics offering and includes nearly 4,000 generic drugs that make up, esentially, all of the retail pharmacies' product needs.
SOURCE revenues was up a robust 34% in the quarter versus the first quarter of last year. We have improved our execution on generic launches and have continued to enlist customers in our First Script auto shipment program. Success with these generic programs is resulting in value for our customers, for our suppliers and for us.
We also continue to make progress in our efforts to rebalance our business mix. Growth in our Retail Independent business continues to track ahead of the market, reflecting the emphasis we've placed in this channel in the past 18 months. And our churn rate at the end of the first quarter, which captures both controllable and non-controllable account losses, was the lowest it's been since we began measuring churn many years ago.
Turning to Nuclear. The raw material shortages we experienced through most of last year did resolve in the first quarter, and supply began to return to more normal levels after a long and difficult period of time.
Both the Chalk River reactor in Canada and the Petten reactor in the Netherlands were at full production by late September. Demand has not yet returned to pre-shortage levels, but we do expect to see this build over time. We have plans in place to help facilitate this ship with our customers in the coming months. In many ways, our relationship with our customers strengthened during the material shortages as we worked closely with them to ensure that the needs of the most critical patients were met first. 
We continued to expand our position in molecular imaging. And in our positron emission tomography or PET unit, we are now working on clinical trials for 17 new compounds. We've made excellent progress in the three quarters since we launched this initiative, and we are well positioned to support this PET bio tracers through post commercialization.  We will plan to give you a more complete view of our nuclear strategy at our Analyst Day in December.
We've made substantial progress on launching our new specialty division called Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions, which brings together all of our specialty capabilities within the Pharma segment, including specialty distribution, third-party logistics and cold chain management, drug development consulting and program management, regulatory and compliance services, risk mitigation strategies, medical billing and claims processing, sourcing and purchasing services and clinical pathways and treatment protocols.
We achieved an important milestone this quarter, closing on the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions or P4 as it is known in the oncology community. Our P4 integration is on schedule, and as indicated previously, we expect it to be substantially complete by the end of the next quarter.
We are building a world-class management team in our new specialty division, in addition to retaining the leadership of P4, including founders: Raj Mantena and Dr. Jeffrey Scott. We've attracted a great leader to run the overall Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions division. Meghan FitzGerald, our new President, has extensive healthcare industry experience focusing on specialty products. Her background includes senior roles in corporate development, strategy and international operations with companies including Medco, Pfizer and Merck.
Also joining us is Dr. Bruce Steinberg. Most recently, Bruce was President and CEO of Georgia Cancer Specialists, a Top 10 private cancer practice and leader in advanced cancer treatment and research. And the work we've done over the past month to build out our specialty physical infrastructure is largely complete. 
We've also been working close with all stakeholders to solidify our partnerships and introduce Cardinal Health expanded specialty capabilities. Our value proposition connects patients, physicians, payors and pharmaceutical manufactures with the goal to improve access to efficient high quality care. A key component of our value proposition is P4 pathways, which brings together payors and practices. We believe this capability, in conjunction with the pharmacy management core competency we have within our pharmacy solutions unit, will give us a competitive advantage.
The timing is right for this important focus on integrated care. We continue to be very excited about our specialty strategy and our P4 acquisition, and we plan to show more details on our model in progress at our Analyst and Investor Day in December.
Now let me discuss our Medical segment. The quarter came in about as expected. Segment sales were down 3%, and segment profit was down 28% versus the prior year. Given the unusual comparisons in the quarter, I'll let Jeff walk you through the details, but let me give you an overall perspective on our progress.
We completed the rollout of our segment strategy around channel and category management during the quarter. This was an important change management staff to align the entire segment around the common goals for our customers and leverage our own strengths.
We continue to build out our preferred product portfolio and feel very good about our expanded global sourcing capabilities and our presence in Asia to drive this strategy. Our medical transformation initiative continues to progress and has moved into the build and test phase for the distribution solutions. 
Our Ambulatory business, where we have made investments to grow our footprint, grew well ahead of the market. And the cross-selling effort with the Pharma segment continues to pick up speed.
I'd like to take just a moment to give you my observations on the demand side in our medical markets. Demand in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was very similar to demand in the fourth quarter fiscal 2010. We have continued to see some sluggishness in elective procedure and doctor visits, both of which have an impact on the demand for our products and some of our medical businesses. 
Having said this, I've spent a fair amount of time in recent weeks in the field, speaking to hospital executives. And I'm guardedly optimistic that procedural volumes will gradually recover. Granted, this is by no means a scientific example. We'll be following the situation closely, and we'll provide updates during our scheduled calls. We are taking a cautious approach and will continue to model a relatively soft market until we see these anecdotal observations begin to show up in the data.
Our recent account wins are giving us greater confidence that the actions we've taken over the last year to enhance the value we deliver to our customer are bearing fruit, and validate our channel and category strategy as well as our ability to execute. 
 
We recently won a major multi-year product agreement with HPG, a group purchasing organization that supports nearly 1,400 acute care facilities. And in addition to a number of recent renewals and new account wins, we signed large multi-year contracts with Baylor Healthcare System and another renowned academic medical center that draws on the depth and beadth of our supply-chain offerings across our Medical businesses.
We are competing effectively in the Medical segment. We are positioned well, and we will continue to invest where we see opportunities for growth.
In summary, we're continuing the momentum we felt during the course of fiscal 2010. This was a strong quarter and a very good start to fiscal 2011. And I'm confident in our strategy and in our ability to perform.
15 reporting weeks into the year, there's plenty of games still to be played. But based on our performance in the first quarter and our progress on key initiatives in both segments, we've become more confident in achieving the higher end of the guidance range we provided in August.
Now let me hand the call over to Jeff, to provide more financial details."
172207,114084285,82633,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Like George, I am very pleased with the results of the quarter and the momentum we have carried over from fiscal 2010. Q1 is an excellent start to our year. Let me add to George's remarks by",1696,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Like George, I am very pleased with the results of the quarter and the momentum we have carried over from fiscal 2010. Q1 is an excellent start to our year. 
Let me add to George's remarks by expanding on some financial trends and drivers in the first quarter. I'll also provide some color to the full fiscal year outlook, including some of our key expectation from a corporate and segment standpoint.
Let's start with the consolidated results for the first quarter, summarized on Slide 4. Despite a slight revenue decline, we delivered 6% gross margin growth and with the benefit of relatively flat expenses, leveraged out into 15% non-GAAP operating earnings growth.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were up less than 1% as expense efficiencies largely offset the business expenses added to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.
The Non-GAAP tax rate was 37.1%, largely in line with our expectation for the full year, but above last year's rate of 35.4%. We benefited from the $450 million in share repurchases we have executed over the past two quarters, including $250 million in Q1, resulting in a significant reduction in share count to just under 352 million diluted shares outstanding.
Importantly, we continue to make real progress on our two key financial metrics: margin expansion and networking and capital optimization. At the consolidated level, the gross margin rate increased to 3.94%, which is an improvement of 27 basis points versus Q1 of FY '10 and 24 basis points sequentially versus Q4, driven by gains in our Pharmaceutical segment.  The non-GAAP operating margin rate improved 22 basis points versus last year's Q1 to 1.52%. 
We also saw further improvement in our networking capital days. Although inventory days have not come down this quarter, we reduced our day sales outstanding and realized a market improvement in days payable, driven by changes in one of our large vendor agreements. We continue to build on our Lean operational excellence initiatives to optimize working capital levels in fiscal '11, with the goal of sustaining and improving upon the gains achieved last year.
To summarize, we are making great progress with our performance initiatives, and it's beginning to consistently show in our key metrics. Although we'll always see some quarterly fluctuations and margin rate trends at working capital levels, due to the nature of our business and external factors, we feel we have the actions in place to continue to move these in the right direction. 
Let me now provide a few other comments on segment performance in Q1, referring primarily to Slide 5 and 6 and starting with the Pharma segment. Revenue in the Segment declined 1%. This primarily reflects three major items. First, bulk sales for existing customers were down, driven by changes in ordering patterns in some of our large bulk customers, including the year-on-year impact of some large Tamiflu orders which occurred in fiscal '10. Second, as disposed previously, we continue to feel the impact of ending our relationship with two large revenue customers in the Mail Order and Grocery Chain Pharmacy segments, which dampens sales growth by approximately 1.2 percentage points in Q1. We will begin to lap this revenue losses by mid fiscal 2011. Third, we also had a dilutive effect on revenue mix from the conversion of certain brands to generics. In addition to driving down overall sales, these three items had a disproportionate impact on sales to bulk customers, which were down 8% for the quarter.  However, I'm pleased to report that sales to non-bulk customers were up 6% for the period. 
Within this customer category, revenues from retail independents grew 3%, continuing to grow at a rate above the market in this important classic trade. Our overall generics revenue growth was nearly 20%, driven by an impressive 34% growth in our generics preferred SOURCE program.
The Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 41 basis points compared to prior year's Q1. In addition to the continued success of our generic sales and sourcing programs, we also saw more than expected benefit from new item generic launches during the quarter. Solid performance under our array of manufacturer agreements and brand inflation from our remaining price-contingent vendors were also positive drivers. 
Please keep in mind that we benefited year-on-year from the impact of certain large pharma vendors, which transitioned to DFA agreements. Finally, I should point out that we had a change in estimated reserves related to DFA fees receivable from certain manufacturers, which contributed $9 million dollars for the quarter.
We realized margin expansion in both our bulk and non-bulk customer segments. For the quarter, the bulk segment profit margin rate was 37 basis points, and our non-bulk rate was 2.17%. Both of these rates are significantly above last year's first quarter rates and the annual average for fiscal 2010.
A reminder that we are not planning to provide a detailed bulk/non-bulk margin quarterly breakdown in our 10-Qs going forward. But we do want to make you aware of a fairly significant change in trend during this call. Bottom line, the segment had exceptional performance throughout and drove an increase in segment profit of 42% to $296 million.
Now turning to our Medical segment. As George mentioned, the first quarter had a bit of noise around it. But overall, we're pleased with where the business is heading. Revenue for the segment declined by 3% to $2.17 billion, primarily as a result of our prior year revenue recognition event that was triggered by the spinoff of CareFusion in the amount of $51 million, as well as a tough compare against an early and strong flu season in the first half of fiscal 2010 worth $28 million in the quarter. Excluding these two unique events, the segment would've experienced positive revenue growth. Importantly, our Inventory business grew at a rate of over 5%, which is significantly above market over the same time period.
Medical segment profit declined 28% to $83 million, mainly due to the combined effect of last year's unique items, namely, the CareFusion revenue recognition issue, which was worth about $14 million of profit and a flu impact of approximately $5 million. Increase in commodity prices also created a year-on-year headwind in our current-period cost of goods sold of about $15 million. All told, these items' total reduction in segment profit growth of 30 percentage points.
Net-net, despite the current short-term sluggishness we are seeing in the procedural market, our Medical business is gaining momentum. And we are continuing to invest in systems and strategy to drive longer-term growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me turn to Slide 7, and take a moment to walk you through the items that accounted for the difference in our GAAP to non-GAAP EPS numbers. All these figures that I'll review our on an after-tax basis. 
The biggest item in this category is a $75 million gain from the sale of 30.5 million shares of CareFusion stock in the quarter. This generated proceeds of $706 million and accounted for approximately $0.21 of GAAP EPS.
Please note that there is no tax impact associated with the sale due to the release of our previously established deferred tax valuation allowance. The sale of these shares complete the liquidation of our CareFusion stake. 
The remaining items on this page, which is restructuring and severance, acquisition-related costs and other spin-off costs netted to approximately a $0.01 reduction. The net of all these items result in a GAAP EPS of $0.84 versus non-GAAP of $0.64.
Let's briefly shift our discussion to the balance sheet. Several significant items which impacted it are listed on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash, in which about $313 million is held overseas. We maintained a strong liquidity position in spite of over $750 million in total outflows related to share repurchases and our acquisition of Healthcare Solutions. 
Our cash position was bolstered by the sale of our remaining CareFusion stake and $217 million in operating cash flow. One item of note, as you compare this year's operating cash flow to last year's figure, keep in mind that we had a $144 million of benefit in last year's number related to CareFusion's ongoing operation for the two months that it was still part of Cardinal Health.
Now to answer a question that I suspect is in many of your minds, let me reiterate our position regarding our capital deployment. Our first priorities are to maintain our differentiated dividend and ensure we are investing appropriately in our organic capital expenditures. In the latter regard, we expect to invest in the range of $250 million this year, about the same as last, but the majority of that in IT-related processes and systems. 
Beyond that, we don't have a fixed formula. Our goal is to ensure that we are positioning for sustainable competitive advantage and to create shareholder value. Where those ends, we will continue to evaluate both acquisitions in select areas and share repurchases. We don't envision the paydown of our existing long-term debt balance in our current plans.
Now let's turn our discussion to fiscal '11 guidance. As George mentioned, we do only have one quarter behind us at this point, so there's still plenty of year left. However, given our performance and our progress in key initiatives, we become more confident in achieving the higher end of our previously announced non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $2.38 to $2.48. 
Our overall revenue guidance remains unchanged at low single-digit growth despite a slightly more cautious view of Med/Surg market volumes. 
Slide 10 outlines some of our key corporate expectations for the year. Let me focus on the items in red, which represent changes from our previous assumptions shared in our August call.
Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding are now projected to be approximately 352 million, reflecting the timing and per share acquisition cost of the $250 million of repurchases that were completed in Q1. Interest expense and other, should be $110 million or so. Our Q1 number is abnormally low due to the impact of interest rate swaps, FX and deferred compensation gains realized in the quarter."

Let me add to George's remarks by expanding on some financial trends and drivers in the first quarter. I'll also provide some color to the full fiscal year outlook, including some of our key expectation from a corporate and segment standpoint.
Let's start with the consolidated results for the first quarter, summarized on Slide 4. Despite a slight revenue decline, we delivered 6% gross margin growth and with the benefit of relatively flat expenses, leveraged out into 15% non-GAAP operating earnings growth.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were up less than 1% as expense efficiencies largely offset the business expenses added to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.
The Non-GAAP tax rate was 37.1%, largely in line with our expectation for the full year, but above last year's rate of 35.4%. We benefited from the $450 million in share repurchases we have executed over the past two quarters, including $250 million in Q1, resulting in a significant reduction in share count to just under 352 million diluted shares outstanding.
Importantly, we continue to make real progress on our two key financial metrics: margin expansion and networking and capital optimization. At the consolidated level, the gross margin rate increased to 3.94%, which is an improvement of 27 basis points versus Q1 of FY '10 and 24 basis points sequentially versus Q4, driven by gains in our Pharmaceutical segment.  The non-GAAP operating margin rate improved 22 basis points versus last year's Q1 to 1.52%. 
We also saw further improvement in our networking capital days. Although inventory days have not come down this quarter, we reduced our day sales outstanding and realized a market improvement in days payable, driven by changes in one of our large vendor agreements. We continue to build on our Lean operational excellence initiatives to optimize working capital levels in fiscal '11, with the goal of sustaining and improving upon the gains achieved last year.
To summarize, we are making great progress with our performance initiatives, and it's beginning to consistently show in our key metrics. Although we'll always see some quarterly fluctuations and margin rate trends at working capital levels, due to the nature of our business and external factors, we feel we have the actions in place to continue to move these in the right direction. 
Let me now provide a few other comments on segment performance in Q1, referring primarily to Slide 5 and 6 and starting with the Pharma segment. Revenue in the Segment declined 1%. This primarily reflects three major items. First, bulk sales for existing customers were down, driven by changes in ordering patterns in some of our large bulk customers, including the year-on-year impact of some large Tamiflu orders which occurred in fiscal '10. Second, as disposed previously, we continue to feel the impact of ending our relationship with two large revenue customers in the Mail Order and Grocery Chain Pharmacy segments, which dampens sales growth by approximately 1.2 percentage points in Q1. We will begin to lap this revenue losses by mid fiscal 2011. Third, we also had a dilutive effect on revenue mix from the conversion of certain brands to generics. In addition to driving down overall sales, these three items had a disproportionate impact on sales to bulk customers, which were down 8% for the quarter.  However, I'm pleased to report that sales to non-bulk customers were up 6% for the period. 
Within this customer category, revenues from retail independents grew 3%, continuing to grow at a rate above the market in this important classic trade. Our overall generics revenue growth was nearly 20%, driven by an impressive 34% growth in our generics preferred SOURCE program.
The Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 41 basis points compared to prior year's Q1. In addition to the continued success of our generic sales and sourcing programs, we also saw more than expected benefit from new item generic launches during the quarter. Solid performance under our array of manufacturer agreements and brand inflation from our remaining price-contingent vendors were also positive drivers. 
Please keep in mind that we benefited year-on-year from the impact of certain large pharma vendors, which transitioned to DFA agreements. Finally, I should point out that we had a change in estimated reserves related to DFA fees receivable from certain manufacturers, which contributed $9 million dollars for the quarter.
We realized margin expansion in both our bulk and non-bulk customer segments. For the quarter, the bulk segment profit margin rate was 37 basis points, and our non-bulk rate was 2.17%. Both of these rates are significantly above last year's first quarter rates and the annual average for fiscal 2010.
A reminder that we are not planning to provide a detailed bulk/non-bulk margin quarterly breakdown in our 10-Qs going forward. But we do want to make you aware of a fairly significant change in trend during this call. Bottom line, the segment had exceptional performance throughout and drove an increase in segment profit of 42% to $296 million.
Now turning to our Medical segment. As George mentioned, the first quarter had a bit of noise around it. But overall, we're pleased with where the business is heading. Revenue for the segment declined by 3% to $2.17 billion, primarily as a result of our prior year revenue recognition event that was triggered by the spinoff of CareFusion in the amount of $51 million, as well as a tough compare against an early and strong flu season in the first half of fiscal 2010 worth $28 million in the quarter. Excluding these two unique events, the segment would've experienced positive revenue growth. Importantly, our Inventory business grew at a rate of over 5%, which is significantly above market over the same time period.
Medical segment profit declined 28% to $83 million, mainly due to the combined effect of last year's unique items, namely, the CareFusion revenue recognition issue, which was worth about $14 million of profit and a flu impact of approximately $5 million. Increase in commodity prices also created a year-on-year headwind in our current-period cost of goods sold of about $15 million. All told, these items' total reduction in segment profit growth of 30 percentage points.
Net-net, despite the current short-term sluggishness we are seeing in the procedural market, our Medical business is gaining momentum. And we are continuing to invest in systems and strategy to drive longer-term growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me turn to Slide 7, and take a moment to walk you through the items that accounted for the difference in our GAAP to non-GAAP EPS numbers. All these figures that I'll review our on an after-tax basis. 
The biggest item in this category is a $75 million gain from the sale of 30.5 million shares of CareFusion stock in the quarter. This generated proceeds of $706 million and accounted for approximately $0.21 of GAAP EPS.
Please note that there is no tax impact associated with the sale due to the release of our previously established deferred tax valuation allowance. The sale of these shares complete the liquidation of our CareFusion stake. 
The remaining items on this page, which is restructuring and severance, acquisition-related costs and other spin-off costs netted to approximately a $0.01 reduction. The net of all these items result in a GAAP EPS of $0.84 versus non-GAAP of $0.64.
Let's briefly shift our discussion to the balance sheet. Several significant items which impacted it are listed on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash, in which about $313 million is held overseas. We maintained a strong liquidity position in spite of over $750 million in total outflows related to share repurchases and our acquisition of Healthcare Solutions. 
Our cash position was bolstered by the sale of our remaining CareFusion stake and $217 million in operating cash flow. One item of note, as you compare this year's operating cash flow to last year's figure, keep in mind that we had a $144 million of benefit in last year's number related to CareFusion's ongoing operation for the two months that it was still part of Cardinal Health.
Now to answer a question that I suspect is in many of your minds, let me reiterate our position regarding our capital deployment. Our first priorities are to maintain our differentiated dividend and ensure we are investing appropriately in our organic capital expenditures. In the latter regard, we expect to invest in the range of $250 million this year, about the same as last, but the majority of that in IT-related processes and systems. 
Beyond that, we don't have a fixed formula. Our goal is to ensure that we are positioning for sustainable competitive advantage and to create shareholder value. Where those ends, we will continue to evaluate both acquisitions in select areas and share repurchases. We don't envision the paydown of our existing long-term debt balance in our current plans.
Now let's turn our discussion to fiscal '11 guidance. As George mentioned, we do only have one quarter behind us at this point, so there's still plenty of year left. However, given our performance and our progress in key initiatives, we become more confident in achieving the higher end of our previously announced non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $2.38 to $2.48. 
Our overall revenue guidance remains unchanged at low single-digit growth despite a slightly more cautious view of Med/Surg market volumes. 
Slide 10 outlines some of our key corporate expectations for the year. Let me focus on the items in red, which represent changes from our previous assumptions shared in our August call.
Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding are now projected to be approximately 352 million, reflecting the timing and per share acquisition cost of the $250 million of repurchases that were completed in Q1. Interest expense and other, should be $110 million or so. Our Q1 number is abnormally low due to the impact of interest rate swaps, FX and deferred compensation gains realized in the quarter.
Now I'll spend a few minutes going through some of the segment's specific assumptions in more detail, starting with just a few items related to the Pharma business on Slide 11. Given the relatively strong start to the year from a generic launch standpoint, we now expect a neutral to slightly positive earnings effect from generic launches versus fiscal '10. 
Within nuclear pharmacy, the resumption of normal supply was consistent with our original expectations. We expect it to be relatively stable for the remainder of the year. And the integration of our Healthcare Solutions acquisition is on track, and we continue to expect it to have a neutral to slightly accretive EPS impact in fiscal 2011.
Finally, turning to Slide 12 in the Medical segment. As George mentioned, we're now being slightly more cautious on our volume outlook for the year, which is reflected in our flat market growth expectation. The rest of our assumptions remain pretty much intact. Commodity prices have remained largely in line with our original projections, as oil prices have stayed in a fairly tight range, around the $80 per barrel level that we budgeted for. And we continue to focus resources and investment on the Medical Transformation project, which remains on track to the majority of it's implementation to occur in fiscal 2012.

But in terms of items of note in the first quarter, which may be more onetime-ish in nature, first of all, there were probably $0.04 of onetime-type items in the first quarter. Non-operating items. For example, we had that accounting estimate change within pharma related to the recognition of DFA fees. That was worth about $0.02, and that was a very unique item that won't replicate itself again. Secondly, within interest and other, we had about $0.02 of benefit from interest rate swap income and deferred compensation gains. And again, we don't forecast those happening in future quarters. So you could say that in the $0.02 of somewhat unique items. And then I referenced earlier that contingent price increase that we had in Q1, which is the pull-ahead from Q3, and that's another $0.02. So I would say those are the three unique items that I would point out. As we go forward in the year, I don't want to get into specific quarterly guidance. But clearly, this was a unusual year, or usual quarter for Medical. There was just a lot of year-on-year headwinds that we had to overcome. So I would say, it was sort of an extraordinary negative growth rate for Medical, which we don't anticipate repeating for the rest of the year. So as we sort of look forward to the rest of the year, I'll repeat what we said earlier, that we're continuing to be relatively cautious about overall demand, particularly procedural demand within Med/Surge. Hopefully, it does better than we're expecting. But I think at this point, it's probably prudent to be appropriately conservative on that. And we continue to risk adjust our generic launches. We had some good launches in Q1, including a couple that weren't expected. But as you know, as we look forward, we generally risk adjust all the uncertain launches. And we continue to do that for the rest of this year. And we could be possibly surprised. But I think, risk adjustment as a methodology had served us well, and we'll continue to do that."

A lot of work with the providers and some unique opportunities with payors working on the pathways program between the physicians and the providers.

I think the entire organization has demonstrated a tremendous focus over these past 12 months or 15 months. A willingness to really attack the priorities with vigour and with discipline, and to compete very effectively. And so I think, we try to lay out a pathway as a leadership team for the organization. I think the organization has embraced it. I think that has been enabled by our reminding everybody in a daily basis about what it's all about, which is our customers. And so I think our ability to focus on customer needs helps mobilize the organization effectively. I'd also point to -- actually, our leadership team is just doing a tremendous job of charting a course of laying out a strategy of defining the deliverables and then going after them. So I will give credit to Mike and Mike who run the segments, and our team that's doing a good job with it. So I think that's certainly number one. And second, probably is just, again, I think we've been able to articulate the levers that are most important to pull. I think one of the challenges -- any time you're trying to shift course for business, there's so many things you want do, and it's about identifying those things that you think will have the most impact. And I can somewhat tell you, when I arrived at Cardinal, it takes three to six months to even know which levers you want to pull. And I think for us, pulling those wins that we know would be influencing margin and the whole notion of margin expansion were important. And those levers that related to working capital management were also important. That's sort of the general answer I would give you."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter call. Our fiscal 2011, or Q1 fiscal 2011, is off to a very good start. We reported revenu",1773,"Thanks, John, and our thoughts go out to Sally and her family during this difficult time. 
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter call. Our fiscal 2011, or Q1 fiscal 2011, is off to a very good start. We reported revenues for the first quarter of $24.4 billion and a non-GAAP EPS number of $0.64, up 19% over the prior year period.
And while we had a slight decline in overall revenues on a year-over-year basis, we generated a healthy expansion in gross margins and held SG&A essentially flat to the prior year. Our strong operating performance in the quarter was driven by excellent results in our Pharmaceutical segment, offsetting an expected difficult year-over-year comparison in our Medical segment. 
Overall, we continued our momentum coming out of fiscal 2010, strengthening the core of our business so we have a strong foundation from which to grow, with particular emphasis on margin expansion, disciplined management of working capital, growing generics at an accelerated rate and enhancing the customer experience. 
Our customer work is beginning to produce results as we look at our record of contract wins and renewals in the Medical segment and the continued strength with our retail independent customer base. We have a very strong balance sheet and continue to manage it carefully. And during the quarter, we demonstrated our commitment to a balanced capital deployment strategy. We increased our quarterly dividend payment. We completed the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions, and we repurchased $250 million in shares. Our operating initiatives are on track, and we continue our progress in positioning our company to deliver sustained growth. 
Now let me provide some additional color on each segment separately.
Performance in our Pharmaceutical segment, and in particular, our Pharma distribution business, really drove the company's overall operating performance in the quarter. Segment sales were down 1% versus the prior year period due to a drop in sales to existing bulk customers and the impact from the previously disclosed loss of two large-revenue customers last year. We will begin to lap those losses in the second half of fiscal 2011. Despite the slight decline in revenue, segment profit was outstanding, up 42% versus the first quarter of last year. And our segment profit rate increased by a robust 41 basis points.
Our improved profitability was driven primarily by outstanding performance in our generics business, various initiatives focused on improving margins and solid performance in our branded manufacturer agreements. We continue to build our capabilities and services to support our branded Pharma partners. And as a result, these relationships are strong.
As I mentioned, we had an excellent performance across our generic activities, both on the sales and sourcing side. Let me take a moment to provide a little more color on our progress in these areas. 
Our generic penetration continues to be a focus, and the team is executing exceptionally well in our SOURCE program across our retail independent customers and with our retail buying groups. The SOURCE program is our most comprehensive generics offering and includes nearly 4,000 generic drugs that make up essentially all of a retail pharmacy's product needs.
SOURCE revenues was up a robust 34% in the quarter versus the first quarter of last year. We have improved our execution on generic launches and have continued to enlist customers in our First Script autoshipment program. Success with these generic programs is resulting in value for our customers, for our suppliers and for us.
We also continue to make progress in our efforts to rebalance our business mix. Growth in our Retail Independent business continues to track ahead of the market, reflecting the emphasis we've placed on this channel in the past 18 months. And our churn rate at the end of the first quarter, which captures both controllable and non-controllable account losses, was the lowest it's been since we began measuring churn many years ago.
Turning to Nuclear. The raw material shortages we experienced through most of last year did resolve in the first quarter, and supply began to return to more normal levels after a long and difficult period of time.
Both the Chalk River reactor in Canada and the Petten reactor in the Netherlands were at full production by late September. Demand has not yet returned to pre-shortage levels, but we do expect to see this build over time. We have plans in place to help facilitate this shift with our customers in the coming months. In many ways, our relationship with our customers strengthened during the material shortages as we worked closely with them to ensure that the needs of the most critical patients were met first. 
We continued to expand our position in molecular imaging. And in our positron emission tomography or PET unit, we are now working on clinical trials for 17 new compounds. We've made excellent progress in the three quarters since we launched this initiative, and we are well positioned to support this PET bio tracers through post commercialization.  We will plan to give you a more complete view of our nuclear strategy at our Analyst Day in December.
We've made substantial progress on launching our new specialty division called Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions, which brings together all of our specialty capabilities within the Pharma segment, including specialty distribution, third-party logistics and cold chain management, drug development consulting and program management, regulatory and compliance services, risk mitigation strategies, medical billing and claims processing, sourcing and purchasing services and clinical pathways and treatment protocols.
We achieved an important milestone this quarter, closing on the acquisition of Healthcare Solutions, or P4 as it is known in the oncology community. Our P4 integration is on schedule and, as indicated previously, we expect it to be substantially complete by the end of the next quarter.
We are building a world-class management team in our new specialty division. In addition to retaining the leadership of P4, including founders Raj Mantena and Dr. Jeffrey Scott, we've attracted a great leader to run the overall Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions division. Meghan FitzGerald, our new President, has extensive healthcare industry experience focusing on specialty products. Her background includes senior roles in corporate development, strategy and international operations with companies including Medco, Pfizer and Merck.
Also joining us is Dr. Bruce Steinberg. Most recently, Bruce was President and CEO of Georgia Cancer Specialists, a Top 10 private cancer practice and leader in advanced cancer treatment and research. And the work we've done over the past month to build out our specialty physical infrastructure is largely complete. 
We've also been working close with all stakeholders to solidify our partnerships and introduce Cardinal Health expanded specialty capabilities. Our value proposition connects patients, physicians, payors and pharmaceutical manufactures with the goal to improve access to efficient, high-quality care. A key component of our value proposition is P4 Pathways, which brings together payors and practices. We believe this capability, in conjunction with the pharmacy management core competency we have within our pharmacy solutions unit, will give us a competitive advantage.
The timing is right for this important focus on integrated care. We continue to be very excited about our specialty strategy and our P4 acquisition, and we plan to show more details on our model in progress at our Analyst and Investor Day in December.
Now let me discuss our Medical segment. The quarter came in about as expected. Segment sales were down 3%, and segment profit was down 28% versus the prior year. Given the unusual comparisons in the quarter, I'll let Jeff walk you through the details, but let me give you an overall perspective on our progress.
We completed the rollout of our segment strategy around channel and category management during the quarter. This was an important change management staff to align the entire segment around the common goals for our customers and leverage our own strengths.
We continue to build out our preferred product portfolio and feel very good about our expanded global sourcing capabilities and our presence in Asia to drive this strategy. Our medical transformation initiative continues to progress and has moved into the build-and-test phase for the distribution solutions. 
Our Ambulatory business, where we have made investments to grow our footprint, grew well ahead of the market. And the cross-selling effort with the Pharma segment continues to pick up speed.
I'd like to take just a moment to give you my observations on the demand side in our Medical markets. Demand in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was very similar to demand in the fourth quarter fiscal 2010. We have continued to see some sluggishness in elective procedure and doctor visits, both of which have an impact on the demand for our products in some of our Medical businesses. 
Having said this, I've spent a fair amount of time in recent weeks in the field speaking to hospital executives. And I'm guardedly optimistic that procedural volumes will gradually recover. Granted, this is by no means a scientific sample. We'll be following the situation closely, and we'll provide updates during our scheduled calls. We are taking a cautious approach and will continue to model a relatively soft market until we see these anecdotal observations begin to show up in the data.
Our recent account wins are giving us greater confidence that the actions we've taken over the last year to enhance the value we deliver to our customer are bearing fruit, and validate our channel and category strategy as well as our ability to execute. 
 
We recently won a major multi-year product agreement with HPG, a group purchasing organization that supports nearly 1,400 acute care facilities. And in addition to a number of recent renewals and new account wins, we signed large multi-year contracts with Baylor Healthcare System and another renowned academic medical center, that draws on the depth and beadth of our supply-chain offerings across our Medical businesses.
We are competing effectively in the Medical segment. We are positioned well, and we will continue to invest where we see opportunities for growth.
In summary, we're continuing the momentum we felt during the course of fiscal 2010. This was a strong quarter and a very good start to fiscal 2011. And I'm confident in our strategy and in our ability to perform.
13 reporting weeks into the year, there's plenty of game still to be played. But based on our performance in the first quarter and our progress on key initiatives in both segments, we've become more confident in achieving the higher end of the guidance range we provided in August.
Now let me hand the call over to Jeff, to provide more financial details."
172207,114084285,82977,"Cardinal Health, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Cardinal Health, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Like George, I am very pleased with the results of the quarter and the momentum we have carried over from fiscal 2010. Q1 is an excellent start to our year. Let me add to George's remarks by",1929,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Like George, I am very pleased with the results of the quarter and the momentum we have carried over from fiscal 2010. Q1 is an excellent start to our year. 
Let me add to George's remarks by expanding on some financial trends and drivers in the first quarter. I'll also provide some color to the full fiscal year outlook, including some of our key expectations from a corporate and segment standpoint.
Let's start with the consolidated results for the first quarter, summarized on Slide 4. Despite a slight revenue decline, we delivered 6% gross margin growth and, with the benefit of relatively flat expenses, leveraged that into 15% non-GAAP operating earnings growth.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were up less than 1% as expense efficiencies largely offset the business expenses added to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.
The non-GAAP tax rate was 37.1%, largely in line with our expectation for the full year, but above last year's rate of 35.4%. We benefited from the $450 million in share repurchases we've executed over the past two quarters, including $250 million in Q1, resulting in a significant reduction in share count to just under 352 million diluted shares outstanding.
Importantly, we continue to make real progress on our two key financial metrics: margin expansion and net working capital optimization. At the consolidated level, the gross margin rate increased to 3.94%, which is an improvement of 27 basis points versus Q1 of FY '10 and 24 basis points sequentially versus Q4, driven by gains in our Pharmaceutical segment.  The non-GAAP operating margin rate improved 22 basis points versus last year's Q1 to 1.52%. 
We also saw further improvement in our net working capital days. Although inventory days did not come down this quarter, we reduced our days sales outstanding and realized a market improvement in days payable, driven by changes in one of our large vendor agreements. We continued to build on our Lean Operational Excellence initiatives to optimize working capital levels in fiscal '11, with the goal of sustaining and improving upon the gains achieved last year.
To summarize, we are making great progress with our performance initiatives, and it's beginning to consistently show in our key metrics. Although we'll always see some quarterly fluctuations in margin rate trends and working capital levels due to the nature of our business and external factors, we feel we have the actions in place to continue to move these in the right direction. 
Let me now provide a few other comments on segment performance in Q1, referring primarily to Slide 5 and 6 and starting with the Pharma segment. Revenue in the segment declined 1%. This primarily reflects three major items. First, bulk sales for existing customers were down, driven by changes in ordering patterns from some of our large bulk customers, including the year-on-year impact of some large Tamiflu orders which occurred in fiscal '10. 
Second, as disclosed previously, we continue to feel the impact of ending our relationship with two large-revenue customers in the mail order and grocery chain pharmacy segments, which dampened sales growth by approximately 1.2 percentage points in Q1. We will begin to lap this revenue losses by mid fiscal 2011. Third, we also had a dilutive effect on revenue mix from the conversion of certain brands to generics. 
In addition to driving down overall sales, these three items had a disproportionate impact on sales to bulk customers, which were down 8% for the quarter.  However, I'm pleased to report that sales to non-bulk customers were up 6% for the period. 
Within this customer category, revenues from retail independents grew 3%, continuing to grow at a rate above the market in this important class of trade. Our overall generics revenue growth was nearly 20%, driven by an impressive 34% growth in our generics preferred SOURCE program.
The Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 41 basis points compared to prior year's Q1. In addition to the continued success of our generic sales and sourcing programs, we also saw more than expected benefit from new item generic launches during the quarter. Solid performance under our branded manufacturer agreements and brand inflation from our remaining price-contingent vendors were also positive drivers. 
Please keep in mind that we benefited year-on-year from the impact of certain large pharma vendors, which transitioned to DFA agreements. Finally, I should point out that we had a change in estimated reserves related to DFA fees receivable from certain manufacturers, which contributed $9 million dollars in the quarter.
We realized margin expansion in both our bulk and non-bulk customer segments. For the quarter, the bulk segment profit margin rate was 37 basis points, and our non-bulk rate was 2.17%. Both of these rates are significantly above last year's first quarter rates and the annual average for fiscal 2010.
A reminder that we are not planning to provide a detailed bulk/non-bulk margin quarterly breakdown in our 10-Qs going forward. But we do want to make you aware of a fairly significant change in trend during this call. 
Bottom line, the segment had exceptional performance throughout and drove an increase in segment profit of 42% to $296 million.
Now turning to our Medical segment. As George mentioned, the first quarter had a bit of noise around it. But overall, we're pleased with where the business is heading. Revenue for the segment declined by 3% to $2.17 billion, primarily as a result of our prior year revenue recognition event that was triggered by the spinoff of CareFusion in the amount of $51 million, as well as a tough compare against an early and strong flu season in the first half of fiscal 2010 worth $28 million in the quarter. Excluding these two unique events, the segment would've experienced positive revenue growth. Importantly, our inventory business grew at a rate of over 5%, which is significantly above market over the same time period.
Medical segment profit declined 28% to $83 million, mainly due to the combined effect of last year's unique items, namely, the CareFusion revenue recognition issue, which was worth about $14 million of profit, and a flu impact of approximately $5 million. Increase in commodity prices also created a year-on-year headwind in our current-period cost of goods sold of about $15 million. All told, these items totaled a reduction in segment profit growth of 30 percentage points.
Net-net, despite the current short-term sluggishness we are seeing in the procedural market, our Medical business is gaining momentum. And we are continuing to invest in systems and strategy to drive longer-term growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me turn to Slide 7, and take a moment to walk you through the items that accounted for the difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS numbers. All these figures that I'll review are on an after-tax basis. 
The biggest item in this category is a $75 million gain from the sale of 30.5 million shares of CareFusion stock in the quarter. This generated proceeds of $706 million and accounted for approximately $0.21 of GAAP EPS.
Please note that there is no tax impact associated with the sale due to the release of a previously established deferred tax valuation allowance. The sale of these shares completes the liquidation of our CareFusion stake. 
The remaining items on this page, which is restructuring and severance, acquisition-related costs and other spin-off costs netted to approximately a $0.01 reduction. The net of all these items result in a GAAP EPS of $0.84 versus non-GAAP of $0.64.
Let's briefly shift our discussion to the balance sheet. Several significant items which impacted it are listed on Slide 8. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash, which about $313 million is held overseas. We maintained a strong liquidity position in spite of over $750 million in total outflows related to share repurchases and our acquisition of Healthcare Solutions. 
Our cash position was bolstered by the sale of our remaining CareFusion stake and $217 million in operating cash flow. One item of note. As you compare this year's operating cash flow to last year's figure, keep in mind that we had a $144 million of benefit in last year's number related to CareFusion ongoing operations for the two months that it was still part of Cardinal Health.
Now to answer a question that I suspect is on many of your minds, let me reiterate our position regarding our capital deployment. Our first priorities are to maintain our differentiated dividend and ensure we are investing appropriately in our organic capital expenditures. In the latter regard, we expect to invest in the range of $260 million this year, about the same as last, with the majority of that in IT-related processes and systems. 
Beyond that, we don't have a fixed formula. Our goal is to ensure that we are positioning for sustainable competitive advantage and to create shareholder value. Towards those ends, we will continue to evaluate both acquisitions in select strategic areas and share repurchases. We don't envision the paydown of our existing long-term debt balance in our current plans.
Now let's turn our discussion to fiscal '11 guidance. As George mentioned, we do only have one quarter behind us at this point, so there's still plenty of year left. However, given our performance and our progress in key initiatives, we become more confident in achieving the higher end of our previously announced non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $2.38 to $2.48. 
Our overall revenue guidance remains unchanged at low single-digit growth despite a slightly more cautious view of med/surg market volumes. 
Slide 10 outlines some of our key corporate expectations for the year. Let me focus on the items in red, which represent changes from our previous assumptions shared in our August call.
Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding are now projected to be approximately 352 million, reflecting the timing and per share acquisition cost of the $250 million of repurchases that were completed in Q1. Interest expense and other, should be $110 million or so. Our Q1 number is abnormally low due to the impact of interest rate swaps, FX and deferred compensation gains realized in the quarter.
Now I'll spend a few minutes going through some of the segment-specific assumptions in more detail, starting with just a few items related to the Pharma business on Slide 11. Given a relatively strong start to the year from a generic launch standpoint, we now expect a neutral to slightly positive earnings effect from generic launches versus fiscal '10. 
Within nuclear pharmacy, the resumption of normal supply was consistent with our original expectations. We expect it to be relatively stable for the remainder of the year. And the integration of our Healthcare Solutions acquisition is on track, and we continue to expect it to have a neutral to slightly accretive EPS impact on fiscal 2011.
Finally, turning to Slide 12 in the Medical segment. As George mentioned, we're now being slightly more cautious on our volume outlook for the year, which is reflected in our flat market growth expectation. The rest of our assumptions remain pretty much intact. Commodity prices have remained largely in line with our original projections, as oil prices have stayed in a fairly tight range, around the $80 per barrel level that we budgeted for. And we continue to focus resources and investment on the Medical Transformation project, which remains on track for the majority of its implementation to occur in fiscal 2012.

But in terms of items of note in the first quarter, which may be more onetime-ish in nature, first of all, there were probably $0.04 of onetime-type items in the first quarter. Non-operating items. For example, we had that accounting estimate change within Pharma related to the recognition of DFA fees. That was worth about $0.02, and that was a very unique item that won't replicate itself again. Secondly, within interest and other, we had about $0.02 of benefit from interest rate swap income and deferred compensation gains. And again, we don't forecast those happening in future quarters. So you could say that another $0.02 of somewhat unique items. And then I referenced earlier that contingent price increase that we had in Q1, which is the pull-ahead from Q3, and that's another $0.02. So I would say those are the three unique items that I would point out. As we go forward in the year, I don't want to get into specific quarterly guidance, but clearly, this was a unusual year, or unusual quarter for Medical. There were just a lot of year-on-year headwinds that we had to overcome. So I would say it was sort of an extraordinary negative growth rate for Medical, which we don't anticipate repeating for the rest of the year. So as we sort of look forward to the rest of the year, I'll repeat what we said earlier, that we're continuing to be relatively cautious about overall demand, particularly procedural demand within med/surge. Hopefully, it does better than we're expecting. But I think at this point, it's probably prudent to be appropriately conservative on that. And we continue to risk adjust our generic launches. We had some good launches in Q1, including a couple that weren't expected. But as you know, as we look forward, we generally risk adjust all the uncertain launches. And we continue to do that for the rest of this year. And we could be possibly surprised. But I think, risk adjustment as a methodology has served us well, and we'll continue to do that."

Beyond that, it's really about looking for opportunities to create value for all of our shareholders. And we'll certainly continue to look at ways to reposition. And if there's the right opportunity to do that, that, we think, it creates for us a competitive advantage and opportunity to generate value for our shareholders, we'll pursue those opportunities. But we'll also have to look opportunistically at where we are in cash position. And as Jeff said, to the extent that we're not seeing the right opportunities, the right price with the right strategic interests -- we sort of are not interested in trapping cash and to the extent that we want to do something different with a repurchase, then certainly we'll consider that."

So we would like to be able to take advantage of the strength of Cardinal's overall business and tie it to the work that we're doing in specialty. And certainly, distribution is one thing we'd like to see grow. But beyond that, we really are working right now across the spectrum. A lot of work with the providers and some unique opportunities with payors working on the Pathways program between the physicians and the providers. And so I would say, the first pass will be driving our oncology position. Not a horizontal move, John.  I would say, first, it's more vertical. Driving the strength there, trying to create value across our specialty businesses. We have a lot of assets and tools to deploy here. And then, sort of a next stage I think will be a more broad look as we move horizontally into some other therapeutic areas."

I think the entire organization has demonstrated a tremendous focus over these past 12 months or 15 months. A willingness to really attack the priorities with vigor and with discipline, and to compete very effectively. And so I think, we try to lay out a pathway as a leadership team for the organization. I think the organization has embraced it. I think that has been enabled by our reminding everybody on a daily basis about what it's all about, which is our customers. And so I think our ability to focus on customer needs helps mobilize the organization effectively. I would also point to, actually, our leadership team is just doing a tremendous job of charting a course, of laying out a strategy of defining the deliverables and then going after them. So I will give credit to Mike and Mike, who run the segments, and our team that's doing a good job with it. So I think that's certainly number one. And second probably is just, again, I think we've been able to articulate the levers that are most important to pull. I think one of the challenges -- any time you're trying to shift course for business, there's so many things you want do, and it's about identifying those things that you think will have the most impact. And I can certainly tell you, when I arrived at Cardinal, it takes three to six months to even know which levers that you want to pull. And I think for us, pulling those ones that we know would be influencing margin and the whole notion of margin expansion were important. And those levers that related to working capital management were also very important. That's sort of the general answer I would give you."
