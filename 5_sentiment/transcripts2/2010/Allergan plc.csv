We completed the fourth quarter and full year 2009 with strong results across the Company. We grew overall revenues and profitability, we invested in the growth of our Generic and Brand businesses, we expanded globally, restructured our balance sheet and we continue to focus on making Watson one of the most profitable pharmaceutical companies in the industry.
Some of our achievements for 2009 are strengthening our generic business with the launch of eight products and we filed 36 ANDAs with the Food and Drug Administration. At year-end, we had over 100 applications pending in the U.S. plus more than 240 filings outside of the U.S.
On the Brand side we launched two important new products and realigned our sales and marketing organization to better present our expanding urology and women’s health portfolio to targeted physicians.
Since year-end, we have taken a number of significant steps to grow our Brand business with more to come. We also made excellent progress on our global supply chain initiative with additional savings being recognized in 2009.
We also restructured our balance sheet and finished 2009 with the solid financial position, which will allow us to invest in future growth. And finally, we put the talent in place to support our new global operating structure.
Our fourth quarter and full year financial results were at or above expectations across all of our businesses. As a reminder, the following results include approximately four weeks of Arrow.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was 57 million or $0.51 per diluted share based on a 22% increase in net revenue of $786 million. Adjusted cash net income for the quarter increased 28% to $94 million or $0.85 per share. The increase in adjusted net income was driven by the contribution of new products and continued savings from our global supply chain initiative in 2009.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter increased 32% to $189 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2009 grew 22% to $689 million. Cash flow from operations was strong at 141 million for the fourth quarter and 377 million for the full year.
Now, I’ll provide some highlights from our three business segments. Global Generics net revenues increased 27% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Adjusted gross profit in our Global Generics segments increased 37% to $218 million for the quarter. Our adjusted gross margin was 46.7%, up over 340 basis points year-over-year.
We continued to increase volumes at our India site contributing to lower overall manufacturing costs. In addition, the phase out of our Carmel, New York facility and increased volume in our daily Florida facility has resulted in significant savings. We expect the global supply chain initiative to provide continued benefits in 2010 and beyond.
We increased our investment in R&D by 21% to $43 million during the quarter and by 18% to $140 million for the full year. A portion of this increase comes from the inclusion of Arrow’s R&D for December, but overall, is consistent with our continued emphasis to aggressively file new product applications.
Since January, we have further expanded our disclosed U.S. patent challenge portfolio with the initiation of challenges for Generic Lidoderm, Nuvigil, LoSeasonique, Rozerem and Implensa [ph].
Moving now to the Brand division, total revenue for our Brand division was up by 5% in the fourth quarter over the same period last year influenced by the higher co-promotion revenue from AndroGel and Femring.
The 2009 launches of RAPAFLO and GELNIQUE in the urology arena, continue to grow at an average TRX growth rate of 35% quarter-over-quarter. Brand adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter was 81.5% versus 78.4% last year. As we mentioned, however, we expect our Brand margins to decrease in 2010 as we work to replace Ferrlecit, which was a high margin product for us.
As you know, we signed a license agreement for a value brand with Ferrlecit with GeneraMedix which we expect to replace a portion of the revenue generated from Ferrlecit. This product is currently pending approval with the FDA.
We also filed an NDA for a six-month formulation of TRELSTAR with an assigned PDUFA date in March and we expect to launch this product in the second quarter of 2010.
As we explained during our Analyst day, we are focused on aggressively growing our Brand business through both business development and internal R&D projects.
I would like to now discuss two of the concluded deals. Earlier this month, we announced an agreement with HRA to become the commercial partner for a novel next-generation emergency contraceptive, which is currently marketed in the UK as LO-1 [ph]. This product will provide a new important alternative to the current emergency contraceptives on the market.
Clinical results published in Lancet and the Green Journal are significant and we are optimistic about the prospects of providing U.S. women with a new emergency contraceptive option.
The next deal was certainly critical to our long-term goal of being a major player in biologics, as we purchased the remaining 64% of Eden Biodesign for approximately $15 million, which will be part of our Brand division.
Eden will provide the foundation for Watson to accelerate our activities for development and commercialization of both Biosimilars and Biobetters for the global market. We are very pleased to add Eden team to our Watson family.
Lastly, we continue to pursue additional product acquisitions and as we mentioned at our Analyst day, we are in late stage discussions on a number of new women’s health opportunities, including a product for infertility, long acting contraceptive that includes a novel progestin and a late-stage product that will take us into labor and delivery. We anticipate providing you with updates on these initiatives in the very near future.
Turning now to our Distribution division, ANDA had a better than expected sales in the fourth quarter, primarily due to sales of new third-party products including generic versions of Valtrex and Prevacid. ANDA also benefited from the relaunch in the quarter of generic Pulmicort as well as an increase in third-party Brand sales.
And with that I’ll turn the call over to Todd, he can take us through the financials in more detail. Todd?

We increased revenues across all our businesses and increased operating margins as well. We acquired Arrow in December, refinanced our convertible debt at favorable rates and finished the year with a strong balance sheet and capital structure.
Our Global Supply Chain initiative continued to yield cost savings and we expect additional savings in 2010. We are also able to increase R&D investment to enhance our product pipeline and support future growth. Clearly, we are entering 2010 very strong financially.
I will now review our fourth quarter financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis, which includes the results of Arrow since December 2nd. For the fourth quarter of 2009, consolidated net revenue was 786 million, an increase of 22% from the prior year period.
Excluding the impact of Arrow, Watson’s standalone revenues grew 15% year-over-year. Net revenue for our Generic division was 467 million, up 27% on a year-over-year basis. The increase was primarily due to new products such as the Toprol ER and increased sales of potassium chloride and oral contraceptives.
Sales of oral contraceptives were 95 million in the fourth quarter, up 19% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the addition of two new products during the year as read in Next Choice.
Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was 46.7%, up 3.4 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. The increase reflects lower year-over-year unit manufacturing costs as a result of our Global Supply Chain initiative and higher margins on new products.
On a sequential quarter basis, the generic adjusted gross margin declined 3.7 percentage points as the third quarter margin was favorably impacted by product mix.
Moving to the Brand division, net revenue was 121 million, up 5% from the prior year period and 7% sequentially. Product sales were 102 million, roughly flat with the prior year. Sales from our 2009 launches of RAPAFLO and GELNIQUE as well as strong sales of AndroGel and TRELSTAR were offset by lower sales of Ferrlecit.
The agreement with Sanofi expired at year-end. Ferrlecit’s sales in the fourth quarter were 24, million down 11 million on a year-over-year basis. Brand other revenue was 19 million for the quarter, an increase of 43% over the prior year, due to higher co-promote revenue from AndroGel and co-promote revenue from Femring which was not present in the prior year quarter. Brand adjusted gross margin was 81.5% roughly flat with the third quarter of this year.
Finally, net revenue from our Distribution segment was 197 million, up 35 million or 22% from the prior year period, due to an increase in third-party product launches included in the generic versions of Valtrex and Pulmicort. We also had higher sales of third-party Brand products in the quarter.
Distribution segment adjusted gross margin was 14.6%, down one percentage point from last year. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin is due to an increase in Brand sales which carry a lower gross margin.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses. Consolidated R&D spending for the fourth quarter was 61 million, up 27% compared to the prior year period due to higher product development spending in our Generics and Brand division. This also includes one month of R&D spending from Arrow. For the full year 2010, we expect total R&D spending in the range of 240 million to 260 million.
SG&A for the fourth quarter was 137 million, an increase of 26 million over the prior year period. Roughly, half of this increase is due to the inclusion of Arrow in our fourth quarter results. The remainder is primarily due to higher litigation cost and higher promotional spending in our Brand division. For 2010, we expect SG&A to be between $630 million and $680 million.
Amortization for the fourth quarter was 27 million, an increase of 7 million over the prior year. This includes amortization of product rights acquired as part of the Arrow acquisition. For 2010, we expect amortization expense to be roughly 170 million.
As discussed in our recent Analyst day, we will be supplementing our GAAP earnings disclosure with adjusted cash basis reporting, which excludes amortization expense and so there are certain other adjustments as disclosed in the reconciliation table of our earnings release.
On an adjusted cash basis, earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.85 per share compared with $0.64 per share in the prior year quarter. The current year adjusted cash results exclude 22 million or $0.12 per share of Watson standalone amortization expense and roughly 27 million of total amortization expense.
We’re reporting 2009 results on an adjusted cash basis due to the inclusion of Arrow in our fourth quarter results. Our adjusted cash basis results also exclude 21.6 million in acquisition and licensing related charges, 7.8 million in costs associated with our global supply chain initiative and 2.4 million legal settlement. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.51 per share.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was 189 million, up 32% compared with the prior year period and up 6% on a sequential quarter basis reflecting strong contributions from all three divisions.
Cash flow from operations was 141 million for the quarter and 377 million for the year. Our GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year was 36.5% and 38.8% respectively. The lower tax rate in the fourth quarter was due to the recognition of 1.8 million in deferred tax assets.
For 2010, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be roughly 40% primarily due to non-deductible expenses associated with the Arrow acquisition. On an adjusted cash basis, we expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 38%.
We ended the year with 1.46 billion of debt and 215 million in cash and marketable securities. We currently have 250 million of undrawn capacity on a revolving credit facility. As of year-end, our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA was roughly 2.1 times and our debt-to-capital ratio was approximately 33%.
Our capital structure provides us with sufficient flexibility to strategically invest in the business and achieve our growth objectives going forward.
With that I will turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2010 forecast and concluding remarks.

We continue to estimate full year net revenues at approximately $3.5 billion. We expect Global Generic revenue to be between 2.2 billion and 2.4 billion with international revenues of $550 million to $610 million.
The assumptions include a first half launch of generic Toprol XL 100 and 200 mg strength and a first half launch of generic Cardizem LA. We now expect competition on generic Toprol later in 2010 and we continue to anticipate minimal competition on generic Micro-K. We continue to have no major patent challenges included in our forecast, including generic Concerta, Lovenox and Pulmicort.
On the Brand side of the business we expect net revenue to be between $440 million and $480 million for the year. The assumptions include a first half launch of TRELSTAR six month and the launch of a value brand version of Ferrlecit in the first half as well. In addition, we have included revenue from a product resulting from a business development opportunity yet to be disclosed.
In the ANDA Distribution business we anticipate revenue to be between $670 million and $740 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA of 760 million to 810 million and adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.05 to $3.30 in line with the previous forecast we provided at our Analyst day. Regarding our quarterly progression of earnings, we expect our earnings to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year.
In summary, 2009 was a remarkable year for Watson. We delivered a 10% increase in net revenues to $2.8 billion. We delivered 24% increase in net income to $349 million and an adjusted cash basis, we delivered a return of $3.04 per share. For the full year 2009, adjusted EBITDA was $689 million and cash flow from operations was a strong 377 million.
We are proud of these results and are committed to continuing to grow Watson in 2010 and to deliver on our goal of a 10% compound annual growth rate over the next three years and
Now, I’ll turn it back to Patty for questions and answers. Patty?

Obviously, the more products we’re able to move into that facility, the better off our margins will be. Also, we would expect to see more of an impact in 2010 of our own API production out of our facility in Ambernath, which is the outside of Mumbai. So more to come on the global supply chain initiative. We did see a pretty strong inclusion in gross margin, particularly, on the generic side.
I think where you should think about the generic margins are consistent with what we talked about at Analyst day, which is sort of in the high 40s, high 40 range. A lot of that fluctuation, I guess, the three percentage point fluctuation we saw was due principally to product mix, the more new launches we have with limited competition, higher the margin, and therefore higher the gross margin in total. So you’ll see some movement around that high 40s range affecting in the third quarter we saw as high as 50%, but probably high 40s is good.
On the Brand side, having to replace Ferrlecit, as everybody knows, that was a very high margin product skewed our margins up a bit. I think most people have not brought those Brand margins down probably low enough. Probably, there we’re looking more in the 70 range as opposed to the 80 range we were before.

I expect that over 2010, the generic playing field will be somewhat stable for a number of reasons, principally, economic conditions, customer consolidation, and general lack of approvals coming out of the FDA.
As I’ve often said on pricing and if you want to call it instability in the market, comes from an event and generally, the event is a new competitor getting an approval and coming into the marketplace, looking to get some market share, which generally lowers pricing. But the FDA being backlogged as they are and we certainly have seen that in spades, I would expect that until that issue is resolved one positive is the stability in the pricing arena.

We’re trying to get them through the agency, as I said, it’s become somewhat of a more difficult task than I certainly have seen in my 20 years in the industry.
Regarding competition of metoprolol, we’ve moved it back because of basic what we’ve heard from other people talking about their current state of their application so we thought it was appropriate to move those numbers back a little bit.
Regarding the progression of earnings, I think it’s important for you recognize that the fourth quarter, for example, had about, I believe $24 million in Ferrlecit’s sales in the fourth quarter that simply won’t be there in the first quarter. And as I just mentioned it's pretty high margin product. So what we will see is an increase.
You need to take that into consideration as you’re thinking about what the first quarter numbers are going to look like and as it grows throughout the year, our revenue and profitability grows throughout the year from other product launches, we’ll be replacing that but that income will be more backward weighted. To be specific about it, that Ferrlecit accounts for about $0.12.

Just back to the issue of FDA and backlog of ANDAs, can you give us some sense from your perspective, impact on larger companies versus smaller companies, if it’s somewhat indiscriminate or maybe it’s just the smaller companies might be feeling it more because of the nature of their products or perhaps the concentration of products? And then just in terms of the commentary around expectations for competition on Toprol XL as well as expectation on the strength that you haven’t received approval on, how much of that do you think is specific to this product and the issues that we’re familiar with the product versus the general resource issues at the FDA?

I think there is both things are contributing to what I guess are delays in the approval of Metoprolol and Cardizem. There’s clearly a lack of sufficient resources at the FDA to process all of the applications that are pending. The single individuals are being asked to review multiple products and they become through really no fault of their own a bottleneck.
We also experienced the unfortunate event of the 200 year snowstorm in Washington which shut down the FDA for somewhere between five days to seven days, pushing back PDUFA dates and approval dates. It’s not something that was welcome because everybody was delayed already and then to throw five days to seven days of no activity on top of that was even more difficult to deal with.
I think as we talked about at the GPhA Association Meeting last week that FDA told us the backlog of ANDAs and FDAs now over 1900, mean approval times are over 26 months for approval times. That affects both big companies and small companies. Probably, disproportionately, hurts the smaller companies because their life blood, like ours, is new product approval. The reason why it doesn’t hurt us quite as much is because we have a basket of over 170 different molecules we’re currently manufacturing. So our continued cash flow is not really at risk, but for smaller companies, it becomes quite difficult.
I think the answer ultimately is that we need to continue to push for additional funding for the Office of Generic Drugs and also their compliance group so that those groups don’t cause delays. And as we said at our GPhA Meeting that Watson and other members of the industry are willing and able to negotiate a user fee program that should help fund some of the activities that offer the generic drugs to get these backlogs brought down to something more reasonable.

Our resu",1409,"Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone, and thank you, for joining us today. We began 2010 with an exceptionally strong performance across all of our businesses, and we entered into the second quarter with a great deal of positive momentum. Our results also reflect the first full quarter contributions from our newly acquired international businesses.
Net revenue for the first quarter increased 28% to $857 million. Adjusted cash net income for the quarter increased 25% to $100 million or $0.81 per share, and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter increased 26% to $199 million. Additionally, cash flow from operations was $112 million. We used our strong cash flow in the quarter to reduce our outstanding debt by $220 million and also to increase our investment in Biologics. We finished the quarter with $182 million in cash and investments on hand. And we made considerable progress on our global objectives, capitalized on favorable industry dynamics and certainly exceeded our financial expectations. With this strong momentum, we are increasing our forecast for 2010, raising adjusted cash EPS to between $3.25 and $3.45 and adjusted EBITDA to between $800 million and $850 million.
Now I'd like to run through some of the year-to-date highlights. In our Global Generics business, we received FDA approval for several key generic products. In the U.S., this includes Diltiazem LA, which we launched in March and the 100-milligram and 200-milligram doses of metoprolol ER, which we launched in the 3rd week of April, allowing us to now compete in all dosage forms of that product, x U.S. we received approval for Clopidogrel in Australia, and the product was recently launched.
Even with the challenges in many markets, we continue to expect to achieve double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in Canada, France and Australia this year.
In Global Generics R&D, we have announced 10 new patent challenges to date, including the blockbuster Lidoderm and more recently, Rapamune. In our Global Brand business we received FDA approval for our six-month formulation of TRELSTAR, the first and only intramuscular GnRH agonist available for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer that can be stored at room temperature. We began shipping this product ahead of schedule on April 15.
We completed a number of brand business development initiatives discussed with you at our Analyst Day, adding significant breadth to our women's health franchise in our Biologics capabilities, which I'll summarize in a few moments.
Since the close of the Arrow acquisition, integration has been going according to plan. Our Global Operations team has been actively reviewing all our supply chain capabilities. We have concluded that excess capacity at other facilities notably, Malta and India, is adequate to absorb current product from our Toronto manufacturing facility, as well as projected manufacturing needs. Additionally, these sites can do so in a more favorable cost. As a result, we announced to our Toronto-based employees a few weeks ago, that we plan to close our Toronto [audio gap] facility by the end of 2011. We expect to realize significant operating cost savings, as well as lower overall cost of goods related to this initiative.
I'd like to also spend a moment updating you on healthcare reform, which is being phased in over several years and will influence our U.S. brands and Generic businesses in different ways and at different stages during the implementation. Near-term industry changes resulting from healthcare reform, include increases in Medicaid rebates for both brand and generic products and the addition of rebates for patients in Medicare managed care plans or dual eligibles. Beginning next year, our Brand division will began funding its portion of the Medicare donut hole and will be contributing the excise tax based on market share of our NDAs. Longer term on the Generic side, we anticipate that there will be an overall increase in utilization of Generic Pharmaceuticals due to increases in total number of Americans now having access to prescription drug benefits. While there are still some questions on how healthcare reform will be implemented, we have factored these changes into our revised forecast.
Generally speaking, the impact to our business is relatively modest and is far outweighed by growth that we’re seeing in our Generic businesses and overall pricing stability.
I would now like to provide you with some details on our three business segments. Global Generics net revenues were $544 million, an increase of 35% and include x U.S. net product sales of $106 million. Sales on our Oral Contraceptive business were $90 million in the first quarter, and our U.S. Generics over performance in the quarter was driven by three factors; strong sales of extended-release products, higher volumes and increased efficiencies, which are contributing to lower overall product costs. We also experienced lower generic price erosion in the U.S. than originally participated, which also provided some upside.
Internationally, we experienced pricing pressure in some of our overseas markets such as France, the U.K. and Canada. There are changing dynamics within these markets that we will continue to watch closely. While these actions are happening swifter than expected, we have been anticipating these changes as governments look to control their healthcare expenditures. Ultimately, we anticipate increased utilization of Generics overall and based on our current market share, product offerings and pipeline, we believe that we can continue to grow these markets over the long term.
During the quarter, we increased our investment in Generic R&D by 40% to $42 million. We concluded the quarter with over 100 ANDAs on file with the U.S. FDA and with 77 Paragraph IV challenges and more than 900 applications pending outside of the U.S. Close to half of the U.S. Paragraph IV opportunities are first-to-file or shared exclusivity opportunities.
Moving to our Global Brands division, revenue was $91 million, down $21 million as anticipated in the first quarter. This decrease reflects the planned lost of Ferrlecit, which was returned to Santa Fe at the end of 2009 and was offset somewhat by the addition of our new products RAPAFLO and Gelnique. More recently, we are experiencing increased prescription transfer for RAPAFLO as result of Flomax going generic in March and also seeing growth in Gelnique due to increased promotion and reach by our sales force. We expect both products to be important contributors to our Global Brands business over the longer term.
Additionally, we continue to expect FDA approval of the generic version of Ferrlecit in the first half of 2010, recall that we signed a licensing agreement with GeneraMedix to market this product upon FDA approval, and we will be promoting it within our Brand division.
Since January, we have taken significant steps to expand our Brand business.  We announced an agreement with HRA to become the commercial partner for a novel next generation emergency contraceptive, which is currently marketed in the U.K. as ellaOne. The FDA advisory committee on reproductive health will be meeting on June 17 to discuss this product. We also announced a licensing agreement with the Population Council to commercialize an investigational vaginal contraceptive ring in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The ring is currently in Phase III clinical development for contraceptive use for up to one year.
We also announced an agreement during the quarter to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to the Colombia’s bioadhesive progesterone gel products currently marketed under the trade names CRINONE and Prochieve, for the indications of infertility and secondary amenorrhea. Under the agreement, we will also collaborate on the ongoing Phase III development program toward a new indication for the prevention of preterm birth and women with a short cervix, as well as global development program for a second generation product for this indication. Of course this transaction is still subject to certain closing conditions and we continue to work with Columbia to get those conditions satisfied.
Lastly, we purchased the remaining 64% of Eden Biodesign for the development and commercialization of Biologics. Since the acquisition, we have approved several contract manufacturing projects designed to increase the near-term third-party revenue, while we simultaneously worked to implement internal R&D projects for Watson’s own Biologics development efforts.
Turning now to our Distribution business, and it had revenues of $221 million, an increase of 44%. Large contributors to ANDAs growth were new generic third party product launches notably generic versions of Aldara and Flomax, as well as additional brand products sales. With that, and I'll turn the call over to Todd to take us through some of the financials. Todd?"
36478,100703025,60567,"Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-10-2010",2010-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","The solid financial performance in the first quarter has us off to a good start for 2010.

We experienced strong earnings in cash flow. Our liquidity improved with the sale of our interest in Scinopharm, and we used the proceeds and excess operating cash flow to reduce revolver borrowings. Our strong balance sheet has us well-positioned to capitalize on strategic investment opportunities, in support of our long-term growth objectives.
I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis, which includes a full quarter of our new Global business. For the first quarter of 2010, consolidated net revenues was $857 million, an increase of 28% over the prior year period. Net revenue for our Generic division was $544 million, up 35% on a year-over-year basis. This includes x U.S. product sales of $106 million, x U.S. sales were lower than expected due to pricing pressure in several key markets. 
Foreign exchange also had some impact on our top line results, although the impact on net earnings was minimal. U.S. generic revenues and margins remain strong due to better-than-expected pricing and higher sales of our extended-release products, including the metoprolol ER and the recently launched Diltiazem LA. Sales of oral contraceptives were $90 million in the first quarter, up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was 50.2%, up 3.5 percentage points on a sequential basis and up 7.8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year increase in adjusted gross margin reflects higher sales of extended-released products at favorable margins, better-than-expected pricing for our base portfolio and lower year-over-year unit manufacturing costs, as a result of cost savings from our Global Supply Chain Initiative and slightly higher unit production.
We expect Generic gross margins to remain strong for the remainder of the year, given the recent launch of two new strengths of metoprolol and ongoing cost savings from our Global Supply Chain Initiative.
Moving to the Brand division, net revenue was $91 million, down 18% from the prior year period. Product sales were $72 million, down 26% year-over-year. The decrease reflects the loss of Ferrlecit, which was partially offset by sales of RAPAFLO and Gelnique, and increased sales of ANDRODERM. Brand other revenue was $19 million for the quarter, an increase of 36% over last year due primarily to higher co-promote revenue from Androgel and Femring. Brand adjusted gross margin was 73%, down from 78.4% in the first quarter of last year, reflecting the loss of Ferrlecit. Finally net revenue from our Distribution segment was $221 million, up 44% or $68 million from the prior year period due to higher third-party product launches and higher brand sales.
Distribution segment, adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 13.1%, down from 18% last year due to product mix, which includes the impact of higher brand sales. Gross margin in the first quarter of last year was favorably impacted by marketplace shortages on certain products.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses. Consolidated R&D for the first quarter was $59.5 million, up 41% compared to the prior year period due to increased investment in both our Global Generic and Brand divisions. Generic R&D increased due to higher x U.S. development spending. The increased Brand R&D investment was due to product development and licensing and higher clinical spending.
For the full year 2010, we continue to expect total R&D spending in the range of $240 million to $260 million. We are currently trending toward the higher end of this range. SG&A for the first quarter was $152 million, an increase of $17 million over the prior year period. The current year period includes a $3 million litigation settlement, while the prior year includes $19 million in litigation charges. For 2010, we still expect our SG&A to be in the range of $630 million to $680 million. However, we now expect to be at the lower end of this range.
Amortization for the first quarter was $39 million, up from $22 million last year reflecting higher amortization as a result of the Arrow acquisition. For 2010, we expect amortization expense to be roughly $170 million. Our GAAP tax rate in the first quarter was 34.5%, down from 38.6% in the first quarter of last year, due primarily to a tax benefit associated with the sale of our investment in a foreign subsidiary. For 2010, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be roughly 39%.
On an adjusted cash basis, we still expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 38%. On an adjusted cash basis, which excludes amortization, earnings for the first quarter was $0.81 per share, up 17% from $0.69 per share in the prior year quarter. Also excluded from the GAAP results for the adjusted cash basis reporting is, $26 million in acquisition and licensing charges, $5.2 million in costs associated with our Global Supply Chain Initiative and  $3 million legal settlement.
Acquisition and licensing-related charges for the quarter include the amortization of an inventory step-up of $11.8 million, preferred stock accretion of $3.7 million, a licensing payment of $3 million and $2.9 million fair market value adjustment for our Atorvastatin contingent liability.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.57. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $199 million, up 26% compared with the prior year period. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $112 million. Our strong operating cash flow and the proceeds from the sale of our Scinopharm investment were used to repay $223 million of outstanding borrowings. We ended the quarter with just under $1.25 billion of debt and $182 million in cash and marketable securities. We have only $50 million outstanding on our revolver, leaving $450 million of undrawn capacity. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.7x, and our debt-to-capital ratio improved to 28.6% from 32.5% at year end.
In summary, we're very pleased with the start of the year. We continue to execute and grow the business. Our strong balance sheet provides us with a great deal of flexibility to pursue investment opportunities, both internally through product development and externally as opportunities arise. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2010 forecast and concluding remarks."

First, the forecasted numbers, which I will discuss will include, as I said before, the impact of the new health care reform legislation. And as always, our forecasted numbers do not include any significant potential upside from patent challenges.
Our estimate for full year net revenue is now approximately $3.55 billion. We expect Generic revenue to be between $2.25 billion and $2.4 billion, with international revenues now being between $500 million to $550 million. These assumptions, assume in the U.S., some competition on generic Toprol in the fourth quarter and no competition on generic Micro-K. They also take into account revenue reductions in some international markets, by Canada and France.
On the Brand side of the business, we still expect net revenues to be between $440 million and $480 million for the year. This assumption continues to include a first half launch of the value brand of Ferrlecit.
In the ANDA Distribution business we now anticipate revenue to be up and to be between $730 million and $780 million. Based on all of these assumptions, plus current information we have available to us, we now expect adjusted EBITDA of $800 million to $850 million, and adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.25 to $3.45.
In summary, we had a very strong first quarter. We experienced more than 25% growth in revenue, adjusted cash net income and adjusted EBITDA. We are launching new generic and brand products in the U.S. to support our continued growth, and we are focused on growing our key international markets. We are continuing to drive efficiencies throughout our Global Operations network. We continue to invest in a focused and harmonized global R&D pipeline, we continue to invest in business development and clinical development to expand our brand portfolio, and we continue to capitalize opportunities in the marketplace.
With all of this, I believe we have strong momentum built up, and I'm very confident we'll be able to achieve the commitments we made in value [ph] creation for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Patty to open up for questions."

On the International revenue side, we're just taking into account the new realities that we see in Canada and France and the U.K., frankly, as pricing has dropped. With the changes though, that you see in many of those markets, we are not necessarily seeing any impact, all that much of an impact, on margin and profitability. The revenue’s being affected but not so much the profit because of the rebates or whatever the case may be. I think we're in still a pretty good position. We also in all of those markets are launching significant new products throughout the year. In Canada, for example, we expect to be launching LIPITOR sometime mid-year and so, we expect to see that make up the difference on the margin and profitability line, although with the revenue being somewhat funded by the changes that are taking place at the governmental level."

The implications of that of course are to drive down the revenue in Canada because once Ontario does it, Québec follows in relatively short order, and we do expect the other provinces to follow along. Same sort of thing happened in France, where there was a reduction in overall generic reimbursement. Again, it affected more of the top line than the bottom line but we will see that on the revenue impact going forward. And I think Todd mentioned there’s sort of the weakening of the euro has also sort of impacted overall revenue projections out of rest of Europe and that's a trend that everybody’s sort of seeing."

Our current market share, our current portfolio products that we anticipate launching in those markets and what we think generic substitution is going to look like in those markets on a going forward basis. If you look at France, for example, I believe the last quoted number I heard was the generic substitution in France is still in the 20% and 25% range. And it’s our expectation that, that will have to get higher. And as that goes higher it bodes well for companies like Watson who have a strong pipeline of products, have a good sales force on the ground in France, and I think with that we can offset losses in revenue and profitability because of price declines by literally doing more volume and having more substitution in those markets. So that's kind of the way we look at it. I have not done, I don’t think we’ve done the analysis to kind of figure out what we think the three to five year projected growth rates are. I'm sure those kinds of analysis are out there but we haven't done that, we're looking more from a Watson perspective. So I think we’re in pretty good position across Europe to take advantage of that opportunity. Your question on AMP in the U.S. is a complicated one. We were just at NACDS and that was a conversation topic of intense conversation at NACDS between many of the participants there. And, of course, no one knows what's going to happen the first day AMP gets published for a particular product there will certainly be people who will look at their pricing and look at AMP and say well gee I'm in a pretty good spot, and there are other people who will look at AMP and say well I’m above AMP and so that can’t be good. So any time you have an average there is, by definition, going to be people above and people below. There's going to be some struggling with pricing in various segments of the U.S. market as everybody sort to sorts out where they fall and where everything falls. Also, it's not 100% clear to me that the definitions of AMP will be consistently applied across every manufacturer factor, so I think it's going to take some time to sort all that out. As I said, our conversations at NACDS indicate that everybody’s sort of in the same boat. We're going to just have to wait and see what happens."

On – I think your second question was U.S. generic markets – on margins I mean, I think we anticipate to stay at the high 40s, 50-ish range, being driven by two major factors. One is our extended release portfolio of products and some of the products we have coming on, which we expect to have reasonably substantial margins on, as well as the continued ability to drive costs out of our system, our operating system and that will continue. So I don't think you'll see us get much above that 50% range but we should stay fairly stable in that range right now, that's what we anticipate."

Since that Advisory Committee has been completed, we did recalculate, we had much of this data. We did recalculate our results, and we have shared those with the agency and we're currently working with the agency on discussing those with them and attempting to show them, of course, that we satisfy the requirements that were discussed at the Advisory Committee. And we hope we can convince them of that. As you also know, there are other things we have to overcome in the Concerta matter. We did make a huge leap last quarter with the victory of the Appoa Court [ph]. We expect the mandate to issue relatively soon and once that happens, if Empax does have exclusivity, their exclusivity will begin to run. If they do not, we'll then, and we can work our way through the agency's issues around Partial AUC data, we could have a potential opportunity. But we continue to work with the agency on that activity and of course as things warrant, we'll provide updates. On the European question, we have, like everyone else, you do have to sort of step back, and you're right, take a pause and think about what's going to happen in these markets and what do we anticipate going forward. I anticipate, I think what we've concluded is that people -- countries can only drive so much cost savings through pharmaceuticals and at the end of the day, they have to recognize, and will ultimately recognize that their single best means of lowering healthcare costs is providing good, solid generic products to their citizens. And most of these countries have not achieved the penetration rates for generics yet that they should. And so from our view is that there is an opportunity to participate in these markets because there's got to be growth in use of generics. As long as the pricing stays above marginal cost, then we think it makes sense for us to participate. And so as we look at the opportunity, we still see an opportunity and a good opportunity for Watson. So we will continue to look for specific strategic investments within the European market. However, we also, as I said before, are looking in South America, looking in Asia-Pacific, where many of the emerging markets are presenting a slightly different dynamic, but one where we think the margins will obviously remain stronger and where penetration rates are in the low single-digit ranges. And again, we want to be at the front end of participating in those growth curves. And then you made the comment about committing more resources to the Brand business. We do commit a lot of resources to our Brand business and we'll continue to commit substantial resources to our Brand business and our Biologics business going forward. We happen to be lucky enough to have the resources to be able to do that with cash flow generation and some of the great products that we've had and our execution on getting those products to market. So I think we can -- we're very busy, but we can do all that stuff, so we're pretty excited about all the opportunities."

But we do expect to have closure costs in that $35 million to $45 million range to achieve those. But that's an ongoing cost of business and I would expect that would carry over into 2011. We'll continue to evaluate, as I said, at all of our facilities to make sure we're achieving the right cost structure. We can also see ourselves investing more in plant and equipment in cases like Malta and India frankly. Malta is a great facility, it probably needs to grow a bit, and we expect to spend some time money there this year, not a lot but some for CapEx. And we continue to look at India to see how we can continue to drive throughput. We're doing about 3 billion units yet this year in India, we're going try to get to the 5 billion to 6 billion range in India over the next year, couple years.

And we thought to be prudent we'd put at least one competitor in, in the fourth quarter, and we'll see what happens. I think the problem we all have right now anticipating competition is estimating when the FDA will complete it, an evaluation of any particular product, particularly extended release products and particularly metoprolol. Given our experience going through the agency with metoprolol, I think it is a unique experience to say the least. And it is not like a normal immediate release approval where you can count on a certain number of cycles and a certain timeline. Our experience with one that required us to get through the standard procedure and then have a re-review and then a yet again, a re-review by higher levels in the agency.

The first time in a long time at NACDS we heard people say, look we can't afford to have product shortages, simply can't. And there was at least a recognition, that supply chain was very critical to the decision-making process. Doesn't mean they're not going to look for lowest possible price but supply chain has become a critical matter for people. Big customers are going and doing their own audits of suppliers. And in some cases, are choosing not to do business with some customers. So it is -- that's the first time I've ever heard that happen. I mean, I think it's just a recognition of the fact that if they lose their supply of a generic, it is devastating to their bottom line."

Structural factors like not allowing chain drug stores, for example. That has an impact on the ability of penetration because each pharmacist and there's 300 pharmacies or 500 pharmacies across a particular region, each one gets to make their own buying choice. That leads to a branded generic market. If there are chains, like we see here in the U.S., CVS makes one decision and every pharmacy has that product and they drive the product. So there are structural things that will change in these markets ultimately and will lead to higher substitution rates."

It really can't go much lower than where it's at. So there, the business is now about cost and how you drive down your acquisition costs and for us it's about switching in-license products with manufacturing products there. France I think pricing, while it's still in the – I think it's down somewhat from the 45%, I think it may be down 5% or 7% off of that, we don't expect that to continue to go down, I think the French government has said that they're done for a while on that. But as Tom indicated, our concern is what do they do about rebates because that obviously affects margin more dramatically than potentially pricing. And then I guess your other question was Canada. I think the Canadian -- if Ontario continues with the idea of the 25% range, I do think the other provinces will follow. We do anticipate Canada revenue to be down because of that. But again, it becomes a question of rebates. How is that affecting – because the Canadian government has then said, okay you don't pay rebates. Now Canadian   pharmacists are not real happy about that, so it's a question of how do they find new ways to increase revenues or save revenue for them, as opposed to losing revenue. So we have to work our way through the nuances of each of those markets. Having said all that, I think we're still in a good spot with the  products that we're going to be launching, the number of products that we're going to be launching and basically from our starting point. So we're still bullish on these markets and we're still going to be very active in them."

We began 2010 with an exceptionally strong performance across all of our businesses, and we entered into the second quarter with a great deal of positive momentum. Our results also reflect the first full quarter of contributions from our newly acquired international businesses.
Net revenue for the first quarter increased 28% to $857 million. Adjusted cash net income for the quarter increased 25% to $100 million or $0.81 per share, and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter increased 26% to $199 million. Additionally, cash flow from operations was $112 million. We used our strong cash flow in the quarter to reduce our outstanding debt by $220 million and also to increase our investment in Biologics. We finished the quarter with $182 million in cash and investments on hand. And we made considerable progress on our global objectives, capitalized on favorable industry dynamics and certainly exceeded our financial expectations. With this strong momentum, we are increasing our forecast for 2010, raising adjusted cash EPS to between $3.25 and $3.45 and adjusted EBITDA to between $800 million and $850 million.
Now I'd like to run through some of the year-to-date highlights. In our Global Generics business, we received FDA approval for several key generic products. In the U.S., this includes Diltiazem LA, which we launched in March and the 100- and 200-milligram doses of metoprolol ER, which we launched in the third week of April, allowing us to now compete in all dosage forms of that product. X U.S. we received approval for Clopidogrel in Australia, and the product was recently launched.
Even with the challenges in many markets, we continue to expect to achieve double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in Canada, France and Australia this year.
In Global Generics R&D, we have announced 10 new patent challenges to date, including the blockbuster Lidoderm and more recently, Rapamune. In our Global Brand business, we received FDA approval for our six-month formulation of TRELSTAR, the first and only intramuscular GnRH agonist available for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer that can be stored at room temperature. We began shipping this product ahead of schedule on April 15.
We completed a number of brand business development initiatives discussed with you at our Analyst Day, adding significant breadth to our Women's Health franchise and our Biologics capabilities, which I'll summarize in a few moments.
Since the close of the Arrow acquisition, integration has been going according to plan. Our Global Operations team has been actively reviewing all our supply chain capabilities. We have concluded that excess capacity at other facilities, notably, Malta and India, is adequate to absorb current product from our Toronto manufacturing facility, as well as projected manufacturing needs. Additionally, these sites can do so at a more favorable cost. As a result, we announced to our Toronto-based employees a few weeks ago that we plan to close our Toronto [audio gap] facility by the end of 2011. We expect to realize significant operating cost savings, as well as lower overall cost of goods related to this initiative.
I'd like to also spend a moment updating you on healthcare reform, which is being phased in over several years and will influence our U.S. brands and Generic businesses in different ways and at different stages during the implementation. Near-term industry changes resulting from healthcare reform include increases in Medicaid rebates for both brand and generic products and the addition of rebates for patients in Medicare managed care plans or dual eligibles. Beginning next year, our Brand division will began funding its portion of the Medicare donut hole and will be contributing the excise tax based on market share of our NDAs. Longer term on the Generic side, we anticipate that there will be an overall increase in utilization of Generic Pharmaceuticals due to increases in total number of Americans now having access to prescription drug benefits. While there are still some questions on how healthcare reform will be implemented, we have factored these changes into our revised forecast.
Generally speaking, the impact to our business is relatively modest and is far outweighed by growth that we’re seeing in our Generic businesses and overall pricing stability.
I would now like to provide you with some details on our three business segments. Global Generics net revenues were $544 million, an increase of 35% and include x U.S. net product sales of $106 million. Sales on our Oral Contraceptive business were $90 million in the first quarter, and our U.S. Generics over-performance in the quarter was driven by three factors: strong sales of extended-release products, higher volumes and increased efficiencies, which are contributing to lower overall product costs. We also experienced lower generic price erosion in the U.S. than originally participated, which also provided some upside.
Internationally, we experienced pricing pressure in some of our overseas markets such as France, the U.K. and Canada. There are changing dynamics within these markets that we will continue to watch closely. While these actions are happening swifter than expected, we have been anticipating these changes as governments look to control their healthcare expenditures. Ultimately, we anticipate increased utilization of Generics overall and based on our current market share, product offerings and pipeline, we believe that we can continue to grow these markets over the long term.
During the quarter, we increased our investment in Generic R&D by 40% to $42 million. We concluded the quarter with over 100 ANDAs on file with the U.S. FDA and with 77 Paragraph IV challenges and more than 900 applications pending outside of the U.S. Close to half of the U.S. Paragraph IV opportunities are first-to-file or shared exclusivity opportunities.
Moving to our Global Brands division, revenue was $91 million, down $21 million as anticipated in the first quarter. This decrease reflects the planned lost of Ferrlecit, which was returned to Santa Fe at the end of 2009 and was offset somewhat by the addition of our new products RAPAFLO and Gelnique. More recently, we are experiencing increased prescription transfer for RAPAFLO as result of Flomax going generic in March and also seeing growth in Gelnique due to increased promotion and reach by our sales force. We expect both products to be important contributors to our Global Brands business over the longer term.
Additionally, we continue to expect FDA approval of the generic version of Ferrlecit in the first half of 2010, recall that we signed a licensing agreement with GeneraMedix to market this product upon FDA approval, and we will be promoting it within our Brand division.
Since January, we have taken significant steps to expand our Brand business.  We announced an agreement with HRA to become the commercial partner for a novel next generation emergency contraceptive, which is currently marketed in the U.K. as ellaOne. The FDA advisory committee on reproductive health will be meeting on June 17 to discuss this product. We also announced a licensing agreement with the Population Council to commercialize an investigational vaginal contraceptive ring in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The ring is currently in Phase III clinical development for contraceptive use for up to one year.
We also announced an agreement during the quarter to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to the Colombia’s bioadhesive progesterone gel products currently marketed under the trade names CRINONE and Prochieve, for the indications of infertility and secondary amenorrhea. Under the agreement, we will also collaborate on the ongoing Phase III development program toward a new indication for the prevention of preterm birth and women with a short cervix, as well as global development program for a second generation product for this indication. Of course this transaction is still subject to certain closing conditions and we continue to work with Columbia to get those conditions satisfied.
Lastly, we purchased the remaining 64% of Eden Biodesign for the development and commercialization of Biologics. Since the acquisition, we have approved several contract manufacturing projects designed to increase the near-term third-party revenue, while we simultaneously worked to implement internal R&D projects for Watson’s own Biologics development efforts.
Turning now to our Distribution business, and it had revenues of $221 million, an increase of 44%. Large contributors to ANDAs growth were new generic third party product launches notably generic versions of Aldara and Flomax, as well as additional brand products sales. With that, and I'll turn the call over to Todd to take us through some of the financials. Todd?"

We experienced strong earnings in cash flow. Our liquidity improved with the sale of our interest in Scinopharm, and we used the proceeds and excess operating cash flow to reduce revolver borrowings. Our strong balance sheet has us well-positioned to capitalize on strategic investment opportunities, in support of our long-term growth objectives.
I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis, which includes a full quarter of our new Global business. For the first quarter of 2010, consolidated net revenues was $857 million, an increase of 28% over the prior year period. Net revenue for our Generic division was $544 million, up 35% on a year-over-year basis. This includes x U.S. product sales of $106 million, x U.S. sales were lower than expected due to pricing pressure in several key markets. 
Foreign exchange also had some impact on our top line results, although the impact on net earnings was minimal. U.S. generic revenues and margins remain strong due to better-than-expected pricing and higher sales of our extended-release products, including the metoprolol ER and the recently launched Diltiazem LA. Sales of oral contraceptives were $90 million in the first quarter, up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was 50.2%, up 3.5 percentage points on a sequential basis and up 7.8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year increase in adjusted gross margin reflects higher sales of extended-released products at favorable margins, better-than-expected pricing for our base portfolio and lower year-over-year unit manufacturing costs, as a result of cost savings from our Global Supply Chain Initiative and slightly higher unit production.
We expect Generic gross margins to remain strong for the remainder of the year, given the recent launch of two new strengths of metoprolol and ongoing cost savings from our Global Supply Chain Initiative.
Moving to the Brand division, net revenue was $91 million, down 18% from the prior year period. Product sales were $72 million, down 26% year-over-year. The decrease reflects the loss of Ferrlecit, which was partially offset by sales of RAPAFLO and Gelnique, and increased sales of ANDRODERM. Brand other revenue was $19 million for the quarter, an increase of 36% over last year due primarily to higher co-promote revenue from Androgel and Femring. Brand adjusted gross margin was 73%, down from 78.4% in the first quarter of last year, reflecting the loss of Ferrlecit. Finally, net revenue from our Distribution segment was $221 million, up 44% or $68 million from the prior year period due to higher third-party product launches and higher brand sales.
Distribution segment adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 13.1%, down from 18% last year due to product mix, which includes the impact of higher brand sales. Gross margin in the first quarter of last year was favorably impacted by marketplace shortages on certain products.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses. Consolidated R&D for the first quarter was $59.5 million, up 41% compared to the prior year period due to increased investment in both our Global Generic and Brand divisions. Generic R&D increased due to higher x U.S. development spending. The increased Brand R&D investment was due to product development and licensing and higher clinical spending.
For the full year 2010, we continue to expect total R&D spending in the range of $240 million to $260 million. We are currently trending toward the higher end of this range. SG&A for the first quarter was $152 million, an increase of $17 million over the prior year period. The current year period includes a $3 million litigation settlement, while the prior year includes $19 million in litigation charges. For 2010, we still expect our SG&A to be in the range of $630 million to $680 million. However, we now expect to be at the lower end of this range.
Amortization for the first quarter was $39 million, up from $22 million last year, reflecting higher amortization as a result of the Arrow acquisition. For 2010, we expect amortization expense to be roughly $170 million. Our GAAP tax rate in the first quarter was 34.5%, down from 38.6% in the first quarter of last year, due primarily to a tax benefit associated with the sale of our investment in a foreign subsidiary. For 2010, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be roughly 39%.
On an adjusted cash basis, we still expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 38%. On an adjusted cash basis, which excludes amortization, earnings for the first quarter was $0.81 per share, up 17% from $0.69 per share in the prior year quarter. Also excluded from the GAAP results for the adjusted cash basis reporting is $26 million in acquisition and licensing charges, $5.2 million in costs associated with our Global Supply Chain Initiative and a $3 million legal settlement.
Acquisition and licensing-related charges for the quarter include the amortization of an inventory step-up of $11.8 million, preferred stock accretion of $3.7 million, a licensing payment of $3 million and $2.9 million fair market value adjustment for our Atorvastatin contingent liability.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.57. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $199 million, up 26% compared with the prior year period. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $112 million. Our strong operating cash flow and the proceeds from the sale of our Scinopharm investment were used to repay $223 million of outstanding borrowings. We ended the quarter with just under $1.25 billion of debt and $182 million in cash and marketable securities. We have only $50 million outstanding on our revolver, leaving $450 million of undrawn capacity. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.7x, and our debt-to-capital ratio improved to 28.6% from 32.5% at year end.
In summary, we're very pleased with the start of the year. We continue to execute and grow the business. Our strong balance sheet provides us with a great deal of flexibility to pursue investment opportunity, both internally through product development and externally as opportunities arise. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2010 forecast and concluding remarks."

First, the forecasted numbers, which I will discuss will include, as I said before, the impact of the new health care reform legislation. And as always, our forecasted numbers do not include any significant potential upside from patent challenges.
Our estimate for full year net revenue is now approximately $3.55 billion. We expect Generic revenue to be between $2.25 billion and $2.4 billion, with international revenues now being between $500 million to $550 million. These assumptions, assume in the U.S., some competition on generic Toprol in the fourth quarter and no competition on generic Micro-K. They also take into account revenue reductions in some international markets, by Canada and France.
On the Brand side of the business, we still expect net revenues to be between $440 million and $480 million for the year. This assumption continues to include a first half launch of the value brand of Ferrlecit.
In the ANDA Distribution business we now anticipate revenue to be up and to be between $730 million and $780 million. Based on all of these assumptions, plus current information we have available to us, we now expect adjusted EBITDA of $800 million to $850 million, and adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.25 to $3.45.
In summary, we had a very strong first quarter. We experienced more than 25% growth in revenue, adjusted cash net income and adjusted EBITDA. We are launching new generic and brand products in the U.S. to support our continued growth, and we are focused on growing our key international markets. We are continuing to drive efficiencies throughout our Global Operations network. We continue to invest in a focused and harmonized global R&D pipeline, we continue to invest in business development and clinical development to expand our brand portfolio, and we continue to capitalize opportunities in the marketplace.
With all of this, I believe we have strong momentum built up, and I'm very confident we'll be able to achieve the commitments we made in value [ph] creation for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Patty to open up for questions."

With the changes though, that you see in many of those markets, we are not necessarily seeing any impact, all that much of an impact, on margin and profitability. The revenue’s being affected but not so much the profit because of the rebates or whatever the case may be. I think we're in still a pretty good position.

We do expect that of course to continue, the marketplace is falling out quite nicely for us.

I think that’s what people should look for, for the rest of the year with the Toprol. On Canada, I think that the issue here is, of course, you may have heard that the Ontario Provincial Government reduced the price of generic pharmaceuticals from 50% of brand price to 25%. That has not yet been implemented, although we do expect it to be implemented this year. The implications of that of course are to drive down the revenue in Canada because once Ontario does it, Québec follows in relatively short order, and we do expect the other provinces to follow along. Same sort of thing happened in France, where there was a reduction in overall generic reimbursement. Again, it affected more of the top line than the bottom line but we will see that on the revenue impact going forward. And I think Todd mentioned there’s sort of the weakening of the euro has also sort of impacted overall revenue projections out of rest of Europe and that's a trend that everybody’s sort of seeing."

Our current market share, our current portfolio products that we anticipate launching in those markets and what we think generic substitution is going to look like in those markets on a going forward basis. If you look at France, for example, I believe the last quoted number I heard was the generic substitution in France is still in the 20% and 25% range. And it’s our expectation that, that will have to get higher. And as that goes higher it bodes well for companies like Watson who have a strong pipeline of products, have a good sales force on the ground in France, and I think with that we can offset losses in revenue and profitability because of price declines by literally doing more volume and having more substitution in those markets. So that's kind of the way we look at it. I have not done, I don’t think we’ve done the analysis to kind of figure out what we think the three to five year projected growth rates are. I'm sure those kinds of analysis are out there but we haven't done that, we're looking more from a Watson perspective. So I think we’re in pretty good position across Europe to take advantage of that opportunity. Your question on AMP in the U.S. is a complicated one. We were just at NACDS and that was a conversation topic of intense conversation at NACDS between many of the participants there. And, of course, no one knows what's going to happen the first day AMP gets published for a particular product there will certainly be people who will look at their pricing and look at AMP and say well gee I'm in a pretty good spot, and there are other people who will look at AMP and say well I’m above AMP and so that can’t be good. So any time you have an average there is, by definition, going to be people above and people below. There's going to be some struggling with pricing in various segments of the U.S. market as everybody sort to sorts out where they fall and where everything falls. Also, it's not 100% clear to me that the definitions of AMP will be consistently applied across every manufacturer factor, so I think it's going to take some time to sort all that out. As I said, our conversations at NACDS indicate that everybody’s sort of in the same boat. We're going to just have to wait and see what happens."

On – I think your second question was U.S. generic markets – on margins I mean, I think we anticipate to stay at the high 40s, 50-ish range, being driven by two major factors. One is our extended release portfolio of products and some of the products we have coming on, which we expect to have reasonably substantial margins on, as well as the continued ability to drive costs out of our system, our operating system and that will continue.

If there's any interaction in terms of issuing of guidelines for that product, if you could update us there? And then follow-up to a couple of questions that you've gotten on the European line, understanding that the Arrow acquisition is so recent and new. But all of us are hearing, as I'm sure you're hearing and experiencing, the pricing cuts and the pricing issues, has there been at all a pause in your thinking? I know it's been thought to add to that footprint and, as you continue to say, add as something comes available, but has there been any internal kind of consideration to going aggressively expanding there, maybe thinking more about taking some of those resources and putting them to brand? Or is it really no change, these pricing cuts are meaningless for us investors that are hearing it, this is just how the world is and we shouldn't be thinking that anything is changing over in Europe?"

It is our belief that the agency – well from the results of that, from the results of that Advisory Committee we understand the agency is thinking about modifying basically Partial AUC data and being able to come up with various time points prior to the eight-hour time point for measurement. Since that Advisory Committee has been completed, we did recalculate, we had much of this data. We did recalculate our results, and we have shared those with the agency and we're currently working with the agency on discussing those with them and attempting to show them, of course, that we satisfy the requirements that were discussed at the Advisory Committee. And we hope we can convince them of that. As you also know, there are other things we have to overcome in the Concerta matter. We did make a huge leap last quarter with the victory at the appellate court. We expect the mandate to issue relatively soon and once that happens, if Empax does have exclusivity, their exclusivity will begin to run. If they do not, we'll then -- and we can work our way through the agency's issues around Partial AUC data, we could have a potential opportunity. But we continue to work with the agency on that activity and of course as things warrant, we'll provide updates. On the European question, we have, like everyone else, you do have to sort of step back, and you're right, take a pause and think about what's going to happen in these markets and what do we anticipate going forward. I anticipate, I think what we've concluded is that people -- countries can only drive so much cost savings through pharmaceuticals and at the end of the day, they have to recognize, and will ultimately recognize that their single best means of lowering healthcare costs is providing good, solid generic products to their citizens. And most of these countries have not achieved the penetration rates for generics yet that they should. And so from our view is that there is an opportunity to participate in these markets because there's got to be growth in use of generics. As long as the pricing stays above marginal cost, then we think it makes sense for us to participate. And so as we look at the opportunity, we still see an opportunity and a good opportunity for Watson. So we will continue to look for specific strategic investments within the European market. However, we also, as I said before, are looking in South America, looking in Asia-Pacific, where many of the emerging markets are presenting a slightly different dynamic, but one where we think the margins will obviously remain stronger and where penetration rates are in the low single-digit ranges. And again, we want to be at the front end of participating in those growth curves. And then you made the comment about committing more resources to the Brand business. We do commit a lot of resources to our Brand business and we'll continue to commit substantial resources to our Brand business and our Biologics business going forward. We happen to be lucky enough to have the resources to be able to do that with cash flow generation and some of the great products that we've had and our execution on getting those products to market. So I think we can -- we're very busy, but we can do all that stuff, so we're pretty excited about all the opportunities."

And particularly as we continue to acquire companies and facilities, we always have to continuously look at which facilities we have and how best to use them. The Toronto closure should generate at somewhere between $18 million to $20 million on yearly basis of savings. But we do expect to have closure costs in that $35 million to $45 million range to achieve those. But that's an ongoing cost of business and I would expect that would carry over into 2011. We'll continue to evaluate, as I said, at all of our facilities to make sure we're achieving the right cost structure. We can also see ourselves investing more in plant and equipment in cases like Malta and India frankly. Malta is a great facility, it probably needs to grow a bit, and we expect to spend some time money there this year, not a lot but some for CapEx. And we continue to look at India to see how we can continue to drive throughput. We're doing about 3 billion units yet this year in India, we're going try to get to the 5 billion to 6 billion range in India over the next year, couple years. And we think that will have a major impact on our going-forward margins, particularly as we start taking products from India into Europe, which we also expect to do.

There are a couple of names we've heard whispered around with the product. At least at the moment I have not heard of Mylan before, but it could be. And we thought to be prudent we'd put at least one competitor in, in the fourth quarter, and we'll see what happens. I think the problem we all have right now anticipating competition is estimating when the FDA will complete it, an evaluation of any particular product, particularly extended release products and particularly metoprolol. Given our experience going through the agency with metoprolol, I think it is a unique experience to say the least. And it is not like a normal immediate release approval where you can count on a certain number of cycles and a certain timeline. Our experience with one that required us to get through the standard procedure and then have a re-review and then a yet again, a re-review by higher levels in the agency. So if everybody else has to go through that same process, I would anticipate – if they haven't anticipated having their timelines, I guess the point is, it's hard to know when they're going to be coming."

Structural factors like not allowing chain drug stores, for example. That has an impact on the ability of penetration because each pharmacist and there's 300 pharmacies or 500 pharmacies across a particular region, each one gets to make their own buying choice. That leads to a branded generic market. If there are chains, like we see here in the U.S., CVS makes one decision and every pharmacy has that product and they drive the product.

It really can't go much lower than where it's at. So there, the business is now about cost and how you drive down your acquisition costs and for us it's about switching in-license products with manufacturing products there. France I think pricing, while it's still in the – I think it's down somewhat from the 45%, I think it may be down 5% or 7% off of that, we don't expect that to continue to go down, I think the French government has said that they're done for a while on that. But as Tom indicated, our concern is what do they do about rebates because that obviously affects margin more dramatically than potentially pricing. And then I guess your other question was Canada. I think the Canadian -- if Ontario continues with the idea of the 25% range, I do think the other provinces will follow. We do anticipate Canada revenue to be down because of that. But again, it becomes a question of rebates. How is that affecting – because the Canadian government has then said, okay you don't pay rebates. Now Canadian   pharmacists are not real happy about that, so it's a question of how do they find new ways to increase revenues or save revenue for them, as opposed to losing revenue. So we have to work our way through the nuances of each of those markets. Having said all that, I think we're still in a good spot with the  products that we're going to be launching, the number of products that we're going to be launching and basically from our starting point. So we're still bullish on these markets and we're still going to be very active in them."

We began 2010 with an exceptionally strong performance across all of our businesses, and we entered into the second quarter with a great deal of positive momentum. Our results also reflect the first full quarter of contributions from our newly acquired international businesses.
Net revenue for the first quarter increased 28% to $857 million. Adjusted cash net income for the quarter increased 25% to $100 million or $0.81 per share, and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter increased 26% to $199 million. Additionally, cash flow from operations was $112 million. We used our strong cash flow in the quarter to reduce our outstanding debt by $220 million and also to increase our investment in Biologics. We finished the quarter with $182 million in cash and investments on hand. And we made considerable progress on our global objectives, capitalized on favorable industry dynamics and certainly exceeded our financial expectations. With this strong momentum, we are increasing our forecast for 2010, raising adjusted cash EPS to between $3.25 and $3.45 and adjusted EBITDA to between $800 million and $850 million.
Now I'd like to run through some of the year-to-date highlights. In our Global Generics business, we received FDA approval for several key generic products. In the U.S., this includes Diltiazem LA, which we launched in March and the 100- and 200-milligram doses of metoprolol ER, which we launched in the third week of April, allowing us to now compete in all dosage forms of that product. X U.S. we received approval for Clopidogrel in Australia, and the product was recently launched.
Even with the challenges in many markets, we continue to expect to achieve double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in Canada, France and Australia this year.
In Global Generics R&D, we have announced 10 new patent challenges to date, including the blockbuster Lidoderm and more recently, Rapamune. In our Global Brand business, we received FDA approval for our six-month formulation of TRELSTAR, the first and only intramuscular GnRH agonist available for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer that can be stored at room temperature. We began shipping this product ahead of schedule on April 15.
We completed a number of brand business development initiatives discussed with you at our Analyst Day, adding significant breadth to our Women's Health franchise and our Biologics capabilities, which I'll summarize in a few moments.
Since the close of the Arrow acquisition, integration has been going according to plan. Our Global Operations team has been actively reviewing all our supply chain capabilities. We have concluded that excess capacity at other facilities, notably, Malta and India, is adequate to absorb current product from our Toronto manufacturing facility, as well as projected manufacturing needs. Additionally, these sites can do so at a more favorable cost. As a result, we announced to our Toronto-based employees a few weeks ago that we plan to close our Toronto [audio gap] facility by the end of 2011. We expect to realize significant operating cost savings, as well as lower overall cost of goods related to this initiative.
I'd like to also spend a moment updating you on healthcare reform, which is being phased in over several years and will influence our U.S. brands and Generic businesses in different ways and at different stages during the implementation. Near-term industry changes resulting from healthcare reform include increases in Medicaid rebates for both brand and generic products and the addition of rebates for patients in Medicare managed care plans or dual eligibles. Beginning next year, our Brand division will began funding its portion of the Medicare donut hole and will be contributing the excise tax based on market share of our NDAs. Longer term on the Generic side, we anticipate that there will be an overall increase in utilization of Generic Pharmaceuticals due to increases in total number of Americans now having access to prescription drug benefits. While there are still some questions on how healthcare reform will be implemented, we have factored these changes into our revised forecast.
Generally speaking, the impact to our business is relatively modest and is far outweighed by growth that we’re seeing in our Generic businesses and overall pricing stability.
I would now like to provide you with some details on our three business segments. Global Generics net revenues were $544 million, an increase of 35% and include x U.S. net product sales of $106 million. Sales on our Oral Contraceptive business were $90 million in the first quarter, and our U.S. Generics over-performance in the quarter was driven by three factors: strong sales of extended-release products, higher volumes and increased efficiencies, which are contributing to lower overall product costs. We also experienced lower generic price erosion in the U.S. than originally participated, which also provided some upside.
Internationally, we experienced pricing pressure in some of our overseas markets such as France, the U.K. and Canada. There are changing dynamics within these markets that we will continue to watch closely. While these actions are happening swifter than expected, we have been anticipating these changes as governments look to control their healthcare expenditures. Ultimately, we anticipate increased utilization of Generics overall and based on our current market share, product offerings and pipeline, we believe that we can continue to grow these markets over the long term.
During the quarter, we increased our investment in Generic R&D by 40% to $42 million. We concluded the quarter with over 100 ANDAs on file with the U.S. FDA and with 77 Paragraph IV challenges and more than 900 applications pending outside of the U.S. Close to half of the U.S. Paragraph IV opportunities are first-to-file or shared exclusivity opportunities.
Moving to our Global Brands division, revenue was $91 million, down $21 million as anticipated in the first quarter. This decrease reflects the planned lost of Ferrlecit, which was returned to Santa Fe at the end of 2009 and was offset somewhat by the addition of our new products RAPAFLO and Gelnique. More recently, we are experiencing increased prescription transfer for RAPAFLO as result of Flomax going generic in March and also seeing growth in Gelnique due to increased promotion and reach by our sales force. We expect both products to be important contributors to our Global Brands business over the longer term.
Additionally, we continue to expect FDA approval of the generic version of Ferrlecit in the first half of 2010, recall that we signed a licensing agreement with GeneraMedix to market this product upon FDA approval, and we will be promoting it within our Brand division.
Since January, we have taken significant steps to expand our Brand business.  We announced an agreement with HRA to become the commercial partner for a novel next generation emergency contraceptive, which is currently marketed in the U.K. as ellaOne. The FDA advisory committee on reproductive health will be meeting on June 17 to discuss this product. We also announced a licensing agreement with the Population Council to commercialize an investigational vaginal contraceptive ring in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The ring is currently in Phase III clinical development for contraceptive use for up to one year.
We also announced an agreement during the quarter to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to the Colombia’s bioadhesive progesterone gel products currently marketed under the trade names CRINONE and Prochieve, for the indications of infertility and secondary amenorrhea. Under the agreement, we will also collaborate on the ongoing Phase III development program toward a new indication for the prevention of preterm birth and women with a short cervix, as well as global development program for a second generation product for this indication. Of course this transaction is still subject to certain closing conditions and we continue to work with Columbia to get those conditions satisfied.
Lastly, we purchased the remaining 64% of Eden Biodesign for the development and commercialization of Biologics. Since the acquisition, we have approved several contract manufacturing projects designed to increase the near-term third-party revenue, while we simultaneously worked to implement internal R&D projects for Watson’s own Biologics development efforts.
Turning now to our Distribution business, and it had revenues of $221 million, an increase of 44%. Large contributors to ANDAs growth were new generic third party product launches notably generic versions of Aldara and Flomax, as well as additional brand products sales. With that, and I'll turn the call over to Todd to take us through some of the financials. Todd?"

We experienced strong earnings in cash flow. Our liquidity improved with the sale of our interest in Scinopharm, and we used the proceeds and excess operating cash flow to reduce revolver borrowings. Our strong balance sheet has us well-positioned to capitalize on strategic investment opportunities, in support of our long-term growth objectives.
I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis, which includes a full quarter of our new Global business. For the first quarter of 2010, consolidated net revenues was $857 million, an increase of 28% over the prior year period. Net revenue for our Generic division was $544 million, up 35% on a year-over-year basis. This includes x U.S. product sales of $106 million, x U.S. sales were lower than expected due to pricing pressure in several key markets. 
Foreign exchange also had some impact on our top line results, although the impact on net earnings was minimal. U.S. generic revenues and margins remain strong due to better-than-expected pricing and higher sales of our extended-release products, including the metoprolol ER and the recently launched Diltiazem LA. Sales of oral contraceptives were $90 million in the first quarter, up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was 50.2%, up 3.5 percentage points on a sequential basis and up 7.8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year increase in adjusted gross margin reflects higher sales of extended-released products at favorable margins, better-than-expected pricing for our base portfolio and lower year-over-year unit manufacturing costs, as a result of cost savings from our Global Supply Chain Initiative and slightly higher unit production.
We expect Generic gross margins to remain strong for the remainder of the year, given the recent launch of two new strengths of metoprolol and ongoing cost savings from our Global Supply Chain Initiative.
Moving to the Brand division, net revenue was $91 million, down 18% from the prior year period. Product sales were $72 million, down 26% year-over-year. The decrease reflects the loss of Ferrlecit, which was partially offset by sales of RAPAFLO and Gelnique, and increased sales of ANDRODERM. Brand other revenue was $19 million for the quarter, an increase of 36% over last year due primarily to higher co-promote revenue from Androgel and Femring. Brand adjusted gross margin was 73%, down from 78.4% in the first quarter of last year, reflecting the loss of Ferrlecit. Finally, net revenue from our Distribution segment was $221 million, up 44% or $68 million from the prior year period due to higher third-party product launches and higher brand sales.
Distribution segment adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 13.1%, down from 18% last year due to product mix, which includes the impact of higher brand sales. Gross margin in the first quarter of last year was favorably impacted by marketplace shortages on certain products.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses. Consolidated R&D for the first quarter was $59.5 million, up 41% compared to the prior year period due to increased investment in both our Global Generic and Brand divisions. Generic R&D increased due to higher x U.S. development spending. The increased Brand R&D investment was due to product development and licensing and higher clinical spending.
For the full year 2010, we continue to expect total R&D spending in the range of $240 million to $260 million. We are currently trending toward the higher end of this range. SG&A for the first quarter was $152 million, an increase of $17 million over the prior year period. The current year period includes a $3 million litigation settlement, while the prior year includes $19 million in litigation charges. For 2010, we still expect our SG&A to be in the range of $630 million to $680 million. However, we now expect to be at the lower end of this range.
Amortization for the first quarter was $39 million, up from $22 million last year, reflecting higher amortization as a result of the Arrow acquisition. For 2010, we expect amortization expense to be roughly $170 million. Our GAAP tax rate in the first quarter was 34.5%, down from 38.6% in the first quarter of last year, due primarily to a tax benefit associated with the sale of our investment in a foreign subsidiary. For 2010, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be roughly 39%.
On an adjusted cash basis, we still expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 38%. On an adjusted cash basis, which excludes amortization, earnings for the first quarter was $0.81 per share, up 17% from $0.69 per share in the prior year quarter. Also excluded from the GAAP results for the adjusted cash basis reporting is $26 million in acquisition and licensing charges, $5.2 million in costs associated with our Global Supply Chain Initiative and a $3 million legal settlement.
Acquisition and licensing-related charges for the quarter include the amortization of an inventory step-up of $11.8 million, preferred stock accretion of $3.7 million, a licensing payment of $3 million and $2.9 million fair market value adjustment for our Atorvastatin contingent liability.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.57. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $199 million, up 26% compared with the prior year period. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $112 million. Our strong operating cash flow and the proceeds from the sale of our Scinopharm investment were used to repay $223 million of outstanding borrowings. We ended the quarter with just under $1.25 billion of debt and $182 million in cash and marketable securities. We have only $50 million outstanding on our revolver, leaving $450 million of undrawn capacity. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.7x, and our debt-to-capital ratio improved to 28.6% from 32.5% at year end.
In summary, we're very pleased with the start of the year. We continue to execute and grow the business. Our strong balance sheet provides us with a great deal of flexibility to pursue investment opportunity, both internally through product development and externally as opportunities arise.

And as always, our forecasted numbers do no",359,"Thanks, Todd. Our remainder of 2010 forecast includes a couple of things. First, the forecasted numbers, which I will discuss will include, as I said before, the impact of the new health care reform legislation. And as always, our forecasted numbers do not include any significant potential upside from patent challenges.
Our estimate for full year net revenue is now approximately $3.55 billion. We expect Generic revenue to be between $2.25 billion and $2.4 billion, with international revenues now being between $500 million to $550 million. These assumptions, assume in the U.S., some competition on generic Toprol in the fourth quarter and no competition on generic Micro-K. They also take into account revenue reductions in some international markets, by Canada and France.
On the Brand side of the business, we still expect net revenues to be between $440 million and $480 million for the year. This assumption continues to include a first half launch of the value brand of Ferrlecit.
In the ANDA Distribution business we now anticipate revenue to be up and to be between $730 million and $780 million. Based on all of these assumptions, plus current information we have available to us, we now expect adjusted EBITDA of $800 million to $850 million, and adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.25 to $3.45.
In summary, we had a very strong first quarter. We experienced more than 25% growth in revenue, adjusted cash net income and adjusted EBITDA. We are launching new generic and brand products in the U.S. to support our continued growth, and we are focused on growing our key international markets. We are continuing to drive efficiencies throughout our Global Operations network. We continue to invest in a focused and harmonized global R&D pipeline, we continue to invest in business development and clinical development to expand our brand portfolio, and we continue to capitalize opportunities in the marketplace.
With all of this, I believe we have strong momentum built up, and I'm very confident we'll be able to achieve the commitments we made in value [ph] creation for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Patty to open up for questions."

On the International revenue side, we're just taking into account the new realities that we see in Canada and France and the U.K., frankly, as pricing has dropped. With the changes though, that you see in many of those markets, we are not necessarily seeing any impact, all that much of an impact, on margin and profitability. The revenue’s being affected but not so much the profit because of the rebates or whatever the case may be. I think we're in still a pretty good position. We also in all of those markets are launching significant new products throughout the year.

We're pleased with the way things have been going, we sort of anticipate it to look a lot like the 25-milligram and 50-milligram metoprolol. I think that’s what people should look for, for the rest of the year with the Toprol. On Canada, I think that the issue here is, of course, you may have heard that the Ontario Provincial Government reduced the price of generic pharmaceuticals from 50% of brand price to 25%. That has not yet been implemented, although we do expect it to be implemented this year. The implications of that of course are to drive down the revenue in Canada because once Ontario does it, Québec follows in relatively short order, and we do expect the other provinces to follow along. Same sort of thing happened in France, where there was a reduction in overall generic reimbursement. Again, it affected more of the top line than the bottom line but we will see that on the revenue impact going forward. And I think Todd mentioned there’s sort of the weakening of the euro has also sort of impacted overall revenue projections out of rest of Europe and that's a trend that everybody’s sort of seeing."

Our current market share, our current portfolio products that we anticipate launching in those markets and what we think generic substitution is going to look like in those markets on a going forward basis. If you look at France, for example, I believe the last quoted number I heard was the generic substitution in France is still in the 20% and 25% range. And it’s our expectation that, that will have to get higher. And as that goes higher it bodes well for companies like Watson who have a strong pipeline of products, have a good sales force on the ground in France, and I think with that we can offset losses in revenue and profitability because of price declines by literally doing more volume and having more substitution in those markets. So that's kind of the way we look at it. I have not done, I don’t think we’ve done the analysis to kind of figure out what we think the three to five year projected growth rates are. I'm sure those kinds of analysis are out there but we haven't done that, we're looking more from a Watson perspective. So I think we’re in pretty good position across Europe to take advantage of that opportunity. Your question on AMP in the U.S. is a complicated one. We were just at NACDS and that was a conversation topic of intense conversation at NACDS between many of the participants there. And, of course, no one knows what's going to happen the first day AMP gets published for a particular product there will certainly be people who will look at their pricing and look at AMP and say well gee I'm in a pretty good spot, and there are other people who will look at AMP and say well I’m above AMP and so that can’t be good. So any time you have an average there is, by definition, going to be people above and people below. There's going to be some struggling with pricing in various segments of the U.S. market as everybody sort to sorts out where they fall and where everything falls. Also, it's not 100% clear to me that the definitions of AMP will be consistently applied across every manufacturer factor, so I think it's going to take some time to sort all that out. As I said, our conversations at NACDS indicate that everybody’s sort of in the same boat. We're going to just have to wait and see what happens."

If things get delayed, then SG&A will be affected accordingly because we obviously won't affect the spend until we need to. I think your second question was U.S. generic margins, I think we anticipate to stay at the high 40s, 50-ish range, being driven by two major factors. One is our extended release portfolio of products and some of the products that we have coming on, which we expect to have reasonably substantial margins on, as well as the continued ability to drive costs out of our system, our operating system and that will continue. So I don't think you'll see us get much above that 50% range but we should stay fairly stable in that range right now. That's what we anticipate."

It is our belief that the agency – well, from the results of that, from the results of that Advisory Committee we understand the agency is thinking about modifying basically Partial AUC data and being able to come up with various time points prior to the eight-hour time point for measurement. Since that Advisory Committee has been completed, we did recalculate, and we had much of this data, we did recalculate our results and we have shared those with the agency. And we're currently working with the agency on discussing those with them and attempting to show them, of course, that we satisfy the requirements that were discussed at the Advisory Committee. And we hope we can convince them of that. As you also know, there are other things we have to overcome in the Concerta matter. We did make a huge leap last quarter with the victory at the appellate court. We expect the mandate to issue relatively soon and once that happens, if Empax does have exclusivity, their exclusivity will begin to run. If they do not and we can work our way through the agency's issues around Partial AUC data, we could have a potential opportunity. But we continue to work with the agency on that activity. And of course as things warrant, we'll provide updates. On the European question, we have, like everyone else, you do have to sort of step back and you're right, take a pause and think about what's going to happen in these markets and what do we anticipate going forward. I think what we've concluded is that countries can only drive so much cost savings through pharmaceuticals, and at the end of the day, they have to recognize and will ultimately recognize that their single best means of lowering healthcare costs, it's providing good, solid generic products to their citizens. And most of these countries have not achieved the penetration rates for generics yet that they should. And so from our view is that there is an opportunity to participate in these markets because there's got to be growth in the use of generics. As long as the pricing stays above marginal cost, then we think it makes sense for us to participate. And so as we look at the opportunity, we still see an opportunity and a good opportunity for Watson. So we will continue to look for specific strategic investments within the European market. However, we also, as I said before, are looking in South America, looking in Asia-Pacific where many of the emerging markets are presenting a slightly different dynamic, but one where we think the margins will obviously remain stronger and where penetration rates are in the low single-digit ranges. And again, we want to be at the front end of participating in those growth curves. And then you made the comment about committing more resources to the Brand business. We do commit a lot of resources to our Brand business and we'll continue to commit substantial resources to our Brand business and our Biologics business going forward. We happen to be lucky enough to have the resources to be able to do that with cash flow generation and some of the great products that we've had and our execution on getting those products to market. So we're very busy, but we can do all that stuff. So we're pretty excited about all the opportunities. Hope that answers your question."

We'll continue to evaluate, as I said, at all of our facilities to make sure we're achieving the right cost structure. We can also see ourselves investing more in plant and equipment in places like Malta and India, frankly. Malta is a great facility. It probably needs to grow a bit and we expect to spend some money there this year, not a lot, but some for CapEx. And we continue to look at India to see how we can continue to drive throughput. We're doing about 3 billion units this year in India. We're going try to get to the 5 billion to 6 billion range in India over the next year, couple years.

There's been talk about three to four to maybe as many as five competitors in Canada but of course, the fewer the competitors, the larger market share we should be able to garner. So we're pleased about our growing share there. I think our share in the other markets in Europe will be affected more by our launches of new products, particularly products which we manufacture either in Malta or in one of our other facilities. And as we can get costs in line and not have to license in as many products, we should be able to grow our market share in those key markets. So I do continue to see, as we said earlier on, double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis in revenue in our major international markets."

On the KV front, I certainly don't know, all I know is what I've read from their financial listings. They indicated that the earliest that they would be back would be potentially in the fourth quarter. We have sort of assumed, for purposes of our assumptions, that it's not KV. Maybe it is, but for our purposes we assumed it wasn't. And Sandoz indicated publicly that they did not anticipate bringing metoprolol back in the fourth quarter. There are a couple of names we've heard whispered around with the product. At least at the moment I've not heard of Mylan before, but it could be. And we thought to be prudent we'd put at least one competitor in, in the fourth quarter, and we'll see what happens. I think the problem we all have right now in anticipating competition is estimating when the FDA will complete an evaluation of any particular product, particularly extended-release products and particularly metoprolol. Given our experience going through the agency with metoprolol, I think it is a unique experience to say the least. And it is not like a normal immediate release approval where you can count on a certain number of cycles and a certain timeline. Our experience was one that required us to get through the standard procedure and then have a re-review and then yet again, a re-review by higher levels in the agency. So if everybody else has to go through that same process, and if they haven't anticipated that in their timelines, then well, I guess the point is, it's hard to know when they're going to be coming."

Structural factors like not allowing chain drug stores, for example. That has an impact on the ability of penetration because each pharmacist, and there's 300 pharmacies or 500 pharmacies across a particular region, each one gets to make their own buying choice. That leads to a branded generic market. If there are chains like we see here in the U.S., CVS makes one decision and every pharmacy has that product and they drive the product.

I think the French government has said that they're done for a while on that. But as Tom indicated, our concern is what do they do about rebates, because that obviously affects margin more dramatically than potentially pricing. And then, I guess your other question was Canada. I think if Ontario continues with the idea of the 25% range, I do think the other provinces will follow. We do anticipate Canada revenue to be down because of that. But again, it becomes a question of rebates. How is that affecting – the Canadian government has then said, ""Okay, you don't pay rebates."" Now Canadian pharmacists are not real happy about that. And so it's a question of how do they find new ways to increase revenues or save revenue for them, as opposed to losing revenue.

We began 2010 with an exceptionally strong performance across all of our businesses, and we entered into the second quarter with a great deal of positive momentum. Our results also reflect the first full quarter of contributions from our newly acquired international businesses.
Net revenue for the first quarter increased 28% to $857 million. Adjusted cash net income for the quarter increased 25% to $100 million or $0.81 per share, and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter increased 26% to $199 million. Additionally, cash flow from operations was $112 million. We used our strong cash flow in the quarter to reduce our outstanding debt by $220 million and also to increase our investment in Biologics. We finished the quarter with $182 million in cash and investments on hand. And we made considerable progress on our global objectives, capitalized on favorable industry dynamics and certainly exceeded our financial expectations. With this strong momentum, we are increasing our forecast for 2010, raising adjusted cash EPS to between $3.25 and $3.45 and adjusted EBITDA to between $800 million and $850 million.
Now I'd like to run through some of the year-to-date highlights. In our Global Generics business, we received FDA approval for several key generic products. In the U.S., this includes Diltiazem LA, which we launched in March and the 100- and 200-milligram doses of metoprolol ER, which we launched in the third week of April, allowing us to now compete in all dosage forms of that product. X U.S. we received approval for Clopidogrel in Australia, and the product was recently launched.
Even with the challenges in many markets, we continue to expect to achieve double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in Canada, France and Australia this year.
In Global Generics R&D, we have announced 10 new patent challenges to date, including the blockbuster Lidoderm and more recently, Rapamune. In our Global Brand business, we received FDA approval for our six-month formulation of TRELSTAR, the first and only intramuscular GnRH agonist available for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer that can be stored at room temperature. We began shipping this product ahead of schedule on April 15.
We completed a number of brand business development initiatives discussed with you at our Analyst Day, adding significant breadth to our Women's Health franchise and our Biologics capabilities, which I'll summarize in a few moments.
Since the close of the Arrow acquisition, integration has been going according to plan. Our Global Operations team has been actively reviewing all our supply chain capabilities. We have concluded that excess capacity at other facilities, notably, Malta and India, is adequate to absorb current product from our Toronto manufacturing facility, as well as projected manufacturing needs. Additionally, these sites can do so at a more favorable cost. As a result, we announced to our Toronto-based employees a few weeks ago that we plan to close our Toronto [audio gap] facility by the end of 2011. We expect to realize significant operating cost savings, as well as lower overall cost of goods related to this initiative.
I'd like to also spend a moment updating you on healthcare reform, which is being phased in over several years and will influence our U.S. brands and Generic businesses in different ways and at different stages during the implementation. Near-term industry changes resulting from healthcare reform include increases in Medicaid rebates for both brand and generic products and the addition of rebates for patients in Medicare managed care plans or dual eligibles. Beginning next year, our Brand division will began funding its portion of the Medicare donut hole and will be contributing the excise tax based on market share of our NDAs. Longer term on the Generic side, we anticipate that there will be an overall increase in utilization of Generic Pharmaceuticals due to increases in total number of Americans now having access to prescription drug benefits. While there are still some questions on how healthcare reform will be implemented, we have factored these changes into our revised forecast.
Generally speaking, the impact to our business is relatively modest and is far outweighed by growth that we’re seeing in our Generic businesses and overall pricing stability.
I would now like to provide you with some details on our three business segments. Global Generics net revenues were $544 million, an increase of 35% and include x U.S. net product sales of $106 million. Sales on our Oral Contraceptive business were $90 million in the first quarter, and our U.S. Generics over-performance in the quarter was driven by three factors: strong sales of extended-release products, higher volumes and increased efficiencies, which are contributing to lower overall product costs. We also experienced lower generic price erosion in the U.S. than originally participated, which also provided some upside.
Internationally, we experienced pricing pressure in some of our overseas markets such as France, the U.K. and Canada. There are changing dynamics within these markets that we will continue to watch closely. While these actions are happening swifter than expected, we have been anticipating these changes as governments look to control their healthcare expenditures. Ultimately, we anticipate increased utilization of Generics overall and based on our current market share, product offerings and pipeline, we believe that we can continue to grow these markets over the long term.
During the quarter, we increased our investment in Generic R&D by 40% to $42 million. We concluded the quarter with over 100 ANDAs on file with the U.S. FDA and with 77 Paragraph IV challenges and more than 900 applications pending outside of the U.S. Close to half of the U.S. Paragraph IV opportunities are first-to-file or shared exclusivity opportunities.
Moving to our Global Brands division, revenue was $91 million, down $21 million as anticipated in the first quarter. This decrease reflects the planned lost of Ferrlecit, which was returned to Santa Fe at the end of 2009 and was offset somewhat by the addition of our new products RAPAFLO and Gelnique. More recently, we are experiencing increased prescription transfer for RAPAFLO as result of Flomax going generic in March and also seeing growth in Gelnique due to increased promotion and reach by our sales force. We expect both products to be important contributors to our Global Brands business over the longer term.
Additionally, we continue to expect FDA approval of the generic version of Ferrlecit in the first half of 2010, recall that we signed a licensing agreement with GeneraMedix to market this product upon FDA approval, and we will be promoting it within our Brand division.
Since January, we have taken significant steps to expand our Brand business.  We announced an agreement with HRA to become the commercial partner for a novel next generation emergency contraceptive, which is currently marketed in the U.K. as ellaOne. The FDA advisory committee on reproductive health will be meeting on June 17 to discuss this product. We also announced a licensing agreement with the Population Council to commercialize an investigational vaginal contraceptive ring in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The ring is currently in Phase III clinical development for contraceptive use for up to one year.
We also announced an agreement during the quarter to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to the Colombia’s bioadhesive progesterone gel products currently marketed under the trade names CRINONE and Prochieve, for the indications of infertility and secondary amenorrhea. Under the agreement, we will also collaborate on the ongoing Phase III development program toward a new indication for the prevention of preterm birth and women with a short cervix, as well as global development program for a second generation product for this indication. Of course this transaction is still subject to certain closing conditions and we continue to work with Columbia to get those conditions satisfied.
Lastly, we purchased the remaining 64% of Eden Biodesign for the development and commercialization of Biologics. Since the acquisition, we have approved several contract manufacturing projects designed to increase the near-term third-party revenue, while we simultaneously worked to implement internal R&D projects for Watson’s own Biologics development efforts.
Turning now to our Distribution business, and it had revenues of $221 million, an increase of 44%. Large contributors to ANDAs growth were new generic third party product launches notably generic versions of Aldara and Flomax, as well as additional brand products sales. With that, and I'll turn the call over to Todd to take us through some of the financials. Todd?"
36478,100703025,62775,"Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-10-2010",2010-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","The solid financial performance in the first quarter has us off to a good start for 2010.

We experienced strong earnings in cash flow. Our liquidity improved with the sale of our interest in Scinopharm, and we used the proceeds and excess operating cash flow to reduce revolver borrowings. Our strong balance sheet has us well-positioned to capitalize on strategic investment opportunities, in support of our long-term growth objectives.
I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis, which includes a full quarter of our new Global business. For the first quarter of 2010, consolidated net revenues was $857 million, an increase of 28% over the prior year period. Net revenue for our Generic division was $544 million, up 35% on a year-over-year basis. This includes x U.S. product sales of $106 million, x U.S. sales were lower than expected due to pricing pressure in several key markets. 
Foreign exchange also had some impact on our top line results, although the impact on net earnings was minimal. U.S. generic revenues and margins remain strong due to better-than-expected pricing and higher sales of our extended-release products, including the metoprolol ER and the recently launched Diltiazem LA. Sales of oral contraceptives were $90 million in the first quarter, up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was 50.2%, up 3.5 percentage points on a sequential basis and up 7.8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year increase in adjusted gross margin reflects higher sales of extended-released products at favorable margins, better-than-expected pricing for our base portfolio and lower year-over-year unit manufacturing costs, as a result of cost savings from our Global Supply Chain Initiative and slightly higher unit production.
We expect Generic gross margins to remain strong for the remainder of the year, given the recent launch of two new strengths of metoprolol and ongoing cost savings from our Global Supply Chain Initiative.
Moving to the Brand division, net revenue was $91 million, down 18% from the prior year period. Product sales were $72 million, down 26% year-over-year. The decrease reflects the loss of Ferrlecit, which was partially offset by sales of RAPAFLO and Gelnique, and increased sales of ANDRODERM. Brand other revenue was $19 million for the quarter, an increase of 36% over last year due primarily to higher co-promote revenue from Androgel and Femring. Brand adjusted gross margin was 73%, down from 78.4% in the first quarter of last year, reflecting the loss of Ferrlecit. Finally, net revenue from our Distribution segment was $221 million, up 44% or $68 million from the prior year period due to higher third-party product launches and higher brand sales.
Distribution segment adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 13.1%, down from 18% last year due to product mix, which includes the impact of higher brand sales. Gross margin in the first quarter of last year was favorably impacted by marketplace shortages on certain products.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses. Consolidated R&D for the first quarter was $59.5 million, up 41% compared to the prior year period due to increased investment in both our Global Generic and Brand divisions. Generic R&D increased due to higher x U.S. development spending. The increased Brand R&D investment was due to product development and licensing and higher clinical spending.
For the full year 2010, we continue to expect total R&D spending in the range of $240 million to $260 million. We are currently trending toward the higher end of this range. SG&A for the first quarter was $152 million, an increase of $17 million over the prior year period. The current year period includes a $3 million litigation settlement, while the prior year includes $19 million in litigation charges. For 2010, we still expect our SG&A to be in the range of $630 million to $680 million. However, we now expect to be at the lower end of this range.
Amortization for the first quarter was $39 million, up from $22 million last year, reflecting higher amortization as a result of the Arrow acquisition. For 2010, we expect amortization expense to be roughly $170 million. Our GAAP tax rate in the first quarter was 34.5%, down from 38.6% in the first quarter of last year, due primarily to a tax benefit associated with the sale of our investment in a foreign subsidiary. For 2010, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be roughly 39%.
On an adjusted cash basis, we still expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 38%. On an adjusted cash basis, which excludes amortization, earnings for the first quarter was $0.81 per share, up 17% from $0.69 per share in the prior year quarter. Also excluded from the GAAP results for the adjusted cash basis reporting is $26 million in acquisition and licensing charges, $5.2 million in costs associated with our Global Supply Chain Initiative and a $3 million legal settlement.
Acquisition and licensing-related charges for the quarter include the amortization of an inventory step-up of $11.8 million, preferred stock accretion of $3.7 million, a licensing payment of $3 million and $2.9 million fair market value adjustment for our Atorvastatin contingent liability.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.57. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $199 million, up 26% compared with the prior year period. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $112 million. Our strong operating cash flow and the proceeds from the sale of our Scinopharm investment were used to repay $223 million of outstanding borrowings. We ended the quarter with just under $1.25 billion of debt and $182 million in cash and marketable securities. We have only $50 million outstanding on our revolver, leaving $450 million of undrawn capacity. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.7x, and our debt-to-capital ratio improved to 28.6% from 32.5% at year end.
In summary, we're very pleased with the start of the year. We continue to execute and grow the business. Our strong balance sheet provides us with a great deal of flexibility to pursue investment opportunity, both internally through product development and externally as opportunities arise. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2010 forecast and concluding remarks."

First, the forecasted numbers, which I will discuss will include, as I said before, the impact of the new health care reform legislation. And as always, our forecasted numbers do not include any significant potential upside from patent challenges.
Our estimate for full year net revenue is now approximately $3.55 billion. We expect Generic revenue to be between $2.25 billion and $2.4 billion, with international revenues now being between $500 million to $550 million. These assumptions, assume in the U.S., some competition on generic Toprol in the fourth quarter and no competition on generic Micro-K. They also take into account revenue reductions in some international markets, by Canada and France.
On the Brand side of the business, we still expect net revenues to be between $440 million and $480 million for the year. This assumption continues to include a first half launch of the value brand of Ferrlecit.
In the ANDA Distribution business we now anticipate revenue to be up and to be between $730 million and $780 million. Based on all of these assumptions, plus current information we have available to us, we now expect adjusted EBITDA of $800 million to $850 million, and adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.25 to $3.45.
In summary, we had a very strong first quarter. We experienced more than 25% growth in revenue, adjusted cash net income and adjusted EBITDA. We are launching new generic and brand products in the U.S. to support our continued growth, and we are focused on growing our key international markets. We are continuing to drive efficiencies throughout our Global Operations network. We continue to invest in a focused and harmonized global R&D pipeline, we continue to invest in business development and clinical development to expand our brand portfolio, and we continue to capitalize opportunities in the marketplace.
With all of this, I believe we have strong momentum built up, and I'm very confident we'll be able to achieve the commitments we made in value [ph] creation for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Patty to open up for questions."

On the International revenue side, we're just taking into account the new realities that we see in Canada and France and the U.K., frankly, as pricing has dropped. With the changes though, that you see in many of those markets, we are not necessarily seeing any impact, all that much of an impact, on margin and profitability.

In Canada, for example, we expect to be launching LIPITOR sometime mid-year and so, we expect to see that make up the difference on the margin and profitability line, although with the revenue being somewhat funded by the changes that are taking place at the governmental level."

We're pleased with the way things have been going, we sort of anticipate it to look a lot like the 25-milligram and 50-milligram metoprolol. I think that’s what people should look for, for the rest of the year with the Toprol. On Canada, I think that the issue here is, of course, you may have heard that the Ontario Provincial Government reduced the price of generic pharmaceuticals from 50% of brand price to 25%. That has not yet been implemented, although we do expect it to be implemented this year. The implications of that of course are to drive down the revenue in Canada because once Ontario does it, Québec follows in relatively short order, and we do expect the other provinces to follow along. Same sort of thing happened in France, where there was a reduction in overall generic reimbursement. Again, it affected more of the top line than the bottom line but we will see that on the revenue impact going forward. And I think Todd mentioned there’s sort of the weakening of the euro has also sort of impacted overall revenue projections out of rest of Europe and that's a trend that everybody’s sort of seeing."

Our current market share, our current portfolio products that we anticipate launching in those markets and what we think generic substitution is going to look like in those markets on a going forward basis. If you look at France, for example, I believe the last quoted number I heard was the generic substitution in France is still in the 20% and 25% range. And it’s our expectation that, that will have to get higher. And as that goes higher it bodes well for companies like Watson who have a strong pipeline of products, have a good sales force on the ground in France, and I think with that we can offset losses in revenue and profitability because of price declines by literally doing more volume and having more substitution in those markets. So that's kind of the way we look at it. I have not done, I don’t think we’ve done the analysis to kind of figure out what we think the three to five year projected growth rates are. I'm sure those kinds of analysis are out there but we haven't done that, we're looking more from a Watson perspective. So I think we’re in pretty good position across Europe to take advantage of that opportunity. Your question on AMP in the U.S. is a complicated one. We were just at NACDS and that was a conversation topic of intense conversation at NACDS between many of the participants there. And, of course, no one knows what's going to happen the first day AMP gets published for a particular product there will certainly be people who will look at their pricing and look at AMP and say well gee I'm in a pretty good spot, and there are other people who will look at AMP and say well I’m above AMP and so that can’t be good. So any time you have an average there is, by definition, going to be people above and people below. There's going to be some struggling with pricing in various segments of the U.S. market as everybody sort to sorts out where they fall and where everything falls. Also, it's not 100% clear to me that the definitions of AMP will be consistently applied across every manufacturer factor, so I think it's going to take some time to sort all that out. As I said, our conversations at NACDS indicate that everybody’s sort of in the same boat. We're going to just have to wait and see what happens."

When you say gross margins could remain strong, is the 50% range we saw this quarter sustainable?

If things get delayed, then SG&A will be affected accordingly because we obviously won't affect the spend until we need to. I think your second question was U.S. generic margins, I think we anticipate to stay at the high 40s, 50-ish range, being driven by two major factors. One is our extended release portfolio of products and some of the products that we have coming on, which we expect to have reasonably substantial margins on, as well as the continued ability to drive costs out of our system, our operating system and that will continue. So I don't think you'll see us get much above that 50% range but we should stay fairly stable in that range right now. That's what we anticipate."

It is our belief that the agency – well, from the results of that, from the results of that Advisory Committee we understand the agency is thinking about modifying basically Partial AUC data and being able to come up with various time points prior to the eight-hour time point for measurement. Since that Advisory Committee has been completed, we did recalculate, and we had much of this data, we did recalculate our results and we have shared those with the agency. And we're currently working with the agency on discussing those with them and attempting to show them, of course, that we satisfy the requirements that were discussed at the Advisory Committee. And we hope we can convince them of that. As you also know, there are other things we have to overcome in the Concerta matter. We did make a huge leap last quarter with the victory at the appellate court. We expect the mandate to issue relatively soon and once that happens, if Empax does have exclusivity, their exclusivity will begin to run. If they do not and we can work our way through the agency's issues around Partial AUC data, we could have a potential opportunity. But we continue to work with the agency on that activity. And of course as things warrant, we'll provide updates. On the European question, we have, like everyone else, you do have to sort of step back and you're right, take a pause and think about what's going to happen in these markets and what do we anticipate going forward. I think what we've concluded is that countries can only drive so much cost savings through pharmaceuticals, and at the end of the day, they have to recognize and will ultimately recognize that their single best means of lowering healthcare costs is providing good, solid generic products to their citizens. And most of these countries have not achieved the penetration rates for generics yet that they should. And so from our view is that there is an opportunity to participate in these markets because there's got to be growth in the use of generics. As long as the pricing stays above marginal cost, then we think it makes sense for us to participate. And so as we look at the opportunity, we still see an opportunity and a good opportunity for Watson. So we will continue to look for specific strategic investments within the European market. However, we also, as I've said before, are looking in South America, looking in Asia-Pacific where, though many of the emerging markets are presenting a slightly different dynamic, but one where we think the margins will obviously remain stronger and where penetration rates are in the low single-digit ranges. And again, we want to be at the front end of participating in those growth curves. And then you made the comment about committing more resources to the Brand business. We do commit a lot of resources to our Brand business and we'll continue to commit substantial resources to our Brand business and our Biologics business going forward. We happen to be lucky enough to have the resources to be able to do that with cash flow generation and some of the great products that we've had and our execution on getting those products to market. So we're very busy, but we can do all that stuff. So we're pretty excited about all the opportunities. Hope that answers your question."

We'll continue to evaluate, as I said, all of our facilities to make sure we're achieving the right cost structure. We can also see ourselves investing more in plant and equipment in places like Malta and India, frankly. Malta is a great facility. It probably needs to grow a bit and we expect to spend some money there this year, not a lot, but some for CapEx. And we continue to look at India to see how we can continue to drive throughput. We're doing about 3 billion units this year in India. We're going try to get to the five to 6 billion range in India over the next year, couple years.

There are a couple of names we've heard whispered around with the product. At least at the moment I've not heard of Mylan before, but it could be. And we thought to be prudent we'd put at least one competitor in, in the fourth quarter, and we'll see what happens. I think the problem we all have right now in anticipating competition is estimating when the FDA will complete an evaluation of any particular product, particularly extended-release products and particularly metoprolol. Given our experience going through the agency with metoprolol, I think it is a unique experience to say the least. And it is not like a normal immediate release approval where you can count on a certain number of cycles and a certain timeline. Our experience was one that required us to get through the standard procedure and then have a re-review and then yet again, a re-review by higher levels in the agency. So if everybody else has to go through that same process, and if they haven't anticipated that in their timelines, then well, I guess the point is, it's hard to know when they're going to be coming."

I think people have learned and I think we've all learned to be cautious about how we attack markets. And then I guess from a specific Watson perspective, I like our base business because the more complicated the product, the more likely it is you're going to be stable. And we have a lot of complicated products. We have DOCs and we have the extended-release products, and we're getting more extended-release products. And those products are difficult to manufacture, they're difficult to start from a dead stop on and so you don't see people generating tons of inventory and trying to launch in and take 20% market share that they have to sort of build their way in. That tends to lead, as we've discussed in the past, to more stable markets. So I like our base business. I think it's going to remain stable over the long haul because of the way we've structured ourselves. And I forgot one major factor, our patch business. I mean our patch business and gel business gives us a lot of strength on the bench, and we look forward to bringing as many of those products to market as we can. We've seen those markets remain very, very stable. So I like the base business."

And there was at least the recognition that supply chain was very critical to the decision-making process. Doesn't mean they're not going to look for lowest possible price. But supply chain has become a critical matter for people. Big customers are going and doing their own audits of suppliers, and in some cases, are choosing not to do business with some customers. So that's the first time I've ever heard that happen. I mean, I think it's just the recognition of the fact that if they lose their supply of a generic, it is devastating to their bottom line."

And there are some structural factors that are going to prevent them from achieving the penetration rates that we see here in the U.S., but once those structural factors are addressed in those markets, I would anticipate penetration rates to be achieved very, very quickly. Structural factors like not allowing chain drug stores, for example. That has an impact on the ability of penetration because each pharmacist, and there's 300 pharmacies or 500 pharmacies across a particular region, each one gets to make their own buying choice. That leads to a branded generic market. If there are chains like we see here in the U.S., CVS makes one decision and every pharmacy has that product and they drive the product. So there are structural things that will change in these markets ultimately and will lead to higher substitution rates."

So there, the business is now about cost and how do you drive down your acquisition costs. And for us it's about switching in-licensed products with manufactured products there. France, I think pricing, while it's still in the – I think it's down somewhat from the 45%, I think it may be down 5% or 7% off of that, we don't expect that to continue to go down. I think the French government has said that they're done for a while on that. But as Tom indicated, our concern is what do they do about rebates, because that obviously affects margin more dramatically than potentially pricing. And then, I guess your other question was Canada. I think if Ontario continues with the idea of the 25% range, I do think the other provinces will follow. We do anticipate Canada revenue to be down because of that. But again, it becomes a question of rebates. How is that affecting – the Canadian government has then said, ""Okay, you don't pay rebates."" Now Canadian pharmacists are not real happy about that. And so it's a question of how do they find new ways to increase revenues or save revenue for them, as opposed to losing revenue. So we have to work our way through the nuances of each of those markets. Having said all that, I think we're still in a good spot that the products that we're going to be launching, the number of products we're going to launching and basically from our starting point. So we're still bullish on these markets and we're still going to be very active in them."

Adjusted net income for the second quarter increased 22% to $103 million or $0.83 per share, and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter increased 26% to $207 million.
Our performance during the quarter was driven by a number of factors, including significant generic product introductions in the U.S., particularly the 100 and 200 mg strengths of Metoprolol, continued strength in our Oral Contraceptive business, the addition of product sales from our international markets and adjusted gross margin growth of five percentage points in our Global Generics business helped round out a solid performance in our Global Generics segment. 
In our Global Brand business, the highlights include greater than 25% sequential increase in prescriptions in the second quarter for RAPAFLO and greater than 20% increase in prescriptions for Gelnique. We expect both products will remain important contributors to our Global Brand business over the longer term.
We also saw the best segment contribution ever from our Anda Distribution business. It delivered a 24% increase in net revenues, driven by new product launches in the industry. While delivering strong financial results, we also invested in supporting future growth. Investment in R&D was up 49% to $44.6 million for generic R&D and up 36% to $17.2 million for brand R&D. We announced a significant number of patent challenges in the U.S., with six new Paragraph 4 filings in the quarter, bringing the number to 12 year-to-date. 
We currently have over 110 ANDAs pending at the U.S. FDA and over 900 dossiers pending outside of the U.S. We also took significant steps to expand both our brand product portfolio and our brand product pipeline. TRELSTAR 6-month is our newest addition to the portfolio, and the recent launch has been met with enthusiasm due to its unique attributes, including low needle pain and no need for refrigeration. 
Also, on June 7, the FDA Advisory Committee on Reproductive Health (sic) [Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs] voted unanimously in favor of approval of HRA's next-generation emergency contraceptive product, currently marketed in Europe as ellaOne. We remain optimistic that this product will be approved this year. Additionally, we have a novel oral contraceptive pending FDA approval, and we expect to hear about that application by the end of the third quarter. We have not forecasted any sales for these two contraceptives in 2010.
We recently completed enrollment for the Phase II study for Uracyst for cystitis. The study will be completed by the fall, and we anticipate results later this year. If the data is positive, we will look to initiate a Phase III study in 2011. 
Following the close of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of CRINONE's progesterone gel product line from Columbia. We immediately began marketing CRINONE to infertility clinics, and we'll be expanding promotion to OB/GYNs with our institutional and women's health field forces in the coming months. We expect to bring more than 3x the previous promotional effort to bear on this product. 
Columbia's Phase III clinical trial for the prevention of pre-term birth is fully enrolled, and results are expected later this year. We are hopeful that the results will support the filing of an NDA in 2011. And lastly, we announced the worldwide licensing agreement with Itero Biopharmaceutics (sic) [Itero Biopharmaceuticals] for their rFSH product, currently in pre-clinical development for the treatment of infertility. This product leverages our world-class resources at Eden Biodesign in our Salt Lake City facility. We expect to be able to develop this product in a cost-effective way.
Now I'd like to provide some color on our International business. With the acquisition of Arrow, we gained a strong foothold in a number of countries and gained some terrific U.S. pipeline assets like generic  LIPITOR, Pulmicort and ZOVIRAX. Since the beginning of the year, we have launched a number of new products in various markets, the largest opportunity of which was generic LIPITOR in Canada. While the market for this product was more competitive than originally anticipated, it is an important product to have in Canada. 
It's important to remember, as you follow our International business, that Arrow was largely a decentralized organization, and they initially built their commercial infrastructure with many in-licensed products. We have made significant progress towards centralizing the organization, enhancing the management structures, balancing the product and development portfolios with the emphasis on manufacturing our own products globally and filing as many Watson products as possible into these markets. 
We've had three key goals for each market: First, restructuring the existing commercial operations in that market to be agile, efficient and profitable; second, we are looking to expand the depth of our product offerings and total market share in each market; third, and longer term, we look to enhance our base business by shifting the balance from in-licensed products to our own manufactured products and creating a strong pipeline with significant product launches for the future. While we have a lot of work to do, I couldn't be more pleased with the assets that we purchased and the progress that we made thus far. And I'm excited for the future of this business, given the many opportunities that I see on the horizon.
Finally, yesterday, we announced that Siggi Olafsson has joined us as our new Executive Vice President for Global Generics Division effective September 1. Siggi most recently served as CEO of Actavis Group, where he was responsible for overseeing Actavis' $2.4 billion global pharmaceutical business, with operations in more than 40 countries. Siggi brings tremendous global experience to our team, and I couldn't be more pleased to have him join us. Siggi will succeed Tom Russillo, who will retire effective at the end of 2010. 
I would just like to say that Tom played an instrumental role in the integration of the Arrow assets and in identifying strategies for Watson's global growth. Before that, Tom was critical to Watson's global supply chain improvement efforts, as well as a driving force in revitalizing our U.S. Generics R&D efforts. I would like to thank them for all of his efforts and wish him all the best in his retirement.
Over the next few months, Tom and Siggi will work together to continue our globalization efforts and begin the next phase of maximizing our current commercial footprint and capitalizing on additional opportunities to expand into these markets. 
So in summary, we delivered strong financial results during the quarter, while continuing to take steps necessary to capitalize on numerous opportunities to grow our business globally. And with that, let me turn the call over to Todd for some more color on the financials. Todd?"
36478,109107908,72467,"Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. For the second quarter of 2010, consolidated net revenue was $875 million, an increase of 29% over the prior-year period. Net revenue for our Global Generics division was",933,"I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. For the second quarter of 2010, consolidated net revenue was $875 million, an increase of 29% over the prior-year period. Net revenue for our Global Generics division was $571 million, up 42% on a year-over-year basis. x U.S. net revenues were $111 million. Sequentially, International net revenues were essentially flat, as unit growth was offset by lower pricing and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
U.S. Generics revenues and margins remained strong due to relatively stable pricing and higher sales of our extended release products, including Metoprolol ER and Diltiazem LA. Oral contraceptive sales were up 12% over last year to $97 million. Adjusted gross margin for the Generics division was 48.6%, up 4.9 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. The increase in adjusted gross margin reflects the continuation of recent trends, including higher sales of extended release products and favorable margins, relatively stable pricing for our U.S.-based portfolio and lower year-over-year unit manufacturing costs as a result of cost savings from our global supply chain initiative and slightly higher unit production levels. 
Moving to the Brand division, net revenue was $104 million, down 10% from the prior-year period. Product sales were $77 million, down 21% year-over-year. The decrease reflects the loss of Ferrlecit, which was partially offset by increased sales of RAPAFLO, ANDRODERM and INFeD. Brand other revenue was $27 million for the quarter, an increase of 51%, as a result of outlicensing revenue for two legacy brand products. For the full year, we expect Brand other revenue to be approximately $80 million.
Brand adjusted gross margin was 77.2%, down from 80.9% in the second quarter of last year, reflecting the loss of Ferrlecit. Brand gross margin was up over four percentage points sequentially from 73% in the first quarter, reflecting the increase in other revenue and lower sales of products supplied to third parties under contract manufacturing arrangements. 
Finally, net revenues from our Distribution segment was $201 million, up 24% or $40 million from the prior-year period due to higher third-party product launches and higher brand sales. Distribution segment adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 16.1%, up from 15.1% last year, mainly as a result of favorable product mix in the quarter.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses. Consolidated R&D for the second quarter were $61.8 million, up 45% compared to the prior-year period due to the addition of our International business and increased investment in generic and brand R&D. Generic R&D increased due to the higher investment in product development. Brand R&D increased as a result of Eden, as well as higher clinical spending, including the initiation of a Phase III study during the quarter. For the full year 2010, we expect total R&D spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $260 million to $275 million. 
SG&A for the second quarter was $157 million, an increase of $28 million over the prior-year period. The increase is mainly as a result of our International business, higher legal and personnel costs and an increase in bad debt of $5.8 million related to our distribution business. The increase in bad debt was a result of the bankruptcy filing of Chem Rx. For 2010, we expect our SG&A spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $620 million to $650 million.
Amortization for the second quarter is $43 million, up from $22 million last year, reflecting higher amortization as a result of the Arrow acquisition. For 2010, we expect amortization expense to be approximately $175 million. 
Our GAAP tax rate in the second quarter was 28%, down from 42% in the second quarter of last year. The decrease was due to certain non-recurring tax benefits associated with the Arrow acquisition. These one-time tax benefits are excluded from our adjusted cash earnings. For 2010, we now expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 34%. On an adjusted cash basis, we continue to expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 38%.
On an adjusted cash basis, which excludes amortization, earnings for the second quarter is $0.83 per share, up 14% from $0.73 per share in the prior-year quarter. Also excluded from the GAAP results for adjusted cash basis reporting were $8.8 million in acquisition- and licensing-related charges and $15.5 million in costs associated with our Global Supply Chain Initiative. Acquisition- and licensing-related charges for the quarter included preferred stock accretion of $3.8 million, a $3 million adjustment related to our terms debt and contingent liability, and integration costs of $2 million. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.57. 
Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $207 million, up 26% compared with the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $74 million. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of debt and $236 million in cash and marketable securities. We have $50 million outstanding on our revolver, leaving $450 million of undrawn capacity. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.6x, and our debt-to-capital ratio improved to 28.4% from 32.5% at year end.
We are pleased with our accomplishments this year. We're well positioned financially and have a proven track record of delevering after major acquisitions, as recognized by our ratings upgrades in the quarter by Moody's and S&P. We're well positioned to capitalize on a number of opportunities for future growth. With that, I will turn the call back over to Paul for an update of the 2010 forecast and concluding remarks."

I will now give you a little guidance on the rest of 2010. Our estimate for full year net revenue is approximately $3.5 billion. We expect our Global Generics segment revenue, including our International revenues, to be between $2.25 billion",448,"Thanks, Todd. I will now give you a little guidance on the rest of 2010. Our estimate for full year net revenue is approximately $3.5 billion. We expect our Global Generics segment revenue, including our International revenues, to be between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion. 
Turning to the assumptions for our U.S. Generics business, we now have one additional competitor in Metoprolol, which we estimate will have a modest pricing impact and a modest unit decline. We now expect no competition on generic Micro K in 2010. Our U.S. forecast does include a modest contribution from some patent challenges. However, we have not included any impact for generic Concerta or generic Lovenox. 
On the International front, we are continuing to experience many positive dynamics, including unit growth. And we, as I've said earlier, have more than 900 pending dossiers outside of the U.S. As with all the players in these markets, we have been experiencing the impact of lower pricing, greater-than-anticipated changes in government regulations and the impact of foreign currency. 
While we are very encouraged by the growth of the international operations, there are many moving pieces. And we currently expect our international revenues in the second half to be higher than the first half, weighted toward the fourth quarter. Conforming to industry practice, we have determined that there is limited value on a separate regional revenue forecast. We will, of course, continue to provide visibility on the performance of the business by reporting international net revenue on a quarterly basis.
On the Brands side of the business, we expect net revenues to be between $440 million and $460 million for the year. The assumptions now include a third quarter launch of our value brand of Ferrlecit. 
With the Anda Distribution business, we anticipate revenues between $760 million and $800 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $820 million to $850 million and adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.30 to $3.45.
In summary then, we experienced a great quarter and a great half year. We experienced more than 20% growth in revenue, adjusted cash net income and adjusted EBITDA. We continue to launch new generic products and expand our portfolio of brand products. We are making notable progress in growing our International business and expanding our global footprint. We're continuing to drive efficiencies resulting in continued strong profitability. And finally, we continue to invest in R&D patent challenges and business development. 
As you can see, we're making significant strides in every one of the initiatives we set out to accomplish in 2010, and I couldn't be more excited about the prospects for the future of Watson. So with that, let's open it up for questions. Patty?"

With that, what the most of the managed care plans were doing is waiting to see whether in fact the brand company is going to chase the generic price down or whether they will just going to allow generics to come in to the marketplace and hold the brand price. That's what they did. So Flomax was essentially then moved to Tier 3. Generics occupied Tier 1 and allowed us an opportunity to occupy Tier 2 in many of these plans. Most of that negotiation had been done during the fourth and first quarter of last year and this year. We are just waiting for the event. And so when that event occur, what they've allowed to do is now finalize those activities, get those programs in place. And what you're seeing in second and third quarter and will see in third quarter is the pull-through of this related to those plans. So yes, you should expect to see some incremental growth on RAPAFLO due to some better managed care physicians. Now Gelnique is just a general slug-it-out time to get additional placement in managed care. Our placement is actually pretty good right now. We occupy between Tier 2 and a non-encumbered Tier 3. Most of the major plans, we're in a pretty good position there."

How does that factor, or does this make you at all consider backing off further business development plans or investments next year as market still -- can you just give us a little bit better sense of how some of these geographies really evolve?"

I actually think this presents a great opportunity. A lot of the companies are re-evaluating their ability to operate in these markets, and that created an opportunity for Watson who is committed, and we are committed to growing our global business. And so for us, it creates a buying opportunity. And so we have been actively pursuing opportunities across multiple markets. We've not singled out any particular region or market that we want to be focused on. What we've said is we want to look at our European businesses, try to help support them by increasing their footprint and their magnitude within each of the countries. We've also said we've been looking at Asia-Pacific, the Asia-Pacific region. Since we have such a strong presence already in that region, we'd like to fill that region out. And finally, we've looked to emerging markets in South America, in Turkey and other places to also fill out. So a little bit will be driven by opportunity, when opportunities present themselves, but we have no particular country that we're focused on other than what the opportunities have presented."

The issue raised in the second CP, the FDA put out a guidance. Clearly, they thought about this beforehand. So once the guidance was issued, it was our position that the FDA carefully considered what they were going to do and issue the guidance. We met the guidance, so it should be denied.

In certain close models, certain -- and sometimes in mail order.

And I think people just sort of miss the point that we have something like 27, 28 different generic oral contraceptives. And it's hard to get approvals, A. And B, to get 20 or 25 to 30 approvals and have a basket of products is not something you can do overnight. Everybody knows the agency's taking 26, 28 months to get approvals done, and these are hard products, so the agency's going to take an extra look at them. So I guess, at the end of the day, we just haven't seen -- we also haven't seen the competition coming on as aggressively and as hard as that was originally anticipated. So our OC numbers are up slightly, I think, quarter-over-quarter. And I guess, we expect that trend to continue not necessarily up but to remain reasonably flat for the second half of the year. A lot of times too, it's the new launches, our new launches of products that help drive that number. And certainly, products like Next Choice have been very positive for Watson, and that also has helped offset any loss of share for the older brands or the older products that competitors have come in with. 2011 will be maybe a different story. We'll have to evaluate it at the time we give guidance for 2011. But again, I'm sort of reluctant to believe that somebody's going to get 30 approvals in a six-month period and be able to be fully competitive in that market."

France, the utilization rate still is in the 20% to 30% range. If units -- these governments are certainly well served, I understand, they're trying to control costs by cutting price but they're actually better off by driving substitution. And I think it's the bet of all the generic companies that their governments are going to realize that and drive substitution. And over time, we'll be certainly better off with substitution rates in the 70% and 80% range, will certainly make up for any product, any cost decline.

Net revenue for the second quarter increased 29% to $875 million. Adjusted net income for the second quarter increased 22% to $103 million or $0.83 per share, and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter increased 26% to $207 million.
Our performance during the quarter was driven by a number of factors, including significant generic product introductions in the U.S., particularly the 100 and 200 mg strengths of Metoprolol, continued strength in our Oral Contraceptive business, the addition of product sales from our international markets and adjusted gross margin growth of five percentage points in our Global Generics business helped round out a solid performance in our Global Generics segment. 
In our Global Brand business, the highlights include greater than 25% sequential increase in prescriptions in the second quarter for RAPAFLO and greater than 20% increase in prescriptions for Gelnique. We expect both products will remain important contributors to our Global Brand business over the longer term.
We also saw the best segment contribution ever from our Anda Distribution business. It delivered a 24% increase in net revenues, driven by new product launches in the industry. While delivering strong financial results, we also invested in supporting future growth. Investment in R&D was up 49% to $44.6 million for generic R&D and up 36% to $17.2 million for brand R&D. We announced a significant number of patent challenges in the U.S., with six new Paragraph 4 filings in the quarter, bringing the number to 12 year-to-date. 
We currently have over 110 ANDAs pending at the U.S. FDA and over 900 dossiers pending outside of the U.S. We also took significant steps to expand both our brand product portfolio and our brand product pipeline. TRELSTAR 6-month is our newest addition to the portfolio, and the recent launch has been met with enthusiasm due to its unique attributes, including low needle pain and no need for refrigeration. 
Also, on June 7, the FDA Advisory Committee on Reproductive Health (sic) [Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs] voted unanimously in favor of approval of HRA's next-generation emergency contraceptive product, currently marketed in Europe as ellaOne. We remain optimistic that this product will be approved this year. Additionally, we have a novel oral contraceptive pending FDA approval, and we expect to hear about that application by the end of the third quarter. We have not forecasted any sales for these two contraceptives in 2010.
We recently completed enrollment for the Phase II study for Uracyst for cystitis. The study will be completed by the fall, and we anticipate results later this year. If the data is positive, we will look to initiate a Phase III study in 2011. 
Following the close of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of CRINONE's progesterone gel product line from Columbia. We immediately began marketing CRINONE to infertility clinics, and we'll be expanding promotion to OB/GYNs with our institutional and women's health field forces in the coming months. We expect to bring more than 3x the previous promotional effort to bear on this product. 
Columbia's Phase III clinical trial for the prevention of pre-term birth is fully enrolled, and results are expected later this year. We are hopeful that the results will support the filing of an NDA in 2011. And lastly, we announced the worldwide licensing agreement with Itero Biopharmaceutics (sic) [Itero Biopharmaceuticals] for their rFSH product, currently in pre-clinical development for the treatment of infertility. This product leverages our world-class resources at Eden Biodesign in our Salt Lake City facility. We expect to be able to develop this product in a cost-effective way.
Now I'd like to provide some color on our International business. With the acquisition of Arrow, we gained a strong foothold in a number of countries and gained some terrific U.S. pipeline assets like generic  LIPITOR, Pulmicort and ZOVIRAX. Since the beginning of the year, we have launched a number of new products in various markets, the largest opportunity of which was generic LIPITOR in Canada. While the market for this product was more competitive than originally anticipated, it is an important product to have in Canada. 
It's important to remember, as you follow our International business, that Arrow was largely a decentralized organization, and they initially built their commercial infrastructure with many in-licensed products. We have made significant progress towards centralizing the organization, enhancing the management structures, balancing the product and development portfolios with the emphasis on manufacturing our own products globally and filing as many Watson products as possible into these markets. 
We've had three key goals for each market: First, restructuring the existing commercial operations in that market to be agile, efficient and profitable; second, we are looking to expand the depth of our product offerings and total market share in each market; third, and longer term, we look to enhance our base business by shifting the balance from in-licensed products to our own manufactured products and creating a strong pipeline with significant product launches for the future. While we have a lot of work to do, I couldn't be more pleased with the assets that we purchased and the progress that we made thus far. And I'm excited for the future of this business, given the many opportunities that I see on the horizon.
Finally, yesterday, we announced that Siggi Olafsson has joined us as our new Executive Vice President for Global Generics Division effective September 1. Siggi most recently served as CEO of Actavis Group, where he was responsible for overseeing Actavis' $2.4 billion global pharmaceutical business, with operations in more than 40 countries. Siggi brings tremendous global experience to our team, and I couldn't be more pleased to have him join us. Siggi will succeed Tom Russillo, who will retire effective at the end of 2010. 
I would just like to say that Tom played an instrumental role in the integration of the Arrow assets and in identifying strategies for Watson's global growth. Before that, Tom was critical to Watson's global supply chain improvement efforts, as well as a driving force in revitalizing our U.S. Generics R&D efforts. I would like to thank them for all of his efforts and wish him all the best in his retirement.
Over the next few months, Tom and Siggi will work together to continue our globalization efforts and begin the next phase of maximizing our current commercial footprint and capitalizing on additional opportunities to expand into these markets. 
So in summary, we delivered strong financial results during the quarter, while continuing to take steps necessary to capitalize on numerous opportunities to grow our business globally. And with that, let me turn the call over to Todd for some more color on the financials. Todd?

36478,109107908,74208,"Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. For the second quarter of 2010, consolidated net revenue was $875 million, an increase of 29% over the prior-year period. Net revenue for our Global Generics division was",933,"I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. For the second quarter of 2010, consolidated net revenue was $875 million, an increase of 29% over the prior-year period. Net revenue for our Global Generics division was $571 million, up 42% on a year-over-year basis. x U.S. net revenues were $111 million. Sequentially, International net revenues were essentially flat, as unit growth was offset by lower pricing and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
U.S. Generics revenues and margins remained strong due to relatively stable pricing and higher sales of our extended release products, including Metoprolol ER and Diltiazem LA. Oral contraceptive sales were up 12% over last year to $97 million. Adjusted gross margin for the Generics division was 48.6%, up 4.9 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. The increase in adjusted gross margin reflects the continuation of recent trends, including higher sales of extended release products and favorable margins, relatively stable pricing for our U.S.-based portfolio and lower year-over-year unit manufacturing costs as a result of cost savings from our global supply chain initiative and slightly higher unit production levels. 
Moving to the Brand division, net revenue was $104 million, down 10% from the prior-year period. Product sales were $77 million, down 21% year-over-year. The decrease reflects the loss of Ferrlecit, which was partially offset by increased sales of RAPAFLO, ANDRODERM and INFeD. Brand other revenue was $27 million for the quarter, an increase of 51%, as a result of outlicensing revenue for two legacy brand products. For the full year, we expect Brand other revenue to be approximately $80 million.
Brand adjusted gross margin was 77.2%, down from 80.9% in the second quarter of last year, reflecting the loss of Ferrlecit. Brand gross margin was up over four percentage points sequentially from 73% in the first quarter, reflecting the increase in other revenue and lower sales of products supplied to third parties under contract manufacturing arrangements. 
Finally, net revenues from our Distribution segment was $201 million, up 24% or $40 million from the prior-year period due to higher third-party product launches and higher brand sales. Distribution segment adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 16.1%, up from 15.1% last year, mainly as a result of favorable product mix in the quarter.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses. Consolidated R&D for the second quarter were $61.8 million, up 45% compared to the prior-year period due to the addition of our International business and increased investment in generic and brand R&D. Generic R&D increased due to the higher investment in product development. Brand R&D increased as a result of Eden, as well as higher clinical spending, including the initiation of a Phase III study during the quarter. For the full year 2010, we expect total R&D spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $260 million to $275 million. 
SG&A for the second quarter was $157 million, an increase of $28 million over the prior-year period. The increase is mainly as a result of our International business, higher legal and personnel costs and an increase in bad debt of $5.8 million related to our distribution business. The increase in bad debt was a result of the bankruptcy filing of Chem Rx. For 2010, we expect our SG&A spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $620 million to $650 million.
Amortization for the second quarter is $43 million, up from $22 million last year, reflecting higher amortization as a result of the Arrow acquisition. For 2010, we expect amortization expense to be approximately $175 million. 
Our GAAP tax rate in the second quarter was 28%, down from 42% in the second quarter of last year. The decrease was due to certain non-recurring tax benefits associated with the Arrow acquisition. These one-time tax benefits are excluded from our adjusted cash earnings. For 2010, we now expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 34%. On an adjusted cash basis, we continue to expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 38%.
On an adjusted cash basis, which excludes amortization, earnings for the second quarter is $0.83 per share, up 14% from $0.73 per share in the prior-year quarter. Also excluded from the GAAP results for adjusted cash basis reporting were $8.8 million in acquisition- and licensing-related charges and $15.5 million in costs associated with our Global Supply Chain Initiative. Acquisition- and licensing-related charges for the quarter included preferred stock accretion of $3.8 million, a $3 million adjustment related to our terms debt and contingent liability, and integration costs of $2 million. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.57. 
Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $207 million, up 26% compared with the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $74 million. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of debt and $236 million in cash and marketable securities. We have $50 million outstanding on our revolver, leaving $450 million of undrawn capacity. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.6x, and our debt-to-capital ratio improved to 28.4% from 32.5% at year end.
We are pleased with our accomplishments this year. We're well positioned financially and have a proven track record of delevering after major acquisitions, as recognized by our ratings upgrades in the quarter by Moody's and S&P. We're well positioned to capitalize on a number of opportunities for future growth. With that, I will turn the call back over to Paul for an update of the 2010 forecast and concluding remarks.

I will now give you a little guidance on the rest of 2010. Our estimate for full year net revenue is approximately $3.5 billion. We expect our Global Generics segment revenue, including our International revenues, to be between $2.25 billion",448,"Thanks, Todd. I will now give you a little guidance on the rest of 2010. Our estimate for full year net revenue is approximately $3.5 billion. We expect our Global Generics segment revenue, including our International revenues, to be between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion. 
Turning to the assumptions for our U.S. Generics business, we now have one additional competitor in Metoprolol, which we estimate will have a modest pricing impact and a modest unit decline. We now expect no competition on generic Micro K in 2010. Our U.S. forecast does include a modest contribution from some patent challenges. However, we have not included any impact for generic Concerta or generic Lovenox. 
On the International front, we are continuing to experience many positive dynamics, including unit growth. And we, as I've said earlier, have more than 900 pending dossiers outside of the U.S. As with all the players in these markets, we have been experiencing the impact of lower pricing, greater-than-anticipated changes in government regulations and the impact of foreign currency. 
While we are very encouraged by the growth of the international operations, there are many moving pieces. And we currently expect our international revenues in the second half to be higher than the first half, weighted toward the fourth quarter. Conforming to industry practice, we have determined that there is limited value on a separate regional revenue forecast. We will, of course, continue to provide visibility on the performance of the business by reporting international net revenue on a quarterly basis.
On the Brands side of the business, we expect net revenues to be between $440 million and $460 million for the year. The assumptions now include a third quarter launch of our value brand of Ferrlecit. 
With the Anda Distribution business, we anticipate revenues between $760 million and $800 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $820 million to $850 million and adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.30 to $3.45.
In summary then, we experienced a great quarter and a great half year. We experienced more than 20% growth in revenue, adjusted cash net income and adjusted EBITDA. We continue to launch new generic products and expand our portfolio of brand products. We are making notable progress in growing our International business and expanding our global footprint. We're continuing to drive efficiencies resulting in continued strong profitability. And finally, we continue to invest in R&D patent challenges and business development. 
As you can see, we're making significant strides in every one of the initiatives we set out to accomplish in 2010, and I couldn't be more excited about the prospects for the future of Watson. So with that, let's open it up for questions. Patty?

With that, what the most of the managed care plans were doing is waiting to see whether in fact the brand company is going to chase the generic price down or whether they will just going to allow generics to come in to the marketplace and hold the brand price. That's what they did. So Flomax was essentially then moved to Tier 3. Generics occupied Tier 1 and allowed us an opportunity to occupy Tier 2 in many of these plans. Most of that negotiation had been done during the fourth and first quarter of last year and this year. We are just waiting for the event. And so when that event occur, what they've allowed to do is now finalize those activities, get those programs in place. And what you're seeing in second and third quarter and will see in third quarter is the pull-through of this related to those plans. So yes, you should expect to see some incremental growth on RAPAFLO due to some better managed care physicians. Now Gelnique is just a general slug-it-out time to get additional placement in managed care. Our placement is actually pretty good right now. We occupy between Tier 2 and a non-encumbered Tier 3. Most of the major plans, we're in a pretty good position there.

How does that factor, or does this make you at all consider backing off further business development plans or investments next year as market still -- can you just give us a little bit better sense of how some of these geographies really evolve?

I actually think this presents a great opportunity. A lot of the companies are re-evaluating their ability to operate in these markets, and that created an opportunity for Watson who is committed, and we are committed to growing our global business. And so for us, it creates a buying opportunity. And so we have been actively pursuing opportunities across multiple markets. We've not singled out any particular region or market that we want to be focused on. What we've said is we want to look at our European businesses, try to help support them by increasing their footprint and their magnitude within each of the countries. We've also said we've been looking at Asia-Pacific, the Asia-Pacific region. Since we have such a strong presence already in that region, we'd like to fill that region out. And finally, we've looked to emerging markets in South America, in Turkey and other places to also fill out. So a little bit will be driven by opportunity, when opportunities present themselves, but we have no particular country that we're focused on other than what the opportunities have presented.

As most people know, there is some possibility that Ranbaxy may not be there on day one and if they're not, then we will launch the product on the day it's certain, and we will be able to supply the entire generic need for the market. So that's our anticipation. But again, our main focus is, what I said the first point, my first discussion is I expect that we will have a competitor with Ranbaxy in November 2011.

The issue raised in the second CP, the FDA put out a guidance. Clearly, they thought about this beforehand. So once the guidance was issued, it was our position that the FDA carefully considered what they were going to do and issue the guidance. We met the guidance, so it should be denied. So we will continue to provide data to the agency as needed but that's kind of where we're at with FENTORA.

And I think people just sort of miss the point that we have something like 27, 28 different generic oral contraceptives. And it's hard to get approvals, A. And B, to get 20 or 25 to 30 approvals and have a basket of products is not something you can do overnight. Everybody knows the agency's taking 26, 28 months to get approvals done, and these are hard products, so the agency's going to take an extra look at them. So I guess, at the end of the day, we just haven't seen -- we also haven't seen the competition coming on as aggressively and as hard as that was originally anticipated. So our OC numbers are up slightly, I think, quarter-over-quarter. And I guess, we expect that trend to continue not necessarily up but to remain reasonably flat for the second half of the year. A lot of times too, it's the new launches, our new launches of products that help drive that number. And certainly, products like Next Choice have been very positive for Watson, and that also has helped offset any loss of share for the older brands or the older products that competitors have come in with. 2011 will be maybe a different story. We'll have to evaluate it at the time we give guidance for 2011. But again, I'm sort of reluctant to believe that somebody's going to get 30 approvals in a six-month period and be able to be fully competitive in that market.

France, the utilization rate still is in the 20% to 30% range. If units -- these governments are certainly well served, I understand, they're trying to control costs by cutting price but they're actually better off by driving substitution. And I think it's the bet of all the generic companies that their governments are going to realize that and drive substitution. And over time, we'll be certainly better off with substitution rates in the 70% and 80% range, will certainly make up for any product, any cost decline.

In our Global Generics business, we continue to see strong sales of new and existing products in the U.S., particularly from our extended-release product portfolio; the addition of product sales for our international markets; and of course, better-than-expected pricing in the U.S. These factors resulted in adjusted generic gross margin of over 50%.
In our Global Brands business, we acquired the Progesterone business from Columbia in July and expanded Columbia's previous promotional efforts for Crinone, a treatment for infertility by adding it to the products offered by our OB/GYN sales and marketing team. Crinone has been well received by doctors and their patients, and we expect sales of Crinone to continue to increase over the next couple of quarters as our efforts begin to yield results.
Overall, brand revenue was lower than anticipated in the third quarter due to the two factors: one, the delay of approval of our value brand of Ferrlecit; and second, an issue that affected sales of our TRELSTAR product. The majority of TRELSTAR sales are reimbursed under the least costly alternative program administered by CMS [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services], and TRELSTAR has historically been the lowest-priced alternative. Earlier this year, a U.S. federal district court struck down this program which, along with other products, disadvantaged TRELSTAR from the physician reimbursement standpoint. In short, following the decision, physicians received lower reimbursement using TRELSTAR than Lupron and Eligard. We are currently pursuing all available options to re-establish a relatively level reimbursement environment. Finally, our ANDA Distribution business had another great quarter, with our third-party sales up 35% due primarily to the launch of generic Effexor XR and continued sales of products launched in prior quarters.
We continue to make significant investments in our business to support future growth. During the quarter, we invested heavily in our R&D programs. Our Global Generic R&D spending increased 46% to $54 million, and our Global Brand R&D increased 45% to $21.7 million. We also completed an agreement with moksha8 to market a select number of Watson products in Brazil and Mexico. This is part of a long-term strategy to expand Watson's presence into these high-growth emerging markets. We will begin to launch some of these products in these markets in the first half of 2011.
We also continued to execute on our Global Supply Chain initiative. We are on track to close our New York facility by year end. The Australian R&D facility will close in the second quarter of 2011, and the Toronto facility is on track to close in early 2012. We continue to move products to and invest capital in our India and Malta facilities. Our focus on Global Supply Chain initiative will ensure that we remain competitive in a global marketplace.
We also had a number of developments since quarter end, and I would like to provide some background on these. First, our agreement with Ortho-McNeil-Janssen on Concerta. Under the agreement, we will be the exclusive authorized generic beginning May 1, 2011, for the duration of the agreement which ends in December of 2014. This agreement provides a date-certain launch of a more affordable generic Concerta product. It also allows us to continue to pursue FDA approval of our ANDA, and launch our own generic version expiry of the agreement. Additionally, the economics of this agreement are not structured as a typical authorized generic agreement. 
During the initial few quarters, the gross margins realized by Watson will be below current gross margins in our Global Generics business. However, following the initial first few quarters, the gross margin will be comparable to or modestly above current gross margins in our Global Generics business.
In our Brands business, we continue to prepare for the launch of ella, the emergency contraceptive that weed license from HRA Pharma. We anticipate the product will launch later this quarter. Columbia's Phase III clinical trial on Crinone for the prevention of pre-term birth in women with a short cervix is nearing completion, and we anticipate results will be available at the end of the year.
Also, we licensed our FSH [follicle-stimulating hormone] product from Itero Biopharmaceutics during the quarter. The collaborative work involving Itero, our Salt Lake City R&D team and Eden Biodesign has begun. They are currently in the process-transfer stage for the product.
Moving to our International business. We continue to face challenges in many of our major markets driven by the dynamics and competitive pricing issues within each market. In the U.K. and Canada, we are seeing price weakness outpace volume growth. In France, sales and profitability are in line with our expectations. We do, however, expect fourth quarter international net revenues to be higher than our third quarter. 
In summary, our performance in the quarter was strong, and we continue to execute well on our strategic goals that we had set to grow the business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd for some financial review. Todd?"
36478,114410343,85328,"Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, Paul. I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. For the third quarter of 2010, net revenues were $882 million, an increase of 33% over the prior-year period. Net revenue for our Generics division was $578",879,"Thanks, Paul. I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. For the third quarter of 2010, net revenues were $882 million, an increase of 33% over the prior-year period. Net revenue for our Generics division was $578 million, up 45% on a year-over-year basis. U.S. Generic revenues and margins remain strong due to stable pricing in the U.S., higher sales of our extended-release products including metroporol ER, potassium XR and Diltiazem LA and the launch of new products including Zarah, our generic version of YASMIN.
For the quarter, oral contraceptive sales were $101.3 million, up 9% over last year. X U.S., net revenues were $102.2 million. Sequentially, international product sales were down 11% due to seasonal factors and lower pricing in certain key markets. Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was basically flat at 50.3%, as increased sales of our higher-margin extended-release products and oral contraceptives were offset by lower margins in our International business. 
Moving to our Brand division. Net revenue was $99.7 million, down 12% from the prior-year period. Product sales were $82.4 million, down 14% year-over-year. The decrease reflect the loss of Ferrlecit and lower sales of TRELSTAR, which were partially offset by increased sales of RAPAFLO, Gelnique, ANDRODERM and the addition of Crinone. Brand other revenue was $17.3 million for the quarter, an increase of 4% as a result of higher Androgel co-promote revenue and the addition of Eden Biodesign. Brand adjusted gross margin was 80.1%, down 1.6 percentage points compared to last year due to the loss of Ferrlecit. Finally, net revenue from our ANDA Distribution business was $205.1 million, up 35% from the prior-year period due to higher third-party product launches. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 14.8%, essentially flat with the third quarter of last year.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses. Consolidated R&D for the third quarter was $75.8 million, up 46% over the prior-year period as a result of increased development spending in both our Generic and Brand businesses. Generic R&D increased as a result of the addition of our International business. Brand R&D increased primarily as a result of product development milestones for FSH, Uracyst and ella. For the full year 2010, we now expect total R&D spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million.
SG&A for the third quarter was $241.6 million, an increase of $121.5 million over the prior-year period. The current-year period includes an $89.9 million charge related to the potential settlement of certain drug pricing litigation and SG&A expenses related to our International business. For 2010, we expect our SG&A spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $700 million and $720 million.
Amortization expense for the third quarter is $45.9 million, up from $22.2 million last year as a result of the Arrow acquisition. For 2010, we expect amortization expense to be approximately $180 million. 
Our income taxes on a GAAP basis reflect an $18.7 million tax benefit associated with favorable resolution of an IRS audit. Our GAAP tax rate also reflects $4.2 million in other non-recurring tax benefits recognized during the quarter. For 2010, we now expect the GAAP-effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. On an adjusted cash basis, we continue to expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be approximately 37%.
On an adjusted cash basis, which excludes amortization expense, earnings for the third quarter was $0.85 per share, up 9% from $0.78 per share in the prior-year quarter. Also excluded from the GAAP results, for adjusted cash basis reporting purposes, were $10.6 million in acquisition and licensing related charges, $9 million in costs associated with our Global Supply Chain initiative, an $89.9 million litigation charge and $22.9 million in favorable tax benefits. 
Included in the $10.6 million of acquisition and licensing related charges are $8.2 million of GAAP interest deductions related to the revaluation of liabilities associated with the acquisition of the Arrow and the acquisition of the progesterone business from Columbia. The acquisition of progesterone business was treated as a business combination for GAAP purposes. Consequently, contingent liabilities associated with the acquisition have been valued as of the acquisition date and reflected on our balance sheet. Adjustments to the fair-market value of these contingent liabilities will be reflected in earnings on a go-forward basis.
GAAP earnings for the quarter was $0.21 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $211.1 million, up 18% compared with the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was strong at $136.5 million. 
We ended the quarter with just under $1.2 billion of debt and $266 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, we repaid $50 million on our revolver, leaving the entire $500 million undrawn at quarter end. With this debt repayment, our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio improved to 1.5x as compared to 2.1x at year end.
I'm pleased with our financial performance in the quarter and with our ability to utilize our strong cash flows to both delever and reinvest in the growth of the business. Watson is in a great position to capitalize on opportunities for future growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2010 forecast and concluding remarks."

Our estimate for full year net revenue is approximately $3.5 billion. We expect our Global Generic segment revenue, including our international revenues, to be approximately $2.3 billion.
Turning to the assumptions for our U.S. Generics business. We are assuming no new competition on metroporol or Micro K for the remainder of the year. We have, however, accounted for KVs re-entry on generic Micro K. Our U.S. forecast does not include any contribution from additional patent challenges.  On the international front, we continue to expect our international revenues in the fourth quarter to be higher than those in the third quarter.
On the Brand side of the business. We expect net revenues to be approximately $400 million for the year. And with the ANDA Distribution business, we anticipate revenue to be approximately $825 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $835 million to $850 million and adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.37 to $3.45.
In summary, with the majority of 2010 now complete, I can say that I'm extremely pleased with how the year is progressing for Watson. The business is performing well, and we've made considerable progress on every one of our objectives for the global growth of our company. I want to thank my Watson colleagues for their hard work and dedication, without which our performance today would not have been possible.

But I think the base fundamentals are still in place that attracted us to those global markets. And those base fundamentals are the continued need to increase generic utilization in many of these markets, as well as which we think we'll certainly outpace any pricing declines. Also the fact that, that Watson is, I think, well and strategically placed now with our facilities and global supply chain to be competitive in those markets on a long-term basis. So things haven't changed for us. We still want to expand our global footprint. As to the opportunities, there are obviously less and less opportunities every day. But the consolidation of the generic marketplace continues pretty aggressively. And we've been very selective at what we've been looking for. We want to find the right opportunity in the right market. We have certainly key markets that we want to continue to build like France and Germany and the U.K. and Canada, Australia as well. I mean places where we currently have a good business, but we know we can build it. And we're going to go after those in two different ways. We're going to continue to use our internal resources, our own applications, follow our own products and build the businesses. But we're also going to look for selected opportunities to grow them by acquisition. If a bigger opportunity presented itself, we would certainly look at that. But those opportunities are fewer and fewer out there. As to emerging markets, I think you saw us do the deal with moksha8 where we acquired about 20% of moksha8. That's a strategy that we'll probably follow more and more in these emerging markets that are really sort of difficult to enter. They're difficult to enter because of local environment, local players, costs of manufacturing generic drugs in those markets and a brand-to-generic strategy in many of these markets. moksha provides us a great opportunity to do in-brand and generic strategy in two very attractive markets. And we'll look for those kind of opportunities in other emerging markets around the world."

You ask me to rank them, I guess we're very aggressively looking around for generic growth opportunities globally. However, we're also looking pretty aggressively at how we expand our brand footprint outside of the U.S., focused primarily on countries where we have scale, where we have critical mass. And for example, we have a number of products filed in Canada. And so the Canadian brand opportunity is probably the next one we'll look at as a way to take advantage of those products that are filed there. And then finally on the U.S. side, on the generics piece, I mean I think we're a very, very large company here in the U.S. We're number three or four, depending on how you count it. And additional scale for us doesn't really do much for us in the marketplace. We have a great pipeline, we've got great products. So there's not a lot of incentive to do a big deal for a generic piece in the U.S. However, we do continue to look very aggressively at brand opportunities to continue to fill out our urology and women's healthcare portfolios including in the pipelines. I think they're very strong, but you can always make them stronger. And then as we prepare for even more future opportunities, we have to continue to look at biologics and continue to keep focus on the fact that five, seven, 10 years from now, biologics are going to be the drivers of growth. So all of those opportunities, we're working on all of them, and we have the balance sheet to be able to do that."

First, it is absolutely where we're looking to expand our brand footprint, which is why the moksha transaction is so valuable. moksha is principally a brand company today, with brand sales forces calling on physicians, and in some cases, pharmacies. It's our intention to put our brand portfolio into Brazil and Mexico using their sales forces. In addition, we'll be using their sales forces to sell branded generic products in those markets, and then at the same time using our own capability, which we currently have in Brazil, to sell more tender-like generic products. So if you think about it, we're coming at the whole market from sort of a two-pronged approach. We've got combined with moksha, we're using a brand strategy and branded generic strategy and then a tender strategy for our generic products that fit that kind of category. So it is an attractive market. If another opportunity in Brazil presented itself, we would certainly take a look at it. I think as you know, the acquisition prices for opportunities in those markets are a little high at the moment, and so we have to be cognizant of that. And we're pretty careful of what we look at to buy, and we want to make sure the numbers would work."

Regarding guidance, we'll give a lot more color on 2011 guidance at Analyst Day, which we expect to happen January. But I think, well, we did give you pretty specific guidance around what margins to use. I think one thing you need to remember, of course, is Concerta will also be supporting the revenues and the profitability for Concerta will also be replacing some of the product loss that we have on a year-over-year basis in our normal Generic business. Normal Generic business has the unfortunate problem of a decline every year because of new competition, price declines and the like. So it doesn't necessarily be all additive. And also, some of that we could reinvest in R&D and the like. So we think it's a good arrangement for us. We think it's a good arrangement for Ortho-McNeil, we think it's a good arrangement for consumers because we've got a product out. We know we're going to get it out, we know we're going to get a lower-cost alternative out, and we know when that's going to happen. And we don't have to wait for approvals and the vagaries of fighting through the Citizen's Petitions and everything else. So hope that helps."

We're still experiencing about 23% to 24% of growth quarter-over-quarter on prescriptions, which is good news because each quarter it's a higher volume. I think our revenue actually increased about 38% quarter-over-quarter on RAPAFLO. And this is trending in a position that we think we'll be making a meaningful product out of it in the end of 2010 and going into 2011. We also have some new data on an indication or potential new indication, that we're starting to put into the marketplace that help differentiate product from this and the other competitors. And so we're bullish on RAPAFLO and the opportunity there. Gelnique is actually functioning in a much tougher marketplace because we're seeing the marketplace declining slightly. We think that's a significant impact on the economy, because we see it in all of the products in the OAB marketplace. We're actually growing about 10% to 12% quarter-over-quarter on prescriptions or a bit higher than that on our revenue as we put it in the quarter.

36478,114410343,85502,"Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report yet another very strong quarter for Watson. Net revenue for the third quarter increased 33% to $882 million. Adjusted net income for the third quarter",900,"Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report yet another very strong quarter for Watson. Net revenue for the third quarter increased 33% to $882 million. Adjusted net income for the third quarter increased 18% to $106 million or $0.85 per share and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter increased 18% to $211 million. 
Our performance in the third quarter was driven by a number of factors. In our Global Generics business, we continue to see strong sales of new and existing products in the U.S., particularly from our extended-release product portfolio, the addition of product sales for our international markets and, of course, better-than-expected pricing in the U.S. These factors resulted in adjusted generic gross margin of over 50%.
In our Global Brands business, we acquired the Progesterone business from Columbia in July and expanded Columbia's previous promotional efforts for Crinone, a treatment for infertility, by adding it to the products offered by our OB/GYN sales and marketing team. Crinone has been well received by doctors and their patients, and we expect sales of Crinone to continue to increase over the next couple of quarters as our efforts begin to yield results.
Overall, brand revenue was lower than anticipated in the third quarter due to the two factors: one, the delay of approval of our value brand of Ferrlecit; and second, an issue that affected sales of our TRELSTAR product. The majority of TRELSTAR sales are reimbursed under the least costly alternative program administered by CMS [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services], and TRELSTAR has historically been the lowest-priced alternative. Earlier this year, a U.S. federal district court struck down this program which, along with other products, disadvantaged TRELSTAR from a physician reimbursement standpoint. In short, following the decision, physicians received lower reimbursement using TRELSTAR than Lupron and Eligard. We are currently pursuing all available options to re-establish a relatively level reimbursement environment. Finally, our ANDA Distribution business had another great quarter with our third-party sales up 35% due primarily to the launch of generic Effexor XR and continued sales of products launched in prior quarters.
We continue to make significant investments in our business to support future growth. During the quarter, we invested heavily in our R&D programs. Our Global Generic R&D spending increased 46% to $54 million, and our Global Brand R&D increased 45% to $21.7 million. We also completed an agreement with moksha8 to market a select number of Watson products in Brazil and Mexico. This is part of a long-term strategy to expand Watson's presence into these high-growth emerging markets. We will begin to launch some of these products in these markets in the first half of 2011.
We also continue to execute on our Global Supply Chain initiative. We are on track to close our Carmel, New York facility by year end. The Australian R&D facility will close in the second quarter of 2011, and the Toronto facility is on track to close in early 2012. We continue to move products to and invest capital in our India and Malta facilities. Our focus on this Global Supply Chain initiative will ensure that we remain competitive in a global marketplace.
We also had a number of developments since quarter end, and I would like to provide some background on these. First, our agreement with Ortho-McNeil-Janssen on Concerta. Under the agreement, we will be the exclusive authorized generic beginning May 1, 2011, for the duration of the agreement which ends in December of 2014. This agreement provides a date-certain launch of a more affordable generic Concerta product. It also allows us to continue to pursue FDA approval of our ANDA, and launch our own generic version expiry of the agreement. Additionally, the economics of this agreement are not structured as a typical authorized generic agreement. 
During the initial few quarters, the gross margins realized by Watson will be below current gross margins in our Global Generics business. However, following the initial first few quarters, the gross margin will be comparable to or modestly above current gross margins in our Global Generics business.
In our Brands business, we continue to prepare for the launch of ella, the emergency contraceptive we licensed from HRA Pharma. We anticipate the product will launch later this quarter. Columbia's Phase III clinical trial on Crinone for the prevention of pre-term birth in women with a short cervix is nearing completion, and we anticipate results will be available at the end of the year.
Also, we licensed our FSH [follicle-stimulating hormone] product from Itero Biopharmaceutics during the quarter. The collaborative work involving Itero, our Salt Lake City R&D team and Eden Biodesign has begun. We are currently in the process-transfer stage for the product.
Moving to our International business. We continue to face challenges in many of our major markets driven by the dynamics and competitive pricing issues within each market. In the U.K. and Canada, we are seeing price weakness outpace volume growth. In France, sales and profitability are in line with our expectations. We do, however, expect fourth quarter international net revenues to be higher than our third quarter. 
In summary, our performance in the quarter was strong, and we continue to execute well on our strategic goals that we have set to grow the business. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd for some financial review. Todd?"
36478,114410343,85502,"Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, Paul. I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. For the third quarter of 2010, net revenues were $882 million, an increase of 33% over the prior-year period. Net revenue for our Generics division was $578",878,"Thanks, Paul. I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. For the third quarter of 2010, net revenues were $882 million, an increase of 33% over the prior-year period. Net revenue for our Generics division was $578 million, up 45% on a year-over-year basis. U.S. Generic revenues and margins remain strong due to stable pricing in the U.S., higher sales of our extended-release products including metoprolol ER, potassium XR and Diltiazem LA and the launch of new products including Zarah, our generic version of YASMIN.
For the quarter, oral contraceptive sales were $101.3 million, up 9% over last year. X U.S., net revenues were $102.2 million. Sequentially, international product sales were down 11% due to seasonal factors and lower pricing in certain key markets. Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was basically flat at 50.3%, as increased sales of our higher-margin extended-release products and oral contraceptives were offset by lower margins in our International business. 
Moving to our Brand division. Net revenue was $99.7 million, down 12% from the prior-year period. Product sales were $82.4 million, down 14% year-over-year. The decrease reflects the loss of Ferrlecit and lower sales of TRELSTAR, which were partially offset by increased sales of RAPAFLO, Gelnique, ANDRODERM and the addition of Crinone. Brand other revenue was $17.3 million for the quarter, an increase of 4% as a result of higher Androgel co-promote revenue and the addition of Eden Biodesign. Brand adjusted gross margin was 80.1%, down 1.6 percentage points compared to last year due to the loss of Ferrlecit. Finally, net revenue from our ANDA Distribution business was $205.1 million, up 35% from the prior-year period due to higher third-party product launches. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 14.8%, essentially flat with the third quarter of last year.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses. Consolidated R&D for the third quarter was $75.8 million, up 46% over the prior-year period as a result of increased development spending in both our Generic and Brand businesses. Generic R&D increased as a result of the addition of our International business. Brand R&D increased primarily as a result of product development milestones for FSH, Uracyst and ella. For the full year 2010, we now expect total R&D spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million.
SG&A for the third quarter was $241.6 million, an increase of $121.5 million over the prior-year period. The current-year period includes an $89.9 million charge related to the potential settlement of certain drug pricing litigation and SG&A expenses related to our International business. For 2010, we expect our SG&A spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $700 million to $720 million.
Amortization expense for the third quarter is $45.9 million, up from $22.2 million last year as a result of the Arrow acquisition. For 2010, we expect amortization expense to be approximately $180 million. 
Our income taxes on a GAAP basis reflect an $18.7 million tax benefit associated with favorable resolution of an IRS audit. Our GAAP tax rate also reflects $4.2 million in other non-recurring tax benefits recognized during the quarter. For 2010, we now expect the GAAP-effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. On an adjusted cash basis, we continue to expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be approximately 37%.
On an adjusted cash basis, which excludes amortization expense, earnings for the third quarter was $0.85 per share, up 9% from $0.78 per share in the prior-year quarter. Also excluded from the GAAP results, for adjusted cash basis reporting purposes, were $10.6 million in acquisition and licensing related charges, $9 million in costs associated with our Global Supply Chain initiative, an $89.9 million litigation charge and $22.9 million in favorable tax benefits. 
Included in the $10.6 million of acquisition and licensing related charges are $8.2 million of GAAP interest deductions related to the revaluation of liabilities associated with the Arrow acquisition and the acquisition of the Progesterone business from Columbia. The acquisition of the Progesterone business was treated as a business combination for GAAP purposes. Consequently, contingent liabilities associated with the acquisition have been valued as of the acquisition date and reflected on our balance sheet. Adjustments to the fair-market value of these contingent liabilities will be reflected in earnings on a go-forward basis.
GAAP earnings for the quarter was $0.21 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $211.1 million, up 18% compared with the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was strong at $136.5 million. 
We ended the quarter with just under $1.2 billion of debt and $266 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, we repaid $50 million on our revolver, leaving the entire $500 million undrawn at quarter end. With this debt repayment, our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio improved to 1.5x as compared to 2.1x at year end.
I'm pleased with our financial performance in the quarter and with our ability to utilize our strong cash flows to both delever and reinvest in the growth of the business. Watson is in a great position to capitalize on opportunities for future growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2010 forecast and concluding remarks."

Our estimate for full year net revenue is approximately $3.5 billion. We expect our Global Generic segment revenue, including our international revenues, to be approximately $2.3 billion.
Turning to the assumptions for our U.S. Generics business. We are assuming no new competition on metoprolol or Micro K for the remainder of the year. We have, however, accounted for KV's re-entry on generic Micro K. Our U.S. forecast does not include any contribution from additional patent challenges.  On the international front, we continue to expect our international revenues in the fourth quarter to be higher than those in the third quarter.
On the Brand side of the business, we expect net revenues to be approximately $400 million for the year. And with the ANDA Distribution business, we anticipate revenue to be approximately $825 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $835 million to $850 million and adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.37 to $3.45.
In summary, with the majority of 2010 now complete, I can say that I'm extremely pleased with how the year is progressing for Watson. The business is performing well, and we've made considerable progress on every one of our objectives for the global growth of our company. I want to thank my Watson colleagues for their hard work and dedication, without which our performance today would not have been possible.

But I think the base fundamentals are still in place that attracted us to those global markets. And those base fundamentals are the continued need to increase generic utilization in many of these markets, as well as which we think will certainly outpace any pricing declines. Also, the fact that Watson is, I think, well and strategically placed now with our facilities and global supply chain to be competitive in those markets on a long-term basis. So things haven't changed for us. We still want to expand our global footprint. As to the opportunities, there are obviously less and less opportunities every day. But the consolidation of the generic marketplace continues pretty aggressively. And we've been very selective at what we've been looking for. We want to find the right opportunity in the right market. We have certainly key markets that we want to continue to build like France and Germany and the U.K. and Canada, Australia as well. I mean, places where we currently have a good business, but we know we can build it. And we're going to go after those in two different ways. We're going to continue to use our internal resources, our own applications, file our own products and build the businesses. But we're also going to look for selected opportunities to grow them by acquisition. If a bigger opportunity presented itself, we would certainly look at that. But those opportunities are fewer and fewer out there. As to emerging markets, I think you saw us do the deal with moksha8 where we acquired about 20% of moksha8. That's a strategy that we'll probably follow more and more in these emerging markets that are really sort of difficult to enter. They're difficult to enter because of local environment, local players, costs of manufacturing generic drugs in those markets and a brand-to-generic strategy in many of these markets. Moksha8 provides us a great opportunity to do a brand and branded generic strategy in two very attractive markets. And we'll look for those kinds of opportunities in other emerging markets around the world."

I guess we're very aggressively looking around for generic growth opportunities globally. However, we're also looking pretty aggressively at how we expand our brand footprint outside of the U.S., focused primarily on countries where we have scale, where we have critical mass. And for example, we have a number of products filed in Canada. And so the Canadian brand opportunity is probably the next one we'll look at as a way to take advantage of those products that are filed there. And then finally on the U.S. side, on the generics piece, I mean I think we're a very, very large company here in the U.S. We're number three or four, depending on how you count it. And additional scale for us doesn't really do much for us in the marketplace. We have a great pipeline. We've got great products. So there's not a lot of incentive to do a big deal for a generic piece in the U.S. However, we do continue to look very aggressively at brand opportunities to continue to fill out our urology and women's healthcare portfolios, including the pipelines. I think they're very strong, but you can always make them stronger. And then as we prepare for even more future opportunities, we have to continue to look at biologics and continue to keep focused on the fact that five, seven, 10 years from now, biologics are going to be the drivers of growth. So all of those opportunities, we're working on all of them, and we have the balance sheet to be able to do that."

It is absolutely where we're looking to expand our brand footprint, which is why the moksha transaction is so valuable. moksha is principally a brand company today, with brand sales forces calling on physicians, and in some cases, pharmacies. It's our intention to put our brand portfolio into Brazil and Mexico using their sales forces. In addition, we'll be using their sales forces to sell branded generic products in those markets, and then at the same time using our own capability, which we currently have in Brazil, to sell more tender-like generic products.

Regarding guidance, we'll give a lot more color on 2011 guidance at Analyst Day, which we expect to happen January. But I think, well, we did give you pretty specific guidance around what margins to use. I think one thing you need to remember, of course, is Concerta will also be supporting the revenues and the profitability for Concerta will also be replacing some of the product loss that we have on a year-over-year basis in our normal Generic business. Our normal Generic business has the unfortunate problem of a decline every year because of new competition, price declines and the like. So it doesn't necessarily be all additive. And also, some of that we could reinvest in R&D and the like. So we think it's a good arrangement for us. We think it's a good arrangement for Ortho-McNeil. We think it's a good arrangement for consumers because we've got a product out. We know we're going to get it out. We know we're going to get a lower-cost alternative out, and we know when that's going to happen. And we don't have to wait for approvals and the vagaries of fighting through the Citizen's Petitions and everything else. So hope that helps."

So RAPAFLO now is sitting in first position in all of the bags, as we get out of into the marketplace. So we've increased the coverage of the urologist for RAPAFLO. We're still experiencing about 23% to 24% growth quarter-over-quarter on prescriptions, which is good news because each quarter it's at a higher volume. I think our revenue actually increased about 38% quarter-over-quarter on RAPAFLO. And this is trending in a position that we think we'll be making a meaningful product out of it in the end of 2010 and going into 2011. We also have some new data on an indication or potential new indication, that we're starting to put into the marketplace that help differentiate product from this and the other competitors. And so we're bullish on RAPAFLO and the opportunity there. Gelnique is actually functioning in a much tougher marketplace because we're seeing the marketplace declining slightly. We think that's a significant impact on the economy. We actually see it in all of the products in the OAB marketplace. We're actually growing about 10% to 12% quarter-over-quarter on prescriptions, a little bit higher than that on our revenue as we reported in the quarter. And we've got that into a solid second position detail in front of all the urologists and the primary care physicians. So still looking for growth from both of those products, and I think you can anticipate a little larger growth out of RAPAFLO than Gelnique."

I think it's very clear, I've been very clear about this. Anything we can do to lower our overall corporate tax rate makes an enormous sense for us. 37% to 38% is a very big number, and it's a very big challenge for American companies to have to deal with that when our top competitors are paying half that amount. So we've got to find a way to get that down, and sometimes the way you do it is with a transformational transaction. That has to be well thought out and well understood by everyone before you do something like that. So that's the answer."

In 2011, I try to remind everybody that we have somewhere around 25, 26, 27 different products. As far as I can tell, the FDA has never granted 27 approvals to any one company in one year. So it's very unlikely that anybody's going to be able to compete with that basket of oral contraceptive products, either the Watson portfolio or the Teva portfolio.

36478,114410343,86543,"Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives"," Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report yet another very strong quarter for Watson. Net revenue for the third quarter increased 33% to $882 million. Adjusted net income for the third quarte",899," Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report yet another very strong quarter for Watson. Net revenue for the third quarter increased 33% to $882 million. Adjusted net income for the third quarter increased 18% to $106 million or $0.85 per share and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter increased 18% to $211 million.
 Our performance in the third quarter was driven by a number of factors. In our Global Generics business, we continue to see strong sales of new and existing products in the U.S., particularly from our extended-release product portfolio; the addition of product sales for our international markets; and of course, better-than-expected pricing in the U.S. These factors resulted in adjusted generic gross margin of over 50%.
 In our Global Brands business, we acquired the Progesterone business from Columbia in July and expanded Columbia's previous promotional efforts for Crinone, a treatment for infertility by adding it to the products offered by our OB/GYN sales and marketing team. Crinone has been well received by doctors and their patients, and we expect sales of Crinone to continue to increase over the next couple of quarters as our efforts begin to yield results.
 Overall, brand revenue was lower than anticipated in the third quarter due to the two factors: one, the delay of approval of our value brand of Ferrlecit; and second, an issue that affected sales of our TRELSTAR product. The majority of TRELSTAR sales are reimbursed under the least costly alternative program administered by CMS [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services], and TRELSTAR has historically been the lowest-priced alternative. Earlier this year, a U.S. federal district court struck down this program which, along with other products, disadvantaged TRELSTAR from the physician reimbursement standpoint. In short, following the decision, physicians received lower reimbursement using TRELSTAR than Lupron and Eligard. We are currently pursuing all available options to re-establish a relatively level reimbursement environment. Finally, our ANDA Distribution business had another great quarter, with our third-party sales up 35% due primarily to the launch of generic Effexor XR and continued sales of products launched in prior quarters.
 We continue to make significant investments in our business to support future growth. During the quarter, we invested heavily in our R&D programs. Our Global Generic R&D spending increased 46% to $54 million, and our Global Brand R&D increased 45% to $21.7 million. We also completed an agreement with moksha8 to market a select number of Watson products in Brazil and Mexico. This is part of a long-term strategy to expand Watson's presence into these high-growth emerging markets. We will begin to launch some of these products in these markets in the first half of 2011.
 We also continued to execute on our Global Supply Chain initiative. We are on track to close our New York facility by year end. The Australian R&D facility will close in the second quarter of 2011, and the Toronto facility is on track to close in early 2012. We continue to move products to and invest capital in our India and Malta facilities. Our focus on Global Supply Chain initiative will ensure that we remain competitive in a global marketplace.
 We also had a number of developments since quarter end, and I would like to provide some background on these. First, our agreement with Ortho-McNeil-Janssen on Concerta. Under the agreement, we will be the exclusive authorized generic beginning May 1, 2011, for the duration of the agreement which ends in December of 2014. This agreement provides a date-certain launch of a more affordable generic Concerta product. It also allows us to continue to pursue FDA approval of our ANDA, and launch our own generic version expiry of the agreement. Additionally, the economics of this agreement are not structured as a typical authorized generic agreement.
 During the initial few quarters, the gross margins realized by Watson will be below current gross margins in our Global Generics business. However, following the initial first few quarters, the gross margin will be comparable to or modestly above current gross margins in our Global Generics business.
 In our Brands business, we continue to prepare for the launch of ella, the emergency contraceptive that weed license from HRA Pharma. We anticipate the product will launch later this quarter. Columbia's Phase III clinical trial on Crinone for the prevention of pre-term birth in women with a short cervix is nearing completion, and we anticipate results will be available at the end of the year.
 Also, we licensed our FSH [follicle-stimulating hormone] product from Itero Biopharmaceutics during the quarter. The collaborative work involving Itero, our Salt Lake City R&D team and Eden Biodesign has begun. They are currently in the process-transfer stage for the product.
 Moving to our International business. We continue to face challenges in many of our major markets driven by the dynamics and competitive pricing issues within each market. In the U.K. and Canada, we are seeing price weakness outpace volume growth. In France, sales and profitability are in line with our expectations. We do, however, expect fourth quarter international net revenues to be higher than our third quarter.
 In summary, our performance in the quarter was strong, and we continue to execute well on our strategic goals that we had set to grow the business.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd for some financial review. Todd?

36478,114410343,86543,"Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives"," Thanks, Paul. I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. For the third quarter of 2010, net revenues were $882 million, an increase of 33% over the prior-year period. Net revenue for our Generics division was $578",879," Thanks, Paul. I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis. For the third quarter of 2010, net revenues were $882 million, an increase of 33% over the prior-year period. Net revenue for our Generics division was $578 million, up 45% on a year-over-year basis. U.S. Generic revenues and margins remain strong due to stable pricing in the U.S., higher sales of our extended-release products including metroporol ER, potassium XR and Diltiazem LA and the launch of new products including Zarah, our generic version of YASMIN.
 For the quarter, oral contraceptive sales were $101.3 million, up 9% over last year. X U.S., net revenues were $102.2 million. Sequentially, international product sales were down 11% due to seasonal factors and lower pricing in certain key markets. Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was basically flat at 50.3%, as increased sales of our higher-margin extended-release products and oral contraceptives were offset by lower margins in our International business.
 Moving to our Brand division. Net revenue was $99.7 million, down 12% from the prior-year period. Product sales were $82.4 million, down 14% year-over-year. The decrease reflect the loss of Ferrlecit and lower sales of TRELSTAR, which were partially offset by increased sales of RAPAFLO, Gelnique, ANDRODERM and the addition of Crinone. Brand other revenue was $17.3 million for the quarter, an increase of 4% as a result of higher Androgel co-promote revenue and the addition of Eden Biodesign. Brand adjusted gross margin was 80.1%, down 1.6 percentage points compared to last year due to the loss of Ferrlecit. Finally, net revenue from our ANDA Distribution business was $205.1 million, up 35% from the prior-year period due to higher third-party product launches. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 14.8%, essentially flat with the third quarter of last year.
 Turning now to GAAP operating expenses. Consolidated R&D for the third quarter was $75.8 million, up 46% over the prior-year period as a result of increased development spending in both our Generic and Brand businesses. Generic R&D increased as a result of the addition of our International business. Brand R&D increased primarily as a result of product development milestones for FSH, Uracyst and ella. For the full year 2010, we now expect total R&D spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million.
 SG&A for the third quarter was $241.6 million, an increase of $121.5 million over the prior-year period. The current-year period includes an $89.9 million charge related to the potential settlement of certain drug pricing litigation and SG&A expenses related to our International business. For 2010, we expect our SG&A spending on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $700 million and $720 million.
 Amortization expense for the third quarter is $45.9 million, up from $22.2 million last year as a result of the Arrow acquisition. For 2010, we expect amortization expense to be approximately $180 million.
 Our income taxes on a GAAP basis reflect an $18.7 million tax benefit associated with favorable resolution of an IRS audit. Our GAAP tax rate also reflects $4.2 million in other non-recurring tax benefits recognized during the quarter. For 2010, we now expect the GAAP-effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. On an adjusted cash basis, we continue to expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be approximately 37%.
 On an adjusted cash basis, which excludes amortization expense, earnings for the third quarter was $0.85 per share, up 9% from $0.78 per share in the prior-year quarter. Also excluded from the GAAP results, for adjusted cash basis reporting purposes, were $10.6 million in acquisition and licensing related charges, $9 million in costs associated with our Global Supply Chain initiative, an $89.9 million litigation charge and $22.9 million in favorable tax benefits.
 Included in the $10.6 million of acquisition and licensing related charges are $8.2 million of GAAP interest deductions related to the revaluation of liabilities associated with the acquisition of the Arrow and the acquisition of the progesterone business from Columbia. The acquisition of progesterone business was treated as a business combination for GAAP purposes. Consequently, contingent liabilities associated with the acquisition have been valued as of the acquisition date and reflected on our balance sheet. Adjustments to the fair-market value of these contingent liabilities will be reflected in earnings on a go-forward basis.
 GAAP earnings for the quarter was $0.21 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $211.1 million, up 18% compared with the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was strong at $136.5 million.
 We ended the quarter with just under $1.2 billion of debt and $266 million in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, we repaid $50 million on our revolver, leaving the entire $500 million undrawn at quarter end. With this debt repayment, our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio improved to 1.5x as compared to 2.1x at year end.
 I'm pleased with our financial performance in the quarter and with our ability to utilize our strong cash flows to both delever and reinvest in the growth of the business. Watson is in a great position to capitalize on opportunities for future growth.
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2010 forecast and concluding remarks.

Our estimate for full year net revenue is approximately $3.5 billion. We expect our Global Generic segment revenue, including our international revenues, to be approximately $2.3 billion.
 Turning to the assumptions for our U.S. Generics business. We are assuming no new competition on metroporol or Micro K for the remainder of the year. We have, however, accounted for KVs re-entry on generic Micro K. Our U.S. forecast does not include any contribution from additional patent challenges.  On the international front, we continue to expect our international revenues in the fourth quarter to be higher than those in the third quarter.
 On the Brand side of the business. We expect net revenues to be approximately $400 million for the year. And with the ANDA Distribution business, we anticipate revenue to be approximately $825 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $835 million to $850 million and adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.37 to $3.45.
 In summary, with the majority of 2010 now complete, I can say that I'm extremely pleased with how the year is progressing for Watson. The business is performing well, and we've made considerable progress on every one of our objectives for the global growth of our company. I want to thank my Watson colleagues for their hard work and dedication, without which our performance today would not have been possible.

But I think the base fundamentals are still in place that attracted us to those global markets. And those base fundamentals are the continued need to increase generic utilization in many of these markets, as well as which we think we'll certainly outpace any pricing declines. Also the fact that, that Watson is, I think, well and strategically placed now with our facilities and global supply chain to be competitive in those markets on a long-term basis. So things haven't changed for us. We still want to expand our global footprint. As to the opportunities, there are obviously less and less opportunities every day. But the consolidation of the generic marketplace continues pretty aggressively. And we've been very selective at what we've been looking for. We want to find the right opportunity in the right market. We have certainly key markets that we want to continue to build like France and Germany and the U.K. and Canada, Australia as well. I mean places where we currently have a good business, but we know we can build it. And we're going to go after those in two different ways. We're going to continue to use our internal resources, our own applications, follow our own products and build the businesses. But we're also going to look for selected opportunities to grow them by acquisition. If a bigger opportunity presented itself, we would certainly look at that. But those opportunities are fewer and fewer out there. As to emerging markets, I think you saw us do the deal with moksha8 where we acquired about 20% of moksha8. That's a strategy that we'll probably follow more and more in these emerging markets that are really sort of difficult to enter. They're difficult to enter because of local environment, local players, costs of manufacturing generic drugs in those markets and a brand-to-generic strategy in many of these markets. moksha provides us a great opportunity to do in-brand and generic strategy in two very attractive markets. And we'll look for those kind of opportunities in other emerging markets around the world.

You ask me to rank them, I guess we're very aggressively looking around for generic growth opportunities globally. However, we're also looking pretty aggressively at how we expand our brand footprint outside of the U.S., focused primarily on countries where we have scale, where we have critical mass. And for example, we have a number of products filed in Canada. And so the Canadian brand opportunity is probably the next one we'll look at as a way to take advantage of those products that are filed there. And then finally on the U.S. side, on the generics piece, I mean I think we're a very, very large company here in the U.S. We're number three or four, depending on how you count it. And additional scale for us doesn't really do much for us in the marketplace. We have a great pipeline, we've got great products. So there's not a lot of incentive to do a big deal for a generic piece in the U.S. However, we do continue to look very aggressively at brand opportunities to continue to fill out our urology and women's healthcare portfolios including in the pipelines. I think they're very strong, but you can always make them stronger. And then as we prepare for even more future opportunities, we have to continue to look at biologics and continue to keep focus on the fact that five, seven, 10 years from now, biologics are going to be the drivers of growth. So all of those opportunities, we're working on all of them, and we have the balance sheet to be able to do that.

I think it was, in retrospect, it was a very solid acquisition for us. It gave us many, many of the things we needed. I think Elliot called it a beachhead, and I think that's probably what it did. It gave us a global footprint that we can build off of. And from that perspective, we really couldn't be happier. We did face some headwinds and challenges in international markets, just like everyone else has done, but that's to be expected.

First, it is absolutely where we're looking to expand our brand footprint, which is why the moksha transaction is so valuable. moksha is principally a brand company today, with brand sales forces calling on physicians, and in some cases, pharmacies. It's our intention to put our brand portfolio into Brazil and Mexico using their sales forces. In addition, we'll be using their sales forces to sell branded generic products in those markets, and then at the same time using our own capability, which we currently have in Brazil, to sell more tender-like generic products. So if you think about it, we're coming at the whole market from sort of a two-pronged approach. We've got combined with moksha, we're using a brand strategy and branded generic strategy and then a tender strategy for our generic products that fit that kind of category. So it is an attractive market. If another opportunity in Brazil presented itself, we would certainly take a look at it. I think as you know, the acquisition prices for opportunities in those markets are a little high at the moment, and so we have to be cognizant of that. And we're pretty careful of what we look at to buy, and we want to make sure the numbers would work.

We know we're going to get it out, we know we're going to get a lower-cost alternative out, and we know when that's going to happen.

So Gelnique and RAPAFLO continue to grow. We've shifted some emphasis to RAPAFLO versus Gelnique. So RAPAFLO now is sitting in first position in all of the bags, as we get out of into the marketplace. So we've increased the coverage of the urologist for RAPAFLO. We're still experiencing about 23% to 24% of growth quarter-over-quarter on prescriptions, which is good news because each quarter it's a higher volume. I think our revenue actually increased about 38% quarter-over-quarter on RAPAFLO. And this is trending in a position that we think we'll be making a meaningful product out of it in the end of 2010 and going into 2011. We also have some new data on an indication or potential new indication, that we're starting to put into the marketplace that help differentiate product from this and the other competitors. And so we're bullish on RAPAFLO and the opportunity there. Gelnique is actually functioning in a much tougher marketplace because we're seeing the marketplace declining slightly. We think that's a significant impact on the economy, because we see it in all of the products in the OAB marketplace. We're actually growing about 10% to 12% quarter-over-quarter on prescriptions or a bit higher than that on our revenue as we put it in the quarter. And we've got that into a solid second position detail from the bulk of urologists and the primary care physicians. So still looking for growth for both of those products. I think you can anticipate a little larger growth out of RAPAFLO than Gelnique.

Paul, did you say that the gross margins on Concerta are going to be close to your generic margins, which are around 50%? Am I misunderstanding something? Because when we spoke earlier this week or when we were trying to kind of run an analysis, we were thinking better than the typical authorized generic margins, and we were modeling 25% to 50%. But this looks like maybe like you're talking more like 45% to 55%. Is that the correct way of interpreting what you're saying?

And frankly, we just have never really seen that. For the remainder of the year, we see no major disruption in our Oral Contraceptive business because of additional competition. In 2011, I try to remind everybody that we have somewhere around 25, 26, 27 different products. As far as I can tell, the FDA has never granted 27 approvals to any one company in one year. So it's very unlikely that anybody's going to be able to compete with that basket of oral contraceptive products, either the Watson portfolio or the tablet portfolio. So anybody who enters this marketplace will be disruptive to that particular product. But overall, our business, well I think, will remain strong into 2011. I would expect it to also be a contributor, maybe not as major of a contributor in 2012.
