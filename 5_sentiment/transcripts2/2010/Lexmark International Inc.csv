Our fourth quarter financial results were significantly better than anticipated, reflecting strong sequential improvement in customer demand for both our hardware and supplies. For the quarter, both divisions exceeded expectations. And geographically, all regions improved sequentially in revenue and profit. During the quarter, we also continued to improve the fundamentals of the business through the implementation of our restructuring and expense reduction efforts, totaling over $200 million in expense savings in 2009 and through a strong sequential increase in our cash flow. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,073,000,000, up 12% sequentially and down just 1% year-to-year, a significant improvement from the year-to-year performance in the first three quarters of 2009.Hardware revenue in the fourth quarter 2009 was up 17%, sequentially and better than expected. Hardware revenue was about flat year-to-year, which is also a significant improvement from the year-to-year improvement in the first three quarters of 2009.  Supplies revenue in the fourth quarter was up 11% sequentially and was better than expected, as both laser and inkjet supplies exceeded expectations. Supplies revenue declined just 1% year-to-year, again, a significant improvement from the year-to-year performance in the first three quarters of 2009. Now this 1% year-to-year supplies decline reflects year-to-year growth in laser supplies, slightly offset by an ongoing, but improved decline in inkjet supplies. Overall, supplies channel inventory was up slightly sequentially, but the increase was much less than what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2008.Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.76. Excluding restructuring-related charges, earnings per share on the quarter were $1.16, a 55% increase year-to-year. In the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $257 million, a 74% increase sequentially from the third quarter of 2009 and almost 5x the fourth quarter 2008 result.Now let's talk about our two divisions. In our Printing Solutions and Services Division or PSSD, fourth quarter 2009 revenue was $748 million, up 14% sequentially and up 4% year-to-year, with the year-to-year growth in both the PSSD hardware and supplies revenue. PSSD operating income excluding restructuring, was $164 million, up 68% sequentially and up 77% year-to-year. Our PSSD laser units for the quarter were up sequentially, along with a strong sequential increase in hardware revenue. Year-to-year laser units were down 16%, but laser hardware revenue was up 6% year-to-year due to an improved mix of product. Now despite the year-to-year laser unit decline in the fourth quarter, we continue to have good year-to-year growth in our color laser units and strong year-to-year growth in our laser MFPs with both categories benefiting from our new product and reductions over the last 15 months. For the second straight quarter, our laser hardware sales have been supply constrained, primarily due to the unexpected demand level, company shortages and increased lead times.Now during the quarter, we had strong growth in our Enterprise Management Services business and continue to close new enterprise deals and help our customers such as Rexall, Rodial [ph] and Kingfisher in Europe to lower their cost and improve their document-based processes. According to IDC data for the first three quarters of 2009, we have continued to gain market share in our branded workgroup laser sales. And according to our internal analysis for 2009, Lexmark continued to be number one in the U.S. printer market in laser product awards received with more than 3x the awards of any other vendor.Let's talk about our Imaging Solutions division or ISD. In the fourth quarter, ISD revenue was $325 million up 7% sequentially and down 11% year-to-year, an improvement in year-to-year hardware and supplies revenue performance from the third quarter of 2009. ISD operating income, excluding restructuring, was $38 million, up 12% sequentially and up 25% year-to-year. ISD units for the quarter were down 34% year-to-year, but with good sequential growth in ISD hardware revenue. Now despite our overall year-to-year inkjet unit decline in the fourth quarter, we continued to improve our high-end mix and continue to have strong year-to-year growth in the retail sell out of our Professional Series products, helped by the expansion of our shelf space in U.S. office superstores in 2009.  According to IDC data for the first three quarters of 2009, we gained a market share in our branded inkjet sales in the above $100 segment in the U.S. and Europe. And according to our internal assessment for 2009, Lexmark inkjet products received 28% of the U.S. industry inkjet awards. This is a significant increase from 2008, making us number two in inkjet product awards received for 2009 and is a strong recognition of the evolution and improvement in our inkjet products over the last two years as we have shifted our focus to serving SMB customers.Now looking back on 2009, despite a 14% year-to-year revenue decline, we believe that Lexmark has performed better than the overall output market. For the year, our operating income excluding restructuring-related charges was down only 3%, reflecting a positive impact of our cumulative, restructuring and other expense actions totaling over $200 million of expense reduction in 2009. In addition, we are encouraged by the improved customer demand we saw during the second half of 2009, and the ongoing improvements that we're driving in the fundamentals of our business. Including the significant refresh and upgrades in our laser and inkjet product line over the last 15 months, the share gain in our key focus segments of workgroup laser and business inkjet, the strong sequential improvements over the last three quarters in our cash generation. And despite our expense reductions, we continue to invest significantly in our corporate technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. Now as we look into the first quarter of 2010, we expect revenue to be up slightly year-to-year. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Earnings per share, excluding restructuring-related charges are expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.90. Now while it could be a long recovery for the overall printer market to return to its full prior levels, we do believe that we are making Lexmark into a leaner and stronger competitor, improving our product, solutions and services offerings and our competitive position. We also continue to maintain a strong financial position with a solid balance sheet and with over $1.1 billion in cash and current marketable securities. I'll now turn it over to John Gamble for his more detailed comments on our financials."

Next, I'll indicate our full-year results. I'll then discuss selected changes on the balance sheet and certain items of cash flow. Finally, I'll finish with more detail regarding our guidance for the first quarter of 2010. I will call out the impact of restructuring-related expense as we walk through the P&L. In the supplemental slide deck posted on our Investor Relations website, we have included details on the income statement line items impacted by the restructuring-related activities. Now let me begin with the P&L.Total revenue for the quarter was $1.07 billion, up 12% sequentially and down slightly compared to last year. The currency impact on Lexmark revenue in 4Q '09 versus 3Q '09 was positive approximately 2% and the currency impact on Lexmark revenue for 4Q '09 versus 4Q '08 was positive approximately 6%. Our revenue exceeded the expectations we discussed at the October earnings call, driven by stronger-than-expected supplies and hardware revenue.Full year 2009 revenue was $3.9 billion, down 14% compared to 2008. The currency impact on Lexmark revenue in 2009 versus 2008 was negative approximately 3%. Geographically for the fourth quarter, revenue grew sequentially versus 3Q '09 in all geographic regions. U.S. revenue of $444 million declined slightly year-to-year. Europe revenue of $408 million declined about 5% year-to-year. The revenue for the remaining geographies increased 9% versus a year ago. Geographically, for the full year of 2009, revenue in the U.S. was $1.672 billion and declined approximately 10%. Europe revenue of $1.454 billion declined about 17% and the remaining geographies declined about 18%. During the quarter, we saw strengthening performance in all regions.In 2009, Dell represented about 12% of revenue. In 2008, Dell represented 13% of revenue. In both 2008 and 2009, Dell was the only customer that represented over 10% of revenue. Supplies revenue declined 1% versus 4Q '08, approximately 11 percentage points better than the year-on-year decline in 3Q '09. In 4Q '09, PSSD supplies revenue was up versus 4Q '08 with this growth more than offset by declines in ISD supplies. The sequential improvement in year-on-year performance was due to significant improvements in channel sell out revenue, primarily in PSSD. In 4Q '09, we saw channel inventory increased slightly, but much less than the increase we saw in 4Q '08. Excluding these channel inventory effects, we would have seen supplies growth in 4Q '09. Sequentially, supplies revenue grew 11% with growth in both PSSD and ISD. For the full year, supplies revenue declined 12%.Hardware revenue was up 17% sequentially from 3Q '09 and about flat from the same quarter in 2008. Sequentially, the hardware revenue improvement was driven by growth in both PSSD and ISD hardware revenue. Year-to-year, the hardware revenue growth in lasers was mostly offset by the decline in inkjet revenue. For the full year, hardware revenue declined 22% year-to-year, driven by declines in both divisions. PSSD revenues for the quarter was $748 million, an increase of 14% from 3Q '09 and a 4% increase year-to-year. The improvement versus 4Q '08 was in both supplies and hardware revenue. Full year 2009 PSSD revenue of $2.6 billion declined 12% compared to 2008. The reduction was due to the 19% reduction in hardware revenue, as well as the decline in supplies revenue. PSSD hardware revenue improved 18% sequentially and 6% versus 4Q '08. The sequential improvement was driven by positive mix toward workgroup devices and MFPs and higher unit volume.  The year-on-year improvement was driven by positive price mix as sales shifted toward color lasers and MFPs. PSSD laser hardware units increased 8% sequentially, but declined 16% versus the prior year. The sequential increase was driven by good growth in workgroup devices and MFPs. The year-on-year decline was driven by a reduction in low-end mono laser placements. During 4Q '09, component shortages limited our ability to fulfill demand. And as such, we focused available capacity on workgroup and color devices and MFPs. In 4Q '09, we saw year-on-year growth in both MFPs and color devices. On a full-year basis, PSSD hardware revenue declined 19% and units 21% versus 2008. PSSD laser hardware average unit revenue was up 27% year-to-year in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by positive product mix shift toward workgroup devices and MFPs. Full year 2009 PSSD laser AUR was up 4% compared to 2008.ISD revenue for the quarter was $325 million, up 7% sequentially and down 11% from the same quarter in 2008. The sequential improvement was driven by growth in both supplies and hardware revenue. The year-on-year decline of 11% was an improvement from the 3Q '09 year-to-year decline of 18%. Full year ISD revenue declined 19% versus 2008. ISD hardware revenue was up sequentially 14% and down 14% versus 4Q '08. The sequential increase was driven by a favorable product mix toward higher-end devices. The year-on-year decline was driven primarily by lower unit volume and negative net price FX, partially offset by a significant improvement in mix toward higher-end devices. Full-year ISD hardware revenue declined 28% versus 2008, as lower unit volume and negative net price FX were again partially offset by improved mix. ISD hardware units were relatively flat sequentially and declined 34% year-to-year in the fourth quarter. ISD hardware shipments of 4.2 million for full year 2009, declined 36% year-to-year. ISD hardware AUR in the quarter was up 30% versus the prior year, reflecting the shift in mix toward higher-end products, as we launched our new inkjet product line. Full year 2009 ISD hardware AUR was up 13% compared to 2008.Gross profit margin for 4Q was 35.7%. Excluding restructuring-related charges of approximately $13 million, gross profit margin would have been 36.9%, up 650 basis points versus the prior year and up 300 basis points sequentially. The 650 basis point fourth quarter increase versus last year was principally due to a 590 basis point increase in product margins, in both hardware and supplies. Sequentially, the 300 basis point improvement was principally due to a 380 basis point increase in product margin, again in both hardware and supplies. This was partially offset by a negative product mix, driven by a higher relative percentage of hardware versus supplies. Gross profit margin for the year was 33.8%. Excluding restructuring-related charges of approximately $51 million, gross profit margin for 2009 would have been 35.1%, up 30 basis points from 2008. The 30 basis point increase was due to 240 basis points of favorable product mix, reflecting a lower relative percentage of hardware versus supplies. This was partially offset by 210 basis points reduction in product margins driven by hardware.Operating expense for the quarter was $293 million, with restructuring-related expense of approximately $32 million. Excluding this impact, operating expense was $261 million, a reduction of $22 million versus 4Q '08. R&D was $93 million and SG&A was $167 million in 4Q '09, a reduction of $12 million and $10 million versus 4Q '08, respectively. Sequentially, operating expense, excluding restructuring-related expenses increased by $11 million versus 3Q '09. SG&A was up $9 million sequentially and R&D approximately $2 million. The increase was principally due to higher bonus accruals reflecting the improved performance in 4Q '09 and negative currency impact.For the full year of 2009, operating expense was $1.094 billion, with restructuring-related expenses of $90 million. Excluding this impact, operating expense was $1.004 billion, down $203 million or 17% from 2008. SG&A declined about $155 million and R&D decreased approximately $48 million. The operating expense to revenue ratio, excluding restructuring-related expenses, was 24.3% in 4Q and 25.9% for the year. Operating income in 4Q was $90 million, excluding total restructuring and related cost and expenses, operating income was $136 million, up $89 million from 4Q '08 and up $61 million sequentially from 3Q '09. The increase in 4Q operating income versus both 4Q '08 and 3Q '09 was primarily in the PSSD business segment, which I will discuss more fully in a moment. Full year 2009 operating income was $216 million. Excluding total restructuring and related cost and expenses of approximately $141 million, operating income was $357 million, down $13 million compared to 2008. Excluding restructuring-related activities, PSSD operating income in 4Q '09 of $164 million increased $71 million versus last year and increased $67 million sequentially. PSSD 4Q '09 improvement in operating income versus 4Q '08 reflects higher gross margins in hardware and supplies, as well as lower operating expenses. Hardware and supplies margin improvements were driven by both improved net price FX and cost improvements from our restructuring and other actions. Sequentially, the operating income increase was primarily due to the higher supplies gross margins, reflecting increased supplies revenue and related cost improvements. Hardware margins also improved, primarily reflecting improved hardware mix. Full year 2009 PSSD operating income of $444 million declined $78 million compared to 2008. The decline in full-year 2009 PSSD operating income was primarily driven by the weak demand for supplies in the first three quarters of 2009 and the impact of currency on both hardware and supplies over the same period. Partially offsetting these impacts were cost and expense reductions from our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives. Again, excluding restructuring-related expenses, ISD operating income in 4Q '09 of $58 million was up $8 million versus last year and up $4 million sequentially. Full year 2009 ISD operating income of $159 million was down $6 million compared to 2008. The 4Q '09 year-to-year increase was driven by lower hardware volume, as well as significant cost and expense reductions across the business, partially offset by lower supplies revenue. The 4Q '09 sequential increase in ISD operating income was driven by higher supplies revenue and cost reductions and improved hardware mix. The slight decrease in full year 2009 ISD operating income reflects the negative impact of lower supplies volume and the negative impact of aggressive hardware pricing and net currency impacts, partially offset by lower hardware volume and expense reductions.Other segment, consisting primarily of costs related to centralized supply chain, IT and other operating expenses, primarily G&A were $67 million in 4Q '09, excluding restructuring-related activities, a $10 million reduction from 4Q '08 and a $10 million increase from 3Q '09. The reduction versus 4Q '08 is a continuation of the impact of our cost and expense reduction efforts. The increase versus 3Q '09 primarily reflects the higher bonus accruals, reflecting the improved performance in 4Q '09 and the negative currency impact that I referenced earlier.Operating income margin in 4Q was 8.4%. Excluding the restructuring-related expenses, operating income margin was 12.6%, an increase of 830 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2008 and an increase of 480 basis points, sequentially. Full year 2009 operating income margin was 5.6%. Excluding restructuring-related expenses, 2009 operating income margin was 9.2%, up 100 basis points versus 2008.  Concerning financing and non-operating costs in the fourth quarter of '09, the net interest and other was an expense of $8 million, up from an expense of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily driven by lower interest income. Sequentially, net interest and other was down $3 million. Full-year 2009 interest and other was an expense of $29.1 million compared to expense of $1.3 million in 2008, due primarily to lower interest income and the interest on our $650 million debt issued in 2Q '08. Our effective tax rate for 2009 was 22%. This was higher than the 18% we had estimated in October and the 17% ongoing tax rate we incurred in 2008 principally reflecting two factors. The percent of 2009 earnings and high tax jurisdictions like the U.S. increased versus our expectation in 2008. Also, as our earnings before tax increased significantly versus our expectations, the impact on the tax rate of fixed dollar tax credits like the R&E tax credit is lower, increasing our tax rate versus our expectation. In 4Q '09, the tax rate was 27.3% as we had to accrue at a higher rate in 4Q '09 to bring the full year tax rate to 22%.Net earnings for the quarter were $60 million. Excluding the $32 million after-tax cost from restructuring-related activities, net earnings in 4Q '09 were $92 million. 4Q '08 net earnings were $80 million or $60 million, excluding after-tax restructuring-related expenses. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.76. Excluding the restructuring-related activities, EPS would've been $1.16 per share. This compares to 4Q '08 GAAP earnings per share of $0.23 or $0.75, excluding restructuring-related activities. GAAP earnings per share for the full year were $1.86. Excluding restructuring-related activities, EPS would have been $3.26 per share. This compares to full-year 2008 GAAP earnings per share of $2.69 or $3.55, excluding restructuring-related activities. 4Q '09 revenue and net income performance was significantly stronger than the guidance we provided in October. In terms of revenue, sequential supplies growth of 11%, reflecting improved end-user demand drove the significant majority of the improvement versus our guidance. PSSD hardware revenue, up 18% sequentially, also outperformed. In terms of operating income performance, the primary factor was increased supplies revenue. Improved product gross margins, reflecting both improved net price FX and cost performance, were also contributing factors.Now moving to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Cash flow from operations for 4Q '09 was extremely strong at $257 million, reflecting our stronger earnings and good working capital performance. In 4Q '09, earnings and working capital performance all improved versus 3Q '09. Since the end of September, accounts receivable decreased $20 million, inventory increased $14 million, accounts payable increased $29 million and accrued liabilities increased $45 million. In the quarter, restructuring-related cash outflows were $60 million, pension contributions were $4 million and fourth quarter capital spending was $45 million. Depreciation in the quarter was $56 million and includes $11 million of restructuring-related accelerated depreciation. Free cash flow in the quarter was $214 million. Cash flow from operations for 2009 was $402 million, down $80 million compared to 2008. Despite being down from 2008, we believe 2009 cash flow performance was strong as it included unusual payments of over $100 million, including a large pension contribution of $92 million and settlement of copyright claims in Germany for a payment of $40 million. In 2009, we also continued to improve our working capital performance as receivables and inventory days continued to improve and payables days remained strong. Since December 31, 2008, accounts receivable decreased $2 million, inventory decreased $81 million, accounts payable decreased $47 million and accrued liabilities decreased $30 million. In 2009, restructuring-related cash outflows were $59 million. 2009 capital spending was $242 million. Depreciation in the year was $214 million and includes $42 million of restructuring-related accelerated depreciation. Free cash flow for 2009 was $162 million. Cash and marketable securities at the end of 4Q '09 was $1.13 billion, up $224 million since September. Total long-term debt at the end of 4Q '09 was $650 million, with maturities on the debt in 2013 and 2018. At quarter end, we have $491 million of share repurchased authority outstanding. No shares were repurchased in 4Q09.Now let me move to restructuring. For the restructuring plans announced in January, April and October 2009, we continue to expect the overall program parameters to be approximately the same as discussed last quarter. In 4Q '09, total pretax restructuring and related cost and expenses were $46 million. In 4Q '09, restructuring cash outflow was $16 million and savings from our 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions were $39 million. In 1Q '10, restructuring and related cost and expenses due to the restructuring actions were expected to be approximately $17 million. Savings in 1Q '10 from the 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructurings, are expected to be about $55 million. More details regarding the restructuring plans we have announced is available on the supplemental slide deck.Now for my forward-looking comments concerning 1Q '10. We expect first quarter revenue to be up slightly year-over-year. Supplies revenue is expected to be about flat versus 1Q '09 with growth in PSSD, offset by declines in ISD. We expect modest revenue growth in the PSSD business segment year-on-year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.64 to $0.74 in 1Q '10. GAAP EPS includes expected restructuring charges of $0.16 per share. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding restructuring and related cost and expenses, is expected to be $0.80 to $0.90. GAAP EPS in the first quarter of 2009 were $0.75 per share, which includes restructuring charges of $0.14 per share. Non-GAAP EPS in 1Q '09 were $0.89 per share. All of the comparisons that follow exclude the impact of restructuring. In the first quarter, we expect gross profit margin percentage to be down versus the 36.9% we achieved in 4Q '09. Operating expense is expected to be down compared to the $261 million incurred in 4Q '09. Operating income margin in the first quarter is expected to be below the 12.6% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 1Q '10, we expect our effective tax rate to be 24% before any discreet items. This reflects the fact that the R&E tax credit has expired as of January 1, 2010, and has not yet been extended. For the full year of 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be 22%, assuming that the R&E tax credit will be re-established in 2010. The guidance provided for 1Q '10 is based on foreign exchange rates as of 12/31/09. Based on these rates, the foreign exchange impact to revenue in 1Q '10 versus 1Q '09 would be approximately positive 6% and versus 4Q '09 would be approximately negative 1%. Given the volatile economic situation we've seen over the last five quarters, we thought that we'll provide some commentary around the assumptions we are making for 2010. These thoughts reflect our current perspective only and may not be updated as we move forward. While we have seen modest improvement in the overall market in 4Q '09, we also believe that the economic downturn may not yet be over. Lexmark is executing 2010 assuming the overall output market revenue will be down slightly year-to-year, and setting the appropriate associated cost and expense actions. In 2010, we expect our PSSD revenue to grow in line with our faster than the broader laser market due to our strong product line and strong solutions and services initiatives. We expect our ISD revenue to grow less than the broader inkjet market, as we concentrate on the sale of higher-end devices and continue to reduce the sales of low-end inkjet units. While our operating income margin has been somewhat volatile over the last two years, we've operated at about 8% in 2008 and 9% in 2009. We expect 2010 operating margin to be about the same as 2009, with upside pressure driven by the numerous restructuring actions we've taken and favorable divisional revenue mix, but countered downward by increasing hardware-versus-supplies revenue mix and the continuing aggressive pricing environment. In terms of specific line items in the income statement and cash flow statements. In 2010, we expect operating expense will decline 3% to 5% from 2009 levels, reflecting the benefit of our restructuring initiatives. Combined net interest income and expense, net and other income and expense will be consistent with 2009. The remaining restructuring and related charges to be incurred on our already announced programs is approximately $65 million, of which accelerated depreciation is approximately $21 million. Full-year capital spending will be approximately equal to depreciation, excluding accelerated depreciation at $185 million. Pension funding in 2010 will be approximately $20 million, of which about $7 million will be in 1Q '10. We expect working capital performance to be stable to slightly improving, as measured in days versus the levels achieved in 2009. The comments around 2010 are based on foreign exchange rates as of 12/31/09. We will now open the floor for your questions."

We've won a lot of awards. We continue to see awards rolling in. What's very interesting to us is that we track very closely customer satisfaction, doing surveys with customers after the first 30 days. Customer satisfaction on the new products is up significantly from prior generations and is very encouraging. Now relative to sales, sales are still ramping. So it's really early to make comments on that, but certainly, we saw sales ramp through the fourth quarter. In terms of usage, again, I think, it's a little early. From what we've seen so far, usage is certainly up from the prior generations significantly as we would have expected. But I'd say it's still a little bit too early for us to draw a conclusion on exactly where that's going to settle out, as people are currently just using products that they bought and we do not really see a lot of reorder just yet."

And the origin of those really is a couple of factors. One is in the second half, you may recall, we significantly exceeded expectations in the third quarter as well as now in the fourth quarter. Demand has been increasing for us and we think this is a reflection of certainly some modest improvement in the market, but also primarily a reflection of the strong product line that we have announced over the last 15 months in lasers, particularly in color and laser MFPs. So we've been having trouble catching the demand because every month our demand [ph] has been increasing. The other thing that's happened here though is that the overall technology industry has picked up over the second half. So broader than just printers and there's constraints in the industry on components. There's been increases in lead times pretty significantly up to almost 20 weeks on some key components. And so that's been an issue for us. Obviously, we've been chasing demand. We're very focused on trying to catch that up and make sure that we're setting our expectations appropriately as we go forward in time. But clearly, it's going to be sometime in the first half of 2010 before we get to where we'd like to be. Again, some of that depends on how demand moves as we go through the first half."

And the reason that we did it, and you're right, we haven't done much",912,"A couple of things, Ben. First, in terms of guidance. We really haven't given guidance. What we try to do is give you some set of assumptions around what we're thinking in our business. And the reason that we did it, and you're right, we haven't done much of this in the past. The reason we did it is really the last five quarters had been very volatile with the economic situation and what's been going on in the market. And we just thought that the way the market had dropped and the way that we now have, in the second half, have done simply better than expectations. They might be helpful to the investors to just get some sense of the assumptions set that we're looking at for 2010. As always, we give guidance only one quarter ahead, and that can be challenging from time to time, to be able to do that. And so we just try to give assumptions looking out into 2010. The first key assumption is really around the market. And I call this an assumption, because we don't know what the market's going to be like in 2010, and nobody knows what it's going to be like. We set an assumption in terms of market revenue, that it will be down slightly year-to-year, and the reason we think that is a couple. One is that if we results on the fourth quarter are continuing to come in, and as we look across the competitors who have already announced, we see revenue ranging from up slightly to down 11%. And if you look across all that, it probably averages in the high single-digit decline. As we look at 2010, we would expect the market to improve from that. Some of that just in terms of lapping easier year-to-year compares. But we're not sure how much that will improve. So we kind of say well, it's in high single digits, probably in the fourth quarter. We're thinking 2010, well, let's say slightly down year-to-year, and that's kind of where we're coming from. We're also looking to be a little conservative in our assumptions set relative to market because I would tell you that we would prefer to prepare for the worst case relative to expense and cost, and we're very focused even in a down market, having a good year. That's what we're trying to do. If the market turns out to be better than that, then possibly we'll have a great year, but that's our focus. Now as we take a look at our revenue -- I think we tried to just make sure people understand, how we're seeing our revenue certainly in the fourth quarter and I think it will include 2010 as well, that on the laser side, we see ourselves as the market modestly improves with the strength we have and that we've gained with our product set and our solutions and services, we see ourselves performing certainly at least with the market but we will, I think, potentially outperforming the market. On the inkjet side, as we transition to focus on the high end, we see ourselves performing under the market because we're going to continue to move away from some of the low-end devices that we've been selling through 2009. So we've kind of given that guidance, there's upward pressure, there's downward pressure on that, and we've given a market statement. But we haven't given revenue range for 2010. On the margin side, what we've indicated is we look at 2009, we did about 9% in terms of operating margin. Again, upward and downward pressures on that. And as to how that will balance, it's always difficult to call, but we tried to give you some indications, what are the things that are pushing us upward or the things that are pushing us down. In terms of pushing us up, clearly we've done a significant amount of restructuring and the cumulative impact of that restructuring is very significant. And I'm not sure, people always appreciate that the magnitude of what we've done and you certainly can see it in the fourth quarter results. So we've got more savings clearly coming in 2010. That's pushing us up. Second thing is, to the extent that we expect to do better in PSSD than ISD. Say PSSD above market, ISD below market, that's going to be a favorable divisional mix, which we would think would help our operating margin. Countering that, we see a couple things. First, to the extent that we're very focused on hardware. We see an increasing hardware-versus-supplies mix, that's going to be a negative from a margin perspective. And then the other thing is, I think from a pricing perspective, and I'm not saying an unusual overpricing, but I'm saying that pricing on our market has always been somewhat aggressive. And so we've put some of that into the expectation there as well. So these are kind of the factors that are going on. Obviously, in terms of your math, if the revenue is flat and the margin's flat, then yes, the earnings per share will probably come out at the same point. But again, we haven't tried to project exactly where the revenue will be, but rather give you the assumptions sets underneath what we think is going to happen in 2010, and we'll certainly see how it unfolds as we go through the year, very dependent on the market."

So clearly, we're seeing some business customers, we're seeing an increase in our business customers. We're also seeing high-usage individuals as well. So our focus is to continue to push more towards the business customers and certainly get a high-usage individual, we're okay with that, too, as long as it's a heavy-usage type of thing. So that's kind of where we expected to go. I think relative to, are we seeing converts or not, I would say it's always hard to comment on some of the specific transactions. Do they consider laser, did they buy this versus laser? I think it's clear to say, that if you look in the market, business inkjet grew in 2009, laser declined in 2009. If you look at low-end laser, color and mono laser, that declined in 2009. And for us, as we indicated, we continue to have strong year-to-year sellout in our Professional Series. So it's clear to us that business inkjet, which is targeted in general, certainly over $200, in many cases over $300, is doing much better in the market right now than low-end laser, which is selling $200 to $500. So our expectation as we've talked in the past is that inkjet is an increasingly important technology in the business market. We do think it's going to compete with laser, certainly sub $500, even sub $1,000. And we think it's an important technology for us to have, as we focus on our business customers, going forward."

What we saw in the quarter, Toni, is that the supplies margins were up sequentially, up year-to-year. Primarily, what we saw there was a couple things. The volume increase that we saw which was unexpected for us helped us on cost because we put a lot more velocity through the burden that we have in the supply chain. Second thing, we saw was, say beyond just the cost. Also, from a, I'll call it a price FX standpoint, we did see some health there. Pricing is a combination of things. But we've taken price actions as you know over the last 12 months and some of that certainly is coming through on a year-to-year basis. But the other thing is that as the currency has moved around the world, we're also perhaps are riding a little higher than what we normally would in terms of harmonization of currency around the world. So I think that also was a little bit of help to us in the quarter. And the other point you made is we've done a lot of restructuring relative to supplies. At long term, we do believe that's going to help us. But certainly as we look between 3Q and 4Q, that was not a significant difference factor. I don't think just between the quarters.

Always on the older products as well as the more recent products. But certainly the more recent products we certainly saw some healthy reordering relative to that. In terms of -- and you're asking a very good question -- in terms of whether what you see out there is pantry restocking versus actual consumption of toner and ink, this is a difficult thing. And as we look back on 2009, we clearly think that there was more of the bleed off of pantry stock than was obvious as we went through the years, be it either in the second tier of supply-channel distribution or in enterprise or in homes, in terms of people just keeping supplies around. And that could be a factor that played in here. We also though do think, because we can see some of this in our large enterprise accounts where we have management services, we do see some usage starting to come up. So clearly, in terms of pre-economic crisis levels, we're not back to that. But we do see some positive trends there and certainly that increased usage, I think, perhaps in addition to some of the pantry stocking and replenishing in some of the second tier had been factors here in the third and fourth quarter, as we've seen over expectation, relative to supplies revenue. But again, we do think that there is some modest improvement in the market going on here as well. So we're hopeful with that as we look forward."

Better-than-expected customer demand resulted in strong sequential growth for Lexmark, exceeding our expectations for both revenue and profit in the quarter. Both divisions exceeded expectations and geographically, all regions improved sequentially in revenue and profit. Overall, revenue was down just 1% year-to-year, a significant improvement from the year-to-year performance in the first three quarters of 2009. Our year-to-year performance in ISD improved in the fourth quarter and our Laser business returned to year-to-year growth with growth in both laser, hardware and laser supplies in the quarter. Overall, looking back at 2009, we are encouraged by the improved customer demand for our products during the second half of 2009 and the ongoing improvements that we are driving into the fundamentals of our business, including the significant refresh and upgrades in our laser and inkjet product line in the last 15 months, the share gain in our key-focus segments of Workgroup Laser [ph] and Business Inkjet, the ongoing cost and expense reductions totaling over $200 million of expense reductions in 2009, the strong sequential improvement over the last three quarters in our cash generation. And despite our expense reductions, we continued to invest significantly in our corporate technology and product development and they're driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. While it could be a long recovery for the overall printer market to return to its prior levels, we do believe that we are making Lexmark into a leaner and stronger competitor, improving our product, solutions and services offerings and our competitive position.

Our fourth quarter financial results were significantly better than anticipated, reflecting strong sequential improvement in customer demand for both our hardware and supplies. For the quarter, both divisions exceeded expectations. And geographically, all regions improved sequentially in revenue and profit. During the quarter, we also continued to improve the fundamentals of the business through the implementation of our restructuring and expense reduction efforts, totaling over $200 million in expense savings in 2009 and through a strong sequential increase in our cash flow. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,073,000,000, up 12% sequentially and down just 1% year-to-year, a significant improvement from the year-to-year performance in the first three quarters of 2009.Hardware revenue in the fourth quarter 2009 was up 17%, sequentially and better than expected. Hardware revenue was about flat year-to-year, which is also a significant improvement from the year-to-year performance in the first three quarters of 2009.  Supplies revenue in the fourth quarter was up 11% sequentially and was better than expected, as both laser and inkjet supplies exceeded expectations. Supplies revenue declined just 1% year-to-year, again, a significant improvement from the year-to-year performance in the first three quarters of 2009. Now this 1% year-to-year supplies decline reflects year-to-year growth in laser supplies, slightly offset by an ongoing, but improved decline in inkjet supplies. Overall, supplies channel inventory was up slightly sequentially, but the increase was much less than what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2008.Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.76. Excluding restructuring-related charges, earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $1.16, a 55% increase year-to-year. In the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $257 million, a 74% increase sequentially from the third quarter of 2009 and almost 5x the fourth quarter 2008 result.Now let's talk about our two divisions. In our Printing Solutions and Services Division or PSSD, fourth quarter 2009 revenue was $748 million, up 14% sequentially and up 4% year-to-year, with the year-to-year growth in both the PSSD hardware and supplies revenue. PSSD operating income, excluding restructuring, was $164 million up 68% sequentially and up 77% year-to-year. Our PSSD laser units for the quarter were up sequentially, along with a strong sequential increase in hardware revenue. Year-to-year laser units were down 16%, but laser hardware revenue was up 6% year-to-year due to an improved mix of product. Now despite the year-to-year laser unit decline in the fourth quarter, we continue to have good year-to-year growth in our color laser units and strong year-to-year growth in our laser MFPs with both categories benefiting from our new product introductions over the last 15 months. For the second straight quarter, our laser hardware sales have been supply constrained, primarily due to the unexpected demand level, company shortages and increased lead times.Now during the quarter, we had strong growth in our Enterprise Management Services business and continue to close new enterprise deals and help our customers such as Rexel, Rodial [ph] and Kingfisher in Europe to lower their cost and improve their document-based processes. According to IDC data for the first three quarters of 2009, we have continued to gain market share in our branded workgroup laser sales. And according to our internal analysis for 2009, Lexmark continued to be number one in the U.S. printer market in laser product awards received with more than 3x the awards of any other vendor.Let's talk about our Imaging Solutions division or ISD. In the fourth quarter, ISD revenue was $325 million up 7% sequentially and down 11% year-to-year, an improvement in year-to-year hardware and supplies revenue performance from the third quarter of 2009. ISD operating income, excluding restructuring, was $38 million, up 12% sequentially and up 25% year-to-year. ISD units for the quarter were down 34% year-to-year, but with good sequential growth in ISD hardware revenue. Now despite our overall year-to-year inkjet unit decline in the fourth quarter, we continued to improve our high-end mix and continue to have strong year-to-year growth in the retail sell out of our Professional Series products, helped by the expansion of our shelf space in U.S. office superstores in 2009.  According to IDC data for the first three quarters of 2009, we gained a market share in our branded inkjet sales in the above $100 segment in the U.S. and Europe. And according to our internal assessment for 2009, Lexmark inkjet products received 28% of the U.S. industry inkjet awards. This is a significant increase from 2008, making us number two in inkjet product awards received for 2009 and is a strong recognition of the evolution and improvement in our inkjet products over the last two years as we have shifted our focus to serving SMB customers.Now looking back on 2009, despite a 14% year-to-year revenue decline, we believe that Lexmark has performed better than the overall output market. For the year, our operating income, excluding restructuring-related charges, was down only 3%, reflecting a positive impact of our cumulative, restructuring and other expense actions totaling over $200 million of expense reduction in 2009. In addition, we are encouraged by the improved customer demand we saw during the second half of 2009 and the ongoing improvements that we're driving in the fundamentals of our business, including the significant refresh and upgrades in our laser and inkjet product line over the last 15 months, the share gain in our key focus segments of workgroup laser and business inkjet, the strong sequential improvements over the last three quarters in our cash generation. And despite our expense reductions, we continue to invest significantly in our corporate technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. Now as we look into the first quarter of 2010, we expect revenue to be up slightly year-to-year. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Earnings per share, excluding restructuring-related charges are expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.90. Now while it could be a long recovery for the overall printer market to return to its prior levels, we do believe that we are making Lexmark into a leaner and stronger competitor, improving our product, solutions and services offerings and our competitive position. We also continue to maintain a strong financial position with a solid balance sheet and with over $1.1 billion in cash and current marketable securities. I'll now turn it over to John Gamble for his more detailed comments on our financials."

Next, I'll indicate our full-year results. I'll then discuss selected changes on the balance sheet and certain items of cash flow. Finally, I'll finish with more detail regarding our guidance for the first quarter of 2010. I will call out the impact of restructuring-related expense as we walk through the P&L. In the supplemental slide deck posted on our Investor Relations website, we have included details on the income statement line items impacted by the restructuring-related activities. Now let me begin with the P&L.Total revenue for the quarter was $1.07 billion, up 12% sequentially and down slightly compared to last year. The currency impact on Lexmark revenue in 4Q '09 versus 3Q '09 was positive approximately 2% and the currency impact on Lexmark revenue for 4Q '09 versus 4Q '08 was positive approximately 6%. Our revenue exceeded the expectations we discussed at the October earnings call, driven by stronger-than-expected supplies and hardware revenue.Full year 2009 revenue was $3.9 billion, down 14% compared to 2008. The currency impact on Lexmark revenue in 2009 versus 2008 was negative approximately 3%. Geographically, for the fourth quarter, revenue grew sequentially versus 3Q '09 in all geographic regions. U.S. revenue of $444 million declined slightly year-to-year. Europe revenue of $408 million declined about 5% year-to-year. The revenue for the remaining geographies increased 9% versus a year ago. Geographically, for the full year of 2009, revenue in the U.S. was $1.672 billion and declined approximately 10%. Europe revenue of $1.454 billion declined about 17% and the remaining geographies declined about 18%. During the quarter, we saw strengthening performance in all regions.In 2009, Dell represented about 12% of revenue. In 2008, Dell represented 13% of revenue. In both 2008 and 2009, Dell was the only customer that represented over 10% of revenue. Supplies revenue declined 1% versus 4Q '08, approximately 11 percentage points better than the year-on-year decline in 3Q '09. In 4Q '09, PSSD supplies revenue was up versus 4Q '08 with this growth more than offset by declines in ISD supplies. The sequential improvement in year-on-year performance was due to significant improvements in channel sell out revenue, primarily in PSSD. In 4Q '09, we saw channel inventory increased slightly, but much less than the increase we saw in 4Q '08. Excluding these channel inventory effects, we would have seen supplies growth in 4Q '09. Sequentially, supplies revenue grew 11% with growth in both PSSD and ISD. For the full year, supplies revenue declined 12%.Hardware revenue was up 17% sequentially from 3Q '09 and about flat from the same quarter in 2008. Sequentially, the hardware revenue improvement was driven by growth in both PSSD and ISD hardware revenue. Year-to-year, the hardware revenue growth in lasers was mostly offset by the decline in inkjet revenue. For the full year, hardware revenue declined 22% year-to-year, driven by declines in both divisions. PSSD revenues for the quarter was $748 million, an increase of 14% from 3Q '09 and a 4% increase year-to-year. The improvement versus 4Q '08 was in both supplies and hardware revenue. Full year 2009 PSSD revenue of $2.6 billion declined 12% compared to 2008. The reduction was due to the 19% reduction in hardware revenue, as well as the decline in supplies revenue. PSSD hardware revenue improved 18% sequentially and 6% versus 4Q '08. The sequential improvement was driven by positive mix toward workgroup devices and MFPs and higher unit volume.  The year-on-year improvement was driven by positive price mix as sales shifted toward color lasers and MFPs. PSSD laser hardware units increased 8% sequentially, but declined 16% versus the prior year. The sequential increase was driven by good growth in workgroup devices and MFPs. The year-on-year decline was driven by a reduction in low-end mono laser placements. During 4Q '09, component shortages limited our ability to fulfill demand. And as such, we focused available capacity on workgroup and color devices and MFPs. In 4Q '09, we saw year-on-year growth in both MFPs and color devices. On a full-year basis, PSSD hardware revenue declined 19% and units 21% versus 2008. PSSD laser hardware average unit revenue was up 27% year-to-year in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by positive product mix shift toward workgroup devices and MFPs. Full year 2009 PSSD laser AUR was up 4% compared to 2008.ISD revenue for the quarter was $325 million, up 7% sequentially and down 11% from the same quarter in 2008. The sequential improvement was driven by growth in both supplies and hardware revenue. The year-on-year decline of 11% was an improvement from the 3Q '09 year-to-year decline of 18%. Full year ISD revenue declined 19% versus 2008. ISD hardware revenue was up sequentially 14% and down 14% versus 4Q '08. The sequential increase was driven by a favorable product mix toward higher-end devices. The year-on-year decline was driven primarily by lower unit volume and negative net price FX, partially offset by a significant improvement in mix toward higher-end devices. Full-year ISD hardware revenue declined 28% versus 2008, as lower unit volume and negative net price FX were again partially offset by improved mix. ISD hardware units were relatively flat sequentially and declined 34% year-to-year in the fourth quarter. ISD hardware shipments of 4.2 million for full year 2009, declined 36% year-to-year. ISD hardware AUR in the quarter was up 30% versus the prior year, reflecting the shift in mix toward higher-end products, as we launched our new inkjet product line. Full year 2009 ISD hardware AUR was up 13% compared to 2008.Gross profit margin for 4Q was 35.7%. Excluding restructuring-related charges of approximately $13 million, gross profit margin would have been 36.9%, up 650 basis points versus the prior year and up 300 basis points sequentially. The 650 basis point fourth quarter increase versus last year was principally due to a 590 basis point increase in product margins, in both hardware and supplies. Sequentially, the 300 basis point improvement was principally due to a 380 basis point increase in product margin, again in both hardware and supplies. This was partially offset by a negative product mix, driven by a higher relative percentage of hardware versus supplies. Gross profit margin for the year was 33.8%. Excluding restructuring-related charges of approximately $51 million, gross profit margin for 2009 would have been 35.1%, up 30 basis points from 2008. The 30 basis point increase was due to 240 basis points of favorable product mix, reflecting a lower relative percentage of hardware versus supplies. This was partially offset by 210 basis points reduction in product margins driven by hardware.Operating expense for the quarter was $293 million, with restructuring-related expense of approximately $32 million. Excluding this impact, operating expense was $261 million, a reduction of $22 million versus 4Q '08. R&D was $93 million and SG&A was $167 million in 4Q '09, a reduction of $12 million and $10 million versus 4Q '08, respectively. Sequentially, operating expense, excluding restructuring-related expenses increased by $11 million versus 3Q '09. SG&A was up $9 million sequentially and R&D approximately $2 million. The increase was principally due to higher bonus accruals reflecting the improved performance in 4Q '09 and negative currency impact.For the full year of 2009, operating expense was $1.094 billion, with restructuring-related expenses of $90 million. Excluding this impact, operating expense was $1.004 billion, down $203 million or 17% from 2008. SG&A declined about $155 million and R&D decreased approximately $48 million. The operating expense to revenue ratio, excluding restructuring-related expenses, was 24.3% in 4Q and 25.9% for the year. Operating income in 4Q was $90 million, excluding total restructuring and related cost and expenses, operating income was $136 million, up $89 million from 4Q '08 and up $61 million sequentially from 3Q '09. The increase in 4Q operating income versus both 4Q '08 and 3Q '09 was primarily in the PSSD business segment, which I will discuss more fully in a moment. Full year 2009 operating income was $216 million. Excluding total restructuring and related cost and expenses of approximately $141 million, operating income was $357 million, down $13 million compared to 2008. Excluding restructuring-related activities, PSSD operating income in 4Q '09 of $164 million increased $71 million versus last year and increased $67 million sequentially. PSSD 4Q '09 improvement in operating income versus 4Q '08 reflects higher gross margins in hardware and supplies, as well as lower operating expenses. Hardware and supplies margin improvements were driven by both improved net price FX and cost improvements from our restructuring and other actions. Sequentially, the operating income increase was primarily due to the higher supplies gross margins, reflecting increased supplies revenue and related cost improvements. Hardware margins also improved, primarily reflecting improved hardware mix. Full year 2009 PSSD operating income of $444 million declined $78 million compared to 2008. The decline in full-year 2009 PSSD operating income was primarily driven by the weak demand for supplies in the first three quarters of 2009 and the impact of currency on both hardware and supplies over the same period. Partially offsetting these impacts were cost and expense reductions from our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives. Again, excluding restructuring-related expenses, ISD operating income in 4Q '09 of $58 million was up $8 million versus last year and up $4 million sequentially. Full year 2009 ISD operating income of $159 million was down $6 million compared to 2008. The 4Q '09 year-to-year increase was driven by lower hardware volume, as well as significant cost and expense reductions across the business, partially offset by lower supplies revenue. The 4Q '09 sequential increase in ISD operating income was driven by higher supplies revenue and cost reductions and improved hardware mix. The slight decrease in full year 2009 ISD operating income reflects the negative impact of lower supplies volume and the negative impact of aggressive hardware pricing and net currency impacts, partially offset by lower hardware volume and expense reductions.Other segment, consisting primarily of costs related to centralized supply chain, IT and other operating expenses, primarily G&A were $67 million in 4Q '09, excluding restructuring-related activities, a $10 million reduction from 4Q '08 and a $10 million increase from 3Q '09. The reduction versus 4Q '08 is a continuation of the impact of our cost and expense reduction efforts. The increase versus 3Q '09 primarily reflects the higher bonus accruals, reflecting the improved performance in 4Q '09 and the negative currency impact that I referenced earlier.Operating income margin in 4Q was 8.4%. Excluding the restructuring-related expenses, operating income margin was 12.6%, an increase of 830 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2008 and an increase of 480 basis points, sequentially. Full year 2009 operating income margin was 5.6%. Excluding restructuring-related expenses, 2009 operating income margin was 9.2%, up 100 basis points versus 2008.  Concerning financing and non-operating costs in the fourth quarter of '09, the net interest and other was an expense of $8 million, up from an expense of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily driven by lower interest income. Sequentially, net interest and other was down $3 million. Full-year 2009 interest and other was an expense of $29.1 million compared to expense of $1.3 million in 2008, due primarily to lower interest income and the interest on our $650 million debt issued in 2Q '08. Our effective tax rate for 2009 was 22%. This was higher than the 18% we had estimated in October and the 17% ongoing tax rate we incurred in 2008 principally reflecting two factors. The percent of 2009 earnings and high tax jurisdictions like the U.S. increased versus our expectation in 2008. Also, as our earnings before tax increased significantly versus our expectations, the impact on the tax rate of fixed dollar tax credits like the R&E tax credit is lower, increasing our tax rate versus our expectation. In 4Q '09, the tax rate was 27.3% as we had to accrue at a higher rate in 4Q '09 to bring the full year tax rate to 22%.Net earnings for the quarter were $60 million. Excluding the $32 million after-tax cost from restructuring-related activities, net earnings in 4Q '09 were $92 million. 4Q '08 net earnings were $80 million or $60 million, excluding after-tax restructuring-related expenses. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.76. Excluding the restructuring-related activities, EPS would've been $1.16 per share. This compares to 4Q '08 GAAP earnings per share of $0.23 or $0.75, excluding restructuring-related activities. GAAP earnings per share for the full year were $1.86. Excluding restructuring-related activities, EPS would have been $3.26 per share. This compares to full-year 2008 GAAP earnings per share of $2.69 or $3.55, excluding restructuring-related activities. 4Q '09 revenue and net income performance was significantly stronger than the guidance we provided in October. In terms of revenue, sequential supplies growth of 11%, reflecting improved end-user demand drove the significant majority of the improvement versus our guidance. PSSD hardware revenue, up 18% sequentially, also outperformed. In terms of operating income performance, the primary factor was increased supplies revenue. Improved product gross margins, reflecting both improved net price FX and cost performance, were also contributing factors.Now moving to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Cash flow from operations for 4Q '09 was extremely strong at $257 million, reflecting our stronger earnings and good working capital performance. In 4Q '09, earnings and working capital performance all improved versus 3Q '09. Since the end of September, accounts receivable decreased $20 million, inventory increased $14 million, accounts payable increased $29 million and accrued liabilities increased $45 million. In the quarter, restructuring-related cash outflows were $60 million, pension contributions were $4 million and fourth quarter capital spending was $45 million. Depreciation in the quarter was $56 million and includes $11 million of restructuring-related accelerated depreciation. Free cash flow in the quarter was $214 million. Cash flow from operations for 2009 was $402 million, down $80 million compared to 2008. Despite being down from 2008, we believe 2009 cash flow performance was strong as it included unusual payments of over $100 million, including a large pension contribution of $92 million and settlement of copyright claims in Germany for a payment of $40 million. In 2009, we also continued to improve our working capital performance as receivables and inventory days continued to improve and payables days remained strong. Since December 31, 2008, accounts receivable decreased $2 million, inventory decreased $81 million, accounts payable decreased $47 million and accrued liabilities decreased $30 million. In 2009, restructuring-related cash outflows were $59 million. 2009 capital spending was $242 million. Depreciation in the year was $214 million and includes $42 million of restructuring-related accelerated depreciation. Free cash flow for 2009 was $162 million. Cash and marketable securities at the end of 4Q '09 was $1.13 billion, up $224 million since September. Total long-term debt at the end of 4Q '09 was $650 million, with maturities on the debt in 2013 and 2018. At quarter end, we have $491 million of share repurchased authority outstanding. No shares were repurchased in 4Q09.Now let me move to restructuring. For the restructuring plans announced in January, April and October 2009, we continue to expect the overall program parameters to be approximately the same as discussed last quarter. In 4Q '09, total pretax restructuring and related cost and expenses were $46 million. In 4Q '09, restructuring cash outflow was $16 million and savings from our 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions were $39 million. In 1Q '10, restructuring and related cost and expenses due to the restructuring actions were expected to be approximately $17 million. Savings in 1Q '10 from the 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructurings, are expected to be about $55 million. More details regarding the restructuring plans we have announced is available on the supplemental slide deck.Now for my forward-looking comments concerning 1Q '10. We expect first quarter revenue to be up slightly year-over-year. Supplies revenue is expected to be about flat versus 1Q '09 with growth in PSSD, offset by declines in ISD. We expect modest revenue growth in the PSSD business segment year-on-year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.64 to $0.74 in 1Q '10. GAAP EPS includes expected restructuring charges of $0.16 per share. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding restructuring and related cost and expenses, is expected to be $0.80 to $0.90. GAAP EPS in the first quarter of 2009 were $0.75 per share, which includes restructuring charges of $0.14 per share. Non-GAAP EPS in 1Q '09 were $0.89 per share. All of the comparisons that follow exclude the impact of restructuring. In the first quarter, we expect gross profit margin percentage to be down versus the 36.9% we achieved in 4Q '09. Operating expense is expected to be down compared to the $261 million incurred in 4Q '09. Operating income margin in the first quarter is expected to be below the 12.6% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 1Q '10, we expect our effective tax rate to be 24% before any discreet items. This reflects the fact that the R&E tax credit has expired as of January 1, 2010, and has not yet been extended. For the full year of 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be 22%, assuming that the R&E tax credit will be re-established in 2010. The guidance provided for 1Q '10 is based on foreign exchange rates as of 12/31/09. Based on these rates, the foreign exchange impact to revenue in 1Q '10 versus 1Q '09 would be approximately positive 6% and versus 4Q '09 would be approximately negative 1%. Given the volatile economic situation we've seen over the last five quarters, we thought that we'll provide some commentary around the assumptions we are making for 2010. These thoughts reflect our current perspective only and may not be updated as we move forward. While we have seen modest improvement in the overall market in 4Q '09, we also believe that the economic downturn may not yet be over. Lexmark is executing 2010 assuming the overall output market revenue will be down slightly year-to-year, and setting the appropriate associated cost and expense actions. In 2010, we expect our PSSD revenue to grow in line with our faster than the broader laser market due to our strong product line and strong solutions and services initiatives. We expect our ISD revenue to grow less than the broader inkjet market, as we concentrate on the sale of higher-end devices and continue to reduce the sales of low-end inkjet units. While our operating income margin has been somewhat volatile over the last two years, we've operated at about 8% in 2008 and 9% in 2009. We expect 2010 operating margin to be about the same as 2009, with upside pressure driven by the numerous restructuring actions we've taken and favorable divisional revenue mix, but countered downward by increasing hardware-versus-supplies revenue mix and the continuing aggressive pricing environment. In terms of specific line items in the income statement and cash flow statements. In 2010, we expect operating expense will decline 3% to 5% from 2009 levels, reflecting the benefit of our restructuring initiatives. Combined net interest income and expense, net and other income and expense will be consistent with 2009. The remaining restructuring and related charges to be incurred on our already announced programs is approximately $65 million, of which accelerated depreciation is approximately $21 million. Full-year capital spending will be approximately equal to depreciation, excluding accelerated depreciation at $185 million. Pension funding in 2010 will be approximately $20 million, of which about $7 million will be in 1Q '10. We expect working capital performance to be stable to slightly improving, as measured in days versus the levels achieved in 2009. The comments around 2010 are based on foreign exchange rates as of 12/31/09. We will now open the floor for your questions."

We've won a lot of awards. We continue to see awards rolling in. What's very interesting to us is that we track very closely customer satisfaction, doing surveys with customers after the first 30 days. Customer satisfaction on the new products is up significantly from prior generations and is very encouraging. Now relative to sales, sales are still ramping. So it's really early to make comments on that, but certainly, we saw sales ramp through the fourth quarter. In terms of usage, again, I think it's a little early. From what we've seen so far, usage is certainly up from the prior generations, significantly, as we would have expected. But I'd say it's still a little bit too early for us to draw a conclusion on exactly where that's going to settle out, as people are currently just using products that they bought and we do not really see a lot of reorder just yet."

And the origin of those really is a couple of factors. One is in the second half, you may recall, we significantly exceeded expectations in the third quarter as well as now in the fourth quarter. Demand has been increasing for us and we think this is a reflection of certainly some modest improvement in the market, but also primarily a reflection of the strong product line that we have announced over the last 15 months in lasers, particularly in color and laser MFPs. So we've been having trouble catching the demand because every month our view on it has been increasing. The other thing that's happened here though is that the overall technology industry has picked up over the second half. So broader than just printers and there's constraints in the industry on components. There's been increases in lead times pretty significantly up to almost 20 weeks on some key components, and so that's been an issue for us. Obviously, we've been chasing demand. We're very focused on trying to catch that up and make sure that we're setting our expectations appropriately as we go forward in time. But clearly, it's going to be some time in the first half of 2010 before we get to where we'd like to be. Again, some of that depends on how demand moves as we go through the first half."

What we try to do is give you some set of assumptions around what we're thinking in our business. And the reason that we did it, and you're right, we haven't done much of this in the past. The reason we did it is really the last five quarters had been very volatile with the economic situation and what's been going on in the market. And we just thought that the way the market had dropped and the way that we now have, in the second half, have done simply better than expectations. They might be helpful to the investors to just get some sense of the assumptions set that we're looking at for 2010. As always, we give guidance only one quarter ahead, and that can be challenging from time to time, to be able to do that. And so we just try to give assumptions looking out into 2010. The first key assumption is really around the market. And I call this an assumption because we don't know what the market's going to be like in 2010, and nobody knows what it's going to be like. We set an assumption in terms of market revenue, that it will be down slightly year-to-year, and the reason we think that is a couple. One is that if we -- results on the fourth quarter are continuing to come in, and as we look across the competitors who have already announced, we see revenue ranging from up slightly to down 11%. And if you look across all that, it probably averages in the high single-digit decline. As we look at 2010, we would expect the market to improve from that. Some of that just in terms of lapping easier year-to-year compares. But we're not sure how much that will improve. So we kind of say well, it's in high single digits, probably in the fourth quarter. We're thinking 2010, well, let's say slightly down year-to-year, and that's kind of where we're coming from. We're also looking to be a little conservative in our assumptions set relative to market because I would tell you that we would prefer to prepare for the worst case relative to expense and cost, and we're very focused on, even in a down market, having a good year. That's what we're trying to do. If the market turns out to be better than that, then possibly we'll have a great year, but that's our focus. Now as we take a look at our revenue, I think we tried to just make sure people understand, how we're seeing our revenue certainly in the fourth quarter and I think it will include 2010 as well, that on the laser side, we see ourselves as the market modestly improves with the strength we have and that we've gained with our product set and our solutions and services, we see ourselves performing certainly at least with the market but we will, I think, potentially outperforming the market. On the inkjet side, as we transition to focus on the high end, we see ourselves performing under the market because we're going to continue to move away from some of the low-end devices that we've been selling through 2009. So we've kind of given that guidance. There's upward pressure, there's downward pressure on that, and we've given a market statement. But we haven't given revenue range for 2010. On the margin side, what we've indicated is we look at 2009. We did about 9% in terms of operating margin. Again, upwards and downward pressures on that. And as to how that will balance, it's always difficult to call, but we tried to give you some indications, what are the things that are pushing us upward or the things that are pushing us down. In terms of pushing us up, clearly we've done a significant amount of restructuring and the cumulative impact of that restructuring is very significant. And I'm not sure, people always appreciate that the magnitude of what we've done and you certainly can see it in the fourth quarter results. So we've got more savings clearly coming in 2010. That's pushing us up. Second thing is, to the extent that we expect to do better in PSSD than ISD. Say PSSD above market, ISD below market, that's going to be a favorable divisional mix, which we would think would help our operating margin. Countering that, we see a couple things. First, to the extent that we're very focused on hardware. We see an increasing hardware-versus-supplies mix, that's going to be a negative from a margin perspective. And then the other thing is, I think from a pricing perspective, and I'm not saying an unusual level of pricing, but I'm saying that pricing on our market has always been somewhat aggressive. And so we've put some of that into the expectation there as well. So these are kind of the factors that are going on. Obviously, in terms of your math, if the revenue is flat and the margin's flat, then yes, the earnings per share will probably come out at the same point. But again, we haven't tried to project exactly where the revenue will be, but rather give you the assumptions sets underneath what we think is going to happen in 2010, and we'll certainly see how it unfolds as we go through the year, very dependent on the market."

So clearly, we're seeing some business customers, we're seeing an increase in our business customers. We're also seeing high-usage individuals as well. So our focus is to continue to push more towards the business customers and to the extent we get a high-usage individual, we're okay with that, too, as long as it's a heavy-usage type of thing. So that's kind of where we expected to go. I think relative to are we seeing converts or not, I would say it's always hard to comment on some of the specific transactions. Do they consider laser? Did they buy this versus laser? I think it's clear to say that if you look in the market, business inkjet grew in 2009, laser declined in 2009. If you look at low-end laser, color and mono laser, that declined in 2009. And for us, as we indicated, we continue to have strong year-to-year sellout in our Professional Series. So it's clear to us that business inkjet, which is targeted in general, certainly over $200, in many cases over $300, is doing much better in the market right now than low-end laser, which is selling $200 to $500. So our expectation as we've talked in the past is that inkjet is an increasingly important technology in the business market. We do think it's going to compete with laser, certainly sub $500, possibly even sub $1,000. And we think it's an important technology for us to have, as we focus on our business customers going forward."

What we saw in the quarter, Toni, is that the supplies margins were up sequentially, up year-to-year. Primarily, what we saw there was a couple things. The volume increase that we saw which was unexpected for us helped us on cost because we put a lot more velocity through the burden that we have in the supply chain. Second thing, we saw was, say beyond just the cost. Also, from a, I'll call it a price FX standpoint, we did see some health there. Pricing is a combination of things. But we've taken price actions as you know over the last 12 months and some of that certainly is coming through on a year-to-year basis. But the other thing is that as the currency has moved around the world, we're also perhaps are riding a little higher than what we normally would in terms of harmonization of currency around the world. So I think that also was a little bit of help to us in the quarter. And the other point you made is we've done a lot of restructuring relative to supplies. At long term, we do believe that's going to help us. But certainly as we look between 3Q and 4Q, that was not a significant difference factor. I don't think just between the quarters.

Always on the older products as well as the more recent products. But certainly the more recent products we certainly saw some healthy reordering relative to that. In terms of -- and you're asking a very good question -- in terms of whether what you see out there is pantry restocking versus actual consumption of toner and ink, this is a difficult thing. And as we look back on 2009, we clearly think that there was more of the bleed off of pantry stock than was obvious as we went through the years, be it either in the second tier of supply-channel distribution or in enterprise or in homes, in terms of people just keeping supplies around. And that could be a factor that played in here. We also though do think, because we can see some of this in our large enterprise accounts where we have management services, we do see some usage starting to come up. So clearly, in terms of pre-economic crisis levels, we're not back to that. But we do see some positive trends there and certainly that increased usage, I think, perhaps in addition to some of the pantry stocking and replenishing in some of the second tier had been factors here in the third and fourth quarter, as we've seen over expectation, relative to supplies revenue. But again, we do think that there is some modest improvement in the market going on here as well. So we're hopeful with that as we look forward."

Better-than-expected customer demand resulted in strong sequential growth for Lexmark, exceeding our expectations for both revenue and profit in the quarter. Both divisions exceeded expectations and geographically, all regions improved sequentially in revenue and profit. Overall, revenue was down just 1% year-to-year, a significant improvement from the year-to-year performance in the first three quarters of 2009. Our year-to-year performance in ISD improved in the fourth quarter and our Laser business returned to year-to-year growth with growth in both laser, hardware and laser supplies in the quarter. Overall, looking back at 2009, we are encouraged by the improved customer demand for our products during the second half of 2009 and the ongoing improvements that we are driving into the fundamentals of our business, including the significant refresh and upgrades in our laser and inkjet product line in the last 15 months, the share gain in our key-focus segments of Workgroup Laser and Business Inkjet, the ongoing cost and expense reductions totaling over $200 million of expense reductions in 2009, the strong sequential improvement over the last three quarters in our cash generation. And despite our expense reductions, we continued to invest significantly in our corporate technology and product development and they're driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products.

The overachievement was broad based with all regions exceeding expectations in revenue and profit. 
Revenue for the first quarter was $1.043 billion, up 10% year to year against a weak first quarter 2009 compare. However this 10% year to year first quarter revenue increase was a significant improvement from the 1% year to year revenue decline in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Also our sequential revenue performance from the fourth quarter to the first quarter was significantly better than our historic norm. Hardware revenue in the first quarter 2010 was up 18% year-to-year and better than expected. The 18% year-to-year hardware growth is a significant improvement from our flat year-to-year performance in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Supplies revenue in the first quarter of 2010 was up 9% year to year and was better than expected as both laser and inkjet supplies exceeded expectations. Now this 9% supplies revenue growth is a significant improvement from the 1% year-to-year decline in the fourth quarter of 2009 and reflects strong growth in laser supplies partially offset by an ongoing but reduced decline in inkjet supplies.
Overall supplies revenue growth was helped in the quarter by improvements in end user demand as well as year-to-year changes in channel inventory including a modest sequential channel inventory increase. 
Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.20. Excluding restructuring related charges earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.35, a 51% increase year to year. In the first quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $146 million. 
Now let’s talk about our two divisions, in our printing solutions and services division, or PSSD, first quarter 2010 revenue was $717 million, up 20% year to year and better than expected with strong year to year growth in both PSSD hardware and supplies revenue. 
PSSD operating income excluding restructuring was $156 million, up 65% year to year. PSSD laser units for the quarter grew 15% year to year with laser MFP’s, color lasers, and workgroup laser units growing at a significantly greater year to year rate benefiting from our new product introductions in these segments over the last 18 months. 
This improvement in laser mix towards workgroup products resulted in PSSD hardware revenue growth of 27% year to year. Now in the first quarter of 2010 our laser hardware sales have again been supply-constrained primarily due to the unexpected demand level, component shortages, and increased component lead times. 
During the quarter we had strong growth in our enterprise management services business. We continued to close new enterprise deals and help our customers such as BB&T and Cummins to optimize their distributed output environment to lower their cost and to improve the visibility of their distributed [field] devices with ongoing managed services. 
According to IDC data for 2009 we have continued to gain branded market share in our focus segment of A4 workgroup lasers with our share increasing almost two and a half points last year to 13% further solidifying our number two market position. And according to our internal analysis for 2009 Lexmark continued to be number one in the US printer market in laser product awards received with more than three times the awards of any other vendor. 
Let’s talk about our imaging solutions division or ISD, in ISD we continue to make sequential progress in reducing the year-to-year revenue decline in both hardware and supplies. In the first quarter ISD revenue was $326 million, up slightly sequentially and down 6% year to year which was an improvement in year-to-year hardware and supplies revenue performance from the fourth quarter of 2009.
ISD operating income excluding restructuring was $49 million, up 28% sequentially and down 12% year to year. ISD units for the quarter were down 23% year to year. During the quarter we continued to improve our mix of high-end inkjet devices and continued to have strong year-to-year growth in the retail sell out of our professional series products, helped by the expansion of our shelf space in the US office superstores last year. 
As a result ISD hardware revenue declined only 2% year to year in the first quarter with growth in branded hardware revenue offset by a decline in OEM hardware revenue. During the quarter ISD introduced the newest member of the professional series, the Lexmark Pinnacle. 
The Pinnacle is a $299 inkjet four in one device targeted at small and medium businesses. This product features the Lexmark my touch user interface and our Lexmark smart solutions and the world’s lowest mono ink cost. According to IDC data for 2009 we gained market share in branded inkjet sales in the above $100 segment in the US and Europe as we’ve shifted our business to serving SMB customers. 
As we look in to the second quarter of 2010 we’re expecting the normal seasonal sequential decline in our supplies revenue as well as the potential for some shrinkage in supplies channel inventory. We’re also expecting good year-to-year hardware revenue growth. 
Overall we expect second quarter 2010 year-to-year revenue growth in the mid to high single-digits. We expect second quarter GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.81. Second quarter 2010 earnings per share excluding restructuring related charges are expected to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.95. 
Now looking back over the last three quarters we are encouraged by the improved customer demand and the improved market conditions that we are seeing. Through the economic downturn our objective has been to make Lexmark into a leaner, but stronger company.
In addition to improved market conditions, our strong first quarter results are also driven by the many actions we’ve taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark. We have expanded and strengthened our product line in PSSD particularly in color lasers and laser MFPs.
We are repositioning ISD to focus on higher usage business customers. We have continued to advance our managed print services business and to strengthen our industry and workflow solutions capabilities delivering value to our software and services and helping customers improve their cost and productivity in the banking, retail, healthcare, education, government, and manufacturing industries. 
We have dramatically changed our manufacturing and support infrastructure, consolidating and reducing the number of facilities and increasing our usage of shared service centers in low cost countries to significantly lower our cost and expense structure. 
As a result we’ve improved our capability to compete in high usage, higher value segments of the market and despite our expense reductions we’ve continued to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. 
We’ve also continued to maintain a strong financial position with a solid balance sheet and with over $1.2 billion in cash and current marketable securities. 
I’ll now turn it over to John Gamble, for his more detailed comments on our financials.

Consistent with previous calls I'll first discuss our results of the first quarter of 2010 relative to the prior year, then relative to the fourth quarter of 2009. I'll then discuss selected changes on the balance sheet and certain items of cash flow. Finally, I'll finish with more detail regarding our guidance for the second quarter 2010. 
I will call out the impact of restructuring related expense as we walk through the P&L. In the supplemental slide deck posted on our investor relations website we have included details on the income statement line items impacted by the restructuring related activities.
Now let me begin with the P&L, total revenue for the quarter was $1.04 billion, up 10% compared to last year and down 3% sequentially from 4Q. The currency impact on Lexmark revenue in 1Q10 versus 4Q09 was negative approximately 2% and the currency impact on Lexmark revenue for 1Q10 versus 1Q09 was positive approximately 5%.
Geographically for the first quarter revenue in all regions was above our expectation. Compared to the same quarter a year ago US revenue of $427 million grew about 1%, Europe revenue of $405 million grew about 15%, and the remaining geographies grew about 24%. 
Supplies revenue in the first quarter increased 9% year to year. This increase was larger than expected reflecting strong growth in PSSD, partially offset by ongoing but reduced declines in ISD. Year to year the increase in supplies revenue was primarily due to improved end user demand and net changes in channel inventory which increased supplies revenue growth by about four percentage points. 
In 1Q10 there was a modest increase in channel inventory while in 1Q09 there was decrease in channel inventory, both principally in PSSD. Hardware revenue in the first quarter increased 18% year to year, and decreased 11% sequentially. This sequential decline is significantly lower than the approximately 25% average reduction over the last five years. 
Year to year the hardware revenue increase was primarily due to increased volume in PSSD and improved product mix in ISD as well as positive net price currency. Compared to 4Q the decrease in hardware revenue is explained by lower hardware volume which is the normal sequential trend.
PSSD revenue for the quarter was $717 million, an increase of 20% from the same quarter in 2009 and a decrease of 4% sequentially from 4Q09. The year-to-year increase was driven by improvements in both supplies and hardware revenue. 
PSSD hardware revenue increased 27% versus 1Q09. This increase was driven primarily by higher unit volume and workgroup and color product mix and positive net price currency. PSSD laser hardware units increased 15% in the first quarter versus the prior year, with laser MFPs, color lasers, and workgroup lasers driving that growth. 
PSSD laser hardware average unit revenue increased 12% year to year in the first quarter driven by a positive shift in the percentage of workgroup and color products as well as stronger foreign currency. 
ISD revenue for the quarter was $326 million, down 6% from the same quarter in 2009 and up slightly from 4Q09. The year-to-year decrease was driven primarily by a year-to-year decline in supplies revenue and hardware revenue that was down 2% versus 1Q09. 
The decrease in hardware revenue was driven primarily by lower unit volume. This negative effect was partially offset by the continuing positive impact of our improving mix toward higher priced hardware devices. 
ISD hardware units decreased 23% year to year in the first quarter reflecting declines in low end units partially offset by strong growth in higher end units as we continued to transition the product line toward higher end devices and higher usage business customers.  
In 1Q10 we saw strong growth in sales of higher end devices. ISD hardware AUR in the quarter increased 28% versus the prior year reflecting the positive shift in the product line and also helped by stronger foreign currency as compared to last year. 
Gross profit margin for 1Q was 36.9%. Excluding restructuring related charges of approximately $8 million, gross profit margin would have been 37.6%, up 180 basis points versus the prior year and up 70 basis points sequentially. The 180 basis point first quarter increase versus last year was principally due to a 250 basis point increase in product margins driven by higher margins in both supplies and hardware.
This product margin increase was partially offset by a negative mix. Sequentially the 70 basis point increase was primarily due to favorable product mix with more supplies relative to hardware. Operating expense for the quarter was $251 million, with restructuring related expense of approximately $7 million. 
Excluding this impact operating expense was $244 million, a reduction of $6 million versus 1Q09 and $16 million sequentially. Versus 1Q09 R&D was down approximately $8 million reflecting our actions in 2009 to consolidate platforms to improve development efficiency. 
SG&A in the quarter was $155 million, up slightly from 1Q09. SG&A was up slightly as cost reductions executed during 2009 were offset by the impact of the weaker dollar versus 1Q09. Sequentially operating expense excluding restructuring related expenses declined $16 million versus the fourth quarter driven by reductions in all expense areas. 
SG&A was lower by approximately $12 million, with R&D down by $4 million. Operating income in !q was $133 million. Excluding total restructuring and related costs and expenses of $15 million, operating income was $148 million, up $61 million from 1Q09 and up $12 million sequentially from 4Q09.
The increase in 1Q10 operating income versus 1Q09 was driven by higher income in PSSD. The increase versus 4Q09 was primarily due to increased ISD operating income and lower other segment expenses. 
Excluding restructuring related activities PSSD operating income in 1Q10 of $156 million was up $62 million versus last year and down $8 million sequentially. The improvement versus last year was driven by higher supplies revenue, positive net price currency impact on both hardware and supplies, and lower operating expense. 
Versus 4Q09 PSSD operating income was down $8 million reflecting lower gross profit in hardware and supplies partially offset by reductions in operating expense. Again, excluding restructuring related expenses ISD operating income in 1Q10 of $49 million was down $7 million versus last year and up $11 million sequentially. 
This decrease versus last year is driven by lower supplies revenue, partially offset by slightly lower operating expense. The increase from 4Q09 was driven by improved hardware profitability, principally improved APCLCM due to lower inkjet hardware inventory. 
Other segment expenses consisting primarily of costs related to centralized supply chain, IT, and other operating expenses primarily G&A, were $57 million in 1Q10 excluding restructuring related activities. This was $6 million lower than 1Q09 primarily due to less negative transaction effect from the impact of movements in foreign currencies.
1Q10 was also $10 million lower than 4Q09 primarily due to lower operating expense. Operating income margin in 1Q was 12.8%. Excluding the restructuring related expenses operating income margin was 14.2%, an increase of 490 basis points from the first quarter of 2009 and an increase of 160 basis points sequentially and well above our expectation in both PSSD and ISD. 
Concerning financing and non-operating costs, in the first quarter of 2010 the net interest in other was an expense of $8 million, up from $4 million net expense in the first quarter of 2009. Net interest in other costs were flat sequentially. 
Our effective tax rate in 1Q100 was 24.1%. Net earnings for the quarter were $95 million, an increase of 61% year on year. Excluding the $11 million after-tax costs from restructuring related activities, net earnings in 1Q10 were $107 million. 
1Q09 net earnings were $59 million or $70 million excluding after-tax restructuring related expenses. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.20. Excluding restructuring related activities EPS would have been $1.35 per share. This compares to !q09 GAAP earnings per share of $0.75, or $0.89 excluding restructuring related activities. 
1Q10 revenue and net income performance are consistent with the improvements we reported over the last three quarters. Supplies continue to recover and our strong laser and inkjet product lines as well as industry leading capabilities in solutions and MPS continue to enable us to grow high value hardware placements.
This coupled with the significant improvements we have driven in our cost structure over the past several years has delivered the much higher earnings levels. 1Q10 was also much stronger than the guidance we provided in February driven by significantly stronger customer demand for supplies and hardware particularly in PSSD. 
We also remain supply constrained on PSSD hardware and as such we continue to focus available capacity on high-end workgroup devices and to limit PSSD hardware promotions. The result of these factors being better hardware mix and improved hardware margins. 
In combination the above factors drove significantly higher gross profit and operating income than expected. Now moving to the balance sheet and cash flow items, cash flow from operations for the quarter was strong at $146 million reflecting our strong earnings and strong working capital performance. 
This compares to an $86 million 1Q09 use of cash. Since the end of December, 2009 accounts receivable increased $16 million, inventory decreased $22 million, accounts payable increased $6 million, and accrued liabilities declined $20 million. 
In 1Q10 we saw continued improvement in inventory turns as well as good performance in receivables and payables days outstanding. For the quarter capital spending was $43 million, depreciation in the quarter was $46 million, and includes $3 million of restructuring related accelerated depreciation. 
Cash and current marketable securities at the end of 1Q10 was $1.2 billion, up $86 million since December, 2009, the significant majority of which is outside the US. Total long-term debt at the end of 1Q10 was $650 million with maturities on the debt in 2013 and 2018.
At quarter end we had $491 million of share repurchase authority outstanding, no shares were repurchased in the quarter. Now let me move to restructuring, for the restructuring plans announced in January, April, and October, 2009 we continue to expect the overall program parameters to be approximately the same as discussed last quarter.
The January, 2009 restructuring plan was principally completed at the end of 1Q10. The April, 2009 restructuring plan is expected to be principally completed at the end of 2Q10. The October, 2009 restructuring plan is expected to be principally completed at the end of 1Q11. 
In 1Q10 total pre-tax restructuring and related costs and expenses were $15 million. In 1Q10 restructuring cash outflow was $27 million and savings from our 2007, 2008, and 2009 restructuring actions were $55 million. 
In 2Q10 restructuring and related costs and expenses due to the restructuring actions are expected to be approximately $14 million. Savings in 2Q10 from the 2007, 2008, and 2009 restructuring are expected to be about $57 million. 
More details regarding the restructuring plans we have announced are available in the supplemental slide deck. Now for my forward-looking comments concerning 2Q10, we expect second quarter revenue to grow in the mid to high single-digit percentage range year over year.
Overall we expect supplies revenue to be up in the mid single-digit range, consistent with first quarter supplies growth, adjusted for the four percentage point benefit of relative change in supplies channel inventory we saw in 1Q10. 
Hardware revenue growth is again expected to outpace supplies growth. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.71 to $0.81 in 2Q10. GAAP EPS includes expected restructuring charges of $0.14 per share, non-GAAP EPS excluding restructuring and related costs and expenses is expected to be $0.85 to $0.95. 
GAAP EPS in the second quarter of 2009 was $0.22 per share which includes restructuring charges of $0.33 per share. Non-GAAP EPS in 2Q09 was $0.55 per share. EPS in 2Q10 is expected to be down versus 1Q10 principally due to sequentially lower PSSD and ISD supplies predominantly in ISD.
All the comparisons that follow exclude the impact of restructuring, in the second quarter we expect gross profit margin percentage to be down versus the 37.6% we achieved in 1Q10. Operating expense is expected to be down slightly from the $244 million incurred in 1Q10. Operating income margin in the second quarter is expected to be below the 14.2% achieved in the first quarter of 2010.
For 2Q 2010 we expect our ongoing effective tax rate to be about 23% before discrete items. This reflects the fact that the R&E tax credit has expired as of January 1, 2010 and has not yet been extended. For the full year of 2010 we expect our effective tax rate to be 22%, assuming that the R&E tax credit will be reestablished in 2010.
We project full year 2010 capital spending to be approximately $185 million and we expect full year depreciation to be approximately $205 million including the impact of accelerated depreciation related to facilities closures. 
The guidance provided is based on foreign exchange rates as of 3/31/10. At these exchange rates the currency impact on revenue in 2Q10 versus 1Q10 is negative approximately less than 1%. The currency impact on revenue of 2Q10 versus 2Q09 is positive approximately less than 2%. 
As we look to the second half of 2010 while we expect continued good performance we also expect several factors to moderate revenue growth and margin percentage levels relative to the first half of 2010. Second half 2010 year to year compares are much tougher than first half compares impacting growth rates. 
The absolute level of supplies revenue in the first half of 2010 was much higher than our supplies models would indicate. For the second half of 2010 we are expecting supplies revenue to be closer to our model forecasts. The supply constraints in our laser hardware have resulted in a strong mix SKU toward workgroup hardware and limited promotions of lasers in the first half. As our laser hardware constraints moderate in the second half we expect more low end to mid range mono and color laser hardware to be shipped returning us to a more normal laser mix. 
We also expect to return to a normal level of laser product promotions. As is our normal seasonal pattern, we expect to ship more inkjet hardware in the second half compared to the first half. We’re also expecting more promotion and demand generation activity to accelerate sales. 
Putting all this together for all of 2010 we now expect low to mid single-digit percentage revenue growth versus 2009. In terms of operating margin rates for 2010 excluding restructuring we expect an increase of up to 150 basis points from 2009 levels. 
With that, we’ll go ahead and open it up for questions.

We certainly see the potential for shrinkage of that here in the second quarter. But in terms of weeks we’re very close to where we want to be. So again it was just modest increase there. 
I think over the last three quarters we have seen supplies improve and I think that there’s potentially two things going on. One is that we’re seeing usage coming back in the marketplace. We certainly saw usage take a hit as we entered the economic downturn and we do believe that there is some usage coming back in the marketplace and that’s good news because this is a sustainable trend relative to supplies in terms of [inaudible] and actual usage of the devices. 
The second thing which we can only speculate about but I think we saw the inverse of it certainly in the first half of 2009 is that there’s inventory out there that’s very difficult for us to see. We can’t see second Tier inventory, we can’t see customer inventory. And I think that in the first half of 2009 we saw this drain because our results were less than what our models would project.
We’re now seeing results over our model and the reality is that can only be one of two things, either the usage is coming back much stronger or there’s some build of inventory we can’t see. Most likely it’s a mix of the two. So the only caution we give relative to the second half is to the extent that’s its build in some of this invisible inventory that may not be there. 
On the other hand we are definitely seeing increases in usage from our customers. We can see it from our services business and that’s a sustainable piece of the trend.

Its saying in that we are seeing improvements in usage out there and so we’re seeing that overage in inkjet supplies versus our expectations relative to end user demand. But the other factor is that inkjet we’re going through a transition. So we have two pieces of the install base.
We have the piece of the install base that we’re walking away from relative to new sales, and then we have the piece that we’re trying to grow. On the high-end side we’re seeing very strong growth in our high-end units and we know that those units have much greater usage than the other piece of the install base which were the low-end units which are declining and our sales are dropping. 
So, I think that that’s the key issue. As we go forward in time obviously we haven’t given guidance relative to supplies or even specifically inkjet supplies, but what we did see in the first quarter was we saw an improvement in the year-to-year decline from what we saw in the fourth quarter. We expect to continue to see improvement as we continue to drive the high-end hardware sales.
And that’s the focus for us as we go forward.

We’re constraint now in components and we have to choose what to build so we’ve chosen to build more of the workgroup side than what I would call the low to mid range side. 
And as a result we’re seeing a mix shift that’s helping certainly hardware margins in PSSD here in the first half. Now what we’re not doing in the first half is we’re not promoting products into the channel into small and medium business on lasers. We’re not doing that, so that’s also helping us. 
So when John talked about additional promotions in the second half, he really was focused from the laser perspective on as we have enough supply be it workgroup or low to mid range lasers to promote it into the channel we can do that and obviously the channel takes a little bit more of a mix in the low to mid range than the workgroup side.
So that was the point that he was making on promotions. Relative to enterprise sales, enterprise always is very aggressive in price, highly competitive and so nothing’s changed there, nothing’s different there. Certainly in the first quarter we’re not really expecting a change there first half to second half.

Second thing we said is around the absolute level of supplies, this was the question earlier about what do we see, and clearly we’re seeing increases in usage in supplies which is a sustainable trend. We also have suspicion that there may be some filling of second Tier inventory and customer inventory which we can’t see, which would not be a sustainable trend and so there’s some possibility that we have some first half supplies that may not repeat themselves in second half, even though again we do believe that the usage increases are here as a sustainable trend.
Third thing we talked about was the constraints in the laser hardware and right now what we’re doing is we’re not promoting into the channel because we need everything we have to pretty much satisfy the enterprise side and what I would call the value part of our channel, the part of the channel that sells solutions and services rather than just hardware.
And so its hard to know how that will play out as we go through the year. Our expectation right now which is the assumption set that we’re using and that we’re sharing is that we will alleviate the hardware constraint. As we do that we do want to promote into the channel because those are very profitable lifetime profit boxes that we want to sell.
So we do believe right now that will happen. Again we’ll see how it plays out in terms of components and overall market demand and Lexmark demand, but that was just the point that was being made that would be a difference we think in the second half and obviously on the inkjet side, the second half is typically much more promotional and we clearly intend to focus there as well as to drive our demand generation on the inkjet side focused on the high end products.
So those are kind of the differences we see first half, second half.

But we’ve seen some positive flip back.

Over the last 18 months we’ve significantly strengthened the product line and this is why I continue to comment on the awards that we’re receiving. The laser awards at 38% is as strong as I think we’ve ever been. The difference between us and everybody else is stronger than I think its ever been. 
So we feel very good about the line. What we’re seeing in terms of sales right now is very very strong growth in laser MFPs. As I look at what HP talked about in their earnings in the February timeframe, I look at what Xerox just talked about a week ago, we’re seeing much, much stronger growth in laser MFPs as we have strengthened the line particularly around our A4 MFPs.
So we feel pretty good about that. Color laser has been good for us, some of that is getting hit by the constraint right now and some of that I think we’ll see a little bit as we go forward in time as well from a constraint perspective. But color laser has been very, very good us.
And workgroup laser has been very strong. Of course we’ve been skewing the build mix over the workgroup lasers over the low to mid end, so that’s why we tend to see more growth there. So we feel very well positioned there in terms of the product line. 
In terms of things like our solutions and services business, we’ve never been stronger. I take a look at our management services business, very strong double-digit growth in the first quarter following a very good year in 2009 during a deep economic downturn certainly. 
And  you look back over the big wins that we’ve had and we only talk about a very few where the customers approve it. We have many more large wins, Fortune 500 wins that we don’t talk about. We’re making good progress there. So we think we’re going to have a very good year in laser hardware.

Go back and look at the launch of the new family we had last September with the tanks capability. The sales of those products continue to ramp up as we’ve gone through the last couple of quarters. In terms of the professional series sales, we’re seeing strong sales, sell out at a retail level.
In terms of our high-end units, we’re seeing strong sell out in terms of office superstores, we’re seeing strong growth on a year-to-year basis. So that’s the good news. Now as we continue to do that we also are continuing to move away more and more from the low end and that’s that drag that’s on the business. 
As we talked earlier, that’s more in the US than outside the US and that drag is there. So the key for us we just want to keep driving that high end and we are seeing usage improvements in that versus what we had been selling before and again we’re seeing good results right now professional series, office superstores, so we just want to keep pushing that. 
We’ve been running some demand generation campaigns, perhaps you’ve seen them, ink months or campaigns that’s out there. So as we look into the second half we’ll be focused on promoting those products and driving demand generation on those product. 
And from a supplies perspective its all about that, as we drive the high end, as that becomes a bigger piece of the install base then the supplies should improve but again that’s a very difficult thing to call exact timing because you’ve got a piece that’s declining, a piece that’s growing and that’s kind of where we are.
But we have the last several quarters seen the year to year in supplies, the supplies decline improve over the last three quarters sequentially.

Paul Curlander 
I think that we feel that we’ve significantly strengthened the laser business over the last several years. So I think almost any time in the past you compare us to we think we’re stronger. We’re stronger in product line, we have a more extensive product line. If you go back five years we were very weak in laser MFPs and color, we’re much stronger now than we ever were.
Our services business continues to make progress. We think we’ve got strong differentiation in services around the capabilities we have, references we have, industry focus that we have. And our solutions we think are very strong. So we feel very good about that business. 
On the inkjet side what we’re doing is we’re transitioning that business and we’re building a stronger business for the future. That’s the whole thrust of what we’re doing and we continue to move through that transition but we think every step we take is making us stronger as we go forward in time. That’s kind of how we think about it.

This overachievement was broad based with all regions exceeding expectations in revenue and profit. Overall revenue was up 10% year to year, a significant improvement from the year-to-year performance in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Our year-to-year performance in ISD continued to improve in the first quarter and PSSD showed strong 20% year to year growth with strong growth in both laser hardware and laser supplies in the quarter. 
First quarter 2010 earnings per share excluding restructuring were $1.35 per share, up 51% year to year. Our outlook for the second quarter is for continued growth in both hardware and supplies. Through this economic downturn our objective has been to make Lexmark into a leaner but stronger company. 
In addition to the improved market conditions, our strong first quarter results were also driven by the many actions we’ve taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark. We’ve expanded and strengthened our product line. We’re repositioning our inkjet business to focus on higher usage business customers. 
We’ve advance our solutions and management services business delivering value to our software and services to help our industry customers reduce costs and improve their productivity. We’re reduced our costs and expense infrastructure, consolidating and reducing the number of facilities and leveraging shared service centers in low cost countries. 
And despite our expense reductions we’ve continued to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products.

As a reminder, Lexmark presents its financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Adjustments to GAAP results in determining non-GAAP results fall into two broad general categories; restructuring-related charges and acquisition-related adjustments.
Restructuring and related charges that are excluded from non-GAAP earnings consist of accelerated depreciation, employee termination benefits, and contract termination and lease charges. They also include project costs that relate to the execution of the restructuring plans.
Acquisition-related adjustments include adjustments to revenue, amortization of intangible assets, and acquisition and integration costs.

Our second quarter financial results were significantly better than expected reflecting strong revenue and earnings growth with double-digit year-to-year growth in both hardware and supplies revenue and good growth in all geographies.
Revenue for the second quarter was $1.033 billion, up 14% year-to-year. For the quarter hardware revenue was up 26% year-to-year and supplies revenue was up 10% year-to-year. Revenue from Perceptive Software was about $6 million in the quarter. Second quarter 2010 earnings per share were $1.07. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related adjustments, earnings per share in the second quarter were $1.23, an increase of 123% year-to-year.
In our Printing Solutions and Services Division, or PSSD, second quarter revenue was $752 million, up 20% year-to-year and better than expected with strong year-to-year growth in both PSSD hardware and supplies revenue.
PSSD operating income excluding restructuring was $168 million, up 92% year-to-year. PSSD laser units for the quarter grew 7% year-to-year with over 30% year-to-year growth in workgroup lasers and laser MFPs benefitting from our recent product line expansions. This improvement in laser mix towards workgroup product and MFPs resulted in PSSD hardware revenue growth of 36% year-to-year.
In the second quarter of 2010, our laser hardware sales continued to be supply constrained primarily due to the stronger than expected demand in component shortages in the market. During the quarter, we continued to have strong growth year-to-year in our enterprise Managed Print Services business.
According to our internal analysis, for the first half of 2010 Lexmark has continued to be number one in the U.S. printer market in laser product awards received. Also according to IDC data for the first quarter of 2010 we’ve continued to gain branded market share in our focused segment of A4 workgroup lasers with the gain of about 240 basis points year-to-year to a share of about 13.5%.
Let’s talk about our Imaging Solutions Division or ISD. In ISD, we continue to make progress in the transition of our inkjet focused business customers. In the second quarter, ISD revenue was $275 million, down only 2% year-to-year which is an improvement in year-to-year revenue performance from the first quarter of 2010.
ISD operating income, excluding restructuring was $34 million up 7% year-to-year. ISD units for the quarter were down 7% year-to-year. During the quarter, we continued to improve our mix of high end inkjet devices resulting in an ISD hardware revenue decline of only 3% year-to-year. We also continued to have strong year-to-year in inkjet sellout revenue in U.S. office superstores help our product line improvements over the past year.
According to our internal analysis for the first half of 2010, Lexmark was number one in U.S. printer market and inkjet product awards received. Also according to NPD data for the first half of 2010 Lexmark has continued to gain inkjet
Also according to MPD data for the first half of 2010, Lexmark has continued to gain inkjet market share in U.S. office super stores, almost doubling our share of OSS inkjet units in the above $100 segment to about 11% making us number two in this important OSS segment.
On June 7, we completed the acquisition of Perceptive Software, a privately held company and a leading provider of Enterprise Content Management or ECM software. Perceptive Software enables a broad range of industry-specific and across industry workflow solutions including solutions in higher education, healthcare and government segments. A key strength and differentiator of their software is its fast, easy and low cost configuration and the integration with number of ERP, CRM and other line-of-business applications.
We acquired Perceptive Software because it builds upon and strengthens Lexmark’s current industry focused document workflow solutions and management services. It expands Lexmark’s market opportunity and adds an ECM software business with strong industry specific solutions.
We believe that Lexmark can accelerate Perceptive’s growth using our global infrastructure and sales channel, and the Perceptive acquisition provides a core strategic component for Lexmark’s future.
Our primary integration focus is to leverage Lexmark’s global infrastructure and lead generation capability to accelerate Perceptive’s growth. To-date, our integration plans are on track.
As we look into the third quarter of 2010, we’re expecting revenue growth in the mid to high single digit range. We expect third quarter GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.80. Third quarter ‘10 EPS, excluding restructuring and acquisition related adjustments are expected to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.
Now, looking back over the first half of 2010, we had strong growth in our revenue and operating income with first half revenue up 12% year-to-year and operating income, excluding restructuring and acquisition related adjustments up 93% year-to-year.
Now, these strong first half results have been driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of workgroup lasers and business inkjets, and have been enhanced by the many actions we’ve taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark. For example, we have expanded and strengthened our product line in PSSD, particularly in color lasers and laser MFPs.
We’re repositioning ISD to focus on higher usage business customers, improving our high end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales through office superstores.
We have continued to advance our management services business and to strengthen our industry and work flow solutions capabilities, delivering value to our software and services and helping customers improve their costs and productivity in the banking, retail, healthcare, education, government and manufacturing industries.
We have dramatically changed our manufacturing and support structure, consolidating and reducing the number of facilities and increasing our usage of shared service centers in low cost countries to significantly lower our costs and expense structure. As a result, we have improved our capability to compete in high usage, higher value segments of the market.
Despite our expense reductions, we have continued to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products.
Now looking forward, in addition to the momentum from our core imaging and printing business, the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of enterprise content management software and will expand and strengthen our industry work flow solutions capability. Together with our Managed Print Services business, Perceptive will be at the center of a rapidly growing software and services business at Lexmark.
Final point is that we continue to maintain a strong financial position with a solid balance sheet and with about $1 billion in cash and current marketable securities. I’ll now turn it over to John Gamble for his more detailed comments on our financials.

Consistent with previous calls, I’ll first discuss our results of the second quarter of 2010 relative to the prior year, then relative to the first quarter of 2010. I’ll then discuss selective changes on the balance sheet and certain items of cash flow. Finally, I’ll finish with more detail regarding our guidance for the third quarter. I will call out the impact of restructuring expense and acquisition-related adjustments, which will be referred to as non-GAAP as we walk through the P&L.
The Perceptive Software acquisition was completed on June 7. Results for Perceptive Software since the June 7 acquisition date have been included in Lexmark’s financial results and in segment recording are included in our other segment. Please note that this will impact comparisons to prior periods as prior period results will not be restated.
In addition to restructuring and related charges and expenses, Lexmark’s non-GAAP financial results will now exclude the impact of acquisition-related accounting adjustments including; amortization of deferred revenue to fair value, amortization of intangible assets, and acquisition and integration costs. In the supplemental slide deck posted to our investor relations Web site, we have included details on the income statement line items impacted by these non-GAAP adjustments.
Now let me begin with the P&L. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.033 billion on a GAAP basis. After non-GAAP adjustments of approximately $2 million, total revenue was $1.035 billion, up 14% compared to last year, down 1% sequentially from 1Q.
The currency impact on Lexmark revenue in 2Q ‘10 versus 1Q ‘10 was negative approximately 3%, and the currency impact on Lexmark revenue from 2Q ‘10 versus 2Q ‘09 was negative approximately 1%.
Our revenue exceeded the guidance range we provided on the April earnings call driven by stronger than expected growth in both supplies and hardware revenue, versus our expectation at the time we provided our financial guidance in April, which was based on the exchange rates as of 3/31/10, currency movement impact on revenue was approximately negative 2%.
Geographically for the second quarter, GAAP U.S. revenue of $435 million grew about 12%. After the non-GAAP deferred revenue adjustment, U.S. revenue of $437 million grew about 13%.
Europe revenue of $369 million grew about 8%, and the remaining geographies grew about 31% year-over-year. We showed strong growth in all geographic regions in 2Q with the somewhat weaker EMEA growth significantly impacted by the euro, which weakened approximately 6% on average in 2Q ‘10 versus 2Q ‘09.
Supplies revenue in the second quarter increased to 10% year-to-year. This increase was larger than expected reflecting strong growth in PSSD partially offset by ongoing but reduced declines in ISD.
Year-to-year, the increase in supplies revenue was primarily due to improved end user demand and net changes in channel inventory, which increased supplies revenue growth by about two percentage points. During 2Q ‘10, supplies’ channel inventory was essentially flat. However, in 2Q ‘09 there was a significant reduction in channel inventories primarily in ISD.
Hardware revenue in the first quarter increased 26% year-to-year and increased 7% sequentially. Year-to-year the hardware revenue increase was primarily due to favorable volume and mix across Lexmark strategic segments of workgroup lasers, laser MFPs, and higher-end inkjets.
Compared to 1Q, the increase in hardware revenue is driven by favorable hardware volume and mix in PSSD, partially offset by a decline in ISD hardware volumes.
PSSD revenue for the quarter was $752 million, an increase of 20% from the same quarter in 2009 and an increase of 5% sequentially from 1Q ‘10. The year-to-year increase was driven by improvements in both supplies and hardware revenue. The sequential increase was primarily driven by growth in hardware revenue and to a lesser extent, supplies revenue.
PSSD hardware revenue increased 36% versus 2Q ‘09. This increase was driven primarily by higher unit volume and favorable work group and MFP product mix. PSSD laser hardware units increased 7% in the second quarter versus the prior year also with strong growth in workgroup devices and laser MFPs.
PSSD has been product constrained on hardware throughout the quarter, and as such has focused on high end product fulfillment. The continued component shortage and resulting hardware product constraint is expected to continue through the third quarter with improvement now expected in 4Q ‘10. PSSD laser hardware average unit revenue increased 28% year-to-year in the second quarter, driven by a positive shift in percentage of workgroup in MFP products.
ISD revenue for the quarter was $275 million, down 2% from the same quarter in 2009 and down 16% from 1Q ‘10. The year-to-year and sequential decline was driven primarily by a decline in supplies revenue. ISD hardware revenue declined 3% in second quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in hardware revenue was driven primarily by lower hardware pricing and volume, partially offset by our continuing improved mix toward higher end business class devices.
The sequential decline from 1Q ‘10 was driven primarily by lower unit volume as well as negative currency. ISD hardware units decreased 7% year-to-year in the second quarter reflecting declines in low-end units, partially offset by strong growth in higher-end units as we continued to transition the product line toward higher-end devices in higher usage business customers. ISD hardware AUR in the quarter increased 5% versus the prior year reflecting the positive shift in the product line.
Perceptive Software revenue for the quarter, which is shown in our other segment, the $6 million on a GAAP basis; after non-GAAP adjustments of approximately $2 million, revenue was $8 million. This represents revenue for the partial period between transaction closed and June 30.
Gross profit margin for 2Q was 36.8% after non-GAAP adjustments of approximately $7 million, gross profit margin would have been 37.4%, up 400 basis points versus the prior year and down 20 basis points sequentially.
The 400 basis point second quarter increase versus last year was principally due to a 560 basis point increase in product margins driven by higher margins in hardware supplies and software. This product margin increase was partially offset by a negative mix of relatively more hardware versus supplies in software.
Sequentially, margins decreased by 20 basis points as a negative mix of relatively more hardware versus supplies was partially offset by improved product margins in hardware.
Operating expense for the quarter was $261 million on a GAAP basis. After non-GAAP adjustments of approximately $10 million, operating expense was $251 million, an increase of $8 million versus 2Q ‘09, and $7 million, sequentially.
In the quarter, the Perceptive Software operating expense represented the majority of this increase, versus 2Q ‘09 R&D was down approximately $1 million. SG&A in the quarter was $160 million, up $10 million from 2Q ‘09. SG&A was up versus 2Q ‘09 as cost reductions executed during 2009 were offset by additional result driven compensation and the addition of Perceptive Software.
Sequentially, operating expense after non-GAAP adjustments increased $7 million versus the first quarter, R&D increased by approximately $2 million, and SG&A was higher by approximately $5 million.
Operating income in 2Q was $119 million. After non-GAAP adjustments of $17 million, operating income was $136 million, up $76 million from 2Q ‘09 and down $12 million sequentially from 1Q ‘10.
The increase in 2Q ‘10 operating income versus 2Q ‘09 was driven by higher income in PSSD. The decrease versus 1Q ‘10 was primarily due to decreased ISD operating income and increases in other segment net cost and expenses.
After non-GAAP adjustments, PSSD operating income in 2Q ‘10 of $168 million was up $81 million versus last year and up $12 million sequentially. This improvement versus last year was driven primarily by higher supplies revenue as well as increased hardware revenue and margins driven by improving mix versus 1Q ‘10 PSSD operating income was up $12 million as higher supplies volume and improved hardware mix were partially offset by negative currency.
Again, after non-GAAP adjustments, ISD operating income in 2Q ‘10 of $34 million was up $2 million versus last year and down $15 million sequentially. This increase versus last year was driven by higher supplies margins reflecting price increases and increasing mix of higher margin tanks from our new inkjet line. The decreases from 1Q ‘10 was driven primarily by lower supplies volume partially offset by less hardware volumes and favorable product mix.
As I referenced earlier, we have included the results of Perceptive Software in our other segment. On a non-GAAP basis Perceptive was slightly accretive to Lexmark net income in 2Q ‘10. In addition to Perceptive Software, the other segment consists primarily of cost related to centralized supply chain, IT, and other operating expenses, primarily G&A.
In 2Q ‘10, other segment operating income after non-GAAP adjustment was negative $66 million. This was $6 million unfavorable to 2Q ‘09 driven primarily by higher negative transaction effect from the impact of movements in foreign currencies, principally the euro, and increases in results-based compensation expenses.
Sequentially, other segment operating income was $9 million unfavorable to 1Q ‘10. Again, this was driven primarily by the negative transaction effect from the impact of movements in the foreign currencies, principally the euro, incurred in 2Q ‘10 versus the benefit generated in 1Q ‘10.
In addition, variable compensation expense was higher in 2Q ‘10 than 1Q ‘10. Operating income margin in 2Q was 11.5%. Excluding the non-GAAP adjustments, operating income margin was 13.1%, an increase of 650 basis points from the second quarter of 2009 and a decrease of 110 basis points sequentially.
Concerning financing and non-operating costs in the second quarter of 2010, the net interest and other was an expense of $6 million, down from $7 million net expense in the second quarter of 2009. Net interest and other costs were down $2 million sequentially.
Our effective tax rate in 2Q ‘10 was 24.6%. Net earnings for the quarter were $85 million, an increase of 400% year-on-year. Excluding the $13 million of after-tax non-GAAP adjustments, net earnings in 2Q ‘10 were $98 million. 2Q ‘09 net earnings were $17 million or $43 million after non-GAAP adjustments.
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.07. After non-GAAP adjustments, EPS would have been $1.23 per share. This compares to 2Q ‘09 GAAP earnings per share of $0.22 or $0.55 after non-GAAP adjustments.
Clearly, our performance both in terms of revenue and income was substantially better than we had guided in April, particularly when considering the impact of the significant weakening of the euro during the quarter.
Stronger than expected volume growth in PSSD supplies, as well as better than expected price realization driven by PSSD more than offset the impact of the weaker euro and allowing us to deliver stronger than expected revenue growth. These same factors drove the better-than-expected income performance. We are clearly seeing the benefits of our strategic focus and investment in high page producing placements.
Now, moving to the balance sheet and cash flow items; cash flow from operations for the quarter was $91 million, compared to $84 million in 2Q’09, and $146 million in 1Q’10.
Since the end of March 2010, accounts receivable increased $36 million, primarily due to the addition of Perceptive Software. Inventory increased $4 million. Accounts payable increased $24 million, and accrued liabilities decreased $4 million.
In 2Q’10, we saw a continued good performance in our cash cycle with significant improvement versus last year. For the quarter, capital spending was $37 million. Depreciation in the quarter was $47 million, and includes $1 million of restructuring-related accelerated depreciation.
Cash and current marketable securities at the end of 2Q’10 was $1 billion, the significant majority of which is outside the U.S. and was down $212 million since March of 2010. The decline was primarily due to the cash acquisition of Perceptive Software at a net cash impact of $267 million, reflecting $280 million purchase price, net of $30 million of cash acquired.
Total long-term debt at the end of 2Q’10 remained at $650 million with maturities on the debt in 2013 and 2018. At quarter-end, we had $491 million of share repurchase authority outstanding. No shares were repurchased in the quarter.
Now, let me move to restructuring. With the restructuring plans announced in January, April, and October of 2009, we continue to expect the overall savings generated from these program parameters to be approximately the same as discussed last quarter.
However, we now expect total cost and expense to be incurred to implement the October 2009 restructuring to be lower than originally announced at approximately $110 million, a reduction of $10 million due to lower than expected severance costs and the deferral of the manufacturing project driven by the strong increase in laser supplies.
The January ‘09 restructuring plan was principally completed at the end of 1Q ‘10. The April ‘09 restructuring plan is expected to be principally completed by the end of 3Q ‘10. The October ‘09 restructuring plan as revised is expected to be principally completed in the first half of ‘11.
In 2Q ‘10, total pre-tax restructuring and related costs and expenses were $9 million. In 2Q ‘10, restructuring cash outflow was $20 million and savings from our 2007, 2008, and 2009 restructuring actions were $59 million.
In 3Q ‘10, restructuring and related costs and expenses due to the restructuring actions are expected to be approximately $9 million. Savings in 3Q ‘10 from the 2007, 2008, and 2009 restructurings are expected to be about $62 million. More details regarding the restructuring plans we have announced are available in the supplemental slide deck.
In addition to restructuring and related costs and expenses, our non-GAAP results also excludes the acquisition related costs and expenses. For 2Q ‘10, these amounts were $2 million impacting revenue, $1 million impacting cost of sales, and $5 million impacting operating expense for a net impact on operating income of $8 million.
For 3Q ‘10, these amounts are expected to be $6 million impacting revenue, $4 million impacting cost of sales, and $2 million impacting operating expense for a net impact on operating income of $12 million. Included in the supplemental slide deck posted to the Investor Relations Web site are summaries of non-GAAP adjustments for 1Q ‘10 and 2Q ‘10 as well as expected levels for 3Q ‘10.
Now for my forward-looking comments concerning 3Q ’10, we expect third quarter revenue to grow in the mid-to-high single digit percentage range year-over-year. The decline in growth rate versus the first half growth rate of approximately 12% is due primarily to currency as well as the relatively tougher compares in 3Q and 4Q ‘10 versus the first half of ‘10.
In the first half of 2010 currency was a net benefit to revenue of approximately 2%, while in the third quarter it’s expected to be a net detriment of over 4% resulting in over a 6% negative relative impact. Hardware revenue growth is again expected to significantly outpace supplies revenue.
GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.70 to $0.80 in 3Q ‘10. GAAP EPS includes expected restructuring and acquisition-related adjustments of $0.20 per share. Non-GAAP EPS excluding these adjustments is expected to be $0.90 to $1.00. GAAP EPS in the third quarter of 2009 was $0.13 per share, which includes restructuring-related adjustments of $0.52 per share.
Non-GAAP EPS in 3Q ‘09 were $0.65 per share. The guidance provided is based on foreign currency exchange rates as of 6/30/10. At these exchange rates, the currency impact on revenue in 3Q ‘10 versus 2Q ‘10 is negative approximately 1%. The currency impact on revenue of 3Q ‘10 versus 3Q ‘09 is negative over 4%.
3Q non-GAAP EPS and operating income are expected to be down sequentially but stronger than historical patterns. The overall reduction is principally due to lower operating income in our PSSD segment reflecting sequentially lower supplies revenue consistent with historical patterns and the weaker euro.
All of the comparisons that follow exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related adjustments. In the third quarter, we expect gross profit margin percentage to be down versus the 37.4% we achieved in 2Q ‘10.
Operating expense is expected to be up slightly from the $251 million incurred in 2Q ‘10 reflecting the acquisition of Perceptive Software. Operating income margin in the third quarter is expected to be below the 13.1% achieved in the second quarter of 2010. For 3Q 2010, we expect our ongoing effective tax rate to be about 24% before any discrete items.
This reflects the fact that the R&D tax credit has expired as of January 1, 2010, and has not yet been extended. For the full year of 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be 23% before any discrete items assuming that the R&D tax credit will be reinstated for 2010.
We project full-year 2010 capital spending to be approximately $185 million, and we expect full-year depreciation to be approximately $95 million including the impact of accelerated depreciation related to facility closures.
As we indicated in our announcement of the Perceptive acquisition, for calendar 2010 on a non-GAAP basis we expect the Perceptive acquisition to be slightly dilutive to earnings.
Clearly, our performance in 2Q and the first half of 2010 was strong in both revenue and income growth as the continued strong tailwind from driving hardware placements in high-end product in both divisions, but particularly PSSD, have improved margins and strengthened our installed base and expected future supplies placements.
The addition of Perceptive Software should further strengthen our capabilities in these areas and in driving additional streams of high margin recurring revenue. This strong performance has been delivered despite the headwinds faced due to currency and component shortages.
Given this performance for all of 2010 our expectations for full-year revenue and earnings have increased, and we now expect high-single digit percentage revenue growth versus 2009.
For all of 2010, we now expect operating expense to be up marginally reflecting the Perceptive acquisition. In terms of operating margin rates for 2010, on a non-GAAP basis we expect an increase of up to 240 basis points year-to-year.
With that, we’ll go ahead and open it up for questions.

What we did through fourth quarter 2008 into the first half of 2009, as we increased prices significantly in Europe as the currency changed. What happened after that is that as the euro swung back, we did not move our prices on the laser side. We did some movement on the inkjet side. We did not on the laser side.
So, as the currency had swung back, we’re actually fairly well harmonized on lasers right now. So, from what we see, we’re probably not going to be moving prices on the laser supplies anytime in the near future, because currencies just kind of swung back to where it was when we increased the prices before.
On the inkjet side, we did do some price increases in the second quarter. I think we’re looking at some possibility also going forward, but on lasers we feel like we’re in good shape from a harmonization perspective. As you pointed out, we’ve not seen any increases from any of the other competitors in the industry yet.

You pointed out several times in your presentation that you’ve made a number of structural changes; you have a fundamentally lower cost structure; you have a much richer mix of high margin lasers; you have a richer mix of laser products, which are higher margin. You continue to try and migrate the higher value products. You have a much higher supplies percentage.
So, can you help us understand is this just a cyclical blip in terms of margins or is this something that’s a bit more structural and something that you know margins may not be too far off from these operating margins on a go-forward basis? And then I have a clarification, please.

First, clearly in the first half you’re seeing some help from the cyclical thing, but we fundamentally have improved the business, and we’ve taken the cost structure down. We really have improved our overhead structure. We’re getting some good supplies growth here, which also is helping margin. These are fundamental things as a result of focusing on the high end units, workgroup lasers, and business inkjets.
So, I think we have a combination of both these things. So I think that when the cyclical smoke clears, we should be sitting in a better margin percent than where we were before start of this economic downturn. So, that was always our objective was to strengthen ourselves through the downturn, so that we exited a stronger company with stronger fundamentals, and that’s really what we’ve been doing with a focus on driving the high-end workgroup and business inkjets.

I’ve heard a lot of incorrect statements over the last couple of months about maybe some of the competition is not fully engaged and that maybe helping Lexmark as an example, but that’s really an incorrect statement. It doesn’t reflect how Lexmark goes to market.
On the laser side, fundamentally what we are doing is selling to enterprise customers. Two thirds of our revenue is going to enterprise. Enterprise sales are not transactional sales. It’s not a case where they’re trying to buy an HP product and if HP doesn’t have it, they buy it from somebody else.
Enterprise sales are long sales cycles. I can’t think of one less than nine months typically, so two year type of sales cycle. Enterprise buys on a contractual basis, three years to five years in duration. They are going to lock up and buy from somebody. Every competitor is engaged in that, and has nothing to do with the current availability of products because they are not going to have to deliver anything for nine months to a year, and it’s going to impact next three to five years. So, everybody is out there bidding, they are bidding aggressively.
The reason Lexmark is growing is because our enterprise business is growing and we are doing much better in enterprise for this year than SMB, not that SMB is bad, enterprise is very strong. We are winning because we have one enterprise, three to five year contractual deals and management services deals in the first half of 2010 and over the last several years, they are still rolling out. So, everybody is fully engaged.
Over on the inkjet side, same thing, the component constraints haven’t been as bad on inkjet side, they’ve been some but certainly haven’t been as bad. Everybody is fully engaged. The pricing environment is the normal that we normally see, even when there is not constraints in the marketplace. So, I think everybody is there and I think that you see in the results for us the strengthening of the fundamentals in our business and the focus on the workgroup lasers and high-end inkjet.

First, the low end lasers are a good lifetime profit boxes. We’d like to sell them. We don’t want to sell them here at the workgroup, which is why we have shifted it. So, as they come back those are good lifetime product boxes for us.
Second thing is, as the data says, and just look at history here over the last year, that even with strong hardware growth we can still do very well on margins, and really it depends on the supplies growth. So, if we get growth in supplies, which is kind of what happened as we went sequentially, say 2Q, 3Q last year and 3Q, 4Q, we saw a lot more hardware, but that hardware particularly being strong in the high end dragged more supplies. We got more supplies on a sequential basis and actually the margins expanded. Year-to-year in first quarter and second quarter we’ve seen the same thing.
So, I think the key to being able to hold the margins and expand the margins just to sell the high end, and that’s really where our focus is. As components come back, we’ll see, just my observation of our history that that appears to be the way it goes.

Obviously, on a cyclical basis, the compares have been fairly easy against first half of 2009. But on a fundamental basis, the laser business is fundamentally stronger than where we were a year and a half ago. First thing I would point to is that we’ve really strengthened the product line and expanded it. Year back, year and a half ago, we were much stronger from where we were at that point in time on our laser MFPs and our color laser lineup.
Second thing is we continue to advance our value propositions in our solutions and services capabilities. So what we’ve seen over the last year and a half is actually a greater receptivity of customers to listen to our value proposition around printing less and improving their productivity. Now some of that starts because it’s cyclical, but in general all of our customers are interested in taking cost and expense out of places that they don’t need to spend it.
So we’ve gotten in front of many customers, we hadn’t had a chance to get in front of before. We’ve seen a lot of receptivity. We’ve had some good business in industries that have been down, and are still down during this economic downturn. So financial services has been very strong for us, retail has been very strong for us. We’re seeing good demand in healthcare as well. Really, all the industries, we see opportunity around the value proposition.
What I’d also tell you is that we’ve been working hard on the OEM side. OEM had been a drag for the last several years. OEM is now helping us. That’s a positive in small and medium business. We have initiatives there to build a channel of Lexmark specific dealers. It’s a small number but it’s a growing number. We’re seeing good growth in that. So a lot of initiatives that are well beyond any cyclical help here, they’re just fundamental to improving Lexmark in product, in path to market, in enterprise value proposition, in solutions and services, and now with the Perceptive Software addition this is a help to us as well. So that’s really how we see it.

As John indicated that the net help on the channel inventory was like 2% help on a year-to-year basis in the second quarter.

Supplies in the third quarter; you’re right, you didn’t hear a specific guidance indication on supplies. What we did say was that as we go into the third quarter that with the first half there’s been some currency help, and John quantified that to about 2% I think.
What we said, as we go into the third quarter, there’s a currency headwind of about 4%, so a net 6% swing. So other than that we haven’t given anything more specific relative to supplies. The reality is historically we haven’t given supplies guidance. We started during the economic downturn because when everything was down, we thought it would be very hard for investors to see where that was going, but the reality is going forward we are getting growth rally also with supplies is two-thirds of the revenue.

That shouldn’t surprise anybody, that’s been the strategy that we’ve talked about since 2007.
That continues to occur as we do less research and development and we’re not announcing new products in that part of that market, so that’s a logical conclusion of that strategy we’re implementing. So, our focus is on the high end. We’re working OSS, and we’re working on other channels that we think that can give us some improvement as well.

It’s hard to know what happens with installed base, when that happens. Our belief is that installed base didn’t disappear. So, the traditional models were saying if sales went down, your installed base must have gone down. I don’t know that that happened during 2009. Clearly, what we’re seeing now is a strong growth in the workgroup lasers. This is what drives the pages. So, in terms of page generation, when I talk about installed base it’s very focused around the workgroup lasers.

Going forward, where we are right now is on the lasers we expect to continue to be constrained through the third quarter into the fourth quarter. That’s further out in time than what I would have told you three months ago, and that’s because the end user demand has been much stronger than what we had anticipated.
All I can tell you is that, we have uplifted our demand lines very significantly to try to get ahead of this. What that then results in is our supply chain team has to go out there and every day chase components. So, very often you have component commitments, turning on the next day those are decommitments. So, it’s an ongoing process chasing components. Really the impact has been lasers. Primarily it’s been impact on the low-end lasers where we’ve held back on the production, but even in the workgroup lasers, we could have sold more, if we had more products.

Our second quarter financial results were significantly better than expected reflecting strong revenue and earnings growth with double-digit year-to-year growth in both hardware and supplies revenue and good growth in all geographies. Revenue for the second quarter was up 14% year-to-year with continued improvement in ISD performance and strong 20% year-to-year growth in PSSD with strong growth in both laser hardware and laser supplies in the quarter. Earnings per share excluding restructuring and acquisition-related adjustments were $1.23, an increase of 123% year-to-year.
Our outlook for the third quarter is for continued growth in both, hardware and supplies. Our strong first half results are being driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of workgroup laser and business inkjets and enhanced by the many actions we’ve taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark. For example, we’ve expanded and strengthened our laser product line. We’re repositioning our inkjet business to focus on higher usage business customers improving our high-end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales to office superstores.
We’ve advanced our solutions and management services business delivering value to our software and services to help our industry customers reduce cost and improve their productivity. We’ve reduced our cost and expense infrastructure, consolidating and reducing the number of facilities, and leveraging shared services centers in low-cost countries. Despite our expense reductions, we’ve continued to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products.
Looking forward in addition to the momentum for our core imaging and printing business, the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of enterprise content management software and will expand and strengthen our industry workflow solutions capability. Together with our management services business, Perceptive will be at the center of a rapidly growing software and services business at Lexmark. With that I’ll turn it back to the operator to close out the call.

As part of planned succession process, I’ve assumed the role of Executive Chairman effective today. I would like to invite everyone in the call to join me in congratulating Paul Rooke on his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of Lexmark. I have known and worked with Paul for over 20 years and throughout his carrier, he has demonstrated tremendous leadership, strategic thinking and operational ability.
Paul has been with the company since its inception in 1991. He has run both of our printer divisions PSSD and ISD and has been involved in all aspects on our business and has participated in the formulation of all other key strategic initiatives. He’s well respected by our employees, our customers and our investors. I have great confidence in Paul Rooke and I’m confident that he is the right person to lead Lexmark forward.
My 19-years with Lexmark including 12 years as Lexmark’s CEO has been an incredibly rewarding experience, but I have a long time personal goal to retire early and it feels like an appropriate time to make the transition. We have a very strong executive team at Lexmark with a lot of experience and continuity. Our business is seeing a positive impact from the key strategic investments in technology, solutions and services that we’ve made over the last four to five years.
We are seeing strong customer demand for management services, our industry work flow solutions, our work group, laser products and MFPs and our high-end inkjet devices. Now with the addition of Perceptive Software and our increased investments there, our future is focused on building a strong growing core of software solutions and services to complement our strong sales in working places and high-end inkjet devices, and to drive Lexmark’s long-term success. I think that this is an extraordinary and exciting time for our company.
In the near term, I will continue as Chairman of the Board of Directors and my role as Executive Chairman, I will assist with the leadership transition and continue to assist the Perceptive Software team with their integration activities. I have planned to retire from the Lexmark Board of Directors and as Executive Chairman in the spring of 2011.

And for now, in addition to my new role, I will also be the acting President of ISD to keep the focus on our inkjet initiatives.
Now let’s turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings were better than expected reflecting good revenue growth inline with our guidance range and strong earnings growth, exceeding our guidance range. GAAP revenue for the third quarter was $1.02 billion; revenue excluding acquisition related adjustments was $1.025 billion up 7% year-to-year.
For the quarter, hardware revenue was up 10% year-to-year and supplies revenue was up 4% year-to-year. Third quarter ‘10 earnings per share were $0.90. Excluding restructuring and acquisition related adjustments, earnings per share in the third quarter were $1.09 an increase of 67% year-to-year. Net cash from operations was $130 million in the quarter.
In our Printing Solutions and Services Division or PS SD, we continue to see strong customer demand for our products and our services, which generated a double-digit year-to-year growth in both PSSD hardware and supplies revenue. PSSD third quarter ’10 revenue was $731 million up 12% year-to-year.
PSSD operating income excluding restructuring was $143 million up 46% year-to-year. Now while PSSD laser units for the quarter grew 5% year-to-year, work group laser units and laser MFPs grew over 20% year-to-year benefiting from our recent product line expansions.
This improvement in laser mix toward workgroup products and MFPs resulted in PSSD hardware revenue growth of 19% year-to-year. During the quarter, we continue to have strong growth year-to-year in our enterprise managed print services business. According to our internal analysis, Lexmark is continued to be number one in the U.S. printer market in laser product awards received for the first three quarters of 2010.
Also according IDC data for the first half of 2010 we have continue to gain branded market share in our focused segment of A4 workgroup lasers with a gain of about 190 basis points year-to-year to a share of about 14%. 
Two weeks ago, PSSD introduced a significant expansion of our workgroup colored laser product line including the announcement of the new 50 page minute X792E color laser MFP.
This is a small foot print, yet high duty cycle integrated A4 color MFP with optional finishing that will help us strengthen or attack on A3 MFPs. An initial, press reviews on the X792E have been very positive and customer interest appears to be strong.
Now let’s talk about our Imaging Solutions Division or ISD. In ISD we continue to make progress in the transition of our inkjet focused on the business customers as we continue to generate ongoing strong growth in high-end inkjet unit sales. 
In the third quarter, ISD revenue was $274 million, about flat sequentially and down 10% year-to-year. ISD operating income excluding restructuring was $35 million up 3% year-to-year. Now supplies of revenue was up slightly sequentially and stronger than the normal sequential trend, which is typically down. In spite of strong sequential performance, the year-to-year performance was impacted by a tougher compare versus 2Q.
ISD units for the quarter were down 28% year-to-year as the strong growth and high-end inkjet units was more than offset by the continuing decline of low-end devices, and this unit mix shift to the high end continues to improve our ISD average unit revenue. And as a result, the decline in ISD hardware revenue of 15% was less than the overall unit decline. 
During the quarter we continue to have strong year-to-year growth in the retail sellout of our professional series inkjet units and ongoing strong growth in inkjet sellout revenue in U.S. office super stores helped by our product line improvements over the last year.
According to our internal analysis, Lexmark is number one in the U.S. printer market in inkjet product awards, received year-to-date through the first three quarters of 2010. Also according to NPD data for the first half of ’10, Lexmark has continued to gain inkjet market share in U.S. office super stores, almost doubling our share of office super store inkjet units in the above $100 segment to about 11%, making us number two in this important office super store segment.
In the fourth quarter we are expanding our inkjet distribution in the U.S. with the addition of some skews at Best Buy, and just over a week ago ISD introduced the new Lexmark genesis inkjet all-in-one, featuring a unique vertical design and a new flash scan camera technology. The new flash scan enables, instant scan previews to the color touch screen and can transfer page from document to digital in as few as three seconds. Priced at $399, the Lexmark Genesis will be available early next year and initial press reviews are very positive.
Our Perceptive Software in the quarter, generated at about $14 million in GAAP revenue, excluding acquisition related adjustments revenue was about $20 million with a strong, year-to-year increase in license bookings during the quarter. Our primary integration focused with Perceptive, is the leverage Lexmark’s global infrastructure and lead generation capability to accelerate Perceptive’s growth. 
In addition, we are working to integrate Lexmark’s and Perceptive’s technology to provide our industry customers with end-to-end workflow solutions. And overall, our integration plans are on-track. Now as we look in to the fourth quarter of 2010, we are expecting a good quarter, with good sequential growth in revenue and operating income, but with a tougher year-to-year compare against our unusually strong sequential improvement in fourth quarter of ’09.
Overall in the fourth quarter, we are excepting year-to-year revenue growth in the low single-digit range, we expect fourth quarter GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.96, fourth quarter ’10 EPS excluding restructuring and acquisition related adjustments are expected to be in the range of $1.03 to a $1.13.
Now looking back to the first three quarters of 2010, we’ve had strong growth in our revenue and operating income. Excluding acquisition and restructuring adjustments year-to-date revenue is up 11% year-to-year and operating income is up 79% year-to-year. The strong results had been driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of work replaces in business inkjets, and it had been enhanced by the many action we’ve taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark, including the expansion and strengthening of our product line in PSSD, particularly in color lasers and laser MFPs.
The repositioning of ISD, to focus on higher usage, business customers. Improving our high-end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales through office super stores, the advancement of our managed print services business and the strengthening of our industry workflow solutions capabilities and significant changes in our manufacturing and support infrastructure. Consolidating, reducing the number of facilities, increasing our usage of shared service centers in low cost countries to significantly lower our cost and expense structure.
As a result, we made Lexmark a stronger, but leaner competitor and improved our capability to compete in high usage, higher value segments of the market and despite our expense reductions, we’ve continued to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products.
Looking forward in addition to the momentum from our core imaging and printing business, the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of enterprise content management software and will expand and strengthen our industry work flow solutions capability. And together with our Managed Print Services business, Perceptive will be at the center of a strong growing software and services business at Lexmark.
As a final point, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with a solid balance sheet and with about $1.1 billion in cash and current marketable securities. I’ll now turn it over to John Gamble for his more detailed comments on our financials.

Consistent with previous calls, I’ll discuss our results of the third quarter of 2010 relative to the prior year, then relative to the second quarter of 2010. 
I’ll then discuss selected changes in the balance sheet and certain items of cash flow. Finally, I’ll finish with more detail regarding our guidance for the fourth quarter. As we announced in the July call, the Perceptive Software acquisition was completed on June 7 and was included in Lexmark’s 2Q results and for segment reporting was included in other. Our 2Q ‘10 financial performance included Perceptive results for only to June 8 though 30th period after the transaction closed.
Now let me begin with the P&L; I’ll start by providing our third quarter 2010 GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $1.020 billion, gross profit was $361 million, gross profit margin percent was 35.4%, operating expense was $268 million, operating income was $93 million, net earnings was $72 million an increase of 622% year-on-year and earnings per share were $0.90. The discussion that follows is on a GAAP basis and reflects non-GAAP adjustments unless, otherwise noted.
Non-GAAP adjustments in 3Q ‘10 were acquisition related revenue adjustments of $5 million and total pretax income adjustments of $19 million. The non-GAAP pretax income adjustments of $19 million in 3Q ‘10 were comprised of $11 million for acquisition related adjustments and $8 million for restructuring related adjustments. As a reminder, included in the supplemental slide deck posted on the investor relation section of the lexmark.com website are schedules detailing the non-GAAP adjustments and reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP measures.
Non-GAAP total revenue for the quarter was $1.025 billion up 7% compared to last year down 1% sequentially from 2Q. The currency impact on Lexmark revenue in 3Q ‘10 versus 2Q ‘10 was positive approximately 1% and the currency impact on Lexmark revenue from 3Q ‘10 versus 3Q ‘09 was negative approximately 2%.
This is the third consecutive quarter of solid revenue growth for Lexmark and was inline with the guidance range we provided on the July earnings call. Hardware revenue growth also significantly exceeded supplies revenue growth as expected versus our expectation at the time we provided our financial guidance in July, which was based on the exchange rates as of June 30, 2010. The impact of currency on revenue was approximately positive 2%.
Geographically for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis U.S. revenue of $468 million grew about 12%. EMEA revenue of $338 million declined about 4% and the remaining geographies grew about 17% year-over-year. We showed strong growth of 13% in all non-EMEA geographic regions in 3Q and the weaker EMEA performance significantly impacted by currency. On a constant currency basis, EMEA revenue was up 3% on a year-on-year basis. 
Supplies revenue in the third quarter increased 4% year-to-year. This reflects double-digit percentage growth in PSSD supplies driven by strong end-user page demand partially offset by ongoing declines in ISD.
Hardware revenue in the third quarter increased 10% year-to-year and declined slightly sequentially. As has consistently have been in the case over the past year, the hardware revenue increase was primarily due to strong growth in Lexmark’s strategic segments, workgour laser, laser MFPs and high-end inkjets and the associated effect of better unit mix.
PSSD revenue for the quarter was $731 million, an increase of 12% from the same quarter in 2009, and they declined 3% sequentially from 2Q ‘10. The year-to-year increase was driven by improvements in both hardware and supplies revenue. The sequential decline was primarily driven by supplies revenue consistent with historical seasonal patterns. 
PSSD laser hardware units increased 5% in the third quarter versus the prior year with over 20% year-to-year growth in workgroup lasers and laser MFPs. Product constraints impacted low and single function shipments in the quarter, but these constraints were significantly reduced as we exited in September.
PSSD hardware revenue increased 19% versus 3Q ‘09. This increase was driven primarily by higher unit volume and favorable workgroup and MFP product mix. PSSD laser hardware average unit revenue increased 14% year-to-year in the third quarter, driven by the positive shift related to workgroup MFP products. 
ISD revenue for the quarter was $274 million, down 10% from the same quarter in 2009 and about flat with 2Q ‘10. The year-to-year decline was driven primarily by a decline in supplies revenue and to a lesser extent hardware revenue. ISD hardware units decreased 28% year-to-year in the third quarter, reflecting declines in low end-units partially offset by strong growth in higher-end units as we continue to transition the product line toward higher end devices and higher usage of business customers.
ISD hardware revenue declined 15% in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in hardware revenue was driven primarily by lower hardware unit volume partially offset by our continuing improved mix toward higher-end business class devices. ISD hardware AUR, in the quarter increased 17% versus the prior year, reflecting the positive mix shift in the product line. 
Perceptive Software, non-GAAP revenue for the quarter, which is shown in our other, was $20 million. 
Non-GAAP gross profit margin for 3Q was 36.5% up 260 basis points versus the prior year and down 90 basis points sequentially. The 260 basis point third quarter increase versus last year was principally due to a 310 basis point increase in product margins driven by higher margins and supplies on software. 
This product margin increase was partially offset by a negative mix of relatively more hardware versus supplies in software. Sequentially, margins decreased by 90 basis points reflecting lower product margins.
Non-GAAP operating expense for the quarter was $262 million, an increase of $13 million versus 3Q ‘09 and $11 million sequentially. In the quarter, versus both 3Q ‘09 and 2Q ‘10, the increase in operating expense is more than explained by the addition of Perceptive Software operating expense versus 3Q ‘09 R&D was about flat. 
SG&A in the quarter was $171 million, up $13 million from 3Q ‘09. SG&A was up versus 3Q ‘09 as cost reductions executed during 2009 were offset primarily by the addition of Perceptive Software operating expense, as well as by additional results driven compensation.
Sequentially, operating expense after non-GAAP adjustments increased $11 million versus the second quarter due to an increase in SG&A. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to the addition of Perceptive SG&A as well as currency.
Non-GAAP operating income in 3Q was $112 million, up $37 million from 3Q ‘09 and down $24 million sequentially from 2Q ‘10. The increase in 3Q ‘10 operating income versus, 3Q ‘09 was driven by higher income in PSSD. The decrease versus 2Q ‘10 was primarily due to decrease to PSSD operating income.
PSSD, non-GAAP operating income in 3Q ‘10 of $143 million was up $45 million versus last year and down $26 million sequentially. This improvement versus last year was driven primarily by higher supplies revenue as well as lower operating expense. Versus 2Q ‘10, PSSD operating income was down $26 million, driven by lower supplies revenue. ISD non-GAAP operational income in 3Q ‘10 of $35 million was up $1 million versus last year and $1 million sequentially.
Other concessive [ph] cost relating to centralized supply chain, IT and other operating expenses primarily G&A as well as the results of Perceptive Software. In 3Q ‘10, other non-GAAP operating income was negative $65 million. This was $9 million unfavorable for 3Q ‘09, driven primarily by additional results, driven compensation and the addition of Perceptive Software. 
Sequentially, other segment operating income was $1 million favorable to 2Q ’10. Non-GAAP operating income margin in 3Q was 10.9% an increase of 310 basis points from the third quarter of 2009 and a decrease of 220 basis points sequentially both inline with our expectations.
Concerning financing and non-operating costs in the third quarter of 2010 the net interest and other was an expense of $6 million down from $11 million net expense in the third quarter of 2009 and flat with the second quarter of 2010. 3Q ’10 was favorable year-on-year primarily due to a $3 million charge incurred in 3Q ’09 for the write down of an equity investment.
Our effective tax rates in 3Q ’10 was 17.7%. This was lower than the 24.6% we saw in 2Q ’10, and lower than our expected tax rate of 24% driven primarily by discrete items reflecting the impacts of tax audits in 3Q ’10 as well as the reduction in our expected full year 2010 effective tax rate at 23%.
The expected 2010 tax rate of 23% excludes discrete items as well as assumes the R&D tax credit is not renewed. As of September 30, the U.S. R&D tax credit has not been reinstated for 2010. Non-GAAP net earnings for the quarter were $87 million. 3Q ‘09, non-GAAP net earnings were $51 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.09 per share this compares to 3Q ’09 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65.
Now moving to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $130 million compared to $147 million in 3Q ’09 and $91 million in 2Q ’10. Since the end of June 2010 accounts receivable decreased $11 million inventory increased to $53 million, accounts payable increased $8 million and accrued liabilities increased $57 million.
The factors impacting our sequential inventory increase were; first increases in component finish goods and pipeline inventory related to catching rapidly increasing demand and alleviating the product constraints we have incurred over the first nine months of 2010. Second an increase in process shipped inventory, due to a sequentially higher number of enterprise shipments underway at the end of 3Q, our units needed to be shipped in early 4Q.And third; some areas of excess inventory we’d like to work off going forward. 
The increase in accrued liabilities was principally driven by increased accrued compensation, interest, and taxes payable. In 3Q ’10, we saw a slight decline in our cash cycle performance, driven by our increased inventory, however we saw significant improvement versus last year.
As we have discussed in the past, improving cash cycles is a significant focus for us with a specific focus on improving inventory performance while improving product availability and customer satisfaction.
For the quarter, capital spending was $28 million; depreciation in the quarter was $51 million. Cash and current marketable securities at the end of 3Q ’10 was $1.1 billion, the significant majority of which is outside the U.S. and was up $113 million since June 2010 driven by operating results.
Total long-term debt at the end of 3Q ’10 remained at $650 million with maturities on the debt in 2013 and 2018. At quarter-end, we had $491 million of share repurchase authority outstanding. No shares were repurchased in the quarter.
Now for my forward-looking comments concerning 4Q ’10. We expect the fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP revenue to grow in the low single-digit percentage range year-over-year. The hardware revenue growth rate is again expected to significantly outpace the supplies revenue growth rate.
GAAP EPS in 4Q ’10 is expected to be $0.86 to $0.96. GAAP EPS in 4Q ’09 was $0.76. In 4Q ’10 non-GAAP adjustments to revenue were expected to be $4 million and EPS are expected to be $0.17 comprised of acquisition related adjustments of $0.09 per share and restructuring related adjustments of approximately $0.08 per share.
Non-GAAP 4Q ’10 EPS is expected to be $1.03 to $1.13 per share. Non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.16 per share. The guidance provided is on a non-GAAP basis and its based on foreign exchange rates as of 9/30/10 at these exchange rates, the currency impact on revenue in 4Q ’10 versus 3Q ’10 is positive approximately 2%. The currency impact on revenue of 4Q ’10 versus 4Q ’09 is negative approximately 2%.
The 4Q ’10 sequential revenue growth is approximately consistent with our normal sequential trend. In the fourth quarter, we expect gross profit margin percentage to be down versus the 36.5% we achieved in 3Q ’10 reflecting a higher mix of hardware. Operating expense is expected to be up slightly from the $262 million incurred in 3Q ’10. Operating income margin in the fourth quarter is expected to be above the 10.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2010.
For 4Q 2010, we expect our ongoing effective tax rate to be about 23%. This reflects the fact of R&D tax credit has expired as of January 1, 2010 and it’s not yet been extended. For the full year of 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be 23% before any discrete items assuming that the R&D tax credit will not be reinstated for 2010. Should the R&D credit be reinstated, we expect the full year 2010 tax rate of approximately 22% before discrete items.
We project full year 2010 capital spending to be approximately $160 million and we expect full year depreciation to be approximately $195 million including the $6 million impact of accelerated depreciation related to facility closures. 
With regards to our announced restructurings, we continue to expect the overall cost of saving generated from the restructuring programs announced in April and October 2009, to be approximately the same as discussed last quarter.
The April ’09, restructuring program was principally completed at the end of 3Q ’10. The October ’09 restructuring program is expected to be principally completed in first half 2011. In 3Q ’10 restructuring cash outflow was $40 million and savings from our 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions were $62 million.
Savings in 4Q ’10 from the 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructurings are excepted to be about $64 million. Our performance in 3Q ’10 continue to be very strong, as our performance throughout 2010. Based on the midpoint of our revenue guidance for 4Q ’10 full year 2010 non-GAAP revenue of about $4.2 billion should go approximately 8% versus 2009.
Based on our 4Q guidance, we are raising our full year non-GAAP operating margin guidance for 2010 from 11.6% to between 12% and 12.5%. Our non-GAAP EPS should be $4.70 to $4.80 per share, representing growth of over 40% versus 2009.
With that, we’ll go ahead and open it up for questions.

I would tell you that, as we look at the revenue guidance in the fourth quarter, we are expecting a good sequential uplift in hardware and supplies, and I think that sequential uplift certainly reflects the workgroup lasers that we are bring into market right now, as well as the announcement we just had with the inkjet products into a Best Buy as well. So those things figure in.
In terms of what we’re seeing on year-to-year basis, we expect again good sequential improvement, but the year-to-year is a much tougher compare against the unusual sequential performance we saw in third quarter, fourth quarter 2009 as we came out of the economic downturn, and that’s the reason for the guidance.

As we move forward in time, we are obviously expecting to see more promotional activity because we’re now caught up on our laser product.
Also, with figures a little bit in terms of fourth quarter guidance is mix, mix of inkjet versus laser, mix of color versus mono, all of which will pull a bit more pressure on those promotions on the hardware margins, but again we are expecting good performance in our strategic segments of our workgroup lasers and high-end inkjet. 
So, strategically things are looking good, certainly in the third quarter, we are expecting it to be very good in fourth quarter and I’ll let Paul Rooke to talk about the competitive landscape.

As you see in our results we had strong double-digit growth in our workgroup lasers and in our business inkjet and so, despite the competitive landscape that’s out there we are making progress and that’s comforting us because it shows an increased customer acceptance of the solutions and services we’re bringing.
There are trends up there you mentioned, the e-print trends, some app trends and so forth and I just point out that e-print is basically printing throughout cloud, it’s been a subset of all the things you can do to the cloud and we are certainly focused on that in fact and we’re doing things to the cloud for several years now in terms of our solutions and services that we provide to our customers.
So, we are looking at really from a broader perspective, a broader opportunity of doing things through the cloud for our customers. The application that you mentioned both on the laser side and on the inkjet with Smart Solutions are an exciting thing for us, it’s been what’s differentiated as for many years now and continues to differentiate us in our workflow solutions as were able to customize for a specific customers, and then we’re trying to certainly extend that down from our enterprise heritage down in the small medium space, and that’s what you’re seeing with the activity with apps on our inkjet line.

In terms of the of the inventory position, it’s really what I described in my comments. Certainly a portion of the increase was related to making sure that we were able to meet the demand that was coming in the fourth quarter and that we had, as we, we saw the third quarter.
The demand that we talked about in terms of shipments that were going out in the third quarter and early fourth quarter are just related to the strong growth we’ve seen in workgroup product and MFPs, consistently throughout the years. 
So, it’s just the timing of it, might have been a little bit later, but it’s just relative to the very good performance we have seen throughout the year and that we have been consistent with.

The core strategic metrics remain strong, so shouldn’t interpret it as a change in the trend here as we go quarter-to-quarter and a lot of it was due to the easier compare that we mentioned in 2Q. 
Let me break it into a couple of pieces; the hardware piece, underneath our high-end inkjets we are seeing growth in double-digits. You see that in our AUR numbers are up 17% there in the third quarter. At the same time, we are dropping more of the low-end, that we’re exiting some mass distribution that Inaudible] so that’s making its way into our numbers.
We’re also on a little less promotional on some of the low-end products as well, so that’s affecting the mix. But, the mix is moving the right direction, which is the strategic point here and we’re encouraged with our technology, the new technology we now into the last fall we’re now extending it with Genesis, is being received very well. 
As we mentioned, the awards numbers that as well as the channel shifts that we’re seeing mass in to OSS, now the number two greater than $100 inkjet provider there in OSS and increases into places like Best Buy. So, that’s really encouraging for us to see the acceptance of the technology that we are bringing and more to come.
On the supplies side, that we mentioned we had a sequential slight increase sequentially which was very encouraging for us, because typically that has been down sequentially in past years.
So, in fact the branded peace of our business was actually better than our OEM, a little more softness in the OEM side and as I mentioned the swing we had last year form 2Q to 3Q is making the compared tougher. So, when we add all that up, while this on surface the metrics look weaker, the core strategic metrics are actually quite strong, and if you back just then look at the overall trend year-to-date both in hardware and supplies, if you compare year-to-date last year versus year-to-date this year, last year we were clearly minus double-digits both hardware and supplies, this year, we’re certainly minus single-digits in both. 
So, the trend is changing and it’s moving in the right direction, obviously I’d like it to be faster, but we’re moving and it is moving and so we’re encouraged.

Paul I wanted to revisit your statement that demand remains very strong, at the surface that actually feels like there was a pretty pronounced change in the demand environment in the quarter well to your expectations. Adjusting for currency, you’re at the very low-end of your revenue guidance of 5%, you said mid to high single-digits, you’re typically pretty conservative. You built inventory and you won from having the biggest backlog in history to potentially having somewhat of a surplus and its sounds like all of the backlog at the high-end has basically been gone. 
So, I was wondering if you could really address the demand situation perhaps linearity in the quarter, and why these collective factors don’t suggest and point to the fact that you’ve seen a change in demand at least relative t your expectations going into the quarter and I have a follow-up.

What happened as we look at the revenue, currently we said mid to high single-digit, we came in right inline with that, your point is well taken with currency, that probably wouldn’t push this up towards the higher-end and we didn’t see that and so the reality is we were a little weaker in a couple of place.
The first thing for us is Europe was weaker than expected. Still had constant currency growth in Europe, but certainly weaker than expected and weaker than what we’ve seen in the first half. Second thing is as I mentioned a minute ago, there were a couple of deals in enterprise. We hoped to get into the quarter. That had been in our outlook that slipped out, but again the enterprise outlook in the fourth quarters is really quite good. And the third thing is, and Paul Rooke mentioned at the OEM supplies in inkjet a little weaker than what we had expected.
But, if we look at the, again the core strategic metrics on the enterprise side workgroup places continue to be very, very strong management services continued to be very strong on year-over-year basis and we currently, on the inventory side we are charging ahead of where we projected demand, because we’ve not been able to catch it for months and months and months. 
So, we took aggressive action there and there is a risk we would overshoot potentially and we saw a little bit of that. But much of that increase is in the core policy and run rate stuff we need, so one of that core increase, some of that will stay, some of that where we will work off, but we are not upset over having a work off a little bit. We are much happier to get caught in it because from a customer standpoint we really did need to get this caught up. 
So, we think overall workgroup basis continue to be quite strong as that high-end inkjets, also quite strong and we have good expectations in the fourth quarter as well.

But I would tell you that this has been a long planned process that the intent for me to retire is in the spring of next year. Your question is to, why do we do it now? Well we need to do a transition and we need to make that public, so Paul and I can work out in the open. 
Our decision to do it before the year end, primarily revolves around making decisions on the 2011 plan that I thought and the Board thought that it would be positive to have the new CEO on the 2011 plan and season set around that. So, we need to do that, we needed to make a change at the end of the third quarter.
And so that’s why we did it, I mean we could have announced it and left me in charge versus Paul in charge, but the reality is that we’ve been making decisions that clearly effect, what he is going to be doing as he goes forward in time. 
So, it’s my personal view that the right way to do a transition like this is to put the new guy in charge, I am still here, I can help him with the transition, but these are the factors that were into it, but there is nothing abrupt here certainly from the internal prospective and again I see a lot of companies do it just this way.

As we look at these geographies, historically they’ve shift a lower mix, more low-end and high-end. But we’ve been very focused on ensuring that as we grow the geographies that they’re on strategy drive, workgroup lasers and high-end inkjet products.
So we are actually having good success with that. The mix continues to improve in those geographies. We are also seeing increases in average unit revenue. So, I think the way you should think about that is that our objective is to basically run them with the same strategic initiatives around workgroup lasers and high-end inkjets.
The mix may always just be a shade less, but it’s going to be close, we are going to keep driving it to get it back to where we have it in the rest of our business.

Our third quarter earnings were better than expected reflecting good revenue growth inline with our guidance range and strong year-to-year earnings growth exceeding our guidance range, excluding restructuring acquisition, related adjustments revenue for the third quarter was up 7% year-to-year with 12% growth in PSSD driven by 19% growth in laser hardware and double-digit growth in laser supplies revenue. 
Earnings per share, excluding restructuring acquisition related adjustments were $1.09, an increase of 67% year-to-year and year-to-date through the third quarter revenue was up 11% year-to-year and earnings per share were $3.67 up 75% year-to-year.
The strong year-to-date results are being driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of workgroup lasers and business inkjets, and enhanced by the many actions we’ve taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark. 
For example, we’ve expanded and strengthened our laser product line. We’re repositioning our inkjet business to focus on higher usage business customers improving our high-end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales to office super stores.
We’ve advanced our solutions and managed print services business delivering value to our software and services to help our industry customers reduce cost and improve their productivity. We’ve reduced our cost and expense infrastructure, consolidating and reducing the number manufacturing facilities and leveraging shared service centers in low-cost countries.
Despite our expense reductions, we have continued to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. And looking forward, in addition to the momentum from our core imaging and printing business, the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of enterprise content management software and will expand and strengthen our industry workflow solutions capability. 
Together with our managed print services business Perceptive will be at the center of a strong growing software and services business at Lexmark. Our outlook for fourth quarter of ‘10 is, we had good sequential growth in revenue and operating income, but with a tougher year-to-year compare against unusually strong sequential improvement from 3Q to 4Q in 2009. 
With that, I’ll turn it back to the operator to close up the call. Thank you.

As part of the planned succession process, I have assumed the role of Executive Chairman effective today. I would like to invite everyone in the call to join me in congratulating Paul Rooke on his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of Lexmark. I have known and worked with Paul for over 20 years and throughout his career, he has demonstrated tremendous leadership, strategic thinking and operational ability. Paul has been with the company since its inception in 1991. He has run both of our Printer divisions, PSSD and ISD, and has been involved in all aspects of our business and has participated in the formulation of all other key strategic initiatives. He's well respected by our employees, our customers and our investors. I have great confidence in Paul Rooke and I'm confident that he is the right person to lead Lexmark forward. 
My 19 years with Lexmark, including 12 years as last Lexmark's CEO, has been an incredibly rewarding experience. But I have a long time personal goal to retire early and this feels like an appropriate time to make the transition. We have a very strong executive team at Lexmark, with a lot of experience in continuity. Our business is seeing a positive impact from the key strategic advancements in technology, solutions and services that we've made over the last 4 to 5 years. We're seeing strong customer demand for our management services, our industry workflow solutions, our work group, laser products and MFPs and our high-end inkjet devices. 
Now with the addition of Perceptive Software and our increased investments there, our future is focused on building a strong, growing core of software solutions and services to complement our strong sales at workgroup lasers and high-end inkjet devices and to drive Lexmark's long-term success. I think that this is an extraordinary and exciting time for our company. 
In the near term, I will continue as Chairman of the Board of Directors. And my role as Executive Chairman, I will assist with the leadership transition and continue to assist the Perceptive Software team with their integration activities. I plan to retire from the Lexmark Board of Directors and as Executive Chairman in the spring of 2011. I will now turn the call over to Paul Rooke, for the CEOs quarterly report."

And for now in addition to my new role, I will also be the acting President of ISD to keep the focus on our inkjet initiatives. 
Now let's turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings were better than expected. Reflecting good revenue growth in-line with our guidance range and strong earnings growth, exceeding our guidance range. GAAP revenue for the third quarter was $1.02 billion, revenue excluding acquisition related adjustments was $1.025 billion, up 7% year-to-year. For the quarter, hardware revenue was up 10% year-to-year and supplies revenue was up 4% year-to-year. Third quarter '10 earnings per share were $0.90. Excluding restructuring and acquisition related adjustments, earnings per share in the third quarter were $1.09, an increase of 67% year-to-year. Net cash from operations was $130 million in the quarter. 
Now in our Printing Solutions and Services Division, or PSSD, we continue to see strong customer demand for our products and our services, which generated double-digit year-to-year growth in both PSSD hardware and supplies revenue. PSSD third quarter '10 revenue was $731 million, up 12% year-to-year. PSSD operating income, excluding restructuring, was $143 million, up 46% year-to-year. Now while PSSD laser units for the quarter grew 5% year-to-year, workgroup laser units and laser MFP's grew over 20% year-to-year benefiting from our recent product line expansions. This improvement in laser mix toward workgroup products and MFP's resulted in PSSD hardware revenue growth of 19% year-to-year. And during the quarter, we continue to have strong growth year-to-year in our Enterprise Managed Print Services business. 
According to our internal analysis, Lexmark has continued to be number one in the U.S. printer market in laser product awards received for the first three quarters of 2010. Also, according to IDC data for the first half of 2010, we have continued to gain branded market share in our focused segment of A4 workgroup lasers with a gain of about 190 basis points year-to-year to a share of about 14%. 
Two weeks ago, PSSD introduced a significant expansion of our workgroup colored laser product line, including the announcement of the new 50 page a minute X792E, color laser MFP. This is a small footprint yet high duty cycle integrated A4 color MFP with optional finishing that will help us strengthen our attack on A3 MFP's. An initial press reviews on the X792E have been very positive and customer interest appears to be strong. 
Let's talk about our Imaging Solutions Division or ISD. In ISD we continue to make progress on the transition of our inkjet focused business customers as we continue to generate ongoing strong growth and high end inkjet unit sales. In the third quarter, ISD revenue was $274 million, about flat sequentially and down 10% year-to-year. ISD operating income excluding restructuring was $35 million, up 3% year-to-year. Now supplies revenue was up slightly sequentially and stronger than the normal sequential trend which is typically down. And slight strong sequential performance, the year-to-year performance was impacted by tougher compare versus 2Q. 
ISD units for the quarter were down 28% year-to-year as the strong growth and high-end inkjet units was more than offset by the continuing decline of low-end devices. And as unit mix shift to the high end continues to improve our ISD average unit revenue. And as a result the decline in ISD hardware revenue of 15% was less than the overall unit decline. And during the quarter we continue to have strong year-to-year growth in the retail sellout of our professional series inkjet units and ongoing strong growth in inkjet sellout revenue in the U.S. office super stores helped by our product line improvements over the last year. According 
to internal analysis, Lexmark is number one in the U.S. printer market in inkjet product awards, received year-to-date through the first three quarters of 2010. Also according to NPD data for the first half of '10, Lexmark has continued to gain inkjet market share in U.S. office super stores, almost doubling our share of office super store inkjet units in the above $100 segment to about 11%, making us number two in this important office super store segment. 
And in the fourth quarter, we're expanding our inkjet distribution in the U.S. with the addition of some SKUs at Best Buy. And just over a week ago, ISD introduced the new Lexmark Genesis inkjet all-in-one, featuring a unique vertical design and a new flash scan camera technology. The new flash scan enables instant scan previews to the color touch screen and can transfer page from document to digital in as few as 3 seconds. Priced at $399, the Lexmark Genesis will be available early next year and initial press reviews are very positive. 
Now Perceptive Software in the third quarter generated about $14 million in GAAP revenue, excluding acquisition related adjustments, revenue was about $20 million with a strong year-to-year increase in license bookings during the quarter. Now our primary integration focused with Perceptive is the leveraged Lexmark's global infrastructure and lead generation capability to accelerate perceptive's growth. In addition we're working to integrate Lexmark's and Perceptive's technology to provide our industry customers with end-to-end workflow solutions, and overall our integration plans are on track. 
Now as we look into the fourth quarter of 2010, we're expecting a good quarter with good sequential gross in revenue and operating income but with a tougher year-to-year compare against our usually strong sequential improvement in fourth quarter of '09. 
Now overall in the fourth quarter we're expecting year-to-year revenue growth in the low single-digit range. We expect fourth quarter GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.96. Fourth quarter '10 EPS excluding restructuring and acquisition related adjustments are expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.13. 
Now looking back to the first three quarters of 2010, we've had strong growth in our revenue and operating income. Excluding acquisition and restructuring adjustments year-to-date, revenue is up 11% year-to-year and operating income is up 79% year-to-year. The strong results had been driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of workgroup lasers and business inkjets and had been enhanced by the many actions we've taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark, including the expansion and strengthening of our product line in PSSD, particularly in color lasers and laser MFPs. The repositioning of ISD, to focus on higher usage, business customers, improving our high-end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales through office super stores. The advancement of our managed print services business and the strengthening of our industry workflow solutions capabilities and significant changes in our manufacturing and support infrastructure, consolidating, reducing the number of facilities, increasing our usage of shared service centers in low-cost countries to significantly lower our cost and expense structure. 
As a result we made Lexmark a stronger but leaner competitor and improved our capability to compete in the high usage, higher value segments of the market. And despite our expense reductions, we've continue to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. 
Looking forward in addition to the momentum from our core imaging and printing business, the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of Enterprise Content Management Software and will expand and strengthen our industry workflow solutions capability. And together with our Managed Print Services business, Perceptive will be at the center of a strong growing software and services business at Lexmark. 
And as a final point, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with a solid balance sheet and with about $1.1 billion in cash and current marketable securities. I'll now turn it over to John Gamble for his more detailed comments on our financials."

Consistent with previous calls, I'll discuss our results of the third quarter of 2010 relative to the prior year than relative to the second quarter of 2010. I'll then discuss selected changes in the balance sheet and certain items of cash flow. Finally, I'll finish with more detail regarding our guidance for the fourth quarter. 
As we announced in the July call, the Perceptive Software acquisition was completed on June 7 and was included in Lexmark's 2Q results and for segment reporting was included in other. Our 2Q '10 financial performance included Perceptive results for only the June 8th through the 30th period after the transaction closed. 
Now let me begin with the P&L. I'll start by providing our third quarter 2010 GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $1.020 billion. Gross profit was $361 million. Gross profit margin percent was 35.4%. Operating expense was $268 million. Operating income was $93 million. Net earnings were $72 million, an increase of 622% year-on-year and earnings per share were $0.90. 
The discussion that follows is on a non-GAAP basis and reflects non-GAAP adjustments unless otherwise noted. Non-GAAP adjustments in 3Q '10 were acquisition related revenue adjustments of $5 million, and total pretax income adjustments of $19 million. The non-GAAP pretax income adjustments of $19 million in 3Q '10 were comprised of $11 million for acquisition related adjustments and $8 million for restructuring related adjustments. As a reminder, included in the supplemental Slide deck posted on the Investor Relations section of the Lexmark.com website are schedules detailing the non-GAAP adjustments and reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP measures. 
Non-GAAP total revenue for the quarter was $1.025 billion, up 7% compared to last year, down 1% sequentially from 2Q. The currency impact on Lexmark revenue in 3Q '10 versus 2Q '10 was positive approximately 1% and the currency impact on Lexmark revenue from 3Q '10 versus 3Q '09 was negative approximately 2%. This is the third consecutive quarter of solid revenue growth for Lexmark and was in-line with the guidance range we provided on the July earnings call. 
Hardware revenue growth also significantly exceeded supplies revenue growth as expected. Versus our expectation at the time we provided our financial guidance in July, which was based on the exchange rates as of June 30, 2010. The impact of currency on revenue was approximately positive 2%. 
Geographically, for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis, U.S. revenue of $468 million grew about 12%. EMEA revenue of $338 million declined about 4% and the remaining geographies grew about 17% year-over-year. We showed strong growth of 13% in all non-EMEA geographic regions in 3Q and the weaker EMEA performance significantly impacted by currency. On a constant-currency basis, EMEA revenue was up 3% on a year-on-year basis. 
Supplies revenue in the third quarter increased 4% year-to-year. This reflects double-digit percentage growth in PSSD supplies driven by strong end-user page demand partially offset by ongoing declines in ISD. Hardware revenue in the third quarter increased 10% year-to-year and declined slightly sequentially. As has consistently been the case over the past year, the hardware revenue increase was primarily due to strong growth in Lexmark's strategic segments our workgroup laser, laser MFP some high-end inkjets and the associated effect of better unit mix. 
PSSD revenue for the quarter was $731 million, an increase of 12% from the same quarter in 2009 and a decline of 2% sequentially from 2Q '10. The year-to-year increase was driven by improvements in both hardware and supplies revenue. The sequential decline was primarily driven by supplies revenue consistent with historical seasonal patterns. PSSD laser hardware units increased 5% in the third quarter versus the prior year with over 20% year-to-year growth in workgroup lasers and laser MFPs. Product constraints impacted low and single function shipments in the quarter, but these constraints were significantly reduced as we exited in September. PSSD hardware revenue increased 19% versus 3Q '09. This increase was driven primarily by higher unit volume and favorable workgroup and MFP product mix. PSSD laser hardware average unit revenue increased 14% year-to-year in the third quarter, driven by the positive shift related to workgroup MFP products. ISD revenue for the quarter was $274 million, down 10% from the same quarter in 2009 and about flat with 2Q '10. The year-to-year decline was driven primarily by a decline in supplies revenue, and to a lesser extent, hardware revenue. ISD hardware units decreased 28% year-to-year in the third quarter, reflecting declines in low end units partially offset by strong growth in higher-end units as we continue to transition the product line toward higher end devices, and higher usage business customers. 
ISD hardware revenue declined 15% in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in hardware revenue was driven primarily by lower hardware unit volume partially offset by our continuing improved mix toward higher-end business class devices. ISD hardware AUR, in the quarter increased 17% versus the prior year, reflecting the positive mix shift in the product line. Perceptive Software, non-GAAP revenue for the quarter which is shown in our Other, was $20 million. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for 3Q was 36.5%, up 260 basis points versus the prior year and down 90 basis points sequentially. The 260 basis point third quarter increase versus last year was principally due to a the 310 basis point increase in product margins driven by higher margins and supplies in software. This product margin increased was partially offset by a negative mix of relatively more hardware versus supplies in software. Sequentially margins decreased by 90 basis points reflecting a lower and margins. 
Non-GAAP operating expense for the quarter was $262 million, an increase of $13 million versus 3Q '09 and $11 million sequentially. In the quarter, versus both 3Q '09 and 2Q '10, the increase in operating expense is more than explained by the addition of Perceptive Software operating expense, versus 3Q '09 R&D was about flat. SG&A in the quarter was $171 million, up $13 million from 3Q '09. SG&A was up versus 3Q '09 as cost reductions executed during 2009 were offset primarily by the addition of Perceptive Software operating expense, as well as by additional results driven compensation. Sequentially operating expense after non-GAAP adjustments increased $11 million versus the second quarter due to an increase in SG&A. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to the addition of perceptive SG&A, as well as currency. 
Non-GAAP operating income in 3Q was $112 million, up $37 million from 3Q '09 and down $24 million sequentially from 2Q '10. The increase in 3Q '10 operating income versus 3Q '09 was driven by higher income in PSSD. The decrease versus 2Q '10 was primarily due to decreased PSSD operating income. PSSD, non-GAAP operating income in 3Q '10 of $143 million, was up $45 million last versus last year, and down $26 million sequentially. This improvement versus last year was driven primarily by higher supplies revenue, as well as lower operating expense. Versus 2Q '10, PSSD operating income was down $26 million, driven by lower supplies revenue. 
ISD non-GAAP operational income in 3Q '10 of $35 million, was up $1 million versus last year and $1 million sequentially. Other consist of cost relating to centralized supply chain, IT and other operating expenses primarily G&A, as well as the results of Perceptive Software. In 3Q '10, other non-GAAP operating income was negative-$65 million. This was $9 million on favorable to 3Q '09, driven primarily by additional results driven compensation and the addition of Perceptive Software. Sequentially other segment operating income was $1 million favorable to 2Q '10. 
Non-GAAP operating income margin in 3Q was 10.9%, an increase of 310 basis points from the third quarter of 2009 and a decrease of 220 basis points sequentially both in-line with our expectations. Concerning financing and non-operating costs, in the third quarter of 2010, the net interest and Other was an expense of $6 million, down from $11 million net expense in the third quarter of 2009, and flat with the second quarter of 2010. 3Q '10 was favorable year-on-year primarily due to a $3 million in 3Q '09 for the write down of an equity investment. 
Our effective tax rate in 3Q '10 was 17.7%. This was lower than the 24.6% we saw in 2Q '10 and lower than our expected tax rate of 24% driven primarily by discrete items reflecting the impacts of tax audits in 3Q '10, as well as the reduction of our expected full year 2010 effective tax rate to 23%. The expected 2010 tax rate of 23% excludes discrete items, as well as assumes. The R&D tax credit is not renewed. As of September 30, the U.S. R&D tax credit have not been reinstated for 2010. 
Non-GAAP net earnings for the quarter were $87 million. 3Q '09, non-GAAP net earnings were $51 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.09 per share. This compares to 3Q '09 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65. 
Now moving to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $130 million, compared to $147 million on 3Q '09 and $91 million in 2Q '10. Since the end of June 2010, accounts receivable decreased $11 million, inventory increased $53 million, accounts payable increased $8 million, and accrued liabilities increased $57 million. The factors impacting our sequential inventory increase were first, increases in component finish goods and pipeline inventory related to catching rapidly increasing demand and alleviating the product constraints we have incurred over the first 9 months of 2010. Second, an increase in in-process shipped inventory due to a sequentially higher number of enterprise shipments underway at the end of 3Q, or units needed to be shipped in early 4Q; and third, some areas of excess inventory we'd like to work off going forward. The increase in accrued liabilities was principally driven by increased accrued compensation, interest and taxes payable. 
In 3Q '10, we saw a slight decline in our cash cycle performance driven by our increased inventory. However we saw significant improvement versus last year. As we have discussed in the past, improving cash cycle is a significant focus for us with a specific focus on improving inventory performance while improving product availability and customer satisfaction. For the quarter, capital spending was $28 million, depreciation in the quarter was $51 million. Cash and current marketable securities at the end of 3Q '10 was $1.1 billion, the significant majority of which is outside the U.S. and was up $113 million since June 2010 driven by operating results. 
Total long-term debt at the end of 3Q '10 remained at $650 million, with maturities on the debt in 2013 and 2018. At quarter end, we had $491 million of share repurchase authority outstanding. No share repurchase in the quarter. 
Now for my forward-looking comments concerning 4Q '10. We expect fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP revenue to grow in the low single-digit percentage range of year-over-year giga. The hardware revenue growth rate is again expected to significantly outpace the supplies revenue growth rate. GAAP EPS in 4Q '10 is expected to be $0.86 to $0.96. GAAP EPS in 4Q '09 was $0.76. In 4Q '10, non-GAAP adjustments to revenue were expected to be $4 million and to EPS are expected to be $0.17, comprised of acquisition related adjustments of $0.09 per share and restructuring related adjustments of approximately $0.08 per share. 
Non-GAAP 4Q '10 EPS is expected to be $1.03 to $1.13 per share. Non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.16 per share. The guidance provided is on a non-GAAP basis and its based on foreign exchange rates as of 9/30/10. At these exchange rates, the currency impact on revenue in 4Q '10 versus 3Q '10 is positive approximately 2%. The currency impact on revenue of 4Q '10 versus 4Q '09 is negative approximately 2%. The four 4Q '10 sequential revenue growth is approximately consistent with our normal sequential trend. 
In the fourth quarter we expect gross profit margin percentage to be down versus the 36.5% we achieved in 3Q '10 reflecting a higher mix of hardware. Operating expenses is expected to be up slightly from the $262 million incurred in 3Q '10. Operating income margin in the fourth quarter is expected to be above the 10.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2010. 
For 4Q 2010, we expect our ongoing effective tax rate to be about 23%. This reflects the fact that the R&D tax credit has expired as of January 1, 2010 and has not yet been extended. For the full year of 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to 23% before industry items assuming that the R&D tax credit will not be reinstated for 2010. Should the R&D credit be reinstated, we expect the full year 2010 tax rate of approximately 22% before discrete items. We project full year 2010 capital spending to be approximately $160 million and we expect full year depreciation to be approximately $195 million, including the $6 million impact of accelerated depreciation related to facility closures. 
With regards to our announced restructurings, we continue to expect the overall cost in savings generated from the restructuring programs announced in April and October 2009 to be approximately the same as discussed last quarter. The April '09 restructuring program was principally completed at the end of 3Q '10. The October '09 were structuring program is expected to be principally completed in the first half 2011. In 3Q '10, restructuring cash outflow was $14 million, and savings from our 2007, 2008, and 2009 restructuring actions was $62 million. Savings in 4Q '10 from the 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructurings are expected to be about $64 million. 
Our performance in 3Q '10 continued to be very strong, as our performance throughout 2010. Based on the midpoint of our revenue guidance for 4Q '10, full year 2010 non-GAAP revenue of about $4.2 billion should grow approximately 8% versus 2009. Based on our 4Q guidance, we are raising our full year non-GAAP operating margin guidance for 2010 from 11.6% to between 12% and 12.5%. Our non-GAAP EPS should be $4.70 to $4.80 per share, representing growth of over 40% versus 2009. With that, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions."

In terms of the inventory position, it's really what I described in my comments. And that certainly a portion of the increase was related to making sure that we were able to meet the demand that was coming in the fourth quarter and that we had, as we saw the third quarter. The demand that we talked about in terms of shipments that were going out in the third quarter and early fourth quarter are just related to the strong growth we've seen in workgroup product and MFP's, consistently throughout the year. So it's just the timing of it. It might have been a little bit later, but it's just relative to the very good performance we've seen throughout the year and we've been consistent with.

The metrics look weaker but underneath and I'll give you a little color on that. The core strategic metrics remain strong so you shouldn't interpret it as a change in the trend here as we go quarter-to-quarter and a lot of that was due to the easier compare that we mentioned in 2Q. Let me break it into a couple of pieces. The hardware piece, underneath our high-end inkjets, we are seeing growth in double digits. You see that in our AUR numbers. They're up 17% there in the third quarter. At the same time we are dropping more on the low end, we're exiting some mass distribution that we are still there so that's making its way into our numbers. We're also a little less promotional on some of the low-end products as well so that's affecting the mix but the mix is moving in the right direction which is a strategic point here and we're encouraged with our technology, the new technology as it with Genesis is being received very well. As we mentioned the awards numbers that, as well as the channel shifts that we're seeing from mass in to OSS that number two greater than $100 inkjet provider there in OSS and increase in places like Best Buy. So that's really encouraging for us to see the acceptance of the technology we're bringing and more to come. Of the supply side, we mentioned we had a sequential slight increase sequentially which was very encouraging for us because typically, that's been down sequentially in past years. So in fact, the branded piece of our business was actually better than our OEM, a little more softness in the OEM side. And as I mentioned, the swing we had last year form 2Q to 3Q is making the compared tougher so when you add all that up well on the surface the metrics look weaker the core strategic metrics are actually quite strong. And if you back up, just then look at the overall trend year-to-date both in hardware and supplies, if you compare year-to-date last year, versus year-to-date this year, last year we were clearly minus double digits both programs this year, we're certainly minus single digits in both. So the trend is changing, and is moving in the right direction. Obviously I'd like it to be faster but we're moving and it is moving and so we're encouraged."

At the surface, that actually feels like there was a pretty pronounced change in the demand environment in the quarter relative to your expectations. Adjusting for currency or at the very low-end of your revenue guidance of 5%. You said mid- to high-single digits. You're typically pretty conservative. You built inventory and you went from having the biggest backlog in history to potentially having somewhat of a surplus and it sounds like all of the backlog at the high-end has basically been gone. So I was wondering if you could really address the demand situation perhaps linearity in the quarter and why these collective factors don't suggest and point to the fact that you've seen a change in demand at least relative to your expectations going into the quarter and I have a follow-up."

First, within our projections for the quarter, we expected to catch a big piece of the backlog so that's not new news. What happened as we looked at the revenue, currently we said mid to high single digit. We came in right in-line with that. Your point is well taken with currency, that probably wouldn't push us up towards the higher-end and we didn't see that and so the reality is we were a little weaker in couple of places. The first thing for us is Europe was weaker than expected. Still had constant currency growth in Europe but certainly weaker than expected and weaker than what we've seen in the first half. Second thing is, as I mentioned a minute ago, there were a couple of deals in enterprise. We hope to get into the quarter. That has been in our outlook that slipped out, but again the enterprise outlook in the first quarter is really quite good and the third thing is, and Paul Rooke mentioned at the OEM supplies in inkjet a little weaker than what we had expected. But if we look at the again, the core metrics strategic position in the enterprise workgroup places continue to be very, very strong, management services continued to be very strong on year-over-year basis and we currently, on the inventory side, we're charging ahead of where we projected demand as we have not been able to catch it for months and months and months. So we took aggressive action there and we know that there is a risk we would overshoot potentially and we saw a little bit of that. But much of that increase is in the core policy and run rate stuff we need so a lot of that core increase, some of that will stay, some of that we will work off. What we are not as upset over having to work off a little bit. We're much happier to get caught in it because from a customer standpoint, we really did need to get this caught up. So we think overall work group basis continue to be quite strong as that high-end inkjets also quite strong and we see we have good expectations in the fourth quarter as well."

Well we need to do a transition and we need to make that public so that while and I can work out in the open. Our decision to do it before the year-end, primarily revolves around making decisions on the 2011 plan that I thought and the Board thought that it would be a positive to have the new CEO on the 2011 plan and decision set around that so we need to do that. We needed to make a change at the end of the third quarter. And so that's why we did it. I mean we could have announced it and left me in charge, versus Paul in charge but the reality is, we've been making decisions that could affect what he is going to be doing as he goes forward in time. So it's my personal view that the right way to do a transition like this is to put the new guy in charge. I'm still here.

Workgroup lasers and high-end inkjet products. And so we're actually having good success with that and the mix continues to improve and the geographies that are also seeing increases in average unit revenue. So I think the way we should think about that is our objective is to basically run them with the same strategic initiatives around workgroup lasers and high-end inkjets. The mix always be a shade less but it's going to be close. We are going to keep driving it to get it back to where we have it in the rest of our business.

Our third quarter earnings were reflecting good revenue growth in-line with our guidance range and strong year-to-year earnings growth exceeding our guidance range. Excluding restructuring, acquisition related adjustments revenue for the third quarter was up 7% year-to-year with 12% growth in PSSD driven by 19% growth in laser hardware and double-digit growth in laser supplies revenue. Earnings per share excluding restructuring acquisition related adjustments were $1.9 an increase of 67% year-to-year and year-to-date through the third quarter revenue was up 11% year-to-year and earnings per share were $3.67, up 75% year-to-year. The strong year-to-date results have been driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of workgroup lasers and business inkjets and enhanced by the many actions we've taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark. For example, we've expanded and strengthened our laser product line. We're repositioning our inkjet business to focus on higher usage business customers improving our high-end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales throughout the office super stores. We've advanced our solutions and managed print services business delivering value to our software and services to help our industry customers reduce cost and improve their productivity. We've reduce our cost and expense infrastructure, consolidating and reducing the number of manufacturing facilities and leveraging shared service centers in low-cost countries. And inspite our expense reduction, we have continued to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. And looking forward to additions in momentum from our core imaging and printing business the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of enterprise content management software and we'll expenditure that our industry workflow solutions capability. Together with our managed print services business Perceptive will be at the center of a strong growing software print services at Lexmark. Our outlook for fourth quarter of '10 is for good sequential gross in revenue and operating income but with a tougher year-to-year compare against unusually strong sequential improvement from 3Q to 4Q in 2009. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to close up the call. Thank you."

As part of the planned succession process, I have assumed the role of Executive Chairman effective today. I would like to invite everyone in the call to join me in congratulating Paul Rooke on his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of Lexmark. I have known and worked with Paul for over 20 years and throughout his career, he has demonstrated tremendous leadership, strategic thinking and operational ability. 
Paul has been with the company since its inception in 1991. He has run both of our Printer divisions, PSSD and ISD, and has been involved in all aspects of our business and has participated in the formulation of all our key strategic initiatives. He's well respected by our employees, our customers and our investors. I have great confidence in Paul Rooke and I'm confident that he is the right person to lead Lexmark forward. 
My 19 years with Lexmark, including 12 years as Lexmark's CEO, has been an incredibly rewarding experience. But I have a long time personal goal to retire early and this feels like an appropriate time to make the transition. 
We have a very strong executive team at Lexmark, with a lot of experience and continuity. Our business is seeing a positive impact from the key strategic investments in technology, solutions and services that we've made over the last 4 to 5 years. We're seeing strong customer demand for our management services, our industry workflow solutions, our work group, laser products and MFPs and our high-end inkjet devices. 
Now with the addition of Perceptive Software and our increased investments there, our future is focused on building a strong, growing core of software solutions and services to complement our strong sales at workgroup lasers and high-end inkjet devices and to drive Lexmark's long-term success. I think that this is an extraordinary and exciting time for our company. 
In the near term, I will continue as Chairman of the Board of Directors. In my role as Executive Chairman, I will assist with the leadership transition and continue to assist the Perceptive Software team with their integration activities. I plan to retire from the Lexmark Board of Directors and as Executive Chairman in the spring of 2011. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul Rooke, for the CEOs quarterly report."

And for now in addition to my new role, I will also be the acting President of ISD to keep the focus on our inkjet initiatives. 
Now let's turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings were better than expected. Reflecting good revenue growth in line with our guidance range, and strong earnings growth exceeding our guidance range. GAAP revenue for the third quarter was $1.02 billion. Revenue excluding acquisition related adjustments was $1.025 billion, up 7% year-to-year. 
For the quarter, hardware revenue was up 10% year-to-year and supplies revenue was up 4% year-to-year. Third quarter '10 earnings per share were $0.90. Excluding restructuring and acquisition related adjustments, earnings per share in the third quarter were $1.09, an increase of 67% year-to-year. Net cash from operations was $130 million in the quarter. 
Now in our Printing Solutions and Services Division, or PSSD, we continue to see strong customer demand for our products and our services, which generated double-digit year-to-year growth in both PSSD hardware and supplies revenue. PSSD third quarter '10 revenue was $731 million, up 12% year-to-year. PSSD operating income, excluding restructuring, was $143 million, up 46% year-to-year. 
Now while PSSD laser units for the quarter grew 5% year-to-year, workgroup laser units and laser MFPs grew over 20% year-to-year, benefiting from our recent product line expansions. This improvement in laser mix toward workgroup products and MFPs resulted in PSSD hardware revenue growth of 19% year-to-year. And during the quarter, we continue to have strong growth year-to-year in our Enterprise Managed Print Services business. 
According to our internal analysis, Lexmark has continued to be #1 in the U.S. printer market in laser product awards received for the first three quarters of 2010. Also, according to IDC data for the first half of 2010, we have continued to gain branded market share in our focused segment of A4 workgroup lasers with a gain of about 190 basis points year-to-year to a share of about 14%. 
Two weeks ago, PSSD introduced a significant expansion of our workgroup color laser product line, including the announcement of the new 50 page a minute X792e color laser MFP. This is a small footprint yet high duty cycle integrated A4 color MFP with optional finishing that will help us strengthen our attack on A3 MFPs. An initial press reviews on the X792e have been very positive and customer interest appears to be strong. 
Let's talk about our Imaging Solutions Division or ISD. In ISD we continue to make progress on the transition of our inkjet focused business customers as we continue to generate ongoing strong growth in high end inkjet unit sales. In the third quarter, ISD revenue was $274 million, about flat sequentially and down 10% year-to-year. ISD operating income excluding restructuring was $35 million, up 3% year-to-year. Now supplies revenue was up slightly sequentially and stronger than the normal sequential trend which is typically down. And slight strong sequential performance, the year-to-year performance was impacted by a tougher compare versus 2Q. 
ISD units for the quarter were down 28% year-to-year as the strong growth and high-end inkjet units was more than offset by the continuing decline of low-end devices. And as unit mix shift to the high end, continues to improve our ISD average unit revenue.  And as a result, the decline in ISD hardware revenue of 15% was less than the overall unit decline. 
And during the quarter we continue to have strong year-to-year growth in the retail sellout of our professional series inkjet units and ongoing strong growth in inkjet sellout revenue in the U.S. office super stores helped by our product line improvements over the last year. 
According to internal analysis, Lexmark is #1 in the U.S. printer market in inkjet product awards, received year-to-date through the first three quarters of 2010. Also according to NPD data for first half '10, Lexmark has continued to gain inkjet market share in U.S. office super stores, almost doubling our share of office super store inkjet units in the above $100 segment to about 11%, making us #2 in this important office super store segment. 
And in the fourth quarter, we're expanding our inkjet distribution in the U.S. with the addition of some SKUs at Best Buy. And just over a week ago, ISD introduced the new Lexmark Genesis inkjet all-in-one, featuring a unique vertical design and a new flash scan camera technology. The new flash scan enables instant scan previews to the color touchscreen and can transfer page from document to digital in as few as 3 seconds. Priced at $399, the Lexmark Genesis will be available early next year and initial press reviews are very positive. 
Now Perceptive Software in the third quarter generated about $14 million in GAAP revenue, excluding acquisition related adjustments, revenue was about $20 million with a strong year-to-year increase in license bookings during the quarter. Now our primary integration focused with Perceptive is the leveraged Lexmark's global infrastructure and lead generation capability to accelerate perceptive's growth. In addition we're working to integrate Lexmark's and Perceptive's technology to provide our industry customers with end-to-end workflow solutions. And overall, our integration plans are on track. 
Now as we look into the fourth quarter of 2010, we're expecting a good quarter with good sequential growth in revenue and operating income but with a tougher year-to-year compare against our unusually strong sequential improvement in fourth quarter of '09. 
Now overall in the fourth quarter we're expecting year-to-year revenue growth in the low single-digit range. We expect fourth quarter GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.96. Fourth quarter '10 EPS excluding restructuring and acquisition related adjustments are expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.13. 
Now looking back to the first three quarters of 2010, we've had strong growth in our revenue and operating income. Excluding acquisition and restructuring adjustments year-to-date, revenue is up 11% year-to-year and operating income is up 79% year-to-year. The strong results had been driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of workgroup lasers and business inkjets and had been enhanced by the many actions we've taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark including: The expansion and strengthening of our product line in PSSD, particularly in color lasers and laser MFPs; the repositioning of ISD, the focus on higher usage, business customers, improving our high-end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales through office super stores; the advancement of our Managed Print Services business and the strengthening of our industry workflow solutions capabilities; and significant changes in our manufacturing and support infrastructure, consolidating, reducing the number of facilities, increasing our usage of shared service centers in low-cost countries to significantly lower our cost and expense structure. 
As a result we made Lexmark a stronger but leaner competitor and improved our capability to compete in the high usage, higher value segments of the market. And despite our expense reductions, we've continue to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. 
Looking forward, in addition to the momentum from our core imaging and printing business, the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of enterprise content management software and will expand and strengthen our industry workflow solutions capability. And together with our Managed Print Services business, Perceptive will be at the center of a strong growing software and services business at Lexmark. 
And as a final point, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with a solid balance sheet and with about $1.1 billion in cash in current marketable securities. I'll now turn it over to John Gamble for his more detailed comments on our financials."

As we announced in the July call, the Perceptive Software acquisition was completed on June 7 and was included in Lexmark's 2Q results and for segment reporting was included in other. Our 2Q '10 financial performance included Perceptive results for only the June 8 to 30 period after the transaction closed. 
Now let me begin with the P&L. I'll start by providing our third quarter 2010 GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $1.020 billion. Gross profit was $361 million. Gross profit margin percent was 35.4%. Operating expense was $268 million. Operating income was $93 million. Net earnings were $72 million, an increase of 622% year-on-year. And earnings per share were $0.90. 
The discussion that follows is on a non-GAAP basis and reflects non-GAAP adjustments unless otherwise noted. Non-GAAP adjustments in 3Q '10 were acquisition related revenue adjustments of $5 million, and total pretax income adjustments of $19 million. The non-GAAP pretax income adjustments of $19 million in 3Q '10 were comprised of $11 million for acquisition related adjustments and $8 million for restructuring related adjustments. As a reminder, included in the supplemental slide deck posted on the Investor Relations section of the Lexmark.com website are schedules detailing the non-GAAP adjustments and reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP measures. 
Non-GAAP total revenue for the quarter was $1.025 billion, up 7% compared to last year, down 1% sequentially from 2Q. The currency impact on Lexmark revenue in 3Q '10 versus 2Q '10 was positive approximately 1% and the currency impact on Lexmark revenue from 3Q '10 versus 3Q '09 was negative approximately 2%. This is the third consecutive quarter of solid revenue growth for Lexmark and was in line with the guidance range we've provided on the July earnings call. 
Hardware revenue growth also significantly exceeded supplies revenue growth as expected versus our expectation at the time we provided our financial guidance in July, which was based on the exchange rates as of June 30, 2010. The impact of currency on revenue was approximately positive 2%. 
Geographically, for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis, U.S. revenue of $468 million grew about 12%. EMEA revenue of $338 million declined about 4%, and the remaining geographies grew about 17% year-over-year. We showed strong growth of 13% in all non-EMEA geographic regions in 3Q, and the weaker EMEA performance significantly impacted by currency. On a constant currency basis, EMEA revenue was up 3% on a year-on-year basis. 
Supplies revenue in the third quarter increased 4% year-to-year. This reflects double-digit percentage growth in PSSD supplies, driven by strong end-user page demand, partially offset by ongoing declines in ISD. Hardware revenue in the third quarter increased 10% year-to-year and declined slightly sequentially. 
As has consistently been the case over the past year, the hardware revenue increase was primarily due to strong growth in Lexmark's strategic segments, our workgroup laser, laser MFPs and high-end inkjets and the associated effect of better unit mix. 
PSSD revenue for the quarter was $731 million, an increase of 12% from the same quarter in 2009 and a decline of 3% sequentially from 2Q '10. The year-to-year increase was driven by improvements in both hardware and supplies revenue. The sequential decline was primarily driven by supplies revenue consistent with historical seasonal patterns. 
PSSD laser hardware units increased 5% in the third quarter versus the prior year with over 20% year-to-year growth in workgroup lasers and laser MFPs. 
Product constraints impacted low-end single function shipments in the quarter, but these constraints were significantly reduced as we exited in September. 
PSSD hardware revenue increased 19% versus 3Q '09. This increase was driven primarily by higher unit volume and favorable workgroup and MFP product mix. PSSD laser hardware average unit revenue increased 14% year-to-year in the third quarter, driven by the positive shift related to workgroup MFP products. 
ISD revenue for the quarter was $274 million, down 10% from the same quarter in 2009 and about flat with 2Q '10. The year-to-year decline was driven primarily by a decline in supplies revenue and to a lesser extent, hardware revenue. 
ISD hardware units decreased 28% year-to-year in the third quarter, reflecting declines in low-end units, partially offset by strong growth in higher-end units as we continue to transition the product line toward higher end devices and higher usage business customers. 
ISD hardware revenue declined 15% in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in hardware revenue was driven primarily by lower hardware unit volume, partially offset by our continuing improved mix toward higher end business class devices.  ISD hardware AUR in the quarter increased 17% versus the prior year, reflecting the positive mix shift in the product line. 
Perceptive Software non-GAAP revenue for the quarter, which is shown in our Other, was $20 million. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for 3Q was 36.5%, up 260 basis points versus the prior year and down 90 basis points sequentially. The 260 basis point third quarter increase versus last year was principally due to a 310 basis point increase in product margins, driven by higher margins in supplies and software. 
This product margin increase was partially offset by a negative mix of relatively more hardware versus supplies and software. Sequentially margins decreased by 90 basis points, reflecting lower product margins. 
Non-GAAP operating expense for the quarter was $262 million, an increase of $13 million versus 3Q '09 and $11 million sequentially. In the quarter, versus both 3Q '09 and 2Q '10, the increase in operating expense is more than explained by the addition of Perceptive Software operating expense. Versus 3Q '09, R&D was about flat. 
SG&A in the quarter was $171 million, up $13 million from 3Q '09. SG&A was up versus 3Q '09 as cost reductions executed during 2009 were offset primarily by the addition of Perceptive Software operating expense, as well as by additional results driven compensation. 
Sequentially operating expense after non-GAAP adjustments increased $11 million versus the second quarter due to an increase in SG&A. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to the addition of perceptive SG&A, as well as currency. 
Non-GAAP operating income in 3Q was $112 million, up $37 million from 3Q '09 and down $24 million sequentially from 2Q '10. The increase in 3Q '10 operating income versus 3Q '09 was driven by higher income in PSSD. The decrease versus 2Q '10 was primarily due to decreased PSSD operating income. 
PSSD, non-GAAP operating income in 3Q '10 of $143 million was up $45 million last versus last year and down $26 million sequentially. This improvement versus last year was driven primarily by higher supplies revenue, as well as lower operating expense. Versus 2Q '10, PSSD operating income was down $26 million, driven by lower supplies revenue. 
ISD non-GAAP operational income in 3Q '10 of $35 million was up $1 million versus last year and $1 million sequentially. 
Other consist of cost related to centralized supply chain, IT and other operating expenses, primarily G&A, as well as the results of Perceptive Software. 
In 3Q '10, Other non-GAAP operating income was negative $65 million. This was $9 million unfavorable to 3Q '09, driven primarily by additional results driven compensation and the addition of Perceptive Software. Sequentially Other segment operating income was $1 million favorable to 2Q '10. 
Non-GAAP operating income margin in 3Q was 10.9%, an increase of 310 basis points from the third quarter of 2009 and a decrease of 220 basis points sequentially both in line with our expectations. 
Concerning financing and non-operating costs, in the third quarter of 2010, the net interest and Other was an expense of $6 million, down from $11 million net expense in the third quarter of 2009 and flat with the second quarter of 2010. 3Q '10 was favorable year-on-year primarily due to a $3 million charge incurred in 3Q '09 for the write-down of an equity investment. 
Our effective tax rate in 3Q '10 was 17.7%. This was lower than the 24.6% we saw in 2Q '10 and lower than our expected tax rate of 24%, driven primarily by discrete items, reflecting the impacts of tax audits in 3Q '10, as well as a reduction in our expected full-year 2010 effective tax rate to 23%. 
The expected 2010 tax rate of 23% excludes discrete items, as well as assumes, the R&D tax credit is not renewed. As of September 30, the U.S. R&D tax credit had not been reinstated for 2010. 
Non-GAAP net earnings for the quarter were $87 million. 3Q '09 non-GAAP net earnings were $51 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.09 per share. This compares to 3Q '09 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65. 
Now moving to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $130 million compared to $147 million on 3Q '09 and $91 million in 2Q '10. Since the end of June 2010, accounts receivable decreased $11 million, inventory increased $53 million, accounts payable increased $8 million, and accrued liabilities increased $57 million. 
The factors impacting our sequential inventory increase were: First, increases in component finished goods and pipeline inventory related to catching rapidly increasing demand and alleviating the product constraints we have incurred over the first 9 months of 2010; second, an increase in in-process shipped inventory due to a sequentially higher number of enterprise shipments underway at the end of 3Q or units needed to be shipped in early 4Q; and third, some areas of excess inventory we would like to work off going forward. 
The increase in accrued liabilities was principally driven by increased accrued compensation, interest and taxes payable. 
In 3Q '10, we saw a slight decline in our cash cycle performance, driven by our increased inventory. However, we saw significant improvement versus last year. As we have discussed in the past, improving cash cycle is a significant focus for us, with a specific focus on improving inventory performance while improving product availability and customer satisfaction. 
For the quarter, capital spending was $28 million, depreciation in the quarter was $51 million. Cash and current marketable securities at the end of 3Q '10 was $1.1 billion, the significant majority of which is outside the U.S. and was up $113 million since June 2010 driven by operating results. 
Total long-term debt at the end of 3Q '10 remained at $615 million, with maturities on the debt in 2013 and 2018. At quarter end, we had $491 million of share repurchase authority outstanding. No shares repurchased in the quarter. 
Now for my forward-looking comments concerning 4Q '10. We expect fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP revenue to grow in the low single-digit percentage range year-over-year. The hardware revenue growth rate is again expected to significantly outpace the supplies revenue growth rate. GAAP EPS in 4Q '10 is expected to be $0.86 to $0.96, GAAP EPS in 4Q '09 was $0.76. 
In 4Q '10, non-GAAP adjustments to revenue were expected to be $4 million, and to EPS are expected to be $0.17, comprised of acquisition related adjustments of $0.09 per share and restructuring related adjustments of approximately $0.08 per share.  Non-GAAP 4Q '10 EPS is expected to be $1.03 to $1.13 per share. Non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.16 per share. 
The guidance provided is on a non-GAAP basis and its based on foreign exchange rates as of 9/30/10. At these exchange rates, the currency impact on revenue in 4Q '10 versus 3Q '10 is positive approximately 2%. The currency impact on revenue of 4Q '10 versus 4Q '09 is negative approximately 2%. The 4Q '10 sequential revenue growth is approximately consistent with our normal sequential trend. 
In the fourth quarter we expect gross profit margin percentage to be down versus the 36.5% we achieved in 3Q '10, reflecting a higher mix of hardware. Operating expense is expected to be up slightly from the $262 million incurred in 3Q '10. Operating income margin in the fourth quarter is expected to be above the 10.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2010. 
For 4Q 2010, we expect our ongoing effective tax rate to be about 23%. This reflects the fact that the R&D tax credit has expired as of January 1, 2010, and has not yet been extended. For the full year of 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be 23% before any discrete items, assuming that the R&D tax credit will not be reinstated for 2010.  Should the R&D credit be reinstated, we expect the full year of 2010 tax rate of approximately 22% before discrete items. 
We project full year 2010 capital spending to be approximately $160 million and we expect full-year depreciation to be approximately $195 million, including the $6 million impact of accelerated depreciation related to facility closures. 
With regard to our announced restructurings, we continue to expect the overall cost in savings generated from the restructuring programs announced in April and October 2009 to be approximately the same as discussed last quarter. The April '09 restructuring program was principally completed at the end of 3Q '10. The October '09 restructuring program is expected to be principally completed in first half 2011. 
In 3Q '10, restructuring cash outflow was $14 million, and savings from our 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions were $62 million. Savings in 4Q '10 from the 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructurings are expected to be about $64 million. 
Our performance in 3Q '10 continued to be very strong, as our performance throughout 2010. Based on the midpoint of our revenue guidance for 4Q '10, full year 2010 non-GAAP revenue of about $4.2 billion should grow approximately 8% versus 2009. 
Based on our 4Q guidance, we are raising our full-year non-GAAP operating margin guidance for 2010 from 11.6% to between 12% and 12.5%. Our non-GAAP EPS should be $4.70 to $4.80 per share, representing growth of over 40% versus 2009. 
With that, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions."

And I think that sequential uplift certainly reflects the workgroup lasers that we're bringing in to the market right now, as well as the announcement we just had with the inkjet products into Best Buy as well. So those things figure in. In terms of what we're seeing on a year-to-year basis, we are expecting again good sequential improvement, but the year-to-year is a much tougher compare against the unusual sequential performance we saw in the third quarter, fourth quarter 2009 as we came out of the economic downturn, and that's the reason for the guidance."

In terms of the product margins, what I would tell you is that in the third quarter what we saw in product margins was actually better than what we had expected. And that was due basically to the hardware mix, as well as the hardware margins themselves. As we move forward in time, we're obviously expecting to see more promotional activity because we now caught up on our laser products. Also what figures a little bit into our fourth quarter guidance is mix, mix of inkjet versus laser, mix of color versus mono. All of which will put a little bit more pressure on these promotions on the hardware margins. But again we're expecting good performance in our strategic segments of workgroup lasers and the high-end inkjets. So strategically, things are looking good, certainly in the third quarter, expecting to be very good in the fourth quarter. And I'll let Paul Rooke to talk about competitive landscape."

There are trends out there, as you mentioned, the e-print trends, some app trends and so forth. And I just point out that e-print is basically printing through a cloud. It's kind of a subset of all the things you can do through the cloud, and we're certainly focused on that. In fact we've been doing things through the cloud for several years now in terms of our solutions and services that we provide to our customers. So we're looking at, really, from a broader perspective, a broader opportunity of doing things through the cloud for our customers. The applications, as you mentioned, both on the laser side and on the inkjet side with SmartSolutions are an exciting thing for us. It's been what's differentiated as for many years now and continues to differentiate us in our work plus [ph] solutions as we were able to customize for a specific customers.

We -- certainly a portion of the increase was related to making sure that we were able to meet the demand that was coming in the fourth quarter and that we had as we saw the third quarter. The demand that we talked about in terms of shipments that were going out in the third quarter and early fourth quarter are just related to the strong growth we've seen in workgroup product and MFPs, consistently throughout the year. So it's just the timing of it. It might have been a little bit later, but it's just relative to the very good performance we've seen throughout the year and that we've been consistent with. We certainly have several areas where we think our inventory can improve. The increased inventory levels were relatively -- were fairly broad, so we think we have a good opportunity to try to work, to try to take inventory levels down, as we work toward to the fourth quarter."

The metrics look weaker but underneath, and I'll give you a little color on that, the core strategic metrics remain strong. So you shouldn't interpret it as a change in the trend here as we go quarter-to-quarter. And a lot of it was due to the easier compare that we mentioned in 2Q. Let me break it in a couple of pieces. The hardware piece, underneath our high-end inkjets, we are seeing growth in double digits. You see that in our AUR numbers, they're up 17% there in the third quarter. At the same time, we are dropping some more of the low end, we're exiting some mass distribution that was still there, so that's making its way into our numbers. We're also a little less promotional on some of the low-end products as well, so that's affecting the mix. But the mix is moving in the right direction, which is the strategic point here. And we're encouraged with our technology, the new technology we now
[Audio Gap] 
last fall and now extending it with Genesis is being received very well. As we mentioned the awards numbers, as well as the channel shifts that we're seeing from mass into OSS, now the #2 greater than $100 inkjet provider there in OSS and entrees into places like Best Buy. So that's really encouraging for us to see the acceptance of the technology that we're bringing, and more to come. On the supply side, we mentioned we had a sequential slight increase sequentially, which was very encouraging for us because typically that's been down sequentially in past years. So in fact, the branded piece of our business was actually better than our OEM, a little more softness in the OEM side. And as I mentioned, the swing we had last year form 2Q to 3Q is making the compare tougher. So when you add all that up, well on the surface the metrics look weaker. The core strategic metrics are actually quite strong. And if you back up, just to look at the overall trend year-to-date both in hardware and supplies, if you compare year-to-date last year versus year-to-date this year, last year we were clearly minus double digits both hardware and supplies. This year, we're certainly minus single digits in both. So the trend is changing, and it's moving in the right direction. Obviously I'd like it to be faster but we're moving and it is moving, and so we're encouraged."

At the surface it actually feels like there was a pretty pronounced change in the demand environment in the quarter relative to your expectations. Adjusting for currency were at the very low-end of your revenue guidance of 5%, you said mid to high single digits, you're typically pretty conservative. You built inventory and you went from having the biggest backlog in history to potentially having somewhat of a surplus, and it sounds like all of the backlog at the high-end has basically been gone. So I was wondering if you could really address the demand situation, perhaps linearity in the quarter and why these collective factors don't suggest and point to the fact that you've seen a change in demand at least relative to your expectations going into the quarter. And I have a follow-up."

First, that in our projections for the quarter, we expected to catch a big piece of the backlog so that's not new news. What happened as we looked at the revenue, currently, we said mid to high single digit. We came in right in line with that. Your point is well taken with currency, that probably would have pushed us up towards the higher end, and we didn't see that. And so the reality is we were a little weaker in a couple of places. The first thing for us is Europe was weaker than expected, still had constant currency growth in Europe but certainly weaker than expected and weaker than what we have seen in the first half. Second thing is, as I mentioned a minute ago, there were a couple of deals in enterprise. We hope to get into the quarter. That has been in our outlook that slipped out. But again the enterprise outlook in the fourth quarter is really quite good. And the third thing is, and Paul Rooke mentioned it, the OEM supplies in inkjet a little weaker than what we had expected. But if we look at the, again, the core metrics, these strategic metrics on the enterprise, workgroup places continue to be very, very strong, management services continue to be very strong on a year-over-year basis. And we currently -- on the inventory side, we're charging ahead of where we projected demand because we have not been able to catch it for months and months and months. So we took aggressive action there. And we knew that there was a risk we would overshoot potentially, and we saw a little bit of that. But much of that increase is in the core policy and run rate stuff we need. So a lot of that core increase, some of that will stay, some of that we will work off. But we're not upset over having to work off a little bit. We're much happier to have caught it because from a customer standpoint, we really did need to get this caught up. So we think overall workgroup basis continue to be quite strong, as I said high-end inkjets also quite strong. And we see -- we have good expectations in the fourth quarter as well."

And so I don't think that's unusual for Lexmark versus other companies. But I would tell you that this has been a long planned process that the intent for me to retire is in the spring of next year. Your question as to why do we do it now? Well we need to do a transition and we need to make that public so that Paul and I can work out in the open. Our decision to do it before the yearend, primarily revolves around the making decisions on the 2011 plan that I thought and the board thought that it would be a positive to have the new CEO own the 2011 plan and decision set around that.  And so to be able to do that, we needed to make a change at the end of the third quarter. And so that's why we did it. I mean we could have announced it and left me in charge versus Paul in charge. But the reality is, we've been making decisions that clearly affect what he is going to be doing as he goes forward in time. So it's my personal view that the right way to do a transition like this is to put the new guy in charge. I'm still here. I can help him with the transition. But these were the factors that went in to it. But there's nothing abrupt here certainly from an internal perspective. And again I see a lot of other companies do it just this way."

Our third quarter earnings were reflecting good revenue growth, in line with our guidance range and strong year-to-year earnings growth, exceeding our guidance range. Excluding restructuring acquisition related adjustments, revenue for the third quarter was up 7% year-to-year with 12% growth in PSSD, driven by 19% growth in laser hardware and double-digit growth in laser supplies revenue. 
Earnings per share excluding restructuring acquisition related adjustments were $1.9, an increase of 67% year-to-year and year-to-date through the third quarter revenue was up 11% year-to-year. And earnings per share were $3.67, up 75% year-to-year. 
This strong year-to-date results have been driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of workgroup lasers and business inkjets and enhanced by the many actions we've taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark. 
For example: We've expanded and strengthened our laser product line; we're repositioning our inkjet business to focus on higher usage business customers improving our high-end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales throughout the super stores; we've advanced our solutions in Managed Print Services business, delivering value to our software and services to help our industry customers reduce cost and improve their productivity; we've reduced our cost and expense infrastructure, consolidating and reducing the number of manufacturing facilities and leveraging shared service centers in low-cost countries; and inspite our expense reductions, we have continued to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. 
And looking forward in additions to momentum from our core imaging and printing business, the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of enterprise content management software and will expand in strength in our industry workflow solutions capability.  Together with our Managed Print Services business, Perceptive will be at the center of a strong growing software and services business at Lexmark. 
Our outlook for fourth quarter of '10 is for a good sequential growth in revenue and operating income but with a tougher year-to-year compare against unusually strong sequential improvement from 3Q to 4Q in 2009.

As part of the planned succession process, I have assumed the role of Executive Chairman effective today. I would like to invite everyone on the call to join me in congratulating Paul Rooke on his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of Lexmark. I have known and worked with Paul for over 20 years and throughout his career, he has demonstrated tremendous leadership, strategic thinking and operational ability. 
Paul has been with the company since its inception in 1991. He has run both of our Printer divisions, PSSD and ISD, and has been involved in all aspects of our business and has participated in the formulation of all of our key strategic initiatives. He is well respected by our employees, our customers and our investors. I have great confidence in Paul Rooke and I'm confident that he is the right person to lead Lexmark forward. 
My 19 years with Lexmark, including 12 years as Lexmark's CEO, has been an incredibly rewarding experience. But I have a long time personal goal to retire early and this feels like an appropriate time to make the transition. 
We have a very strong executive team at Lexmark, with a lot of experience and continuity. Our business is seeing a positive impact from the key strategic investments in technology, solutions and services that we've made over the last 4 to 5 years. We're seeing strong customer demand for our management services, our industry workflow solutions, our work group, laser products and MFPs and our high-end inkjet devices. 
Now with the addition of Perceptive Software and our increased investments there, our future is focused on building a strong, growing core of software solutions and services to complement our strong sales at workgroup lasers and high-end inkjet devices and to drive Lexmark's long-term success. I think that this is an extraordinary and exciting time for our company. 
In the near term, I will continue as Chairman of the Board of Directors. In my role as Executive Chairman, I will assist with the leadership transition and continue to assist the Perceptive Software team with their integration activities. I plan to retire from the Lexmark Board of Directors and as Executive Chairman in the spring of 2011. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul Rooke, for the CEOs quarterly report."

I want to thank you for your support and confidence in me. I'm honored and humbled to be serving as Lexmark's third CEO. Lexmark will turn 20 years old next March, and I'm excited about the chance to lead a talented Lexmark team into the years ahead. And for now in addition to my new role, I will also be the acting President of ISD to keep the focus on our inkjet initiatives. 
Now let's turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings were better than expected, reflecting good revenue growth in line with our guidance range, and strong earnings growth exceeding our guidance range. GAAP revenue for the third quarter was $1.02 billion. Revenue excluding acquisition-related adjustments was $1.025 billion, up 7% year-to-year. 
Before the quarter, hardware revenue was up 10% year-to-year and supplies revenue was up 4% year-to-year. Third quarter '10 earnings per share were $0.90. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related adjustments, earnings per share in the third quarter were $1.09, an increase of 67% year-to-year. Net cash from operations was $130 million in the quarter. 
Now in our Printing Solutions and Services Division, or PSSD, we continue to see strong customer demand for our products and our services, which generated double-digit year-to-year growth in both PSSD hardware and supplies revenue. PSSD third quarter '10 revenue was $731 million, up 12% year-to-year. PSSD operating income, excluding restructuring, was $143 million, up 46% year-to-year. 
Now while PSSD laser units for the quarter grew 5% year-to-year, workgroup laser units and laser MFPs grew over 20% year-to-year, benefiting from our recent product line expansions. This improvement in laser mix toward workgroup products and MFPs resulted in PSSD hardware revenue growth of 19% year-to-year. And during the quarter, we continue to have strong growth year-to-year in our Enterprise Managed Print Services business. 
According to our internal analysis, Lexmark has continued to be #1 in the U.S. printer market in laser product awards received through the first three quarters of 2010. Also, according to IDC data for the first half of 2010, we have continued to gain branded market share in our focused segment of A4 workgroup lasers with a gain of about 190 basis points year-to-year to a share of about 14%. 
Now 2 weeks ago, PSSD introduced a significant expansion of our workgroup color laser product line, including the announcement of the new 50 page a minute X792e color laser MFP. This is a small footprint yet high duty cycle integrated A4 color MFP with optional finishing that will help us strengthen our attack on A3 MFPs. And initial press reviews on the X792e have been very positive and customer interest appears to be strong. 
Let's talk about our Imaging Solutions Division, or ISD. In ISD we continue to make progress on the transition of our inkjet focus to business customers as we continue to generate ongoing strong growth in high end inkjet unit sales. In the third quarter, ISD revenue was $274 million, about flat sequentially and down 10% year-to-year. ISD operating income excluding restructuring was $35 million, up 3% year-to-year. Now supplies revenue was up slightly sequentially and stronger than the normal sequential trend which is typically down. And slight strong sequential performance, the year-to-year performance, was impacted by a tougher compare versus 2Q. 
ISD units for the quarter were down 28% year-to-year as the strong growth and high-end inkjet units was more than offset by the continuing decline of low-end devices. Now this unit mix shift to the high end continues to improve our ISD average unit revenue.  And as a result, the decline in ISD hardware revenue of 15% was less than the overall unit decline. 
And during the quarter we continue to have strong year-to-year growth in the retail sellout of our professional series inkjet units and ongoing strong growth in inkjet sellout revenue in the U.S. office super stores helped by our product line improvements over the last year. 
According to our internal analysis, Lexmark is #1 in the U.S. printer market in inkjet product awards received year-to-date through the first three quarters of 2010. Also according to NPD data for first half '10, Lexmark has continued to gain inkjet market share in U.S. office super stores, almost doubling our share of office super store inkjet units in the above $100 segment to about 11%, making us #2 in this important office super store segment. 
And in the fourth quarter, we're expanding our inkjet distribution in the U.S. with the addition of some SKUs at Best Buy. And just over a week ago, ISD introduced the new Lexmark Genesis inkjet all-in-one, featuring our unique vertical design and a new flash scan camera technology. The new flash scan enables instant scan previews to the color touchscreen and can transfer a page from document to digital in as few as 3 seconds. Priced at $399, the Lexmark Genesis will be available early next year and initial press reviews are very positive. 
Now Perceptive Software in the third quarter generated about $14 million in GAAP revenue, excluding acquisition-related adjustments, revenue was about $20 million with a strong year-to-year increase in license bookings during the quarter. Now our primary integration focus with Perceptive is the leveraged Lexmark's global infrastructure and lead generation capability to accelerate perceptive's growth. In addition, we're working to integrate Lexmark's and Perceptive's technology to provide our industry customers with end-to-end workflow solutions. And overall, our integration plans are on track. 
Now as we look into the fourth quarter of 2010, we're expecting a good quarter with good sequential growth in revenue and operating income but with a tougher year-to-year compare against our unusually strong sequential improvement in fourth quarter of '09. 
Now overall in the fourth quarter we're expecting year-to-year revenue growth in the low single-digit range. We expect fourth quarter GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.96. Fourth quarter '10 EPS excluding restructuring and acquisition-related adjustments are expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.13. 
Now looking back through the first three quarters of 2010, we've had strong growth in our revenue and operating income. Excluding acquisition and restructuring adjustments year-to-date, revenue is up 11% year-to-year and operating income is up 79% year-to-year. These strong results had been driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of workgroup lasers and business inkjets and have been enhanced by the many actions we've taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark, including: The expansion and strengthening of our product line in PSSD, particularly in color lasers and laser MFPs; the repositioning of ISD, the focus on higher usage, business customers, improving our high-end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales through office super stores; the advancement of our Managed Print Services business and the strengthening of our industry workflow solutions capabilities; and significant changes in our manufacturing and support infrastructure, consolidating, reducing the number of facilities, increasing our usage of shared service centers in low-cost countries to significantly lower our cost and expense structure. 
As a result, we made Lexmark a stronger but leaner competitor and improved our capability to compete in the high usage, higher value segments of the market. And despite our expense reductions, we've continue to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. 
Looking forward, in addition to the momentum from our core imaging and printing business, the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of enterprise content management software and will expand and strengthen our industry workflow solutions capability. And together with our Managed Print Services business, Perceptive will be at the center of a strong growing software and services business at Lexmark. 
And as a final point, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with a solid balance sheet and with about $1.1 billion in cash in current marketable securities. I'll now turn it over to John Gamble for his more detailed comments on our financials."

Consistent with previous calls, I'll discuss our results of the third quarter of 2010 relative to the prior year then relative to the second quarter of 2010. I'll then discuss selected changes in the balance sheet and certain items of cash flow. Finally, I'll finish with more detail regarding our guidance for the fourth quarter. 
As we announced in the July call, the Perceptive Software acquisition was completed on June 7 and was included in Lexmark's 2Q results and for segment reporting was included in other. Our 2Q '10 financial performance included Perceptive results for only the June 8 to 30 period after the transaction closed. 
Now let me begin with the P&L. I'll start by providing our third quarter 2010 GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $1.020 billion. Gross profit was $361 million. Gross profit margin percent was 35.4%. Operating expense was $268 million. Operating income was $93 million. Net earnings were $72 million, an increase of 622% year-on-year. And earnings per share were $0.90. 
The discussion that follows is on a non-GAAP basis and reflects non-GAAP adjustments unless otherwise noted. Non-GAAP adjustments in 3Q '10 were acquisition-related revenue adjustments of $5 million, and total pretax income adjustments of $19 million. The non-GAAP pretax income adjustments of $19 million in 3Q '10 were comprised of $11 million for acquisition-related adjustments and $8 million for restructuring-related adjustments. As a reminder, included in the supplemental slide deck posted on the Investor Relations section of the Lexmark.com website are schedules detailing the non-GAAP adjustments and reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP measures. 
Non-GAAP total revenue for the quarter was $1.025 billion, up 7% compared to last year, down 1% sequentially from 2Q. The currency impact on Lexmark revenue in 3Q '10 versus 2Q '10 was positive approximately 1% and the currency impact on Lexmark revenue from 3Q '10 versus 3Q '09 was negative approximately 2%. This is the third consecutive quarter of solid revenue growth for Lexmark and was in line with the guidance range we've provided on the July earnings call. 
Hardware revenue growth also significantly exceeded supplies revenue growth as expected. Versus our expectation at the time we provided our financial guidance in July, which was based on the exchange rates as of June 30, 2010, the impact of currency on revenue was approximately positive 2%. 
Geographically, for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis, U.S. revenue of $468 million grew about 12%. EMEA revenue of $338 million declined about 4%, and the remaining geographies grew about 17% year-over-year. We showed strong growth of 13% in all non-EMEA geographic regions in 3Q, and the weaker EMEA performance significantly impacted by currency. On a constant currency basis, EMEA revenue was up 3% on a year-on-year basis. 
Supplies revenue in the third quarter increased 4% year-to-year. This reflects double-digit percentage growth in PSSD supplies, driven by strong end-user page demand, partially offset by ongoing declines in ISD. Hardware revenue in the third quarter increased 10% year-to-year and declined slightly sequentially. 
As has consistently been the case over the past year, the hardware revenue increase was primarily due to strong growth in Lexmark's strategic segments, the workgroup laser, laser MFPs and high-end inkjets and the associated effect of better unit mix. 
PSSD revenue for the quarter was $731 million, an increase of 12% from the same quarter in 2009 and a decline of 3% sequentially from 2Q '10. The year-to-year increase was driven by improvements in both hardware and supplies revenue. The sequential decline was primarily driven by supplies revenue consistent with historical seasonal patterns. 
PSSD laser hardware units increased 5% in the third quarter versus the prior year with over 20% year-to-year growth in workgroup lasers and laser MFPs. 
Product constraints impacted low-end single function shipments in the quarter, but these constraints were significantly reduced as we exited September. 
PSSD hardware revenue increased 19% versus 3Q '09. This increase was driven primarily by higher unit volume and favorable workgroup and MFP product mix. PSSD laser hardware average unit revenue increased 14% year-to-year in the third quarter, driven by the positive shift related to workgroup MFP products. 
ISD revenue for the quarter was $274 million, down 10% from the same quarter in 2009 and about flat with 2Q '10. The year-to-year decline was driven primarily by a decline in supplies revenue and to a lesser extent, hardware revenue. 
ISD hardware units decreased 28% year-to-year in the third quarter, reflecting declines in low-end units, partially offset by strong growth in higher-end units as we continue to transition the product line toward higher end devices and higher usage business customers. 
ISD hardware revenue declined 15% in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in hardware revenue was driven primarily by lower hardware unit volume, partially offset by our continuing improved mix toward higher end business class devices.  ISD hardware AUR in the quarter increased 17% versus the prior year, reflecting the positive mix shift in the product line. 
Perceptive Software non-GAAP revenue for the quarter, which is shown in our Other, was $20 million. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for 3Q was 36.5%, up 260 basis points versus the prior year and down 90 basis points sequentially. The 260 basis point third quarter increase versus last year was principally due to a 310 basis point increase in product margins, driven by higher margins in supplies and software. 
This product margin increase was partially offset by a negative mix of relatively more hardware versus supplies and software. Sequentially, margins decreased by 90 basis points reflecting lower product margins. 
Non-GAAP operating expense for the quarter was $262 million, an increase of $13 million versus 3Q '09 and $11 million sequentially. In the quarter, versus both 3Q '09 and 2Q '10, the increase in operating expense is more than explained by the addition of Perceptive Software operating expense. Versus 3Q '09, R&D was about flat. 
SG&A in the quarter was $171 million, up $13 million from 3Q '09. SG&A was up versus 3Q '09 as cost reductions executed during 2009 were offset primarily by the addition of Perceptive Software operating expense, as well as by additional results-driven compensation. 
Sequentially operating expense after non-GAAP adjustments increased $11 million versus the second quarter due to an increase in SG&A. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to the addition of perceptive SG&A, as well as currency. 
Non-GAAP operating income in 3Q was $112 million, up $37 million from 3Q '09 and down $24 million sequentially from 2Q '10. The increase in 3Q '10 operating income versus 3Q '09 was driven by higher income in PSSD. The decrease versus 2Q '10 was primarily due to decreased PSSD operating income. 
PSSD, non-GAAP operating income in 3Q '10 of $143 million was up $45 million versus last year and down $26 million sequentially. This improvement versus last year was driven primarily by higher supplies revenue, as well as lower operating expense. Versus 2Q '10, PSSD operating income was down $26 million, driven by lower supplies revenue. 
ISD non-GAAP operational income in 3Q '10 of $35 million was up $1 million versus last year and $1 million sequentially. 
Other consist of cost related to centralized supply chain, IT and other operating expenses, primarily G&A, as well as the results of Perceptive Software. 
In 3Q '10, Other non-GAAP operating income was negative $65 million. This was $9 million unfavorable to 3Q '09, driven primarily by additional results-driven compensation and the addition of Perceptive Software. Sequentially Other segment operating income was $1 million favorable to 2Q '10. 
Non-GAAP operating income margin in 3Q was 10.9%, an increase of 310 basis points from the third quarter of 2009 and a decrease of 220 basis points sequentially both in line with our expectations. 
Concerning financing and non-operating costs, in the third quarter of 2010, the net interest and Other was an expense of $6 million, down from $11 million net expense in the third quarter of 2009 and flat with the second quarter of 2010. 3Q '10 was favorable year-on-year primarily due to a $3 million charge incurred in 3Q '09 for the write-down of an equity investment. 
Our effective tax rate in 3Q '10 was 17.7%. This was lower than the 24.6% we saw in 2Q '10 and lower than our expected tax rate of 24%, driven primarily by discrete items, reflecting the impacts of tax audits in 3Q '10, as well as a reduction in our expected full-year 2010 effective tax rate to 23%. 
The expected 2010 tax rate of 23% excludes discrete items, as well as assumes the R&D tax credit is not renewed. As of September 30, the U.S. R&D tax credit had not been reinstated for 2010. 
Non-GAAP net earnings for the quarter were $87 million. 3Q '09 non-GAAP net earnings were $51 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.09 per share. This compares to 3Q '09 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65. 
Now moving to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $130 million compared to $147 million in 3Q '09 and $91 million in 2Q '10. Since the end of June 2010, accounts receivable decreased $11 million, inventory increased $53 million, accounts payable increased $8 million, and accrued liabilities increased $57 million. 
The factors impacting our sequential inventory increase were: First, increases in component finished goods and pipeline inventory related to catching rapidly increasing demand and alleviating the product constraints we have incurred over the first 9 months of 2010; second, an increase in in-process shipped inventory due to a sequentially higher number of enterprise shipments underway at the end of 3Q or units needed to be shipped in early 4Q; and third, some areas of excess inventory we would like to work off going forward. 
The increase in accrued liabilities was principally driven by increased accrued compensation, interest and taxes payable. 
In 3Q '10, we saw a slight decline in our cash cycle performance, driven by our increased inventory. However, we saw significant improvement versus last year. As we have discussed in the past, improving cash cycle is a significant focus for us, with a specific focus on improving inventory performance while improving product availability and customer satisfaction. 
For the quarter, capital spending was $28 million, depreciation in the quarter was $51 million. Cash and current marketable securities at the end of 3Q '10 was $1.1 billion, the significant majority of which is outside the U.S. and was up $113 million since June 2010 driven by operating results. 
Total long-term debt at the end of 3Q '10 remained at $615 million, with maturities on the debt in 2013 and 2018. At quarter end, we had $491 million of share repurchase authority outstanding. No shares repurchased in the quarter. 
Now for my forward-looking comments concerning 4Q '10. We expect fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP revenue to grow in the low single-digit percentage range year-over-year. The hardware revenue growth rate is again expected to significantly outpace the supplies revenue growth rate. GAAP EPS in 4Q '10 is expected to be $0.86 to $0.96. GAAP EPS in 4Q '09 was $0.76. 
In 4Q '10, non-GAAP adjustments to revenue were expected to be $4 million, and to EPS are expected to be $0.17, comprised of acquisition-related adjustments of $0.09 per share and restructuring-related adjustments of approximately $0.08 per share.  Non-GAAP 4Q '10 EPS is expected to be $1.03 to $1.13 per share. Non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.16 per share. 
The guidance provided is on a non-GAAP basis and is based on foreign exchange rates as of 9/30/10. At these exchange rates, the currency impact on revenue in 4Q '10 versus 3Q '10 is positive approximately 2%. The currency impact on revenue of 4Q '10 versus 4Q '09 is negative approximately 2%. The 4Q '10 sequential revenue growth is approximately consistent with our normal sequential trend. 
In the fourth quarter we expect gross profit margin percentage to be down versus the 36.5% we achieved in 3Q '10, reflecting a higher mix of hardware. Operating expense is expected to be up slightly from the $262 million incurred in 3Q '10. Operating income margin in the fourth quarter is expected to be above the 10.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2010. 
For 4Q 2010, we expect our ongoing effective tax rate to be about 23%. This reflects the fact that the R&D tax credit has expired as of January 1, 2010, and has not yet been extended. For the full year of 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be 23% before any discrete items, assuming that the R&D tax credit will not be reinstated for 2010.  Should the R&D credit be reinstated, we expect the full year of 2010 tax rate of approximately 22% before discrete items. 
We project full year 2010 capital spending to be approximately $160 million and we expect full-year depreciation to be approximately $195 million, including the $6 million impact of accelerated depreciation related to facility closures. 
With regard to our announced restructurings, we continue to expect the overall cost in savings generated from the restructuring programs announced in April and October 2009 to be approximately the same as discussed last quarter. The April '09 restructuring program was principally completed at the end of 3Q '10. The October '09 restructuring program is expected to be principally completed in first half 2011. 
In 3Q '10, restructuring cash outflow was $14 million, and savings from our 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions were $62 million. Savings in 4Q '10 from the 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructurings are expected to be about $64 million. 
Our performance in 3Q '10 continue to be very strong, as has our performance throughout 2010. Based on the midpoint of our revenue guidance for 4Q '10, full year 2010 non-GAAP revenue of about $4.2 billion should grow approximately 8% versus 2009. 
Based on our 4Q guidance, we are raising our full-year non-GAAP operating margin guidance for 2010 from 11.6% to between 12% and 12.5%. Our non-GAAP EPS should be $4.70 to $4.80 per share, representing growth of over 40% versus 2009. 
With that, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions."

In terms of the product margins, what I would tell you is that in the third quarter what we saw in product margins was actually better than what we had expected. And that was just due basically to the hardware mix, as well as the hardware margins themselves. As we move forward in time, we're obviously expecting to see more promotional activity because we now have caught up on our laser products. Also what figures a little bit into our fourth quarter guidance is mix, mix of inkjet versus laser, mix of color versus mono, all of which will put a little bit more pressure on with these promotions on the hardware margins. But again we're expecting good performance in our strategic segments of workgroup lasers and the high-end inkjets. So strategically, things are looking good, certainly in the third quarter, expecting to be very good in the fourth quarter. And I'll let Paul Rooke talk about competitive landscape."

And so despite the competitive landscape that's out there, we are making progress and that's comforting to us because it just shows an increased customer acceptance of the solutions and services we're bringing. There are trends out there, as you mentioned, the e-print trends, some app trends and so forth. And I just point out that e-print is basically printing through a cloud. It's kind of a subset of all the things you can do through the cloud, and we're certainly focused on that. In fact we've been doing things through the cloud for several years now in terms of our solutions and services that we provide to our customers. So we're looking at, really -- looking at it really from a broader perspective, a broader opportunity of doing things through the cloud for our customers. The applications, as you mentioned, both on the laser side and on the inkjet side with SmartSolutions are an exciting thing for us. It's been what's differentiated as for many years now and continues to differentiate us in our work plus [ph] solutions as we were able to customize for a specific customers.

In terms of the inventory position, it's really what I described in my comments. Right? We -- certainly a portion of the increase was related to making sure that we were able to meet the demand that was coming in the fourth quarter and that we had as we saw the third quarter. The demand that we talked about in terms of shipments that were going out in the third quarter and early fourth quarter are just related to the strong growth we've seen in workgroup product and MFPs, consistently throughout the year. So it's just the timing of it. It might have been a little bit later, but it's just relative to the very good performance we've seen throughout the year and that we've been consistent with. We certainly have several areas where we think our inventory can improve. The increased inventory levels were relatively -- were fairly broad, so we think we have a good opportunity to try to work, to try to take inventory levels down, as we work through the fourth quarter."

The metrics look weaker but underneath, and I'll give you a little color on that, the core strategic metrics remain strong. So you shouldn't interpret it as a change in the trend here as we go quarter-to-quarter. And a lot of it was due to the easier compare that we mentioned in 2Q. Let me break it in a couple of pieces. The hardware piece, underneath our high-end inkjets, we are seeing growth in double digits. You see that in our AUR numbers, they're up 17% there in the third quarter. At the same time, we are dropping some more of the low end, we're exiting some mass distribution that was still there, so that's making its way into our numbers. We're also a little less promotional on some of the low-end products as well, so that's affecting the mix. But the mix is moving in the right direction, which is the strategic point here. And we're encouraged with our technology, the new technology we now
[Audio Gap] 
last fall and now extending it with Genesis is being received very well. As we mentioned the awards numbers, as well as the channel shifts that we're seeing from mass into OSS, now the #2 greater than $100 inkjet provider there in OSS and entries into places like Best Buy. So that's really encouraging for us to see the acceptance of the technology that we're bringing, and more to come. On the supply side, we mentioned we had a sequential -- slight increase sequentially, which was very encouraging for us because typically that's been down sequentially in past years. So in effect, the branded piece of our business was actually better than our OEM. We had a little more softness in the OEM side. And as I mentioned, the swing we had last year form 2Q to 3Q is making the compare tougher. So when you add all that up, while on the surface the metrics look weaker, the core strategic metrics are actually quite strong. And if you back up, just and look at the overall trend year-to-date both in hardware and supplies, if you compare year-to-date last year versus year-to-date this year, last year we were clearly minus double digits both hardware and supplies. This year, we're certainly minus single digits in both. So the trend is changing, and it's moving in the right direction. Obviously I'd like it to be faster but we're moving and it is moving, and so we're encouraged."

At the surface it actually feels like there was a pretty pronounced change in the demand environment in the quarter relative to your expectations. Adjusting for currency you're at the very low-end of your revenue guidance of 5%, you said mid- to high-single digits, you're typically pretty conservative. You've built inventory and you went from having the biggest backlog in history to potentially having somewhat of a surplus, and it sounds like all of the backlog at the high-end has basically been gone. So I was wondering if you could really address the demand situation, perhaps linearity in the quarter and why these collective factors don't suggest and point to the fact that you've seen a change in demand at least relative to your expectations going into the quarter.

First, that in our projections for the quarter, we had expected to catch a big piece of the backlog so that's not new news. What happened as we looked at the revenue, clearly, we said mid- to high-single digit. We came in right in line with that. Your point is well taken with currency, that probably would have pushed us up towards the higher end, and we didn't see that. And so the reality is we were a little weaker in a couple of places. The first thing for us is Europe was weaker than expected. Still had constant currency growth in Europe but certainly weaker than expected and weaker than what we had seen in the first half. Second thing is, as I mentioned a minute ago, there were a couple of deals in enterprise we had hope to get into the quarter that had been in our outlook that slipped out. But again the enterprise outlook in the fourth quarter is really quite good. And the third thing is, and Paul Rooke mentioned it, the OEM supplies in inkjet a little weaker than what we had expected. But if we look at the, again, the core metrics, strategic metrics, on the enterprise side, workgroup lasers continue to be very, very strong. Management services continue to be very strong on a year-to-year basis. And we clearly -- on the inventory side, we're charging ahead of where we projected demand because we have not been able to catch it for months and months and months. So we took aggressive action there. And we knew that there was a risk we would overshoot potentially, and we saw a little bit of that. But much of that increase is in the core policy and run rate stuff we need. So a lot of that core increase, some of that will stay, some of that we will work off. But we're not upset over having to work off a little bit. We're much happier to have caught it because from a customer standpoint, we really did need to get this caught up. So we think, overall, workgroup basis continue to be quite strong, as I said high-end inkjets also quite strong. And we see -- we have good expectations in the fourth quarter as well."

Your question as to why do we do it now? Well we need to do a transition and we need to make that public so that Paul and I can work out in the open. Our decision to do it before the year end, primarily revolves around the making decisions on the 2011 plan that I thought and the board thought that it would be a positive to have the new CEO own the 2011 plan and decision set around that.  And so really to do that, we needed to make a change at the end of the third quarter. And so that's why we did it. I mean we could have announced it and left me in charge versus Paul in charge. But the reality is, I would have been making decisions that clearly would affect what he is going to be doing as he goes forward in time. So it's my personal view that the right way to do a transition like this is to put the new guy in charge. I'm still here. I can help him with the transition.

As we look at these geographies, historically they've shift a lower mix, more low end than high end, but we've been very focused on ensuring that as we grow these geographies, that they're on our strategy drive, workgroup lasers and high-end inkjet products. And so we're actually having good success with that. The mix continues to improve. And those geographies, they're also seeing increases in average unit revenue. So I think the way you should think about that is that our objective is to basically run them with the same strategic initiatives around workgroup lasers and high-end inkjets. Their mix may always just be a shade less, but it's going to be close. And we're going to keep driving it to get it back to where we have it in the rest of our business.

And I would tell you that from a competitive standpoint on supplies, we face competition everywhere around the world. I don't know that we'd say it's stronger, but I would tell you that obviously we're very careful outside the U.S. where we do business. We're very focused on capturing supplies. So we take that into account about how we do business and where we do business.

Our third quarter earnings, we're reflecting good revenue growth, in line with our guidance range and strong year-to-year earnings growth exceeding our guidance range. Excluding restructuring acquisition-related adjustments, revenue for the third quarter was up 7% year-to-year with 12% growth in PSSD, driven by 19% growth in laser hardware and double-digit growth in laser supplies revenue. 
Earnings per share excluding restructuring, acquisition-related adjustments were $1.09, an increase of 67% year-to-year. And year-to-date through the third quarter revenue was up 11% year-to-year. And earnings per share were $3.67, up 75% year-to-year. 
These strong year-to-date results are being driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of workgroup lasers and business inkjets and enhanced by the many actions we've taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark.  For example: We've expanded and strengthened our laser product line; we're repositioning our inkjet business to focus on higher usage business customers improving our high-end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales throughout the super stores; we've advanced our solutions in Managed Print Services business, delivering value through our software and services to help our industry customers reduce cost and improve their productivity; we've reduced our cost and expense infrastructure, consolidating and reducing the number of manufacturing facilities and leveraging shared service centers in low-cost countries; and despite our expense reductions, we have continued to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. 
And looking forward, in addition to the momentum from our core imaging and printing business, the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of enterprise content management software and will expand and strengthen our industry workflow solutions capability.  Together with our Managed Print Services business, Perceptive will be at the center of a strong growing software and services business at Lexmark. 
Our outlook for fourth quarter of '10 is for a good sequential growth in revenue and operating income, but with a tougher year-to-year compare against unusually strong sequential improvement from 3Q to 4Q in 2009. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to close out the call. Thank you."

As part of the planned succession process, I have assumed the role of Executive Chairman effective today. I would like to invite everyone on the call to join me in congratulating Paul Rooke on his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of Lexmark. I have known and worked with Paul for over 20 years and throughout his career, he has demonstrated tremendous leadership, strategic thinking and operational ability. 
Paul has been with the company since its inception in 1991. He has run both of our Printer divisions, PSSD and ISD, and has been involved in all aspects of our business and has participated in the formulation of all of our key strategic initiatives. He is well respected by our employees, our customers and our investors. I have great confidence in Paul Rooke and I'm confident that he is the right person to lead Lexmark forward. 
My 19 years with Lexmark, including 12 years as Lexmark's CEO, has been an incredibly rewarding experience. But I have a long time personal goal to retire early and this feels like an appropriate time to make the transition. 
We have a very strong executive team at Lexmark, with a lot of experience and continuity. Our business is seeing a positive impact from the key strategic investments in technology, solutions and services that we've made over the last 4 to 5 years. We're seeing strong customer demand for our management services, our industry workflow solutions, our work group, laser products and MFPs and our high-end inkjet devices. 
Now with the addition of Perceptive Software and our increased investments there, our future is focused on building a strong, growing core of software solutions and services to complement our strong sales at workgroup lasers and high-end inkjet devices and to drive Lexmark's long-term success. I think that this is an extraordinary and exciting time for our company. 
In the near term, I will continue as Chairman of the Board of Directors. In my role as Executive Chairman, I will assist with the leadership transition and continue to assist the Perceptive Software team with their integration activities. I plan to retire from the Lexmark Board of Directors and as Executive Chairman in the spring of 2011. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul Rooke, for the CEOs quarterly report."

And for now in addition to my new role, I will also be the acting President of ISD to keep the focus on our inkjet initiatives. 
Now let's turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter earnings were better than expected, reflecting good revenue growth in line with our guidance range, and strong earnings growth exceeding our guidance range. GAAP revenue for the third quarter was $1.02 billion. Revenue excluding acquisition-related adjustments was $1.025 billion, up 7% year-to-year. 
For the quarter, hardware revenue was up 10% year-to-year and supplies revenue was up 4% year-to-year. Third quarter '10 earnings per share were $0.90. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related adjustments, earnings per share in the third quarter were $1.09, an increase of 67% year-to-year. Net cash from operations was $130 million in the quarter. 
Now in our Printing Solutions and Services Division, or PSSD, we continue to see strong customer demand for our products and our services, which generated double-digit year-to-year growth in both PSSD hardware and supplies revenue. PSSD third quarter '10 revenue was $731 million, up 12% year-to-year. PSSD operating income, excluding restructuring, was $143 million, up 46% year-to-year. 
Now while PSSD laser units for the quarter grew 5% year-to-year, workgroup laser units and laser MFPs grew over 20% year-to-year, benefiting from our recent product line expansions. This improvement in laser mix toward workgroup products and MFPs resulted in PSSD hardware revenue growth of 19% year-to-year. And during the quarter, we continue to have strong growth year-to-year in our Enterprise Managed Print Services business. 
According to our internal analysis, Lexmark has continued to be #1 in the U.S. printer market in laser product awards received through the first three quarters of 2010. Also, according to IDC data for the first half of 2010, we have continued to gain branded market share in our focused segment of A4 workgroup lasers with a gain of about 190 basis points year-to-year to a share of about 14%. 
Now 2 weeks ago, PSSD introduced a significant expansion of our workgroup color laser product line, including the announcement of the new 50 page a minute X792e color laser MFP. This is a small footprint yet high duty cycle integrated A4 color MFP with optional finishing that will help us strengthen our attack on A3 MFPs. And initial press reviews on the X792e have been very positive and customer interest appears to be strong. 
Let's talk about our Imaging Solutions Division, or ISD. In ISD we continue to make progress on the transition of our inkjet focus to business customers as we continue to generate ongoing strong growth in high end inkjet unit sales. In the third quarter, ISD revenue was $274 million, about flat sequentially and down 10% year-to-year. ISD operating income excluding restructuring was $35 million, up 3% year-to-year. Now supplies revenue was up slightly sequentially and stronger than the normal sequential trend which is typically down. And slight strong sequential performance, the year-to-year performance, was impacted by a tougher compare versus 2Q. 
ISD units for the quarter were down 28% year-to-year as the strong growth and high-end inkjet units was more than offset by the continuing decline of low-end devices. Now this unit mix shift to the high end continues to improve our ISD average unit revenue.  And as a result, the decline in ISD hardware revenue of 15% was less than the overall unit decline. 
And during the quarter we continue to have strong year-to-year growth in the retail sellout of our professional series inkjet units and ongoing strong growth in inkjet sellout revenue in the U.S. office super stores helped by our product line improvements over the last year. 
According to our internal analysis, Lexmark is #1 in the U.S. printer market in inkjet product awards received year-to-date through the first three quarters of 2010. Also according to NPD data for first half '10, Lexmark has continued to gain inkjet market share in U.S. office super stores, almost doubling our share of office super store inkjet units in the above $100 segment to about 11%, making us #2 in this important office super store segment. 
And in the fourth quarter, we're expanding our inkjet distribution in the U.S. with the addition of some SKUs at Best Buy. And just over a week ago, ISD introduced the new Lexmark Genesis inkjet all-in-one, featuring our unique vertical design and a new flash scan camera technology. The new flash scan enables instant scan previews to the color touchscreen and can transfer a page from document to digital in as few as 3 seconds. Priced at $399, the Lexmark Genesis will be available early next year and initial press reviews are very positive. 
Now Perceptive Software in the third quarter generated about $14 million in GAAP revenue, excluding acquisition-related adjustments, revenue was about $20 million with a strong year-to-year increase in license bookings during the quarter. Now our primary integration focus with Perceptive is the leveraged Lexmark's global infrastructure and lead generation capability to accelerate perceptive's growth. In addition, we're working to integrate Lexmark's and Perceptive's technology to provide our industry customers with end-to-end workflow solutions. And overall, our integration plans are on track. 
Now as we look into the fourth quarter of 2010, we're expecting a good quarter with good sequential growth in revenue and operating income but with a tougher year-to-year compare against our unusually strong sequential improvement in fourth quarter of '09. 
Now overall in the fourth quarter we're expecting year-to-year revenue growth in the low single-digit range. We expect fourth quarter GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.96. Fourth quarter '10 EPS excluding restructuring and acquisition-related adjustments are expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.13. 
Now looking back through the first three quarters of 2010, we've had strong growth in our revenue and operating income. Excluding acquisition and restructuring adjustments year-to-date, revenue is up 11% year-to-year and operating income is up 79% year-to-year. These strong results had been driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of workgroup lasers and business inkjets and have been enhanced by the many actions we've taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark, including: The expansion and strengthening of our product line in PSSD, particularly in color lasers and laser MFPs; the repositioning of ISD, the focus on higher usage, business customers, improving our high-end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales through office super stores; the advancement of our Managed Print Services business and the strengthening of our industry workflow solutions capabilities; and significant changes in our manufacturing and support infrastructure, consolidating, reducing the number of facilities, increasing our usage of shared service centers in low-cost countries to significantly lower our cost and expense structure. 
As a result, we made Lexmark a stronger but leaner competitor and improved our capability to compete in the high usage, higher value segments of the market. And despite our expense reductions, we've continue to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. 
Looking forward, in addition to the momentum from our core imaging and printing business, the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of enterprise content management software and will expand and strengthen our industry workflow solutions capability. And together with our Managed Print Services business, Perceptive will be at the center of a strong growing software and services business at Lexmark. 
And as a final point, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with a solid balance sheet and with about $1.1 billion in cash in current marketable securities. I'll now turn it over to John Gamble for his more detailed comments on our financials."

I'll then discuss selected changes in the balance sheet and certain items of cash flow. Finally, I'll finish with more detail regarding our guidance for the fourth quarter. 
As we announced in the July call, the Perceptive Software acquisition was completed on June 7 and was included in Lexmark's 2Q results and for segment reporting was included in other. Our 2Q '10 financial performance included Perceptive results for only the June 8 to 30 period after the transaction closed. 
Now let me begin with the P&L. I'll start by providing our third quarter 2010 GAAP results. GAAP revenue was $1.020 billion. Gross profit was $361 million. Gross profit margin percent was 35.4%. Operating expense was $268 million. Operating income was $93 million. Net earnings were $72 million, an increase of 622% year-on-year. And earnings per share were $0.90. 
The discussion that follows is on a non-GAAP basis and reflects non-GAAP adjustments unless otherwise noted. Non-GAAP adjustments in 3Q '10 were acquisition-related revenue adjustments of $5 million, and total pretax income adjustments of $19 million. The non-GAAP pretax income adjustments of $19 million in 3Q '10 were comprised of $11 million for acquisition-related adjustments and $8 million for restructuring-related adjustments. As a reminder, included in the supplemental slide deck posted on the Investor Relations section of the Lexmark.com website are schedules detailing the non-GAAP adjustments and reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP measures. 
Non-GAAP total revenue for the quarter was $1.025 billion, up 7% compared to last year, down 1% sequentially from 2Q. The currency impact on Lexmark revenue in 3Q '10 versus 2Q '10 was positive approximately 1% and the currency impact on Lexmark revenue from 3Q '10 versus 3Q '09 was negative approximately 2%. This is the third consecutive quarter of solid revenue growth for Lexmark and was in line with the guidance range we've provided on the July earnings call. 
Hardware revenue growth also significantly exceeded supplies revenue growth as expected. Versus our expectation at the time we provided our financial guidance in July, which was based on the exchange rates as of June 30, 2010, the impact of currency on revenue was approximately positive 2%. 
Geographically, for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis, U.S. revenue of $468 million grew about 12%. EMEA revenue of $338 million declined about 4%, and the remaining geographies grew about 17% year-over-year. We showed strong growth of 13% in all non-EMEA geographic regions in 3Q, and the weaker EMEA performance significantly impacted by currency. On a constant currency basis, EMEA revenue was up 3% on a year-on-year basis. 
Supplies revenue in the third quarter increased 4% year-to-year. This reflects double-digit percentage growth in PSSD supplies, driven by strong end-user page demand, partially offset by ongoing declines in ISD. Hardware revenue in the third quarter increased 10% year-to-year and declined slightly sequentially. 
As has consistently been the case over the past year, the hardware revenue increase was primarily due to strong growth in Lexmark's strategic segments, the workgroup laser, laser MFPs and high-end inkjets and the associated effect of better unit mix. 
PSSD revenue for the quarter was $731 million, an increase of 12% from the same quarter in 2009 and a decline of 3% sequentially from 2Q '10. The year-to-year increase was driven by improvements in both hardware and supplies revenue. The sequential decline was primarily driven by supplies revenue consistent with historical seasonal patterns. 
PSSD laser hardware units increased 5% in the third quarter versus the prior year with over 20% year-to-year growth in workgroup lasers and laser MFPs. 
Product constraints impacted low-end single function shipments in the quarter, but these constraints were significantly reduced as we exited September. 
PSSD hardware revenue increased 19% versus 3Q '09. This increase was driven primarily by higher unit volume and favorable workgroup and MFP product mix. PSSD laser hardware average unit revenue increased 14% year-to-year in the third quarter, driven by the positive shift related to workgroup MFP products. 
ISD revenue for the quarter was $274 million, down 10% from the same quarter in 2009 and about flat with 2Q '10. The year-to-year decline was driven primarily by a decline in supplies revenue and to a lesser extent, hardware revenue. 
ISD hardware units decreased 28% year-to-year in the third quarter, reflecting declines in low-end units, partially offset by strong growth in higher-end units as we continue to transition the product line toward higher end devices and higher usage business customers. 
ISD hardware revenue declined 15% in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in hardware revenue was driven primarily by lower hardware unit volume, partially offset by our continuing improved mix toward higher end business class devices.  ISD hardware AUR in the quarter increased 17% versus the prior year, reflecting the positive mix shift in the product line. 
Perceptive Software non-GAAP revenue for the quarter, which is shown in our Other, was $20 million. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for 3Q was 36.5%, up 260 basis points versus the prior year and down 90 basis points sequentially. The 260 basis point third quarter increase versus last year was principally due to a 310 basis point increase in product margins, driven by higher margins in supplies and software. 
This product margin increase was partially offset by a negative mix of relatively more hardware versus supplies and software. Sequentially, margins decreased by 90 basis points reflecting lower product margins. 
Non-GAAP operating expense for the quarter was $262 million, an increase of $13 million versus 3Q '09 and $11 million sequentially. In the quarter, versus both 3Q '09 and 2Q '10, the increase in operating expense is more than explained by the addition of Perceptive Software operating expense. Versus 3Q '09, R&D was about flat. 
SG&A in the quarter was $171 million, up $13 million from 3Q '09. SG&A was up versus 3Q '09 as cost reductions executed during 2009 were offset primarily by the addition of Perceptive Software operating expense, as well as by additional results-driven compensation. 
Sequentially operating expense after non-GAAP adjustments increased $11 million versus the second quarter due to an increase in SG&A. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to the addition of perceptive SG&A, as well as currency. 
Non-GAAP operating income in 3Q was $112 million, up $37 million from 3Q '09 and down $24 million sequentially from 2Q '10. The increase in 3Q '10 operating income versus 3Q '09 was driven by higher income in PSSD. The decrease versus 2Q '10 was primarily due to decreased PSSD operating income. 
PSSD, non-GAAP operating income in 3Q '10 of $143 million was up $45 million versus last year and down $26 million sequentially. This improvement versus last year was driven primarily by higher supplies revenue, as well as lower operating expense. Versus 2Q '10, PSSD operating income was down $26 million, driven by lower supplies revenue. 
ISD non-GAAP operational income in 3Q '10 of $35 million was up $1 million versus last year and $1 million sequentially. 
Other consist of cost related to centralized supply chain, IT and other operating expenses, primarily G&A, as well as the results of Perceptive Software. 
In 3Q '10, Other non-GAAP operating income was negative $65 million. This was $9 million unfavorable to 3Q '09, driven primarily by additional results-driven compensation and the addition of Perceptive Software. Sequentially Other segment operating income was $1 million favorable to 2Q '10. 
Non-GAAP operating income margin in 3Q was 10.9%, an increase of 310 basis points from the third quarter of 2009 and a decrease of 220 basis points sequentially both in line with our expectations. 
Concerning financing and non-operating costs, in the third quarter of 2010, the net interest and Other was an expense of $6 million, down from $11 million net expense in the third quarter of 2009 and flat with the second quarter of 2010. 3Q '10 was favorable year-on-year primarily due to a $3 million charge incurred in 3Q '09 for the write-down of an equity investment. 
Our effective tax rate in 3Q '10 was 17.7%. This was lower than the 24.6% we saw in 2Q '10 and lower than our expected tax rate of 24%, driven primarily by discrete items, reflecting the impacts of tax audits in 3Q '10, as well as a reduction in our expected full-year 2010 effective tax rate to 23%. 
The expected 2010 tax rate of 23% excludes discrete items, as well as assumes the R&D tax credit is not renewed. As of September 30, the U.S. R&D tax credit had not been reinstated for 2010. 
Non-GAAP net earnings for the quarter were $87 million. 3Q '09 non-GAAP net earnings were $51 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $1.09 per share. This compares to 3Q '09 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65. 
Now moving to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $130 million compared to $147 million in 3Q '09 and $91 million in 2Q '10. Since the end of June 2010, accounts receivable decreased $11 million, inventory increased $53 million, accounts payable increased $8 million, and accrued liabilities increased $57 million. 
The factors impacting our sequential inventory increase were: First, increases in component finished goods and pipeline inventory related to catching rapidly increasing demand and alleviating the product constraints we have incurred over the first 9 months of 2010; second, an increase in in-process shipped inventory due to a sequentially higher number of enterprise shipments underway at the end of 3Q or units needed to be shipped in early 4Q; and third, some areas of excess inventory we would like to work off going forward. 
The increase in accrued liabilities was principally driven by increased accrued compensation, interest and taxes payable. 
In 3Q '10, we saw a slight decline in our cash cycle performance, driven by our increased inventory. However, we saw significant improvement versus last year. As we have discussed in the past, improving cash cycle is a significant focus for us, with a specific focus on improving inventory performance while improving product availability and customer satisfaction. 
For the quarter, capital spending was $28 million, depreciation in the quarter was $51 million. Cash and current marketable securities at the end of 3Q '10 was $1.1 billion, the significant majority of which is outside the U.S. and was up $113 million since June 2010 driven by operating results. 
Total long-term debt at the end of 3Q '10 remained at $615 million, with maturities on the debt in 2013 and 2018. At quarter end, we had $491 million of share repurchase authority outstanding. No shares repurchased in the quarter. 
Now for my forward-looking comments concerning 4Q '10. We expect fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP revenue to grow in the low single-digit percentage range year-over-year. The hardware revenue growth rate is again expected to significantly outpace the supplies revenue growth rate. GAAP EPS in 4Q '10 is expected to be $0.86 to $0.96. GAAP EPS in 4Q '09 was $0.76. 
In 4Q '10, non-GAAP adjustments to revenue were expected to be $4 million, and to EPS are expected to be $0.17, comprised of acquisition-related adjustments of $0.09 per share and restructuring-related adjustments of approximately $0.08 per share.  Non-GAAP 4Q '10 EPS is expected to be $1.03 to $1.13 per share. Non-GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.16 per share. 
The guidance provided is on a non-GAAP basis and is based on foreign exchange rates as of 9/30/10. At these exchange rates, the currency impact on revenue in 4Q '10 versus 3Q '10 is positive approximately 2%. The currency impact on revenue of 4Q '10 versus 4Q '09 is negative approximately 2%. The 4Q '10 sequential revenue growth is approximately consistent with our normal sequential trend. 
In the fourth quarter we expect gross profit margin percentage to be down versus the 36.5% we achieved in 3Q '10, reflecting a higher mix of hardware. Operating expense is expected to be up slightly from the $262 million incurred in 3Q '10. Operating income margin in the fourth quarter is expected to be above the 10.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2010. 
For 4Q 2010, we expect our ongoing effective tax rate to be about 23%. This reflects the fact that the R&D tax credit has expired as of January 1, 2010, and has not yet been extended. For the full year of 2010, we expect our effective tax rate to be 23% before any discrete items, assuming that the R&D tax credit will not be reinstated for 2010.  Should the R&D credit be reinstated, we expect the full year of 2010 tax rate of approximately 22% before discrete items. 
We project full year 2010 capital spending to be approximately $160 million and we expect full-year depreciation to be approximately $195 million, including the $6 million impact of accelerated depreciation related to facility closures. 
With regard to our announced restructurings, we continue to expect the overall cost in savings generated from the restructuring programs announced in April and October 2009 to be approximately the same as discussed last quarter. The April '09 restructuring program was principally completed at the end of 3Q '10. The October '09 restructuring program is expected to be principally completed in first half 2011. 
In 3Q '10, restructuring cash outflow was $14 million, and savings from our 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions were $62 million. Savings in 4Q '10 from the 2007, 2008 and 2009 restructurings are expected to be about $64 million. 
Our performance in 3Q '10 continue to be very strong, as has our performance throughout 2010. Based on the midpoint of our revenue guidance for 4Q '10, full year 2010 non-GAAP revenue of about $4.2 billion should grow approximately 8% versus 2009. 
Based on our 4Q guidance, we are raising our full-year non-GAAP operating margin guidance for 2010 from 11.6% to between 12% and 12.5%. Our non-GAAP EPS should be $4.70 to $4.80 per share, representing growth of over 40% versus 2009. 
With that, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions."

And I think that sequential uplift certainly reflects the workgroup lasers that we're bringing in to the market right now, as well as the announcement we just had with the inkjet products into Best Buy as well. So those things figure in. In terms of what we're seeing on a year-to-year basis, we are expecting again good sequential improvement, but the year-to-year is a much tougher compare against the unusual sequential performance we saw in the third quarter to fourth quarter 2009 as we came out of the economic downturn, and that's the reason for the guidance."

In terms of the product margins, what I would tell you is that in the third quarter what we saw in product margins was actually better than what we had expected. And that was just due basically to the hardware mix, as well as the hardware margins themselves. As we move forward in time, we're obviously expecting to see more promotional activity because we now have caught up on our laser products. Also what figures a little bit into our fourth quarter guidance is mix, mix of inkjet versus laser, mix of color versus mono, all of which will put a little bit more pressure on with these promotions on the hardware margins. But again we're expecting good performance in our strategic segments of workgroup lasers and the high-end inkjets. So strategically, things are looking good, certainly in the third quarter, expecting to be very good in the fourth quarter. And I'll let Paul Rooke talk about competitive landscape."

There are trends out there, as you mentioned, the e-print trends, some app trends and so forth. And I just point out that e-print is basically printing through a cloud. It's kind of a subset of all the things you can do through the cloud, and we're certainly focused on that. In fact we've been doing things through the cloud for several years now in terms of our solutions and services that we provide to our customers. So we're looking at, really -- looking at it really from a broader perspective, a broader opportunity of doing things through the cloud for our customers. The applications, as you mentioned, both on the laser side and on the inkjet side with SmartSolutions are an exciting thing for us. It's been what's differentiated as for many years now and continues to differentiate us in our work plus [ph] solutions as we were able to customize for a specific customers.

We -- certainly a portion of the increase was related to making sure that we were able to meet the demand that was coming in the fourth quarter and that we had as we saw the third quarter. The demand that we talked about in terms of shipments that were going out in the third quarter and early fourth quarter are just related to the strong growth we've seen in workgroup product and MFPs, consistently throughout the year. So it's just the timing of it. It might have been a little bit later, but it's just relative to the very good performance we've seen throughout the year and that we've been consistent with. We certainly have several areas where we think our inventory can improve. The increased inventory levels were relatively -- were fairly broad, so we think we have a good opportunity to try to work, to try to take inventory levels down, as we work through the fourth quarter."

The metrics look weaker but underneath, and I'll give you a little color on that, the core strategic metrics remain strong. So you shouldn't interpret it as a change in the trend here as we go quarter-to-quarter. And a lot of it was due to the easier compare that we mentioned in 2Q. Let me break it in a couple of pieces. The hardware piece, underneath our high-end inkjets, we are seeing growth in double digits. You see that in our AUR numbers, they're up 17% there in the third quarter. At the same time, we are dropping some more of the low end, we're exiting some mass distribution that was still there, so that's making its way into our numbers. We're also a little less promotional on some of the low-end products as well, so that's affecting the mix. But the mix is moving in the right direction, which is the strategic point here. And we're encouraged with our technology, the new technology we now
[Audio Gap] 
last fall and now extending it with Genesis is being received very well. As we mentioned the awards numbers, as well as the channel shifts that we're seeing from mass into OSS, now the #2 greater than $100 inkjet provider there in OSS and entries into places like Best Buy. So that's really encouraging for us to see the acceptance of the technology that we're bringing, and more to come. On the supply side, we mentioned we had a sequential -- slight increase sequentially, which was very encouraging for us because typically that's been down sequentially in past years. So in effect, the branded piece of our business was actually better than our OEM. We had a little more softness in the OEM side. And as I mentioned, the swing we had last year from 2Q to 3Q is making the compare tougher. So when you add all that up, while on the surface the metrics look weaker, the core strategic metrics are actually quite strong. And if you back up, just and look at the overall trend year-to-date both in hardware and supplies, if you compare year-to-date last year versus year-to-date this year, last year we were clearly minus double digits both hardware and supplies. This year, we're certainly minus single digits in both. So the trend is changing, and it's moving in the right direction. Obviously I'd like it to be faster but we're moving and it is moving, and so we're encouraged."

At the surface it actually feels like there was a pretty pronounced change in the demand environment in the quarter relative to your expectations. Adjusting for currency you're at the very low-end of your revenue guidance of 5%, you said mid- to high-single digits, you're typically pretty conservative. You've built inventory and you went from having the biggest backlog in history to potentially having somewhat of a surplus, and it sounds like all of the backlog at the high-end has basically been gone. So I was wondering if you could really address the demand situation, perhaps linearity in the quarter and why these collective factors don't suggest and point to the fact that you've seen a change in demand at least relative to your expectations going into the quarter. And I have a follow-up."

First, that in our projections for the quarter, we had expected to catch a big piece of the backlog so that's not new news. What happened as we looked at the revenue, clearly, we said mid- to high-single digit. We came in right in line with that. Your point is well taken with currency, that probably would have pushed us up towards the higher end, and we didn't see that. And so the reality is we were a little weaker in a couple of places. The first thing for us is Europe was weaker than expected. Still had constant currency growth in Europe but certainly weaker than expected and weaker than what we had seen in the first half. Second thing is, as I mentioned a minute ago, there were a couple of deals in enterprise we had hope to get into the quarter that had been in our outlook that slipped out. But again the enterprise outlook in the fourth quarter is really quite good. And the third thing is, and Paul Rooke mentioned it, the OEM supplies in inkjet a little weaker than what we had expected. But if we look at the, again, the core metrics, strategic metrics, on the enterprise side, workgroup lasers continue to be very, very strong. Management services continue to be very strong on a year-to-year basis. And we clearly -- on the inventory side, we're charging ahead of where we projected demand because we have not been able to catch it for months and months and months. So we took aggressive action there. And we knew that there was a risk we would overshoot potentially, and we saw a little bit of that. But much of that increase is in the core policy and run rate stuff we need. So a lot of that core increase, some of that will stay, some of that we will work off. But we're not upset over having to work off a little bit. We're much happier to have caught it because from a customer standpoint, we really did need to get this caught up. So we think, overall, workgroup basis continue to be quite strong, as I said high-end inkjets also quite strong. And we see -- we have good expectations in the fourth quarter as well."

And so I don't think that's unusual for Lexmark versus other companies. But I would tell you that this has been a long planned process that the intent for me to retire is in the spring of next year. Your question as to why do we do it now? Well we need to do a transition and we need to make that public so that Paul and I can work out in the open. Our decision to do it before the year end, primarily revolves around the making decisions on the 2011 plan that I thought and the board thought that it would be a positive to have the new CEO own the 2011 plan and decision set around that.  And so really to do that, we needed to make a change at the end of the third quarter. And so that's why we did it. I mean we could have announced it and left me in charge versus Paul in charge. But the reality is, I would have been making decisions that clearly would affect what he is going to be doing as he goes forward in time. So it's my personal view that the right way to do a transition like this is to put the new guy in charge. I'm still here. I can help him with the transition. But these were the factors that went in to it. But there's nothing abrupt here certainly from an internal perspective. And again I see a lot of other companies do it just this way."

Our third quarter earnings were reflecting good revenue growth, in line with our guidance range and strong year-to-year earnings growth exceeding our guidance range. Excluding restructuring acquisition-related adjustments, revenue for the third quarter was up 7% year-to-year with 12% growth in PSSD, driven by 19% growth in laser hardware and double-digit growth in laser supplies revenue. 
Earnings per share excluding restructuring, acquisition-related adjustments were $1.09, an increase of 67% year-to-year. And year-to-date through the third quarter revenue was up 11% year-to-year. And earnings per share were $3.67, up 75% year-to-year. 
These strong year-to-date results are being driven by our strategy to focus on the growth of workgroup lasers and business inkjets and enhanced by the many actions we've taken over the last several years to fundamentally improve Lexmark.  For example: We've expanded and strengthened our laser product line; we're repositioning our inkjet business to focus on higher usage business customers improving our high-end inkjet product line and significantly expanding our sales throughout the super stores; we've advanced our solutions in Managed Print Services business, delivering value through our software and services to help our industry customers reduce cost and improve their productivity; we've reduced our cost and expense infrastructure, consolidating and reducing the number of manufacturing facilities and leveraging shared service centers in low-cost countries; and despite our expense reductions, we have continued to invest significantly in our core print technology and product development and are driving a strong pipeline of future Lexmark products. 
And looking forward, in addition to the momentum from our core imaging and printing business, the addition of Perceptive Software allows us to now compete in the fast growing segment of enterprise content management software and will expand and strengthen our industry workflow solutions capability.  Together with our Managed Print Services business, Perceptive will be at the center of a strong growing software and services business at Lexmark. 
Our outlook for fourth quarter of '10 is for a good sequential growth in revenue and operating income, but with a tougher year-to-year compare against unusually strong sequential improvement from 3Q to 4Q in 2009. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to close out the call. Thank you."
