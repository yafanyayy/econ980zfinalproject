I would like to start today's call by revisiting Newmont’s strategic priorities outlined on slide 3, for those of you with access to our simulcast presentation.
In 2009, we continued to execute well in our operations and drive significant improvement in our financial performance. As we look forward, we believe that successfully executing on the key benchmarks that we set out for the company at the beginning of each year will lead to increased value for our shareholders. Less execution risk should imply a higher value for our portfolio of operations and projects. We continue to work tirelessly to achieve our strategic priorities every year, and we are pleased that 2009 to a significant degree solidified our foundation of doing what we say we will do. Our continuous focus on disciplined planning in operational and business excellence enabled us again to deliver on our annual operational guidance for 2009, just as they did in 2008. The operating results, along with the robust gold price environment led to record financial performance, including the generation of almost $3 billion in operating cash flow, which Russell will speak to later.
Now that we have reached the construction completion and commercial production milestones at our Boddington project in Australia, we are focusing our efforts on advancing our next generation of projects, 30 million to 40 million targeted ounces of development opportunities, of which approximately 20 million ounces are in proven and probable reserves at this year end, with the remainder being at earlier stages of definition. Guy will review a number of these opportunities a little later in the presentation. Importantly, the strength of our balance sheet, combined with expected future cash flow should provide the funding we need to develop these world-class mining projects.
And finally, we consistently aim to improve our safety record and commitment to environmental stewardship, and social responsibility. That said, 2009 was a somber year for Newmont, as we mourn the loss of four co-workers who died as a result of fail accidents in our operations. Because of our relentless commitment to creating the safest possible work environment, we recognize that fatalities are simply unacceptable. We continue to believe that we must get to a zero injury, not just zero-fatality workplace. Safe production is the bottom line here at Newmont.
2009 did offer some high points in our environmental, social and community relations efforts. We completed and published the findings from our unprecedented Community Relations Review, and brought together a global workshop held in Washington DC late in the year for many of the participants to hear feedback from the communities who had a chance to review the CRR. However, our work doesn't stop with just a review. We are in the process of developing standards and pushing them throughout our organization to build better relationships and more sustainable relationships with our host communities. We are also pleased to be recognized as an industry leader in sustainability for the third consecutive year, by our selection to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.
We also recognize the challenges facing the world related to climate change. As such, we continue to look for ways to make our operations more energy-efficient and take an industry leading role on this critical issue.
Turning to 2009 performance highlights on slide four, we had an excellent year, setting records for revenue, adjusted net income, and operating cash flow. In 2009, Newmont generated $7.7 billion in revenue, a 26% increase over 2008. We also generated record operating cash flow of $2.9 billion, a 109% increase over 2008. And our adjusted net income increased to $1.4 billion, or $2.79 per share, as 60% improvement on the year. Our equity gold sales reached 5.3 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $417 per ounce, both within our guidance announced at the beginning of 2009. While realized gold prices grew 12%, our margin on gold increased 28%, demonstrating our ability to deliver strong financial leverage to the gold price. We also sold 226 million pounds of copper at costs applicable to sales of $0.64 per pound.
In addition to record financial results, our combination of excellent 2009 exploration results and the acquisition of Anglo’s one-third interest in Boddington, resulted in equity gold reserves of 92 million ounces, an 8% increase over 2008. This marks the highest level for our equity gold reserves since 2006, and equity copper results of 9.1 billion pounds, a 17% increase over last year. We are excited about these results, as this forms the foundation for future growth to our existing operations and our strong pipeline of products. 2009 marks a significant milestone in Newmont’s transformation and positions us to further emerge as a leader in the mining industry.
Turning to slide five and focusing on our fourth quarter results in particular, our operations generated consolidated revenue of $2.5 billion, a 90% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008. Net operating cash flow was approximately $1 billion, a 323% increase over 2008. Our net adjusted income rose 379% to $561 million, or $1.14 per share, an improvement of 338% over last year.
Equity gold sales for the quarter were 1.5 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $413 per ounce. This quarter's costs applicable to sales were 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008, thanks to a continuous focus on cost control and higher production. These operating results, paired with a 38% realized gold price increase, led to a 94% increase in our gold operating margin. Copper, as in the third quarter, also contributed significantly to our success. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold 72 million equity pounds of copper at $3.24 per pound with costs applicable to sales of $0.64 per pound. I want to acknowledge the dedication and commitment of our employees worldwide. We had a superb 2009.
Our total equity gold sales for the year, focusing on slide six, were 5.3 million ounces, falling in the center of the range for our original outlook. Our full-year costs applicable to sales of $417 per ounce also comes in the lower half of the original outlook range of $400 to $440. Due to the delayed completion of Boddington, our consolidated capital expenditures were $1.8 billion, above our original outlook range, and above our third-quarter outlook update of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. As we mentioned, the delayed start up of Boddington pushed this number higher for the year, as we continued to capitalize pre-commercial production and interest costs, until we achieved commercial production in mid-November.
I will now ask Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to take us through our operating details on a regional level.

Slide seven illustrates our regional performance as compared to our outlook for 2009. We are proud that across our entire portfolio, our focus on operational education produced equity gold sales and costs applicable to sales results in line with our original expectations, which speaks to the hard work, alignment, and dedication of our employees in each one of our regions.
In Nevada, we sold more than 2 million ounces of gold, just slightly ahead of our outlook, due to higher underground tons mined at Leeville and Deep Post, and higher leach recovery at Carlin North and Twin Creeks. Costs applicable to sales in Nevada were $521 an ounce, lower than our expectations due to higher production, fewer tons mined, partially offset by higher royalties, higher net proceeds taxes, and higher underground mining costs.
At our operations in Australia and New Zealand, we sold 1.3 million equity ounces of gold, below our original guidance of 1.5 million to 1.6 million ounces, due to the delayed start up at Boddington. Gold sales at Jundee again came in higher than expected, as we continue to have higher ore grade at this operation, which was offset by lower-than-anticipated sales at Tanami, due to lower ore grade and at Waihi, as a result of an electrical fire in the mill earlier in the year. Costs applicable to sales of $508 per ounce were above our original expectations, but were in line with our third quarter updated outlook.
At Yanacocha in Peru, equity gold sales reached 1.1 million ounces, beating our outlook due to higher mill throughput, ore grade, and recovery. Costs applicable to sales were $311 per ounce, just outside the top end of our original expectation of $290 to $310 per ounce, as higher gold prices resulted in higher royalty and workers’ participation costs, partially offset by higher mill production, and by product credits.
Our Ahafo operation in Ghana sold 546,000 equity ounces of gold, well above our expectations, due to higher ore grade and throughput, and a drawdown of finished goods inventory. Ahafo’s costs applicable to sales were $445 per ounce, better than expected due to lower mining costs as a result of lower than expected waste material mined and lower power costs.
And finally, equity gold sales at Batu Hijau in Indonesia were 239,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $214 per ounce, which was lower than expected, due to lower diesel and mining costs, and higher co-product allocation of costs to copper.
Across the portfolio, we are very pleased with our operational performance, and continue to look for innovative ways to improve upon these results.
Now, I will turn it over to Russell Ball, our CFO, to highlight some of the more interesting financial results for the year.

On slide eight, you will see our gold operating margin for 2009 grew 28% on an average realized gold price increase of 12%, demonstrating our ability to deliver gold price leverage to the bottom line. In 2009, gold operating margin of 57% is an all-time high, and this does not take into account any benefits from our copper sales, which as Richard mentioned previously, grew significantly in 2009 and we look forward to an even stronger 2010.
As you can see from this chart, historically, our margins were in the 45% to 50% range, not too dissimilar from the rest of the industry. Now, with the continuing focus on cost control, and full of exposure to rising gold, copper, and silver prices, we are seeing substantial earnings in operating cash flow growth. For the 2005 to 2009 timeframe, gold margins increased by 175% on an average realized gold price increase of 122%.
On slide nine, you can see our operating cash flows in absolute dollar terms. 2009 was a record year, as we generated almost $3 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 109% from 2008. Looking at the chart on the right side of this slide, you can see that we have an extremely strong balance sheet with over $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We have approximately $1.6 billion available under our revolving credit facility, plus approximately $1 billion in marketable securities. The $6 billion of available liquidity positions us well for funding internal growth to the development of our project pipeline, and potentially through acquisitions.
Now, I will turn it over to Guy Lansdown, our EVP for Discovery and Development, to talk about our 2009 exploration results, proven and probable reserves, and advanced products.

Looking at slide 10, as we mentioned earlier, our proven and probable gold reserves grew 8% in 2009 to approximately 92 million equity ounces, the highest result there was since 2006. At the same time, our copper reserves grew 17% to 9",844,"Thank you, Russell. Looking at slide 10, as we mentioned earlier, our proven and probable gold reserves grew 8% in 2009 to approximately 92 million equity ounces, the highest result there was since 2006. At the same time, our copper reserves grew 17% to 9.1 billion equity pounds, our highest level on record. Our exploration programs alone replaced over 90% of our gold production depletion. Gold addition came from all regions, with notable new ounces at the Gold Quarry pitch in Nevada, Boddington in Australia, underground operations across Australia and New Zealand, and at Ahafo in Ghana.
In addition to our 2009 equity copper reserves being the highest on record for Newmont, our equity copper NRM is at the highest level since 2003, largely due to the Boddington acquisition completed in January of 2009, and a greater economic interest in Batu Hijau in Indonesia. These increases, combined with our general exploration opportunities, will support future sustainability and growth in each of our operating regions. We have focused our exploration efforts across the full breadth of the (inaudible). We will continue to strengthen our reserve base, as we have budgeted $190 million to $220 million for exploration in 2010, a 10% increase from last year, 75% of which has been budgeted for new mine opportunities.
Turning to slide 11, we are excited about these two major projects in our African region, the Akyem project, which is up for a final development position and full funding approval in the third quarter of this year and as a beta expansion opportunity near our existing Ahafo operation. With respect to Akyem, as mentioned earlier this year, we recently received the mining lease from the Ghanaian government, and have commenced the necessary crop compensation and relocation work. We are committed to implementing industry-leading environmental and socially responsible practices, as we bring this project into production in late 2013 to 2014. We are extremely excited about this project, as we have come up with some innovative ways to reduce the project's capital costs and increase the return on capital. Current initial capital estimates are between $700 million and $1 billion, to produce between 480,000 and 550,000 ounces of gold per year, at average costs applicable to sales of between $350 and $450 per ounce. We are aggressively moving this project forward, and plan to spend approximately $100 million this year, 2010, on basic and detailed project engineering, land access, and building out on this team. As mentioned, we will be looking at making a go-forward decision in the third quarter of this year.
Looking at the Subika expansion project, we have identified a target of approximately 7 million to 9 million equity ounces of gold, of which approximately 3 million ounces are in proven and probable reserves, and the remainder is at earlier stages of definition, including underground operations. We began construction of an exploration beacon in February of this year, and are conducting simultaneous exploration drilling from both the surface and underground to further delineate this deposit. The Subika project will be our first underground operation in Ghana, and demonstrates the potential in and around our existing Ahafo operation.
Slide 12 highlights two other major projects, Conga in Peru, and Hope Bay in Canada. At Conga in 2010, we are advancing the permitting process in basic and detailed engineering, with a gate for full funding decision targeted for the end of the fourth quarter, depending on permitting. Conga is a large copper gold field, with consolidated reserves of approximately 12 million ounces of gold and over 3 billion pounds of copper. First production is currently anticipated for late 2014 to 2015, with average annual production of 650,000 to 750,000 ounces of gold, and 160 million to 210 million pounds of copper at competitive operating costs. The current initial capital estimate stands at between $2.5 billion and $3.4 billion, on 100% basis. Buenaventura is our partner on this project, and as with Yanacocha, Newmont earns 51.35%. We are very excited about this project. First, because it has an expected mine life in excess of 20 years, and because there is tremendous exploration potential in the district.
We are also excited about our vision for the advancement of our Hope Bay project in Canada. Positive 2009 drilling and regional exploration results, combined with a favorable review from our Jundee operations team in Australia, have reinforced our positive view of gold resource potential across the 80 kilometer Greenstone belt. We are advancing development with an underground focus, to be initiated with a decline at the Doris north deposit. Although still in the early stages, we are energized about this opportunity and we now have an experienced team and key contractors in place. With near-term development plans and district exploration for years to come, Hope Bay is a significant asset within our portfolio. We have $140 million to $170 million budgeted for 2010, primarily for exploration infrastructure and to advance the decline. We look forward to updating you on Hope Bay’s progress throughout the year.
Now, I will turn it over to Richard.

Total costs applicable to sales are expected to be between $450 and $480 per ounce, including the impacts of accounting for Boddington on a co-product basis. Total costs applicable to sales would be expected to be between $440 and $470 per ounce, including the impacts of accounting for Boddington on a by-product basis. Costs applicable to sales are up in 2010 from 2009 as a result of lower production at Yanacocha, and low production at Nevada. By the way, Boddington, on a standalone basis, would be about $295 to $315, announced on a by-product basis; and about $375 to $395, announced on a co-product basis.
Our copper production in 2010 is expected to be 350 million to 380 million pounds, at costs applicable to sales of $0.85 to $0.95 per pound, driven by higher production at Batu Hijau, and the ramp-up of slightly higher cost production at Boddington. We also expect to spend on a consolidated basis $1.4 million to $1.6 million in capital expenditures in 2010. This figure includes the capital related to aggressively advancing the development of our projects, which Guy spoke to earlier, and there is a chart in our earnings release, which goes into detail on the spending on those projects.
Moving to slide 14, at the time of our third-quarter earnings call, we announced that we believed our 2010 production would be up 5% to 10% from 2009 levels. Our outlook, as presented today, is at the bottom of that previous guidance, and I wanted to describe the major factors affecting this shift to the lower end of that range. As mentioned earlier, the biggest incremental contributor to our production profile in 2010 is Boddington, which we anticipate will produce 800,000 to 875,000 equity gold ounces in 2010. And that is slightly below our targeted 1 million ounce run rate, as we continue to ramp up to full production throughout 2010.
As you know, our Yanacocha operation continues to mature, since commercial operation began there in 1993, and we expect its production in 2010 to decline to between 750,000 and 810,000 equity gold ounces. Incrementally, this represents a decline of approximately 300,000 ounces from 2009. The primary reasons for the decline in production is lower leach placement, and lower mill ore grade. Looking forward, we expect South America’s production to remain near 2010 levels.
Turning to Nevada, our production outlook for 2010 is 1.6 million to 1.7 million equity gold ounces, approximately 17% lower than our 2009 production, due to lower production from the Carlin operations and the closure of Deep Post, partially offset by increased production at Leeville. The lower production at Carlin is due to a geotechnical event we experienced in late December at Gold Quarry, limiting access to ore that was originally scheduled to be mined in 2010 and 2011. Following the series of geotechnical mine planning and ore blending analysis conducted in January and February this year, up to approximately 150,000 equity ounces of gold production are expected to be deferred from Gold Quarry in 2010, with potential additional ounces deferred in 2011. We continue to study opportunities to safely accelerate the production of the ounces currently scheduled to be produced in 2012 and 2013. Of course, this event will not likely affect our life of mine plants for Gold Quarry, but it does defer the production of those ounces to 2012, 2013 timeframe. In total, we are expecting 2010 equity gold production to be between 5.3 million and 5.5 million ounces, which represents production growth potential of up to 5%.
Turning to copper, we expect to produce between 350 million and 380 million equity pounds of copper in 2010. That is up approximately 60% from 2009 levels. This is driven by the ramp-up of Boddington, as well as an assumed economic interest of 52.44% in Batu Hijau.
Looking at slide 15, our 2010 costs applicable to sales outlook compared to the 2009 actual figure, is that higher costs are primarily driven by lower production at Yanacocha and Nevada, as well as the change in accounting for Boddington from a by-product credit basis to co-product accounting. Boddington's low-cost production will benefit our 2010 costs applicable to sales as well, bringing the total costs applicable to sales for the year to between $450 to $480 per ounce as I mentioned earlier.
Our costs applicable to sales for copper will be slightly higher in 2010 compared to 2009, as a result of more costs being allocated to copper at Batu Hijau, as well as co-product accounting treatment at Boddington.
As previously mentioned, our consolidated capital expenditure outlook for 2010 is $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, with approximately 30% invested in each of the North America and Asia-Pacific regions, and the remaining 40% at other locations. Approximately 60% of the 2010 capital budget is allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining 40% allocated to project development, including the development of Akyem in Ghana, Conga in Peru, and Hope Bay in Canada. We will continue to provide additional information about our projects throughout the year.
In closing, our achievements in 2009 provide Newmont a strong and enduring foundation for strong operating results and project development capacity for decades to come. We have demonstrated that we have the ability to consistently deliver on our plans and do what we say we are going to do. We have also demonstrated our ability to deliver significant margin growth, and leverage to an increasing gold price. Our existing production base and focus on responsibly containing our costs have given us strong operating cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet to fund the development of our next generation of major gold and copper projects. As we embark on our next major mine development campaign, Newmont is well-positioned to take advantage of ongoing strength in metal prices. We are inspired by Newmont's ongoing transformation, as the changes we have implemented begin to yield noteworthy results for our shareholders and stakeholders.
And we are not done yet. As I stated at the beginning of this presentation, we are all committed to doing what it takes to make Newmont the most valued and respected mining company through industry-leading performance. Lastly, I again want to express my gratitude to our employees for delivering a record year, and for the foundation they are creating to ensure the future success of our company.
And with that, I would like to thank all of you for listening and open the call for questions.

What we plan on doing is pulling on from the positive exploration results that we have had is to start driving a decline. We would like to understand the resource better, understand what the extraction processes are, set up the infrastructure to continue exploring and developing, and from that point on with positive results, our plan is to go in with a phased approach with regard to putting in our processing facilities, perhaps a smaller plant down the road, but our first step is to get in with the decline this year and set up infrastructure. So, we are very excited about the project and the - both the exploration results that we have got, not only from the drill but also from our regional (inaudible) study.

I would say we did better-than-expected in terms of ramping up to commercial production, really getting the project from construction completion very rapidly into mid-November, surpassing that 65% plus sort of level of operating. I will tell you, over the last couple of months, from a mill operation standpoint, things are going very well. We have run the mill at or near capacity on several days, and I think the team is really executing very well. So in that respect, it is actually going probably beyond our expectations.
Back into the mine, I think we still have some work to do, you know, from the pit to the primary crusher, and I think we will continue to optimize this facility over the next couple of years to ensure that we have got the right balance between mine production, all the way through to refining both copper and gold, and I think, you know, overall, we feel good about where we are on Boddington, I think emphasizing that the purchase of the Anglo interest was very economic for us and I think owning 100% of that, with current operations, we feel very good about that and I think the potential on that district will I think lead us to beyond a 20-plus year mine life that we have. So at this point, I would say it goes very well for us, and we are going to be happy to have some of your guys down to take a look at it, because I think when you see the facility and how operations are going, you will this is a pretty amazing facility and we are actually doing a really great job there and compliments to the team around the world for really supporting ramping that operation up as quickly as we did.

Russell Ball
Brian, Russ. So the $287 million was the advance at 12/30/09. Subsequent to year end, we have had a small additional advance that was part of a delayed payment. In addition to that, we have had a dividend distribution. So that is roughly about $260 million today. As far as capital, there is significant cash flow coming out of Indonesia, so external financing at least for 2010 and into 2011 is not an issue. So the project self-funds if you want.

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, I’d like to begin on slide three. With our average realized gold price up 22% to $1,106 per ounce and our average realized copper price up 97% to $3.33 p",712,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, I’d like to begin on slide three. With our average realized gold price up 22% to $1,106 per ounce and our average realized copper price up 97% to $3.33 per pound from the first quarter of 2009, our first quarter operating cash flow increased from $381 million to $728 million. Our revenues also rose, increasing from $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion while our adjusted net income improved from $199 million to $408 million. As these financial results clearly indicate, we continue to offer investors substantial gold and copper price leverage.
As shown on slide four, we also continue to meet our operating targets. During the first quarter of this year, we produced 1.3 million equity ounces of gold and 90 million equity pounds of copper, with cost applicable to sales of $480 per ounce of gold and $0.78 per pound of copper. For the year, we continue to expect gold cost applicable to sales of between $450 to $480 per ounce.
In 2010, we are experiencing pressures relative to our full year 2009 CIS [ph] of $417 per ounce, primarily driven by lower production volumes in Nevada, Peru, and Ghana, and as a function of higher cost underground production at Nevada and higher mill production at Yanacocha.
The lower cost production from Boddington should offset some of these operating costs, as we ramp up the full production towards the end of this year. Additionally, the remaining third of the year’s increase over last year in CIS I is a result of higher gold prices and an unfavorable Australian dollar exchange rate. Despite these operating cost pressures, we continue to expect full year performance in line with our existing outlook.
We continue to advance our development projects with encouraging results. During the first quarter, we made progress with our engineering, optimization, permitting, and community relations (inaudible) Conga, Akyem, Hope Bay, and Nevada projects. Collectively, these opportunities currently represent up to $30 million to $40 million targeted equity ounces, a potential reserve and resource development opportunities, approximately $20 million of which are currently in proven and probable reserves, which could grow with positive exploration results over time.
Our first quarter financial and operational results speak to the strength of our commitment to execution and increasing our financial returns, as well as to the dedication of our employees around the world to deliver safely on our plans and provide the highest value to our shareholders.
Moving to slide five, we remain bullish on metal prices. Robust fundamentals, including evidence of a rebounding jewelry market in India and growth in the jewelry market in China, plus sustained industry inflows and historically low Central Bank sales continue to support gold price performance during the first quarter of 2010.
On the supply side, European and Central Bank sales were near zero, while Russia brought approximately 8 tons of gold in the first quarter, as it continues its gold purchasing program. With Central Bank sales essentially non-existent and some countries actually buying gold, extra supplies not being pushed into the market causing supply to tighten even further. In addition to these factors, we believe mine supply will also remain constrained due to declining grades on a global basis.
On the demand side, many developing economies are recovering faster than the developed counterparts, especially in countries like India and China, which are key markets for gold consumption. The continued recovery of these developing nations should have a positive impact on gold demand. In addition, medium-term concerns surrounding sovereign debt rates in some regions are likely to favor gold, as investors put their trust in gold rather than currency. Overall, investment interest in gold remains very strong, as demonstrated by a record high for the amount of gold held by ETFs reached in the first quarter.
In copper, we believe a strong pricing environment will continue to be driven by a revival of consumption both in the West and in China. Additionally, the tight copper concentrate supply will likely keep upward pressure on pricing as demonstrated by relatively low smelter processing charges.
I’d now like to turn the presentation over to Russell Ball, our CFO, who will get further into the details of our quarter.

For the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, a 46% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Net operating cash flow was approximately $728 million, a 91% increase over 2009. And our adjusted net incom",443,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning all. For the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, a 46% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Net operating cash flow was approximately $728 million, a 91% increase over 2009. And our adjusted net income rose to $408 million or roughly 105% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Higher gold and copper prices and significantly higher copper production from our assets in Indonesia were a most significant contributors to the increase in net income.
Turning to slide seven, equity gold production was approximately 1.3 million ounces, and average realized gold price was up 22% to approximately $1,100 an ounce. While the cost applicable to sales increased approximately 11% to $480 an ounce, gold operating margin expanded by 32% to $626 an ounce.
On a year-over-year basis, CIS increased from $431 to $480 an ounce, primarily due to lower production as a result of the slide late in the fourth quarter of 2009 and higher mining costs in Nevada. Lower production, higher waste mining, higher royalties and workers participation at the Yanacocha, and finally, from the ongoing ramp-up at Boddington.
As Richard mentioned earlier, for the year, we have maintained gold production and operating cost guidance despite a change on gold price assumption to $1,100 an ounce and now - or the dollar assumption to $0.90, which collectively add between $15 and $20 per ounce. The TFO more than happy to pay these increased operating costs, given the positive increase in operating margins and free cash flow that accrues.
Turning to slide eight, copper production increased 143% to 90 million pounds with an average realized price of $3.33 per pound, an improvement of 97% from the year-ago quarter. Copper production was up significantly due to the fact we are in Phase V mining at Batu Hijau this year. We will essentially complete Phase 5 mining at Batu Hijau this year, as stripping for Phase 6 will begin in earnest in 2011.
Cost applicable to sales decreased 12% to $0.78 a pound resulting in a 219% increase in our copper operating margin. As you will see on slide nine, gold margin for the quarter increased by a third to $626 per ounce despite the higher costs applicable to sales. When factoring in copper byproduct revenue as copper credits, cash operating margin increases from 58% to approximately 78%. This leverage to gold and copper prices demonstrates our ability to generate significant cash flow from our existing production base of approximately 5.3 million ounces.
I would now turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to discuss our regional operating results for the quarter.

As you can see on slide 10, each of our four regions performed essentially in line with expectations in terms of gold production, with North America’s production being just a little bit higher than what we were expecting. Costs applicable to sales were slightly higher than expected in North America due to higher underground mining costs, higher production taxes, and lower byproduct credits in Nevada.
At Yanacocha, costs applicable to sales were higher than anticipated due to higher milling costs. Lower production from the leach pads, higher workers participation, and royalty costs related to the higher realized gold price and lower byproduct credits. Costs applicable to sales at Ahafo in Ghana were slightly lower than expected due to lower power costs and lower mining costs.
Costs in the Asia-Pacific region were essentially in line with expectations of higher cost production from Boddington as a result of lower than expected gold grades was offset by lower cost production at Batu Hijau due to lower mining costs and a lower allocation of costs to gold. The other operations in Australia and New Zealand performed as expected.
In summary, the portfolio is working and we continue to expect equity gold production for the year of between 5.3 million and 5.5 million ounces and costs applicable to sales of between $450 million and $480 per ounce.
Turning to slide 11, I’m proud to give you an update on the ramp-up of Boddington. As a reminder, Boddington achieved commercial production in November of last year, and the first quarter of 2010 represents just the first full quarter of commercial production. For the first quarter, gold production increased 34% to 158,000 ounces and copper production increased 40% to 14 million pounds from the fourth quarter of 2009.
We are in the process of commissioning the fourth course ore screen that was installed late in the first quarter, and that’s progressing as planned. Overall, our gold and copper recoveries have continued to be stronger than our existing mine plan. However, we have experienced some volatility in our ore grades, resulting in lower than expected gold grades and higher than expected copper grades as we continue to reconcile the block model with our tool production.
Our site operation and commissioning teams continue to improve plant performance. The concentrator throughput is performing as expected and at levels consistent with the 12-month ramp-up schedule. And as of the end of the first quarter, total tons mined from the pit are within 10% of the current mine plan. We are hosting a site tour at the end of September, and we hope to see many of you there where we can show you more of the operation firsthand.
I also wanted to briefly mention the earthquake that we experienced near our KCGM operation last week. The 5.2 magnitude earthquake caused us to temporarily suspend operations for the safety of our employees and contractors. There were no injuries and no significant damage to our operations, and normal operations resumed the following day.
Guy Lansdown, our Executive Vice President of Discovery & Development, will now give you a brief update on our major projects.

As you know, we are very excited about our pipeline of projects that we anticipate will bring between 30 million and 40 million targeted ounces to production in the coming years, of which approximately 20 million ounces are currently in pro",737,"Thanks, Brian. As you know, we are very excited about our pipeline of projects that we anticipate will bring between 30 million and 40 million targeted ounces to production in the coming years, of which approximately 20 million ounces are currently in proven and probable reserves, which could go with positive exploration results.
We won’t get into too many details on the full extent of our project pipeline on this call. For that, we look forward to discussions with you at our Investor Day presentation on May the 27th with the intent to deep dive our projects in each of our regions.
Slide 12 shows our major projects in each of our regions. As we indicated last quarter, we are advancing development of the Hope Bay district with an underground focus of the Doris north deposit. We have increased this year’s funding for this program to between $180 million and $200 million, accelerating 2010 construction and development activities. As a result, we have increased our 2010 outlook for advanced projects R&D spending to between $230 million and $250 million, up from $185 million to $210 million.
We are currently deploying supplies for this program from multiple ports on the East and West Coast in a carefully coordinated sealift, supporting development of additional surface infrastructure and (inaudible). We are executing development and exploration drilling programs in parallel, with 18,000 meters of drilling completed so far this year, and early results supporting our resource expectations. Although we are in the early stages, we remain energized about the opportunity and the experienced team and key contractors we now have in place on the significant assets.
I also want to congratulate the Hope Bay team for recently celebrating two years without a lost time accident, over 1.2 million man hours as of April the 20th of 2010. At Conga, we had a very successful public hearing on March the 31st of this year, with over 4,000 people participating in the event, including national and local government officials, farmers and other members of the community. In addition, we continue to build the Conga development team and trade execution strategies while advancing engineering.
Our Akyem project in Ghana is expected to complete the stage 4 (inaudible) in the second half of 2010, with production still targeted for late 2013 to 2014. Following the receipts of the mining lease in January, negotiations with the local communities regarding land access and crop compensation continue. And we have now got 70% completed engineering work.
We are also excited about the Subiaco expansion where we currently have identified a target of approximately 7 million to 9 million equity ounces of gold, of which approximately 3 million are in proven and probable reserves. We are advancing simultaneously surface and underground development programs. Our exploration and development team made good progress, advancing approximately 500 meters a day, and we have completed 8,000 meters of exploration drilling this year.
Turning to slide 13, as part of our Nevada portfolio, we have excellent new explorations results (inaudible) project that provides a possibility to double our current reserve with potential to expand within and beyond the footprint shown on the slide. In an effort to better understand the potential of this core asset, we have been executing in parallel a surface drill campaign and drilling from underground platforms with approximately 20% of this program completed so far this year.
We drilled approximately 15,000 meters from surface in 2009 with the intent of better understanding the full extent of the orebody. The results of this program will be an exceptional. To highlight a few results, I would turn your attention to the map on the right. On the north end of the map, 1,000 meters beyond our end of 2009 and our reserve footprint, we have anticipated 10 meters of 13 grams per ton in the drill hole called CGXH. This combined with multiple favorable insights to the south suggest potential to expand underground minable mineralization well beyond current levels.
In addition, I would highlight the drill hole called CGX-2 where we intersected 10 meters of 22 grams per ton, roughly 250 meters to the list of previously modeled Leeville mineralization. We are excited by these new expansion discoveries in our core Nevada assets and plan to increase funding for additional inflow and step-up drilling.
I’m now going to pass the mike back to Richard for an update on our Batu Hijau ownership.

As previously announced, we recently completed the sale of the 2009 portion of the divestiture shares under our contracted work at our Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia. As you recall, in the fourth quarter, we obtained a 17% effective equity",549,"Thanks, Guy. As previously announced, we recently completed the sale of the 2009 portion of the divestiture shares under our contracted work at our Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia. As you recall, in the fourth quarter, we obtained a 17% effective equity ownership interest in PTNNT as a result of a loan made to our Indonesian equity partner.
As you see on slide 14, at year-end, we directly own 35.44% of Batu Hijau through our NTP investment with Sumitomo. Adding the 17% collateral ownership, our year-end 2009 economic ownership is 52.44% and we held that interest throughout the first quarter. In March, we finalized the sales of 2009 divestiture shares, which reduced our effective ownership position to 48.5%, which is where it stands at the end of the quarter. As a result of this sale, we’ve adjusted downward our 2010 outlook for equity copper production to between 330 million to 360 million pounds, down 20 million pounds more to previous outlook.
One final divestiture tranche remains outstanding, which is the final 7% of the PTNNT that was offered for sale on March 31, 2010. The offer price was $444 million for the 7%, or approximately $6.3 billion on a 100% basis. Once the sale closes presumably sometime later this year, our economic ownership will decline to 44.56%. At that time, the divestiture process would be complete.
Turning to slide 15, I’d like to reiterate that Newmont continues to perform well operationally and financially while simultaneously continuing to strive to maintain our leadership position in safety, sustainability and community relations. For the third consecutive year, we were selected Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, an accomplishment of which we are very proud. We also achieved International Cyanide Code Certification at all of our mines, except at Boddington where we are still to ramp up and where we should start to receive the certification in 2011.
We are in the implementation phase of our community relations review, which we envision as our roadmap to uniform and industry-leading community relations throughout the world, and we have created our global carbon management team to help us navigate through the responsibilities of being a good global citizen through management of our carbon footprint.
In closing, we had another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. And we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on what we say we will deliver. We continue to generate significant cash flow today from our gold and copper production, combined with the relentless focus on cost containment and margin expansion. We are in the process of executing on our business excellent program, which is expected to create significant value, additional value across our regions, functions, and the operations over the next three years.
We are aggressively advancing our project pipeline as well as investing in our exploration program to develop our operating assets of the future. We’d be giving a lot more detail on these efforts at our Investor Day presentation on May 27th in Boston, for which we hope many of you can join us either on person or via the webcast. I’d like to express my thanks to our dedicated employees and contractors for another outstanding quarter.
And with that, operator, I’d like to thank you all for listening and turn it back to you for questions.

John, I think if you recall, we’ve said we were looking at about a 12-month ramp-up period to get to 100% production. So we are hoping to get there around the third quarter of this year on a basis over Q1. We are actually running the plant at about 70,000, 75,000 tons, which is getting close to that 70%, 75% of capacity. And that’s essentially on target with where we are at. We are extremely pleased and happy with how the plant has ramped up. With respect to your question around the grades, for us it’s still early days. As we’ve said, we are just sort of one quarter into full production. We’ve got a number of different geological domains that we are mining. And as we mine those and reconcile them to the model, it’s really when you get actual production that we can go back and actually see how we are doing.
So as we said, we are slightly - we are slightly down on the gold grade and up on the copper grade. And I think we still need to get a couple more quarters under our belt with mining and some of the different domains to be able to come back with some more definitive answers around the reconciliation. A couple of things that we have done is we did put the fourth course ore screen in. We did leave space to be able to do that because we always knew that the dry plant might be an area where we needed to increase capacity. We are also bringing in our sixth secondary crusher, sixth MP1000. The space was left to bring that in. And these are really to help increase the rate at which we get up to full production, and in fact, they are going to allow us probably to go over a name plate capacity, as we get towards the end of this year and into 2011.

First, on the dividend, as you know, the market for gold stocks doesn’t necessarily pay an increasing value related to increasing our cash dividend. I would say though if we do anything, it’s more likely that we would probably have a cash dividend increase rather than a share buyback, because we also believe although I can’t say that financially this makes a lot of sense that it’s not clear to us the per share metrics, really drive a lot of valuation again in the market. We believe it should. And over time, as it does, I think you will see us be more responsive to increases in dividends and perhaps share buyback if we can continue to generate significant cash flow, as we are over the past three quarters really. So our balance sheet looks in good shape to develop these projects.
We are finding some interesting opportunities internally. That’s where we’d rather invest our cash versus at the external projects or an increase in the dividend, we’d rather go for growth and drive our return on assets up by having appropriate investments. And I would say that relative to external investments, we would prefer internal investments every time. That doesn’t mean that we won’t look externally, but we will look at that in terms of the trade-off between paying a premium to acquire something, issuing additional shares, because we do think that dilution matters and making sure that we properly evaluate opportunities. If we do see something in the market, for the upside that they made bring in addition to current assets. So I think a wide ranging view here in terms of our openness to look at things. But as we continue to look - I’d say, we continue to believe that exploration, the project development, and M&A are the way we are going to continue to build the company and will flex back and forth.

We have an investment agreement that was entered into - before we began the development of the households and because we knew that Akyem might at some point be developed.

So we are actually protected, if you will, against upward changes and taxes, changes in the tax structure, and upward changes in the royalty.

And what we’ve told them is that - we have a contract, but of course we will sit down and talk with them.
So what I would tell you is that while we won’t be impacted directly by some of the changes that continue to be talked about in the government and the impact on other mining companies. I would tell you that while we are protected, we do want to be a good citizen in Ghana. So we will probably make some changes over time. I don’t know what those look like.

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, I'd like to begin on Slide 3. With our average realized gold price up 22% to $1,106 per ounce and our average realized copper price up 97% to $3.33 per pou",711,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, I'd like to begin on Slide 3. With our average realized gold price up 22% to $1,106 per ounce and our average realized copper price up 97% to $3.33 per pound from the first quarter of 2009, our first quarter operating cash flow increased from $381 million to $728 million. Our revenues also rose, increasing from $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion, while our adjusted net income improved from $199 million to $408 million. As these financial results clearly indicate, we continue to offer investors substantial gold and copper price leverage. 
As shown on Slide 4, we also continue to meet our operating targets. During the first quarter this year, we produced 1.3 million equity ounces of gold and 90 million equity pounds of copper, with costs applicable to sales of $480 per ounce of gold and $0.78 per pound of copper. For the year, we continue to expect gold costs applicable to sales of between $450 to $480 per ounce. In 2010, we're experiencing pressures relative to our full year 2009 CAS of $417 per ounce, primarily driven by lower production volumes in Nevada, Peru and Ghana and as a function of higher cost underground production in Nevada and higher mill production at Yanacocha. The lower cost production from Boddington should offset some of these operating costs as we ramp up to full production towards the end of this year. Additionally, the remaining third of the year increased over last year in CAS as a result of higher gold prices and an unfavorable Australian dollar exchange rate. Despite these operating cost pressures, we continue to expect full year performance in line with our existing outlook. 
We continue to advance our development projects with encouraging results. During the first quarter, we made progress with our engineering optimization, permitting and community relations efforts on our Conga, Akyem, Hope Bay and Nevada projects. Collectively, these opportunities currently represent up to 30 million to 40 million targeted equity ounces of potential reserve and resource development opportunities, approximately 20 million of which are currently in proven and probable reserves, which could grow with positive exploration results over time.
Our first quarter financial and operational results speak to the strength of our commitment to execution and increasing our financial returns, as well as to the dedication of our employees around the world to deliver safely on our plans and provide the highest value to our shareholders.
Moving to Slide 5. We remain bullish on metal prices. Robust fundamentals, including evidence of a rebounding jewelry market in India and growth in the jewelry market in China, plus sustained investor inflows and historically low central bank sales continue to support gold price performance during the first quarter of 2010. On the supply side, European net central bank sales were near zero, while Russia bought approximately 8 tons of gold in the first quarter as it continues its gold purchasing program. With central bank sales essentially nonexistent and some countries actually buying gold, extra supply is not being pushed into the market, causing supply to tighten even further. 
In addition to these factors, we believe mine supply will also remain constrained due to declining grades on a global basis. On the demand side, many developing economies are recovering faster than the developed counterparts, especially in countries like India and China, which are key markets for gold consumption. The continued recovery of these developing nations should have a positive impact on gold demand. In addition, medium-term concerns surrounding sovereign debt risk in some regions are likely to favor gold as investors put their trust in gold rather than currency. 
Overall, investment interest in gold remains very strong as demonstrated by a record high for the amount of gold held by ETFs reached in the first quarter. In copper, we believe a strong pricing environment will continue to be driven by a revival of consumption both in the West and in China. Additionally, the tight copper concentrate supply will likely keep upward pressure on pricing as demonstrated by relatively low smelter processing charges. 
I'd now like to turn the presentation over to Russell Ball, our CFO, who will get further into the details of our quarter."

For the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, a 46% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Net operating cash flow was approximately $728 million, a 91% increase over 2009 and our adjusted net income rose to $408 million or roughly a 105% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Higher gold and copper prices and significantly higher copper production from our asset in Indonesia were the most significant contributors to the increase in net income.
Turning to Slide 7. Equity gold production was approximately 1.3 million ounces, and our average realized gold price was up 22% to approximately $1,100 an ounce. While our costs applicable to sales increased approximately 11% to $480 an ounce, gold operating margin expanded by 32% to $626 an ounce. On a year-over-year basis, CAS increased from $431 to  $480 an ounce, primarily due to lower production as a result of the slide late in the fourth quarter of 2009 and higher mining costs in Nevada; lower production, higher waste mining, higher royalties and workers participation at the Yanacocha; and finally, from the ongoing ramp-up at Boddington. As Richard mentioned earlier, for the year, we have maintained our gold production and operating cost guidance despite a change in our gold price assumption to $1,100 an ounce and in our Aussie dollar assumption to $0.90, which collectively add between $15 and $20 per ounce. As CFO, I'm more than happy to pay these increased operating costs given the positive increase in operating margin and free cash flow that accrues.
Turning to Slide 8. Copper production increased 143% to 90 million pounds, with an average realized price of $3.33 per pound, an improvement of 97% from the year-ago quarter. Copper production was up significantly due to the fact we are in Phase 5 mining at Batu Hijau this year. We will essentially complete Phase 5 mining at Batu Hijau this year and stripping for Phase 6 will begin in earnest in 2011. Costs applicable to sales decreased 12% to $0.78 a pound, resulting in a 219% increase in our copper operating margin. 
As you will see on Slide 9, gold margin for the quarter increased by a third to $626 per ounce, despite the higher costs applicable to sales. When factoring in copper byproduct revenue as copper credits, our cash operating margin increases from 58% to approximately 78%. This leverage to gold and copper prices demonstrates our ability to generate significant cash flow from our existing production base of approximately 5.3 million ounces. I will now turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to discuss our regional operating results for the quarter."

As you can see on Slide 10, each of our four regions performed essentially in line with expectations in terms of gold production, with North America's production being just a little bit higher than what we were expecting. Costs applicable to sales were slightly higher than expected in North America due to higher underground mining costs, higher production taxes and lower byproduct credits in Nevada. 
At Yanacocha, costs applicable to sales were higher than anticipated due to higher milling costs. Lower production from the leach pads, higher workers' participation and royalty costs related to the higher realized gold price and lower byproduct credits. Costs applicable to sales at Ahafo in Ghana were slightly lower than expected due to lower power costs and lower mining costs. Costs in the Asia-Pacific region were essentially in line with expectations as higher cost production from Boddington, as a result of lower-than-expected gold grades, was offset by lower cost production at Batu Hijau due to lower mining costs and a lower allocation of costs to gold. The other operations in Australia and New Zealand performed as expected.
In summary, the portfolio is working and we continue to expect equity gold production for the year of between 5.3 million and 5.5 million ounces and costs applicable to sales of between $450 and $480 per ounce.
Turning to Slide 11. I'm proud to give you an update on the ramp-up of Boddington. As a reminder, Boddington achieved commercial production in November of last year, and the first quarter of 2010 represents just the first full quarter of commercial production. For the first quarter, gold production increased 34% to 158,000 ounces and copper production increased 40% to 14  million pounds from the fourth quarter of 2009. We're in the process of commissioning the fourth coarse ore screen that was installed late in the first quarter and that's progressing as planned. Overall, our gold and copper recoveries have continued to be stronger than our existing mine plan. However, we have experienced some volatility in our ore grades resulting in lower-than-expected gold grades and higher-than-expected copper grades as we continue to reconcile the block model with actual production.
Our site operation and commissioning teams continue to improve plant performance. The concentrator throughput is performing as expected and at levels consistent with the 12-month ramp-up schedule. And as of the end of the first quarter, total tons mined from the pit are within 10% of the current mine plan. We are hosting a site tour at the end of September and we hope to see many of you there where we can show you more of the operation firsthand.
I also wanted to briefly mention the earthquake that we experienced near our KCGM operation last week. The 5.2 magnitude earthquake caused us to temporarily suspend operations for the safety of our employees and contractors. There were no injuries and no significant damage to our operations and normal operations resumed the following day. Guy Lansdown, our Executive Vice President of Discovery and Development, will now give you a brief update on our major projects."

As you know, we are very excited about our pipeline of projects that we anticipate will bring between 30 million and 40 million targeted ounces to production in the coming years, of which approximately 20 million ounces are currently in proven and probable reserves, which could grow with positive exploration results. We won't get into too many details on the full extent of our project pipeline on this call. For that, we look forward to discussions with you at our Investor Day presentation on May 27, where we intend to deep dive [ph] our projects in each of our regions.
Slide 12 shows our major projects in each of our regions. As we indicated last quarter, we are advancing development of the Hope Bay district, with an underground focus on the Doris north deposit. We have increased this year's funding for this program to between $180 million and $200 million, accelerating 2010 construction and development activities. As a result, we have increased our 2010 outlook for advanced projects R&D spending to between $230 million and $250 million, up from $185 million to $210 million. 
We are currently deploying supplies for this program from multiple ports on the East and West Coasts in a carefully coordinated sealift, supporting development of additional surface infrastructure and the decline. We are executing developmental and exploration-drilling programs in parallel with 18,000 meters of drilling completed so far this year and early results supporting our resource expectation. Although we are in the early stages, we remain energized about the opportunity and the experienced team and key contractors we now have in place on this significant asset. I also want to congratulate the Hope Bay team for recently celebrating two years without a lost time accident, over 1.2 million man hours as of April 20, 2010. 
At Conga, we had a very successful public hearing at March 31 of this year, with over 4,000 people participating in the event including national and local government officials, farmers and other members of the community. In addition, we continue to build the Conga development team and create execution strategies while advancing engineering. 
Our Akyem project in Ghana is expected to complete the Stage 4 gate review in the second half of 2010, with production still targeted for late 2013 to 2014. Following the receipt of the mining lease in January, negotiations with the local communities regarding land access and crop compensation continue, and we are now about 70% complete with engineering work. 
We are also excited about the Subika expansion, where we currently have identified a target of approximately 7 million to 9 million equity ounces of gold, of which approximately 3 million ounces are in proven and probable reserves. We're advancing simultaneous surface and underground development programs. Our exploration and development decline made good progress, advancing approximately 300 meters to date, and we have completed approximately 8,000 meters of exploration drilling this year.
Turning to Slide 13. As part of our Nevada portfolio, we have excellent new exploration results and Leeville/Turf deposit that provide the possibility to over double our current reserve with potential to expand within and beyond the footprint shown on the slide. In an effort to better understand the potential of this core asset, we have been executing in parallel a surface drill campaign and drilling from underground platforms, with approximately 20% of this program completed so far this year. We drilled approximately 15,000 meters from surface in 2009 with the intent of better understanding the full extent of the oil body. The results of this program have been exceptional. 
To highlight a few results, I would turn your attention to the map on the right. On the north end of the map, 1,000 meters beyond the end of our 2009 NRM and reserve would footprint, we have intersected 10 meters at 13 grams per ton in the drill hole called CGX8. This combined with multiple favorable intercepts to the south suggest potential to expand underground mineable mineralization well beyond current workings. 
In addition, I would highlight the drill hole called CGX2, where we intersected 10 meters at 22 grams per ton, roughly 250 meters to the west of previously modeled Leeville mineralization. We are excited by these new expansion recoveries in our core Nevada assets and plan to increase funding for additional inflow and step-out drilling. I'm now going to pass the mic back to Richard for an update on our Batu Hijau ownership."

As previously announced, we recently completed the sale of the 2009 portion of the divestiture shares under our contracted work in the Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia. As you recall, in the fourth quarter, we obtained a 17% effective equity ownership interest in PTNNT as a result of a loan made to our Indonesian equity partner. 
As you see on Slide 14, at year end, we directly owned 35.44% of Batu Hijau through our NTP investment with Sumitomo. Adding the 17% collateral ownership, our year-end 2009 economic ownership was 52.44% and we held that interest throughout the first quarter. In March, we finalized the sale of the 2009 divestiture shares, which reduced our effective ownership position to 48.5%, which is where it stands at the end of the quarter. As a result of this sale, we've adjusted downward our 2010 outlook for equity copper production to between 330 million to 360 million pounds, down 20 million pounds from our previous outlook. 
One final divestiture tranche remains outstanding, which is the final 7% of the PTNNT that was offered for sale on March 31, 2010. The offer price was $444 million for the 7% or approximately $6.3 billion on a 100% basis. Once the sale closes, presumably some time later this year, our economic ownership will decline to 44.56%. At that time, the divestiture process will be complete.
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like to reiterate that Newmont continues to perform well operationally and financially, while simultaneously continuing to strive to maintain our leadership position in safety, sustainability and community relations. For the third consecutive year, we were selected to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, an accomplishment of which we're very proud. 
We also achieved international cyanide code certification at all of our mines, except at Boddington where we're still on ramp up and where we should expect to receive the certification in 2011. We're in the implementation phase of our community relations review, which we envision as our roadmap to uniform and industry-leading community relations throughout the world. And we have created our global carbon management team to help us navigate through the responsibilities of being a good global citizen through management of our carbon footprint.
In closing, we had another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. And we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on what we say we will deliver. We continue to generate significant cash flow today from our gold and copper production, combined with a relentless focus on cost containment and margin expansion. We're in the process of executing on our business excellence program, which is expected to create significant value, additional value across our regions, functions and the operations over the next three years. We're aggressively advancing our project pipeline, as well as investing in our exploration program to develop our operating assets of the future. We'll be giving a lot more detail in these efforts at our Investor Day presentation on May 27 in Boston, where which we hope many of you can join us either in person or via the webcast.
I'd like to express my thanks to our dedicated employees and contractors for another outstanding quarter. And with that, operator, I'd like to thank you all for listening and turn it back to you for questions."

We're extremely pleased and happy with how the plant has ramped up. With respect to your question around the grades, for us, it's still early days. As we've said, we're just sort of one quarter into full production. We've got a number of different geological domains that we're mining, and as we mine those and reconcile them to the model, it's really when we get actual production that we can go back and actually see how we're doing. So as we said, we're slightly down on the gold grade and up on the copper grade, and I think we still need to get a couple more quarters under our belt of mining in some of the different domains to be able to come back with some more definitive answers around the reconciliation. A couple of things that we have done is we did put the fourth coarse ore screen in. We did leave space to be able to do that because we always knew that the dry plant might be an area where we needed to increase capacity. We're also bringing in a fixed secondary crusher, a sixth MP1000. The space was left to bring that in and these are really to help increase the rate at which we get up to full production, and in fact, they're going to allow us probably to go over nameplate capacity as we get towards the end of this year and into 2011."

As you know, the market for gold stocks doesn't necessarily pay an increasing value related to increasing our cash dividend. I would say, though, if we do anything, it's more likely that we would probably have a cash dividend increase rather than a share buyback. Because we also believe, although I can't say that financially this makes a lot of sense, but it's not clear to us that per-share metrics really drive a lot of valuation again in the market. We believe it should. And over time as it does, I think you'll see us be more responsive to increases in dividends and perhaps share buyback if we can continue to generate significant cash flow, as we are over the past three quarters, really. So our balance sheet looks in good shape to develop these projects. We are finding some interesting opportunities internally. That's where we'd rather invest our cash versus in external projects or in increasing the dividend. We'd rather go for growth and drive our return on assets up by having appropriate investments. And I would say that relative to external investments, we would prefer internal investments every time. That doesn't mean that we won't look externally, but we will look at that in terms of the trade-off between paying a premium to acquire something, issuing additional shares, because we do think that dilution matters and making sure that we properly evaluate opportunities, if we do see something in the market, for the upside that they may bring in addition to current assets. So I think a wide-ranging view here in terms of our openness to look at things, but as we continue to look, I'd say we continue to believe that exploration, project development and M&A are the way we're going to continue to build the company and we'll flex back and forth."

We have an investment agreement that was entered into before we began the development of Ahafo.

So what I would tell you is that while we won't be impacted directly by some of the changes that continue to be talked about in the government and in the impact on other mining companies, I would tell you that while we're protected, we do want to be a good citizen in Ghana, so we will probably make some changes over time. I don't know what those look like and I would tell you that because we have an agreement, they probably won't look like everybody else's.

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, I'd like to begin on Slide 3. With our average realized gold price up 22% to $1,106 per ounce and our average realized copper price up 97% to $3.33 per pou",711,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, I'd like to begin on Slide 3. With our average realized gold price up 22% to $1,106 per ounce and our average realized copper price up 97% to $3.33 per pound from the first quarter of 2009, our first quarter operating cash flow increased from $381 million to $728 million. Our revenues also rose, increasing from $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion, while our adjusted net income improved from $199 million to $408 million. As these financial results clearly indicate, we continue to offer investors substantial gold and copper price leverage. 
As shown on Slide 4, we also continue to meet our operating targets. During the first quarter this year, we produced 1.3 million equity ounces of gold and 90 million equity pounds of copper, with costs applicable to sales of $480 per ounce of gold and $0.78 per pound of copper. For the year, we continue to expect gold costs applicable to sales of between $450 to $480 per ounce. In 2010, we're experiencing pressures relative to our full year 2009 CAS of $417 per ounce, primarily driven by lower production volumes in Nevada, Peru and Ghana and as a function of higher cost underground production in Nevada and higher mill production at Yanacocha. The lower cost production from Boddington should offset some of these operating costs as we ramp up to full production towards the end of this year. Additionally, the remaining third of the year increased over last year in CAS as a result of higher gold prices and an unfavorable Australian dollar exchange rate. Despite these operating cost pressures, we continue to expect full year performance in line with our existing outlook. 
We continue to advance our development projects with encouraging results. During the first quarter, we made progress with our engineering optimization, permitting and community relations efforts on our Conga, Akyem, Hope Bay and Nevada projects. Collectively, these opportunities currently represent up to 30 million to 40 million targeted equity ounces of potential reserve and resource development opportunities, approximately 20 million of which are currently in proven and probable reserves, which could grow with positive exploration results over time.
Our first quarter financial and operational results speak to the strength of our commitment to execution and increasing our financial returns, as well as to the dedication of our employees around the world to deliver safely on our plans and provide the highest value to our shareholders.
Moving to Slide 5. We remain bullish on metal prices. Robust fundamentals, including evidence of a rebounding jewelry market in India and growth in the jewelry market in China, plus sustained investor inflows and historically low central bank sales continue to support gold price performance during the first quarter of 2010. On the supply side, European net central bank sales were near zero, while Russia bought approximately 8 tons of gold in the first quarter as it continues its gold purchasing program. With central bank sales essentially nonexistent and some countries actually buying gold, extra supply is not being pushed into the market, causing supply to tighten even further. 
In addition to these factors, we believe mine supply will also remain constrained due to declining grades on a global basis. On the demand side, many developing economies are recovering faster than the developed counterparts, especially in countries like India and China, which are key markets for gold consumption. The continued recovery of these developing nations should have a positive impact on gold demand. In addition, medium-term concerns surrounding sovereign debt risk in some regions are likely to favor gold as investors put their trust in gold rather than currency. 
Overall, investment interest in gold remains very strong as demonstrated by a record high for the amount of gold held by ETFs reached in the first quarter. In copper, we believe a strong pricing environment will continue to be driven by a revival of consumption both in the West and in China. Additionally, the tight copper concentrate supply will likely keep upward pressure on pricing as demonstrated by relatively low smelter processing charges. 
I'd now like to turn the presentation over to Russell Ball, our CFO, who will get further into the details of our quarter."

For the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, a 46% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Net operating cash flow was approximately $728 million, a 91% increase over 2009 and our adjusted net income rose to $408 million or roughly a 105% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Higher gold and copper prices and significantly higher copper production from our asset in Indonesia were the most significant contributors to the increase in net income.
Turning to Slide 7. Equity gold production was approximately 1.3 million ounces, and our average realized gold price was up 22% to approximately $1,100 an ounce. While our costs applicable to sales increased approximately 11% to $480 an ounce, gold operating margin expanded by 32% to $626 an ounce. On a year-over-year basis, CAS increased from $431 to  $480 an ounce, primarily due to lower production as a result of the slide late in the fourth quarter of 2009 and higher mining costs in Nevada; lower production, higher waste mining, higher royalties and workers participation at the Yanacocha; and finally, from the ongoing ramp-up at Boddington. As Richard mentioned earlier, for the year, we have maintained our gold production and operating cost guidance despite a change in our gold price assumption to $1,100 an ounce and in our Aussie dollar assumption to $0.90, which collectively add between $15 and $20 per ounce. As CFO, I'm more than happy to pay these increased operating costs given the positive increase in operating margin and free cash flow that accrues.
Turning to Slide 8. Copper production increased 143% to 90 million pounds, with an average realized price of $3.33 per pound, an improvement of 97% from the year-ago quarter. Copper production was up significantly due to the fact we are in Phase 5 mining at Batu Hijau this year. We will essentially complete Phase 5 mining at Batu Hijau this year and stripping for Phase 6 will begin in earnest in 2011. Costs applicable to sales decreased 12% to $0.78 a pound, resulting in a 219% increase in our copper operating margin. 
As you will see on Slide 9, gold margin for the quarter increased by a third to $626 per ounce, despite the higher costs applicable to sales. When factoring in copper byproduct revenue as copper credits, our cash operating margin increases from 58% to approximately 78%. This leverage to gold and copper prices demonstrates our ability to generate significant cash flow from our existing production base of approximately 5.3 million ounces. I will now turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to discuss our regional operating results for the quarter."

As you can see on Slide 10, each of our four regions performed essentially in line with expectations in terms of gold production, with North America's production being just a little bit higher than what we were expecting. Costs applicable to sales were slightly higher than expected in North America due to higher underground mining costs, higher production taxes and lower byproduct credits in Nevada. 
At Yanacocha, costs applicable to sales were higher than anticipated due to higher milling costs. Lower production from the leach pads, higher workers' participation and royalty costs related to the higher realized gold price and lower byproduct credits. Costs applicable to sales at Ahafo in Ghana were slightly lower than expected due to lower power costs and lower mining costs. Costs in the Asia-Pacific region were essentially in line with expectations as higher cost production from Boddington, as a result of lower-than-expected gold grades, was offset by lower cost production at Batu Hijau due to lower mining costs and a lower allocation of costs to gold. The other operations in Australia and New Zealand performed as expected.
In summary, the portfolio is working and we continue to expect equity gold production for the year of between 5.3 million and 5.5 million ounces and costs applicable to sales of between $450 and $480 per ounce.
Turning to Slide 11. I'm proud to give you an update on the ramp-up of Boddington. As a reminder, Boddington achieved commercial production in November of last year, and the first quarter of 2010 represents just the first full quarter of commercial production. For the first quarter, gold production increased 34% to 158,000 ounces and copper production increased 40% to 14  million pounds from the fourth quarter of 2009. We're in the process of commissioning the fourth course ore screen that was installed late in the first quarter and that's progressing as planned. Overall, our gold and copper recoveries have continued to be stronger than our existing mine plan. However, we have experienced some volatility in our ore grades resulting in lower-than-expected gold grades and higher-than-expected copper grades as we continue to reconcile the block model with actual production.
Our site operation and commissioning teams continue to improve plant performance. The concentrator throughput is performing as expected and at levels consistent with the 12-month ramp-up schedule. And as of the end of the first quarter, total tons mined from the pit are within 10% of the current mine plan. We are hosting a site tour at the end of September and we hope to see many of you there where we can show you more of the operation firsthand.
I also wanted to briefly mention the earthquake that we experienced near our KCGM operation last week. The 5.2 magnitude earthquake caused us to temporarily suspend operations for the safety of our employees and contractors. There were no injuries and no significant damage to our operations and normal operations resumed the following day. Guy Lansdown, our Executive Vice President of Discovery and Development, will now give you a brief update on our major projects."

As you know, we are very excited about our pipeline of projects that we anticipate will bring between 30 and 40 million targeted ounces to production in the coming years, of which approximately 20 million ounces are currently in proven and probable reserves, which could grow with positive exploration results. We won't get into too many details on the full extent of our project pipeline on this call. For that, we look forward to discussions with you at our Investor Day presentation on May the 27th, where we intend to deep dive [ph] our projects in each of our regions.
Slide 12 shows our major projects in each of our regions. As we indicated last quarter, we are advancing development of the Hope Bay district, with an underground focus at the Doris North deposit. We have increased this year's funding for this program to between $180 million and $200 million, accelerating 2010 construction and development activities. As a result, we have increased our 2010 outlook for advanced projects R&D spending to between $230 million and $250 million, up from $185 million to $210 million. 
We are currently deploying supplies for this program from multiple ports on the East and West Coasts in a carefully coordinated sealift, supporting development of additional surface infrastructure and the decline. We are executing development and exploration-drilling programs in parallel with 18,000 meters of drilling completed so far this year and early results supporting our resource expectation. Although we are in the early stages, we remain energized about the opportunity and the experienced team and key contractors we now have in place on this significant asset. I also want to congratulate the Hope Bay team for recently celebrating two years without a lost time accident, over 1.2 million man hours as of April the 20th, 2010. 
At Conga, we had a very successful public hearing at March the 31st of this year, with over 4,000 people participating in the event including national and local government officials, farmers and other members of the community. In addition, we continue to build the Conga development team and create execution strategies while advancing engineering. 
Our Akyem project in Ghana is expected to complete the Stage 4 gate review in the second half of 2010, with production still targeted for late 2013 to 2014. Following the receipt of the mining lease in January, negotiations with the local communities regarding land access and crop compensation continue, and we are now about 70% complete with engineering work. 
We are also excited about the Subika expansion, where we currently have identified a target of approximately 7 to 9 million equity ounces of gold, of which approximately 3 million ounces are in proven and probable reserves. We're advancing simultaneous surface and underground development programs. Our exploration and development decline made good progress, advancing approximately 500 meters to date, and we have completed approximately 8,000 meters of exploration drilling this year.
Turning to Slide 13. As part of our Nevada portfolio, we have excellent new exploration results at our Leeville/Turf deposit that provide the possibility to over double our current reserve with potential to expand within and beyond the footprint shown on the slide. In an effort to better understand the potential of this core asset, we have been executing in parallel a surface drill campaign and drilling from underground platforms, with approximately 20% of this program completed so far this year. We drilled approximately 15,000 meters from surface in 2009 with the intent of better understanding the full extent of the oil body. The results of this program have been exceptional. 
To highlight a few results, I would turn your attention to the map on the right. On the north end of the map, 1,000 meters beyond the end of our 2009 NRM and reserve would footprint, we have intersected 10 meters at 13 grams per ton in the drill hole called CGX8. This combined with multiple favorable intercepts to the south suggest potential to expand underground mineable mineralization well beyond current workings. 
In addition, I would highlight the drill hole called CGX2, where we intersected 10 meters at 22 grams per ton, roughly 250 meters to the west of previously modeled Leeville mineralization. We are excited by these new expansion recoveries in our core Nevada assets and plan to increase funding for additional inflow and step-out drilling. I'm now going to pass the mic back to Richard for an update on our Batu Hijau ownership."

As previously announced, we recently completed the sale of the 2009 portion of the divestiture shares under our contracted work in the Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia. As you recall, in the fourth quarter, we obtained a 17% effective equity ownership interest in PTNNT as a result of a loan made to our Indonesian equity partner. 
As you see on Slide 14, at year end, we directly owned 35.44% of Batu Hijau through our NTP investment with Sumitomo. Adding the 17% collateral ownership, our year-end 2009 economic ownership was 52.44% and we held that interest throughout the first quarter. In March, we finalized the sale of the 2009 divestiture shares, which reduced our effective ownership position to 48.5%, which is where it stands at the end of the quarter. As a result of this sale, we've adjusted downward our 2010 outlook for equity copper production to between 330 million to 360 million pounds, down 20 million pounds from our previous outlook. 
One final divestiture tranche remains outstanding, which is the final 7% of the PTNNT that was offered for sale on March 31, 2010. The offer price was $444 million for the 7% or approximately $6.3 billion on a 100% basis. Once the sale closes, presumably some time later this year, our economic ownership will decline to 44.56%. At that time, the divestiture process will be complete.
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like to reiterate that Newmont continues to perform well operationally and financially, while simultaneously continuing to strive to maintain our leadership position in safety, sustainability and community relations. For the third consecutive year, we were selected to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, an accomplishment of which we're very proud. 
We also achieved international cyanide code certification at all of our mines, except at Boddington where we're still on ramp up and where we should expect to receive the certification in 2011. We're in the implementation phase of our community relations review, which we envision as our roadmap to uniform and industry-leading community relations throughout the world. And we have created our global carbon management team to help us navigate through the responsibilities of being a good global citizen through management of our carbon footprint.
In closing, we had another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. And we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on what we say we will deliver. We continue to generate significant cash flow today from our gold and copper production, combined with a relentless focus on cost containment and margin expansion. We're in the process of executing on our business excellence program, which is expected to create significant value, additional value across our regions, functions and the operations over the next three years. We're aggressively advancing our project pipeline, as well as investing in our exploration program to develop our operating assets of the future. We'll be giving a lot more detail in these efforts at our Investor Day presentation on May 27 in Boston, where which we hope many of you can join us either in person or via the webcast.
I'd like to express my thanks to our dedicated employees and contractors for another outstanding quarter. And with that, operator, I'd like to thank you all for listening and turn it back to you for questions."

We're actually running the plant at about 70,000, 75,000 tons, which is getting close to that 70%, 75% of capacity. And that's essentially on target with where we're at. We're extremely pleased and happy with how the plant has ramped up. With respect to your question around the grades, for us, it's still early days. As we've said, we're just sort of one quarter into full production. We've got a number of different geological domains that we're mining, and as we mine those and reconcile them to the model, it's really when we get actual production that we can go back and actually see how we're doing. So as we said, we're slightly down on the gold grade and up on the copper grade, and I think we still need to get a couple more quarters under our belt of mining in some of the different domains to be able to come back with some more definitive answers around the reconciliation. A couple of things that we have done is we did put the fourth coarse ore screen in. We did leave space to be able to do that because we always knew that the dry plant might be an area where we needed to increase capacity. We're also bringing in a fixed secondary crusher, a sixth MP1000. The space was left to bring that in and these are really to help increase the rate at which we get up to full production, and in fact, they're going to allow us probably to go over nameplate capacity as we get towards the end of this year and into 2011."

So my question is where is management's thinking in terms of when would it make sense if, to raise a dividend in the future, what would you favor, a higher cash dividend or share buybacks? And then in terms of your growth, obviously, there's some M&A opportunities happening overseas. Just wanted to get your view as to if you believe your best growth options are internal, as you've highlighted in Nevada and possibly in Africa medium term."

As you know, the market for gold stocks doesn't necessarily pay an increasing value related to increasing our cash dividend. I would say, though, if we do anything, it's more likely that we would probably have a cash dividend increase rather than a share buyback. Because we also believe, although I can't say that financially this makes a lot of sense, but it's not clear to us that per-share metrics really drive a lot of valuation again in the market. We believe it should. And over time as it does, I think you'll see us be more responsive to increases in dividends and perhaps share buyback if we can continue to generate significant cash flow, as we are over the past three quarters, really. So our balance sheet looks in good shape to develop these projects. We are finding some interesting opportunities internally. That's where we'd rather invest our cash versus in external projects or in increasing the dividend. We'd rather go for growth and drive our return on assets up by having appropriate investments. And I would say that relative to external investments, we would prefer internal investments every time. That doesn't mean that we won't look externally, but we will look at that in terms of the trade-off between paying a premium to acquire something, issuing additional shares, because we do think that dilution matters and making sure that we properly evaluate opportunities, if we do see something in the market, for the upside that they may bring in addition to current assets. So I think a wide-ranging view here in terms of our openness to look at things, but as we continue to look, I'd say we continue to believe that exploration, project development and M&A are the way we're going to continue to build the company and we'll flex back and forth."

I don't know what those look like and I would tell you that because we have an agreement, they probably won't look like everybody else's. But we will try to make sure that while we assure shareholders a return, that if we continue to be in an environment of higher gold prices, that we do reflect some additional return back to Ghana.

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we will start on Slide 3 with an overview of the investment thesis for Newmont. First, our ongoing focus on execution and maintaining our operating track record has been and will continue to be job one for us. With consistent operational execution comes gold price leverage and strong cash flow generating capacity, which in turn, provides us with balance sheet strength and the flexibility to invest in our business. Delivering operating performance today provides us with the possibilities of the future. As we've described before, our current balance sheet and free cash flow generation afford us the ability to essentially pre-fund our $4 billion to $5 billion pipeline of advanced projects. Finally, we continue to focus on maintaining a position of leadership in the areas of safety, the environmental and social responsibility, as well as employee development. These leadership positions are the cornerstone upon which our business continues to be built.
Moving to Slide 4, as I noted before, our focus on dedication to operational execution is job one. During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.3 million equity ounces of gold at cost applicable to sales of $492 per ounce, with our North American region contributing 36% of total quarterly equity gold production, South America contributing 14% and Africa contributing 10%. Our Asia-Pacific region contributed the remaining 40% of our quarterly gold production and the majority of our 80 million pounds of equity copper production. 
Within our APAC region, our newest mine, Boddington, continues ramping up to full capacity and produced 184,000 ounces of gold and 15 million pounds of copper in the quarter. We are maintaining our overall outlook for full year 2010 gold and copper production, capital expenditures and gold operating costs within the original ranges we provided in February, although lower production at Yanacocha, higher cost ramp up production at Boddington, higher gold royalties and taxes, as well as adverse movements in the Australian dollar continue to put upward pressure on our costs, which suggest we'll end the year toward the top end of this CAS range.
Turning to Slide 5, as I noted before, our strong cash flow generation, coupled with over $6 billion of liquidity, affords us considerable flexibility to profitably develop our business and generate returns to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we generated $753 million of operating cash flow, up about 50% over last year and $434 million of free cash flow. For the first two quarters, we generated a total of approximately $1.5 billion of operating cash flow and $875 million of free cash flow. As you may have also seen earlier this week, Moody's upgraded our senior debt rating from a rating of BAA2 to BAA1.
As this slide highlights, we intend to continue to invest our free cash flow and available liquidity in a combination of project development, exploration and value-oriented acquisition opportunities. In addition to investing in our business when our liquidity and free cash flow generating capacity allows, we will also look for opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Today, we are pleased to announce that the board has approved a 50% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, or an indicated annual dividend of $0.60 per share, effective September 29. We believe that our business is strong enough to both reinvest capital at attractive returns and offer higher dividends in a higher metal price environment, which we feel positions us uniquely in the gold equity market, as well as against the gold ETF.
As we discussed during our investor day in Boston, we're intent on providing investors with a sustainable range of gold and copper production over time that offers current and ongoing exposure to gold price, as well as competitive financial returns. We continue to see numerous internal attractive project development opportunities. Akyem and Conga, along with Hope Bay, Greater Leeville/Turf and Gold Quarry West Wall collectively represent up to 30 million to 45 million equity ounces of potential reserve and resource development, of which approximately 20 million are currently in proven and profitable reserves. We believe the combination of our pipeline of projects and our exploration portfolio will continue to allow us to extend the lives of our operating regions for many years to come.
I'll now turn the presentation over to Russell Ball, our CFO, who will provide further details on our second quarter results."
291795,99084144,70109,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Good morning, all. Moving to Slide 6, as Richard previously mentioned, equity gold production for the quarter was approximately 1.3 million ounces, an increase of 10% and at an average realized gold price of $1,200 an ounce, an increase o",533,"Thanks, Richard. Good morning, all. Moving to Slide 6, as Richard previously mentioned, equity gold production for the quarter was approximately 1.3 million ounces, an increase of 10% and at an average realized gold price of $1,200 an ounce, an increase of 31%. Gold operating margins expanded 44% to $708 an ounce, despite a 16% increase in operating costs.
Moving to Slide 7. I wanted to spend a little time discussing the reasons for the increase in operating costs. As you can see on the waterfall, lower production at Yanacocha, where we encountered unexpected transitional wall that was stockpiled for future processing through the mill and higher cost production at Boddington, which Brian Hill will cover shortly, were the primary drivers of higher costs for the quarter. Higher silver byproduct credits offset some of the cost increases, which you can see represented on that waterfall.
Turning to copper on Slide 8. Production increased 56% to 80 million pounds as a result of Phase V mining at Batu Hijau and the ramp up at Boddington. The average realized copper price of $233 per pound improved by 7% from the year-ago quarter, but included a provisional pricing adjustment of $0.62 a pound. Higher operating costs were due to higher milling costs at Batu Hijau and higher cost Boddington production coming online.
Moving to Slide 9. For the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, a 38% increase. Net operating cash flow from continuing operations was $753 million, a 49% increase, and adjusted net income rose to $377 million or $0.70 a share, an increase of 79%. For the quarter, reported net income was negatively impacted by a couple of items. You might have noticed we had a higher effective tax rate of 33.6% versus 29.6% in 2009 and approximately 15% in the first quarter. The difference of roughly 4% quarter-on-quarter impacted earnings per share by about $0.07 a share. Notwithstanding a higher tax rate this quarter, our effective tax rate for 2010 remains unchanged at between 24% and 28%. We had a copper provisional pricing adjustment, as previously mentioned, of about $79 million, which impacted earnings per share by about $0.06 a share. 
We marked to market at quarter end at $296 a pound. I think this morning checking earlier, copper was trading around $325, so we will see most of that come back in the third quarter. And finally, we had a delayed shipment of about 30,000 tons of copper concentrate from Batu Hijau that was scheduled for quarter end, and it got rolled into the third quarter, which impacted earnings by about $0.03. So you can see the impact of that on the second quarter, and most of that will come back in the third quarter. So when you step back and look at it, I think the key job for us to deliver significant gold price leverage to the bottom line and that's what you saw in the quarter. We had a 79% increase in earnings per share on a 31% increase in average realized gold price.
I will now turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations to discuss our regional operating results for the quarter."
291795,99084144,70109,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Russell. As you can see on Slide 10, North America produced 463,000 ounces of gold, up 4% from the year-ago quarter.

As you can see on Slide 10, North America produced 463,000 ounces of gold, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to higher production at La Herradura due to commencement of production in the new Soledad and Dipolos pits, as well as underground increases at Midas and Leeville. This was offset by lower leached ore production and reduced production as a result of the Gold Quarry Slide. Costs applicable to sales were $585 per ounce, up 9% due to a higher proportion of underground mining and additional surface costs due to the Gold Quarry Slide. We continue to expect North America to produce between 1.7 million and 1.9 million ounces of gold for the year within our original CAS outlook range of $575 to $615 per ounce. 
In South America, we produced 181,000 equity ounces, a decrease of 32% from the prior year. This decrease is due to lower mill ore grade and recovery, combined with lower leach tons placed due to the stockpiling of transitional ore. Costs applicable to sales were $389 per ounce, up 20% from 2009 due to lower production, higher waste mining and higher maintenance costs, production taxes and royalties as a result of the higher gold price. We anticipate Yanacocha to have a strong second half. South America is on track to produce between 750,000 and 810,000 equity ounces of gold for the year. However, we believe CAS may come in at the high end of the original outlook range of $360 to $400 an ounce due to lower than expected leach tons placed and silver byproduct credits.
In Africa, we produced 132,000 ounces, a slight decline from 2009 due to lower grade and recovery as we have moved out of the Subika pit and into the Apensu and Awonsu pits, offset partially by higher throughput. Costs applicable to sales decreased 3% to $416 per ounce due to lower milling costs, partially offset by higher fuel costs. We are pleased to report we have increased our outlook for full-year production at Ahafo to between 500,000 and 530,000 ounces, and our costs applicable to sales outlook has been lowered to between $475 and $515 per ounce as we are seeing higher grades than projected.
In APAC, we produced 522,000 equity ounces of gold, a 64% increase over 2009, primarily due to production at Boddington, which was not in production during the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, we benefited from higher production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales in Asia-Pacific were up 17%, primarily due to higher cost production from Boddington during the ramp up, a stronger Australian dollar and lower production at the Tanami due to mill availability issues.
Moving to Slide 11, as Richard mentioned, we continue to ramp up production at Boddington, having declared commercial production in November 2009. For the second quarter, gold production increased 16% from the first quarter of 2010 to 184,000 ounces, and copper production increased 13% to 15 million pounds. The processing plant continues to perform in line with our expectations and should achieve nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter. In the first three weeks of July, we saw the plant operating at approximately 97% of capacity. However, costs applicable to sales have been higher than anticipated due to a stronger Australian dollar and higher than expected mining costs during the ramp up.
On Slide 12, now that we are several months into the ramp up, we wanted to give you an update on some of the positives and challenges since we started delivering ore to the plant last year. On the positive side, recoveries for both gold and copper have exceeded feasibility study estimates to date. We have also mined 23% more contained copper than modeled, with higher-quality concentrate helped by better than anticipated performance by the high-pressure grinding rolls and the wet plant. However, we have encountered approximately 12% lower than modeled contained gold thus far, offset somewhat by 23% more contained copper. In addition to in the dry plant, we are seeing higher wear in the primary and secondary pressure circuits than we expected. We have also seen mining costs higher than expected due to increased costs related to drilling and blasting and stockpile re-handling. As a result, equity gold production for 2010 is now expected between 750,000 and 825,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales on a co-product basis of $475 to $550 per ounce. For the reasons just discussed, we believe we will achieve the 2010 copper production outlook of between 65 million and 75 million pounds. We now believe copper costs applicable to sales could be between $1.55 and $1.75 per pound.
Looking ahead to 2011, as the mine begins its first year of steady-state production, we expect equity gold production at Boddington to be between 850,000 and 925,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $475 and $525 per ounce, which we believe to be conservative given the expected increase in production. Beyond 2011, our outlook for Boddington's operating performance is subject to further data collection and analysis as we gain more experience with the mine. I want to highlight the fact that we have only mined 2% of the reserves of this 20-plus year mine life asset, and feel that it is too soon to draw conclusions on the long-term impact of the model reconciliation experience during ramp up.
Turning to Slide 11, I'd like to give a brief discussion on Batu Hijau. The second quarter was anticipated to be a strong quarter as we began to access higher grade ore from the bottom of Phase 5 in the traditional dry season. As you can see from this photo taken on April 25, we experienced unseasonably heavy rainfall during the quarter, limiting our access to the bottom of the pit and requiring us to produce from lower grade stockpiles. We believe that we should be able to make up this delayed production in the second half of the year, assuming a normal dry season pattern and are maintaining our original production outlook. 
As an update to our ownership position, no shares were divested during the quarter, and our effective economic interest remains at 48.1/2%. We offered the final 7% ownership stake for sale in March, and negotiations of the purchase price are still underway with the Central Government. So what does this all mean for our full-year outlook? 
As you can see on Slide 14, our portfolio continues to perform as we continue to expect full-year gold production in the range of our original outlook of 5.3 million  to 5.5 million ounces. However, we are tightening our outlook for CAS to the narrow range of $460 to $480 per ounce based on the factors we've already spoken about. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Richard."

We're also ranked 16th overall on the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list co-filed by Corporate Responsibility Magazine., and Newmont is the sole mining company featured in the top 20. In addition, in May, we were announced as the winner of 2010 Global Business Coalition Award for our Workplace Malaria and HIV/AIDS program in Ghana. And just in the past few weeks, Newmont was awarded the 2010 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award.

We're very proud to support our employees who dedicate their time and effort to the Reserves and to our country, and we appreciate the government's recognition of our employee support.
Turning to the last slide, in summary, we continue to generate significant free cash flow in the strong metal price environment. We're pleased to be in a position to increase cash returns to our shareholders in the form of a dividend increase, as well as to continue to drive sustainable longer-term returns, through developing our most prospective projects, continuing to fund exploration opportunities and considering strategic value-oriented M&A transactions. We do anticipate a strong second half of the year as we continue to focus on execution, and we are confident that we can once again deliver on our annual guidance for production, costs applicable to sales and capital expenditures, generating operating cash flow that is leveraged to gold price and allows us to reinvest in our business and return cash to shareholders.

First of all, Phoenix experienced a number of issues related to the oxide zone. There was a much bigger oxide zone in the Phoenix deposit that caused problems in the mill. The mill  wasn't designed to handle that. At Boddington, all of our material is primarily sulfide so we're not going to see that issue. Phoenix had a significant amount of historical data in non-core drilling that has proved be biased, and that led an overestimation of gold. At Boddington, most of the drilling is being completed under the control of Newmont and its partners. And finally, Phoenix has coarse gold that led to estimation issues and difficulties in ore control misclassification. The deposit type at Phoenix is SCRUM and those are notoriously difficult to model and predict. Boddington is not a SCRUM deposit, and while coarse gold does exist, the gold particle size is much finer and it doesn't make up as large a percentage of the contained metal as it did at Phoenix. Also building on what Richard said, there's been a tremendous amount of work done on the model itself. There's a number of work done by many, many different sources. We've got a strong underlying drill hole database that we've had numerous external audits and continuous QA/QC programs. The data is dominated by core drilling, which had excellent recovery and check assays during the course of the feasibility study suggested that the database was actually conservative. Now just building on the reviews that have been done, we had 10 external reviews during the feasibility study and eight external reviews since that time. Numerous internal reviews by Newmont and, of course, we had our partners Newcrest and Anglo involved at the same time. So in addition to that, we mine test pits early on, which demonstrated the grade should have been above expectation. Additionally, it's a very large deposit, it's very well drilled and it should be robust, and I have to reemphasize that it's still very early days with only 2% of the ore body mined to date. But we've got a much better database and much more confidence in the underlying data for this deposit."

The other thing that we've also started is we've also started all of the dry season work, including the work we can do now that we have the pinjim cokeye [ph] [12:13] to be in position for stripping in Phase 6 and all the other drainage work and re-diversion work around the pit that we need to do so we can get stripping going in Phase 6."

So we've been seeing shorter life coming out of the bowls, mantles and other wear components. That's led us to be changing some of those out quicker and on shorter schedules than we'd originally expected. I guess what we are seeing is we are seeing that the average hours between change out are increasing. So just as everybody works through getting the right wear material, the right composition of wear material, I think we expect to see those numbers come down on wear in the plant. The high-pressure grinding rolls are wearing as expected, which for us we're really pleased about that. We expected to get around 5,200 hours on those and that's precisely what we're seeing. So we've had some wins in the process plant, and we're also seeing some wear issues there, which wasn't unexpected and we'd actually anticipated that. In the mine, what we've experienced is we've tightened up the drill pattern. We're really trying to get that optimum fragmentation size so that we can get the mine to mill process optimized. Our drill spacing is tighter. We've had to do more drilling than we've expected. We've also increased the powder factor. That's still a learning process we're going through, but that's one of the issues contributing to the higher cost. Another issue, too, is we've been trying to get the highest grade through the mine. So we've actually been going to more selective mining and more stockpiling and more re-handle coming off the stockpiles so we can really optimize the grade that we present to the primary crusher and into the plant. So those are really the principle components that have led to the higher operating costs."

So really, as we do look into 2011, our current expectation is that Boddington will be between 850,000 and 925,000 ounces. That's the level that we project today. I would say with only 2% of the reserves mined to date, all the data that Guy has talked about with respect to how we modeled this deposit initially and with the fact that most of this problem is really mining related, not processing related,  I got to say, I hold out high hopes that we'll continue to work our way through this positively. I like to have the problems in the mine. That's what we're good at. We will figure this out. The processing plant is running well, and I think with that, I think the expectation is that we can push the processing plant up beyond nameplate capacity. And if we need to put more ore through the mill at a lower grade to get additional recoveries, I hope that that's the plan that we'll be able to put into effect."

As Richard said, we've looked at putting another $25 million of funding into this because of the great success we've had earlier in the year, and that would support 22 new surface holes that would extend the project 3,500 meters or two miles north and about 1,000 meters east and the west from the Leeville shaft. We've drilled six of those holes on the program, with the first three holes complete and results are still pending. But a lot of excitement around Leeville, and still trying to get our hands around what the bigger project looks like. While we're doing that, we're also looking at how to optimize this from a throughput perspective. Do we need more shafts? What's the best way to exploit the asset that we've got out there.

And now I will turn the call over to Richard O'Brien, our President and Chief Executive Officer."

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we will start on Slide 3 with an overview of the investment thesis for Newmont.

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we will start on Slide 3 with an overview of the investment thesis for Newmont. First, our ongoing focus on execution and maintaining our operating track record has been and will continue to be job one for us. With consistent operational execution comes gold price leverage and strong cash flow generating capacity, which in turn, provides us with balance sheet strength and the flexibility to invest in our business. Delivering operating performance today provides us with the possibilities of the future. As we've described before, our current balance sheet and free cash flow generation afford us the ability to essentially pre-fund our $4 billion to $5 billion pipeline of advanced projects. Finally, we continue to focus on maintaining a position of leadership in the areas of safety, the environmental and social responsibility, as well as employee development. These leadership positions are the cornerstone upon which our business continues to be built.
Moving to Slide 4, as I noted before, our focus on dedication to operational execution is job one. During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.3 million equity ounces of gold at cost applicable to sales of $492 per ounce, with our North American region contributing 36% of total quarterly equity gold production, South America contributing 14% and Africa contributing 10%. Our Asia-Pacific region contributed the remaining 40% of our quarterly gold production and the majority of our 80 million pounds of equity copper production. 
Within our APAC region, our newest mine, Boddington, continues ramping up to full capacity and produced 184,000 ounces of gold and 15 million pounds of copper in the quarter. We are maintaining our overall outlook for full year 2010 gold and copper production, capital expenditures and gold operating costs within the original ranges we provided in February, although lower production at Yanacocha, higher cost ramp up production at Boddington, higher gold royalties and taxes, as well as adverse movements in the Australian dollar continue to put upward pressure on our costs, which suggest we'll end the year toward the top end of this CAS range.
Turning to Slide 5, as I noted before, our strong cash flow generation, coupled with over $6 billion of liquidity, affords us considerable flexibility to profitably develop our business and generate returns to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we generated $753 million of operating cash flow, up about 50% over last year and $434 million of free cash flow. For the first two quarters, we generated a total of approximately $1.5 billion of operating cash flow and $875 million of free cash flow. As you may have also seen earlier this week, Moody's upgraded our senior debt rating from a rating of BAA2 to BAA1.
As this slide highlights, we intend to continue to invest our free cash flow and available liquidity in a combination of project development, exploration and value-oriented acquisition opportunities. In addition to investing in our business when our liquidity and free cash flow generating capacity allows, we will also look for opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Today, we are pleased to announce that the board has approved a 50% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, or an indicated annual dividend of $0.60 per share, effective September 29. We believe that our business is strong enough to both reinvest capital at attractive returns and offer higher dividends in a higher metal price environment, which we feel positions us uniquely in the gold equity market, as well as against the gold ETF.
As we discussed during our investor day in Boston, we're intent on providing investors with a sustainable range of gold and copper production over time that offers current and ongoing exposure to gold price, as well as competitive financial returns. We continue to see numerous internal attractive project development opportunities. Akyem and Conga, along with Hope Bay, Greater Leeville/Turf and Gold Quarry West Wall collectively represent up to 30 million to 45 million equity ounces of potential reserve and resource development, of which approximately 20 million are currently in proven and profitable reserves. We believe the combination of our pipeline of projects and our exploration portfolio will continue to allow us to extend the lives of our operating regions for many years to come.
I'll now turn the presentation over to Russell Ball, our CFO, who will provide further details on our second quarter results."

Moving to Slide 6, as Richard previously mentioned, equity gold production for the quarter was approximately 1.3 million ounces, an increase of 10% and at an average realized gold price of $1,200 an ounce, an increase o",532,"Thanks, Richard. Good morning, all. Moving to Slide 6, as Richard previously mentioned, equity gold production for the quarter was approximately 1.3 million ounces, an increase of 10% and at an average realized gold price of $1,200 an ounce, an increase of 31%. Gold operating margins expanded 44% to $708 an ounce, despite a 16% increase in operating costs.
Moving to Slide 7. I wanted to spend a little time discussing the reasons for the increase in operating costs. As you can see on the waterfall, lower production at Yanacocha, where we encountered unexpected transitional wall that was stockpiled for future processing through the mill and higher cost production at Boddington, which Brian Hill will cover shortly, were the primary drivers of higher costs for the quarter. Higher silver by-product credits offset some of the cost increases, which you can see represented on that waterfall.
Turning to copper on Slide 8. Production increased 56% to 80 million pounds as a result of Phase V mining at Batu Hijau and the ramp up at Boddington. The average realized copper price of $2.33 per pound improved by 7% from the year-ago quarter, but included a provisional pricing adjustment of $0.62 a pound. Higher operating costs were due to higher milling costs at Batu Hijau and higher cost Boddington production coming online.
Moving to Slide 9. For the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, a 38% increase. Net operating cash flow from continuing operations was $753 million, a 49% increase, and adjusted net income rose to $377 million or $0.70 a share, an increase of 79%. For the quarter, reported net income was negatively impacted by a couple items. You might have noticed we had a higher effective tax rate of 33.6% versus 29.6% in 2009 and approximately 15% in the first quarter. The difference of roughly 4% quarter-on-quarter impacted earnings per share by about $0.07 a share. Notwithstanding a higher tax rate this quarter, our effective tax rate for 2010 remains unchanged at between 24% and 28%. We had a copper provisional pricing adjustment, as previously mentioned, of about $79 million, which impacted earnings per share by about $0.06 a share. 
We marked to market at quarter end at $2.96 a pound. I think this morning checking earlier, copper was trading around $3.25, so we will see most of that come back in the third quarter. And finally, we had a delayed shipment of about 30,000 tons of copper concentrate from Batu Hijau that was scheduled for quarter end, and it got rolled into the third quarter, which impacted earnings by about $0.03. So you can see the impact of that on the second quarter, and most of that will come back in the third quarter. So when you step back and look at it, I think the key job for us to deliver significant gold price leverage to the bottom line and that's what you saw in the quarter. We had a 79% increase in earnings per share on a 31% increase in average realized gold price.
I will now turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to discuss our regional operating results for the quarter."
291795,99084144,71170,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Russell. As you can see on Slide 10, North America produced 463,000 ounces of gold, up 4% from the year-ago quarter.

As you can see on Slide 10, North America produced 463,000 ounces of gold, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to higher production at La Herradura due to commencement of production in the new Soledad and Dipolos pits, as well as underground increases at Midas and Leeville. This was offset by lower leached ore production and reduced production as a result of the Gold Quarry Slide. Costs applicable to sales were $585 per ounce, up 9% due to a higher proportion of underground mining and additional surface costs due to the Gold Quarry Slide. We continue to expect North America to produce between 1.7 million and 1.9 million ounces of gold for the year within our original CAS outlook range of $575 to $615 per ounce. 
In South America, we produced 181,000 equity ounces, a decrease of 32% from the prior year. This decrease is due to lower mill ore grade and recovery, combined with lower leach tons placed due to the stockpiling of transitional ore. Costs applicable to sales were $389 per ounce, up 20% from 2009 due to lower production, higher waste mining and higher maintenance costs, production taxes and royalties as a result of a higher gold price. We anticipate Yanacocha to have a strong second half. South America is on track to produce between 750,000 and 810,000 equity ounces of gold for the year. However, we believe CAS may come in at the high end of the original outlook range of $360 to $400 an ounce due to lower than expected leach tons placed and silver by-product credits.
In Africa, we produced 132,000 ounces, a slight decline from 2009 due to lower grade and recovery as we have moved out of the Subika pit and into the Apensu and Awonsu pits, offset partially by higher throughput. Costs applicable to sales decreased 3% to $416 per ounce due to lower milling costs, partially offset by higher fuel costs. We are pleased to report we have increased our outlook for full-year production at Ahafo to between 500,000 and 530,000 ounces, and our costs applicable to sales outlook has been lowered to between $475 and $515 per ounce as we are seeing higher grades than projected.
In APAC, we produced 522,000 equity ounces of gold, a 64% increase over 2009, primarily due to production at Boddington, which was not in production during the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, we benefited from higher production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales in Asia-Pacific were up 17%, primarily due to higher cost production from Boddington during the ramp up, a stronger Australian dollar and lower production at the Tanami due to mill availability issues.
Moving to Slide 11, as Richard mentioned, we continue to ramp up production at Boddington, having declared commercial production in November 2009. For the second quarter, gold production increased 16% from the first quarter of 2010 to 184,000 ounces, and copper production increased 13% to 15 million pounds. The processing plant continues to perform in line with our expectations and should achieve nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter. In the first three weeks of July, we saw the plant operating at approximately 97% of capacity. However, costs applicable to sales have been higher than anticipated due to a stronger Australian dollar and higher than expected mining costs during the ramp up.
On Slide 12, now that we are several months into the ramp up, we wanted to give you an update on some of the positives and challenges since we started delivering ore to the plant last year. On the positive side, recoveries for both gold and copper have exceeded feasibility study estimates to date. We have also mined 23% more contained copper than modeled, with higher-quality concentrate helped by better than anticipated performance by the high-pressure grinding rolls and the wet plant. However, we have encountered approximately 12% lower than modeled contained gold thus far, offset somewhat by 23% more contained copper. In addition to in the dry plant, we are seeing higher wear in the primary and secondary pressure circuits than we expected. We have also seen mining costs higher than expected due to increased costs related to drilling and blasting and stockpile re-handling. As a result, equity gold production for 2010 is now expected between 750,000 and 825,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales on a co-product basis of $475 to $550 per ounce. For the reasons just discussed, we believe we will achieve the 2010 copper production outlook of between 65 million and 75 million pounds. We now believe copper costs applicable to sales could be between $1.55 and $1.75 per pound.
Looking ahead to 2011, as the mine begins its first year of steady-state production, we expect equity gold production at Boddington to be between 850,000 and 925,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $475 and $525 per ounce, which we believe to be conservative given the expected increase in production. Beyond 2011, our outlook for Boddington's operating performance is subject to further data collection and analysis as we gain more experience with the mine. I want to highlight the fact that we have only mined 2% of the reserves of this 20-plus year mine life asset, and feel that it is too soon to draw conclusions on the long-term impact of the model reconciliation experience during ramp up.
Turning to Slide 11, I'd like to give a brief discussion on Batu Hijau. The second quarter was anticipated to be a strong quarter as we began to access higher grade ore from the bottom of Phase 5 in the traditional dry season. As you can see from this photo taken on April 25, we experienced unseasonably heavy rainfall during the quarter, limiting our access to the bottom of the pit and requiring us to produce from lower grade stockpiles. We believe that we should be able to make up this delayed production in the second half of the year, assuming a normal dry season pattern and are maintaining our original production outlook. 
As an update to our ownership position, no shares were divested during the quarter, and our effective economic interest remains at 48.1/2%. We offered the final 7% ownership stake for sale in March, and negotiations of the purchase price are still underway with the Central Government. So what does this all mean for our full-year outlook? 
As you can see on Slide 14, our portfolio continues to perform as we continue to expect full-year gold production in the range of our original outlook of 5.3 million  to 5.5 million ounces. However, we are tightening our outlook for CAS to the narrow range of $460 to $480 per ounce based on the factors we've already spoken about. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Richard."

Turning to Slide 15, I want to reiterate that safety, environmental stewardship, sustainability and leadership in corporate social responsibility remain the hallmarks of our business, and we believe these attributes offer us a competitive advantage. For the third consecutive year, we've been selected to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We're also ranked 16th overall on the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list co-filed by Corporate Responsibility Magazine., and Newmont is the sole mining company featured in the top 20. In addition, in May, we were announced as the winner of 2010 Global Business Coalition Award for our Workplace Malaria and HIV/AIDS program in Ghana. And just in the past few weeks, Newmont was awarded the 2010 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. This is the highest honor presented by the U.S. Government to employers who provide outstanding support to employees serving in the Guard and Reserve. We're very proud to support our employees who dedicate their time and effort to the Reserves and to our country, and we appreciate the government's recognition of our employee support.
Turning to the last slide, in summary, we continue to generate significant free cash flow in the strong metal price environment. We're pleased to be in a position to increase cash returns to our shareholders in the form of a dividend increase, as well as to continue to drive sustainable longer-term returns, through developing our most prospective projects, continuing to fund exploration opportunities and considering strategic value-oriented M&A transactions. We do anticipate a strong second half of the year as we continue to focus on execution, and we are confident that we can once again deliver on our annual guidance for production, costs applicable to sales and capital expenditures, generating operating cash flow that is leveraged to gold price and allows us to reinvest in our business and return cash to shareholders.
And with that, I'd like to thank you all for listening and open the call for questions."

First of all, Phoenix experienced a number of issues related to the oxide zone. There was a much bigger oxide zone in the Phoenix deposit that caused problems in the mill. The mill  wasn't designed to handle that. At Boddington, all of our material is primarily sulfide so we're not going to see that issue. Phoenix had a significant amount of historical data in non-core drilling that has proved be biased, and that led an overestimation of gold. At Boddington, most of the drilling is being completed under the control of Newmont and its partners. And finally, Phoenix has coarse gold that led to estimation issues and difficulties in ore control misclassification. The deposit type at Phoenix is SCRUM and those are notoriously difficult to model and predict. Boddington is not a SCRUM deposit, and while coarse gold does exist, the gold particle size is much finer and it doesn't make up as large a percentage of the contained metal as it did at Phoenix. Also building on what Richard said, there's been a tremendous amount of work done on the model itself. There's a number of work done by many, many different sources. We've got a strong underlying drill hole database that we've had numerous external audits and continuous QA/QC programs. The data is dominated by core drilling, which had excellent recovery and check assays during the course of the feasibility study suggested that the database was actually conservative. Now just building on the reviews that have been done, we had 10 external reviews during the feasibility study and eight external reviews since that time. Numerous internal reviews by Newmont and, of course, we had our partners Newcrest and Anglo involved at the same time. So in addition to that, we mine test pits early on, which demonstrated the grade should have been above expectation. Additionally, it's a very large deposit, it's very well drilled and it should be robust, and I have to reemphasize that it's still very early days with only 2% of the ore body mined to date. But we've got a much better database and much more confidence in the underlying data for this deposit."

So we've been seeing shorter lives coming out of the bowls, mantles and other wear components. That's led us to be changing some of those out quicker and on shorter schedules than we'd originally expected. I guess what we are seeing is we are seeing that the average hours between change out are increasing. So just as everybody works through getting the right wear material, the right composition of wear material, I think we expect to see those numbers come down on wear in the plant. The high-pressure grinding rolls are wearing as expected, which for us we're really pleased about that. We expected to get around 5,200 hours on those and that's precisely what we're seeing. So we've had some wins in the process plant, and we're also seeing some wear issues there, which wasn't unexpected and we'd actually anticipated that. In the mine, what we were experiencing is we've tightened up the drill pattern. We're really trying to get that optimum fragmentation size so that we can get the mine to mill process optimized. Our drill spacing is tighter. We've had to do more drilling than we've expected. We've also increased the powder factor. That's still a learning process we're going through, but that's one of the issues contributing to the higher cost. Another issue, too, is we've been trying to get the highest grade through the mine. So we've actually been going to more selective mining and more stockpiling and more re-handle coming off the stockpiles so we can really optimize the grade that we present to the primary crusher and into the plant. So those are really the principle components that have led to the higher operating costs."

I'd just add we're into the wet season down there, and we spent a significant amount this quarter on road base and getting the roads in shape to get the truck productivity up. So those costs, while we will have an ongoing component of those, we had a big effort this quarter really to get the roads in shape. I'd also, Barry, just point you to your earlier question on bu- and co-products. If you look at Page 12 on the release, you'll see Boddington broken down on both a co-product and a by-product and the $582 represents the co-product, as Richard said, by-product it's about $503 for the quarter."

We will continue to do all of the extra work that Brian talked about and try to do everything we can to make sure that this grade issue is well defined and that we do the best job we can in the mine to reduce the amount of dilution. So really, as we do look into 2011, our current expectation is that Boddington will be between 850,000 and 925,000 ounces. That's the level that we project today. I would say with only 2% of the reserves mined to date, all the data that Guy has talked about with respect to how we modeled this deposit initially and with the fact that most of this problem is really mining related, not processing related,  I got to say, I hold out high hopes that we'll continue to work our way through this positively. I like to have the problems in the mine. That's what we're good at. We will figure this out. The processing plant is running well, and I think with that, I think the expectation is that we can push the processing plant up beyond nameplate capacity. And if we need to put more ore through the mill at a lower grade to get additional recoveries, I hope that that's the plan that we'll be able to put into effect."

But a lot of excitement around Leeville, and still trying to get our hands around what the bigger project looks like. While we're doing that, we're also looking at how to optimize this from a throughput perspective. Do we need more shafts? What's the best way to exploit the asset that we've got out there. So really excited about that one."

It helps us to extend the life of our Nevada reserves, which as you know, if we can bring up the Nevada portfolio over people's expectations of the outward decline for Nevada, that brings up the whole foundation for the company. And there's a lot of good work with respect to costs that can happen as a result of higher grade deposits and the right chemistry, which Leeville provides us with out of Nevada."

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we will start on Slide 3 with an overview of the investment thesis for Newmont.

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we will start on Slide 3 with an overview of the investment thesis for Newmont. First, our ongoing focus on execution and maintaining our operating track record has been and will continue to be job one for us. With consistent operational execution comes gold price leverage and strong cash flow generating capacity, which in turn, provides us with balance sheet strength and the flexibility to invest in our business. Delivering operating performance today provides us with the possibilities of the future. As we've described before, our current balance sheet and free cash flow generation afford us the ability to essentially pre-fund our $4 billion to $5 billion pipeline of advanced projects. Finally, we continue to focus on maintaining a position of leadership in the areas of safety, the environmental and social responsibility, as well as employee development. These leadership positions are the cornerstone upon which our business continues to be built.
Moving to Slide 4, as I noted before, our focus on dedication to operational execution is job one. During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.3 million equity ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of $492 per ounce, with our North American region contributing 36% of total quarterly equity gold production, South America contributing 14% and Africa contributing 10%. Our Asia-Pacific region contributed the remaining 40% of our quarterly gold production and the majority of our 80 million pounds of equity copper production. 
Within our APAC region, our newest mine, Boddington, continues ramping up to full capacity and produced 184,000 ounces of gold and 15 million pounds of copper in the quarter. We are maintaining our overall outlook for full year 2010 gold and copper production, capital expenditures and gold operating costs within the original ranges we provided in February, although lower production at Yanacocha, higher cost ramp up production at Boddington, higher gold royalties and taxes, as well as adverse movements in the Australian dollar continue to put upward pressure on our costs, which suggest we'll end the year toward the top end of the CAS range.
Turning to Slide 5, as I noted before, our strong cash flow generation, coupled with over $6 billion of liquidity, affords us considerable flexibility to profitably develop our business and generate returns to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we generated $753 million of operating cash flow, up about 50% over last year, and $434 million of free cash flow. For the first two quarters, we generated a total of approximately $1.5 billion of operating cash flow and $875 million of free cash flow. As you may have also seen earlier this week, Moody's upgraded our senior debt rating from a rating of BAA2 to BAA1.
As this slide highlights, we intend to continue to invest our free cash flow and available liquidity in a combination of project development, exploration and value-oriented acquisition opportunities. In addition to investing in our business, when our liquidity and free cash flow generating capacity allows we will also look for opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Today, we are pleased to announce that the board has approved a 50% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, or an indicated annual dividend of $0.60 per share, effective September 29. We believe that our business is strong enough to both reinvest capital at attractive returns and offer higher dividends in a higher metal price environment, which we feel positions us uniquely in the gold equity market, as well as against the gold ETF.
As we discussed during our Investor Day in Boston, we're intent on providing investors with a sustainable range of gold and copper production over time that offers current and ongoing exposure to gold price, as well as competitive financial returns. We continue to see numerous internal attractive project development opportunities. Akyem and Conga, along with Hope Bay, Greater Leeville/Turf and Gold Quarry West Wall collectively represent up to 30 million to 45 million equity ounces of potential reserve and resource development, of which approximately 20 million are currently in proven and profitable reserves. We believe the combination of our pipeline of projects and our exploration portfolio will continue to allow us to extend the lives of our operating regions for many years to come.
I'll now turn the presentation over to Russell Ball, our CFO, who will provide further details on our second quarter results."

Moving to Slide 6, as Richard previously mentioned, equity gold production for the quarter was approximately 1.3 million ounces, an increase of 10% at an average realized gold price of $1,200 an ounce, an increase of 31%. Go",527,"Thanks, Richard. Morning, all. Moving to Slide 6, as Richard previously mentioned, equity gold production for the quarter was approximately 1.3 million ounces, an increase of 10% at an average realized gold price of $1,200 an ounce, an increase of 31%. Gold operating margins expanded 44% to $708 an ounce, despite a 16% increase in operating costs.
Moving to Slide 7. I wanted to spend a little time discussing the reasons for the increase in operating costs. As you can see on the waterfall, lower production at Yanacocha, where we encountered unexpected transitional ore that was stockpiled for future processing through the mill, and higher cost production at Boddington, which Brian Hill will cover shortly, were the primary drivers of higher costs for the quarter. Higher silver by-product credits offset some of the cost increases, which you can see represented on that waterfall.
Turning to copper on Slide 8. Production increased 56% to 80 million pounds as a result of Phase 5 mining at Batu Hijau and the ramp up at Boddington. The average realized copper price of $2.33 per pound improved by 7% from the year-ago quarter, but included a provisional pricing adjustment of $0.62 a pound. Higher operating costs were due to higher milling costs at Batu Hijau and higher-cost Boddington production coming online.
Moving to Slide 9. For the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, a 38% increase. Net operating cash flow from continuing operations was $753 million, a 49% increase, and adjusted net income rose to $377 million or $0.70 a share, an increase of 79%. For the quarter, reported net income was negatively impacted by a couple items. You might have noticed we had a higher effective tax rate of 33.6% versus 29.6% in 2009 and approximately 15% in the first quarter. The difference of roughly 4% quarter-on-quarter impacted earnings per share by about $0.07 a share. Notwithstanding a higher tax rate this quarter, our effective tax rate for 2010 remains unchanged at between 24% and 28%. We had a copper provisional pricing adjustment, as previously mentioned, of about $79 million, which impacted earnings per share by about $0.06 a share. 
We marked-to-market at quarter end at $2.96 a pound. I think this morning checking earlier, copper was trading around $3.25, so we will see most of that come back in the third quarter. And finally, we had a delayed shipment of about 30,000 tons of copper concentrate from Batu Hijau that was scheduled for quarter end, and it got rolled into the third quarter, which impacted earnings by about $0.03. So you can see the impact of that on the second quarter, and most of that will come back in the third quarter. So when you step back and look at it, I think the key job for us to deliver significant gold price leverage to the bottom line, and that's what you saw in the quarter. We had a 79% increase in earnings per share on a 31% increase in average realized gold price.
I will now turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to discuss our regional operating results for the quarter."

As you can see on Slide 10, North America produced 463,000 ounces of gold, up 4% from the year-ago quarter.

As you can see on Slide 10, North America produced 463,000 ounces of gold, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to higher production at La Herradura due to commencement of production in the new Soledad and Dipolos pits, as well as underground increases at Midas and Leeville. This was offset by lower leached ore production and reduced production as a result of the Gold Quarry Slide. Costs applicable to sales were $585 per ounce, up 9% due to a higher proportion of underground mining and additional surface costs due to the Gold Quarry Slide. We continue to expect North America to produce between 1.7 million and 1.9 million ounces of gold for the year within our original CAS outlook range of $575 to $615 per ounce. 
In South America, we produced 181,000 equity ounces, a decrease of 32% from the prior year. This decrease is due to lower mill ore grade and recovery, combined with lower leach tons placed due to the stockpiling of transitional ore. Costs applicable to sales were $389 per ounce, up 20% from 2009 due to lower production, higher waste mining and higher maintenance costs, production taxes and royalties as a result of a higher gold price. We anticipate Yanacocha to have a strong second half. South America is on track to produce between 750,000 and 810,000 equity ounces of gold for the year. However, we believe CAS may come in at the high end of the original outlook range of $360 to $400 an ounce due to lower than expected leach tons placed and silver by-product credits.
In Africa, we produced 132,000 ounces, a slight decline from 2009 due to lower grade and recovery as we have moved out of the Subika pit and into the Apensu and Awonsu pits, offset partially by higher throughput. Costs applicable to sales decreased 3% to $416 per ounce due to lower milling costs, partially offset by higher fuel costs. We are pleased to report we have increased our outlook for full-year production at Ahafo to between 500,000 and 530,000 ounces, and our costs applicable to sales outlook has been lowered to between $475 and $515 per ounce as we are seeing higher grades than projected.
In APAC, we produced 522,000 equity ounces of gold, a 64% increase over 2009, primarily due to production at Boddington, which was not in production during the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, we benefited from higher production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales in Asia-Pacific were up 17%, primarily due to higher-cost production from Boddington during the ramp up, a stronger Australian dollar and lower production at the Tanami due to mill availability issues.
Moving to Slide 11. As Richard mentioned, we continue to ramp up production at Boddington, having declared commercial production in November 2009. For the second quarter, gold production increased 16% from the first quarter of 2010 to 184,000 ounces, and copper production increased 13% to 15 million pounds. The processing plant continues to perform in line with our expectations and should achieve nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter. In the first three weeks of July, we saw the plant operating at approximately 97% of capacity. However, costs applicable to sales have been higher than anticipated due to a stronger Australian dollar and higher-than-expected mining costs during the ramp up.
On Slide 12, now that we’re several months into the ramp up, we wanted to give you an update on some of the positives and challenges since we started delivering ore to the plant last year. On the positive side, recoveries for both gold and copper have exceeded feasibility study estimates to date. We have also mined 23% more contained copper than modeled, with higher-quality concentrate helped by better-than-anticipated performance by the high-pressure grinding rolls and the wet plant. However, we have encountered approximately 12% lower-than-modeled contained gold thus far, offset somewhat by 23% more contained copper. In addition in the dry plant, we are seeing higher wear in the primary and secondary crusher circuits than we expected. We have also seen mining costs higher than expected due to increased costs related to drilling and blasting and stockpile re-handling. As a result, equity gold production for 2010 is now expected between 750,000 and 825,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales on a co-product basis of $475 to $550 per ounce. For the reasons just discussed, we believe we will achieve the 2010 copper production outlook of between 65 million and 75 million pounds. We now believe copper costs applicable to sales could be between $1.55 and $1.75 per pound.
Looking ahead to 2011, as the mine begins its first year of steady-state production, we expect equity gold production at Boddington to be between 850,000 and 925,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $475 and $525 per ounce, which we believe to be conservative given the expected increase in production. Beyond 2011, our outlook for Boddington's operating performance is subject to further data collection and analysis as we gain more experience with the mine. I want to highlight the fact that we have only mined 2% of the reserves of this 20-plus year mine life asset, and feel that it is too soon to draw conclusions on the long-term impact of the model reconciliation experienced during ramp up.
Turning to Slide 11, I'd like to give a brief discussion on Batu Hijau. The second quarter was anticipated to be a strong quarter as we began to access higher-grade ore from the bottom of Phase 5 in the traditional dry season. As you can see from this photo taken on April 25, we experienced unseasonably heavy rainfall during the quarter, limiting our access to the bottom of the pit and requiring us to produce from lower-grade stockpiles. We believe that we should be able to make up this delayed production in the second half of the year, assuming a normal dry season pattern and are maintaining our original production outlook. 
As an update to our ownership position, no shares were divested during the quarter, and our effective economic interest remains at 48½%. We offered the final 7% ownership stake for sale in March, and negotiations of the purchase price are still underway with the Central Government. So what does this all mean for our full year outlook? 
As you can see on Slide 14, our portfolio continues to perform as we continue to expect full year gold production in the range of our original outlook of 5.3 million  to 5.5 million ounces. However, we are tightening our outlook for CAS to the narrow range of $460 to $480 per ounce based on the factors we've already spoken about. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Richard."

Turning to Slide 15, I want to reiterate that safety, environmental stewardship, sustainability and leadership in corporate social responsibility remain the hallmarks of our business, and we believe these attributes offer us a competitive advantage. For the third consecutive year, we've been selected to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We're also ranked 16th overall on the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list profiled by Corporate Responsibility Magazine, and Newmont is the sole mining company featured in the top 20. In addition, in May, we were announced as the winner of 2010 Global Business Coalition Award for our Workplace Malaria and HIV/AIDS program in Ghana. And just in the past few weeks, Newmont was awarded the 2010 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. This is the highest honor presented by the U.S. Government to employers who provide outstanding support to employees serving in the Guard and Reserve. We're very proud to support our employees who dedicate their time and effort to the Reserves and to our country, and we appreciate the government's recognition of our employee support.
Turning to the last slide, in summary, we continue to generate significant free cash flow in this strong metal price environment. We're pleased to be in a position to increase cash returns to our shareholders in the form of a dividend increase, as well as to continue to drive sustainable longer-term returns, through developing our most prospective projects, continuing to fund exploration opportunities and considering strategic value-oriented M&A transactions. We do anticipate a strong second half of the year as we continue to focus on execution, and we are confident that we can once again deliver on our annual guidance for production, costs applicable to sales and capital expenditures, generating operating cash flow that is leveraged to gold price and allows us to reinvest in our business and return cash to shareholders.
And with that, I'd like to thank you all for listening and open the call for questions."

First of all, Phoenix experienced a number of issues related to the oxide zone. There was a much bigger oxide zone in the Phoenix deposit that caused problems in the mill. The mill wasn't designed to handle that. At Boddington, all of our material is primary sulfide so we're not going to see that issue. Phoenix had a significant amount of historical data in non-core drilling that has proved be biased, and that led to an overestimation of gold. At Boddington, most of the drilling is being completed under the control of Newmont and its partners. And finally, Phoenix has coarse gold that led to estimation issues and difficulties in ore control misclassification. The deposit type at Phoenix is SCRUM and those are notoriously difficult to model and predict. Boddington is not a SCRUM deposit, and while coarse gold does exist, the gold particle size is much finer and it doesn't make up as large a percentage of the contained metal as it did at Phoenix. Also building on what Richard said, there's been a tremendous amount of work done on the model itself. There's a number of work done by many, many different sources. We've got a strong underlying drill hole database that we've had numerous external audits and continuous QA/QC programs. The data is dominated by core drilling, which had excellent recovery. And check assays during the course of the feasibility study suggested that the database was actually conservative. Now just building on the reviews that have been done, we had 10 external reviews during the feasibility study and eight external reviews since that time. Numerous internal reviews by Newmont and, of course, we had our partners Newcrest and Anglo involved at the same time. So in addition to that, we mined test pits early on, which demonstrated the grade should have been above expectation. Additionally, it's a very large deposit, it's very well drilled and it should be robust, and I have to reemphasize that it's still very early days with only 2% of the ore body mined to date. But we've got a much better database and much more confidence in the underlying data for this deposit."

So we've been seeing shorter lives coming out of the bowls, mantles and other wear components. That's led us to be changing some of those out quicker and on shorter schedules than we'd originally expected. I guess what we are seeing is we are seeing that the average hours between change out are increasing. So just as everybody works through getting the right wear material, the right composition of wear material, I think we expect to see those numbers come down on wear in the plant. The high-pressure grinding rolls are wearing as expected, which for us we're really pleased about that. We expected to get around 5,200 hours on those, and that's precisely what we're seeing. So we've had some wins in the process plant, and we're also seeing some wear issues there, which wasn't unexpected, and we'd actually anticipated that. In the mine, what we were experiencing is we've tightened up the drill pattern. We're really trying to get that optimum fragmentation size so that we can get the mine to mill process optimized. Our drill spacing is tighter. We've had to do more drilling that we've expected. We've also increased the powder factor. That's still a learning process we're going through, but that's one of the issues contributing to the higher cost. Another issue, too, is we've been trying to get the highest grade through the mine. So we've actually been going to more selective mining and more stockpiling and more re-handle coming off the stockpiles so we can really optimize the grade that we present to the primary crusher and into the plant. So those are really the principal components that have led to the higher operating costs."

I would say with only 2% of the reserves mined to date, all the data that Guy has talked about with respect to how we modeled this deposit initially and with the fact that most of this problem is really mining-related, not processing-related, I got to say, I hold out high hopes that we'll continue to work our way through this positively. I like to have the problems in the mine. That's what we're good at. We will figure this out. The processing plant is running well, and I think with that, I think the expectation is that we can push the processing plant up beyond nameplate capacity. And if we need to put more ore through the mill at a lower grade to get additional recoveries, I hope that that's the plan that we'll be able to put into effect."

And sorry to just keep questioning on Boddington, but just again, big picture, conceptually Boddington in this current quarter was annualizing production at around 736,000 ounces. Your guidance, even though reduced for 2011, still implies a range of 775,000 as a midpoint, at least 5% higher, maybe 10% higher at the outside guidance range. What is it that you're sort of pre-preparing for that would cause you to not expect significant fixed-cost dilution as you are able to optimize your production in that year? Are you pre-bracing for further issues from, for example, the Australian exchange rate or energy? Or do you believe that you're leaving a little bit of padding in the latest guidance that costs could surprise to the downside?"

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we'll start on Slide 3. If you've been following Newmont recently, the themes of execution, cash flow, flexibility, margin expansion and leadership will sound very familiar to you.",573,"Thanks, John. For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we'll start on Slide 3. 
If you've been following Newmont recently, the themes of execution, cash flow, flexibility, margin expansion and leadership will sound very familiar to you. That's by design as we believe consistent delivery creates sustainable value.
Our consistent focus on production and cost management applied across our portfolio of assets gives us the ability to deliver the most cash flow leverage per share of any gold company in the world. That cash flow in turn gives us the flexibility to fund exploration, by far, the cheapest source of new reserve growth and to fund our considerable project development pipeline with an expectation of favorable real returns. And our free cash flow generation provides us the confidence to return capital to shareholders as evidenced by our 50% increase in our dividend announced in the last quarter and sustained this quarter.
While we continue to focus on optimizing the results from each of our existing operations, we're also transitioning our Boddington project through ramp-up and into steady-state operations. During the third quarter, we strengthened our senior management team at Boddington to support this transition. And we are now forming a special project team to optimize and de-bottleneck the mine and process plant as we complete that transition into ongoing operations.
An initial component of this optimization process has been the installation of a sixth MP-1000 secondary crusher, which will be commissioned this month. As a 20-year-plus asset with compelling exploration potential, our expectations for Boddington continue to be high. Alongside optimizing our existing operations and transitioning Boddington to full capacity, we're also simultaneously preparing for our next significant project development campaign, which includes Conga and Peru, Akyem in Ghana, Hope Bay in the Canadian Arctic and several near mine development opportunities in the Carlin Trend in Nevada.
Moving to Slide 4, you'll see a snapshot of our global production in the third quarter. Newmont produced 1.4 million equity ounces of gold at an average realized price of $1,221 per ounce and cost applicable to sales of $477 per ounce. Our North American region contributed 35% of our total quarterly equity gold production. South America contributed 13%, and Africa contributed 11%. Our Asia-Pacific region contributed the remaining 41% of our quarterly gold production and all of our 83 million pounds of equity copper production.
Within our APAC region, our newest mine, Boddington, produced 180,000 ounces of gold and 14 million pounds of copper in the quarter. With the first three quarters of the year behind us, we've narrowed our overall outlook for 2010 equity gold and copper production to 5.3 million to 5.4 million ounces for the year. We've also reduced our 2010 capital spending outlook by about $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. 
And as we suggested in our July earnings call, higher gold prices and unfavorable exchange ratios have led to higher costs in the third quarter. We've expanded our outlook for gold cost applicable to sales to a range of $485 to $500 per ounce for 2010, still below the gold industry average and highly influenced by higher gold and a higher Australian dollar rate. You can find more details on our 2010 outlook in the appendix to this presentation. 
I'd like to now turn the presentation over to our Chief Financial Officer, Russell Ball, to fill you in with more details on our financial performance."
291795,99084160,84296,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter performance compared to the prior-year quarter. We recognized record revenue of $2.6 billion on higher equity gold and copper production and average net realized prices of $1,221 an ounce and $3.67 a p",611,"Thanks, Richard. Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter performance compared to the prior-year quarter. We recognized record revenue of $2.6 billion on higher equity gold and copper production and average net realized prices of $1,221 an ounce and $3.67 a pound, respectively. Looking at the screens earlier this morning, we were trading at $1,356 and $3.80, so significantly higher than the averages realized for the third quarter. 
With significantly higher operating margins, we reported adjusted net income for the third quarter of $1.08 a share, an increase of 37% from the year-ago quarter and some $0.10 to $0.12 above consensus. Reported net income was slightly higher than the adjusted net income due to a small net gain on an asset disposition which we backed out.
I didn't want to ignore the two red arrows on the slide, namely costs applicable to sales for both gold and copper, which were up 18% and 46%, respectively. And we'll cover this in more detail on Slide 7.
When you look at industry-wide cost trends as reflected on Slide 6, you will see that while we are faring better than the industry average, we are all experiencing upward cost pressures as mines age, the complexities of the ores we treat increases and average ore grades decrease. On the slide, Newmont's costs applicable to sales are shown in blue, and that compared against the GFMS average in gray. 
Our third quarter CAS of $477 an ounce is below the GFMS average of $535 per ounce for the second quarter, the most recent available. And we'll undoubtedly be well below the average for the third quarter when all producers have reported. The 61% operating margin for the third quarter, the highest in recent memory, what others will likely be eclipsed in the fourth quarter given where metal prices are trading today.
On Slide 7, we've highlighted our costs applicable to sales outlook from February 2010 to where we stand today. Our original guidance, as Richard mentioned earlier, was based on a $900 gold price and an AUD $80 exchange rate assumption. The higher realized gold price and stronger Australian dollar or maybe that should be a weaker U.S. dollar in today's context, collectively added about $19 an ounce to operating costs.  And as I've said on the second quarter call, these are higher operating costs we don't mind paying given the increase in margin. 
Lower production volume and higher spending, primarily at Boddington and Batu Hijau contributed another $11 per ounce in higher costs. Our copper CAS outlook remains unchanged at $0.85 to $0.95 per pound, with lower production costs from Batu Hijau offset by higher costs from Boddington.
Slide 8 focuses on free cash flow generation, as we believe that this metric is the ultimate determinant of value for this and any other business. We delivered operating cash flow in excess of $850 million for the quarter. And this was off the funding of pension obligations in the amount of approximately $60 million and $130 million prepayment of income taxes, which we expect to be refunded next year. I should note that included in operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2009 was $175 million of income tax refund.
So in summary, strong operating cash flow generation, but some big working capital movements that are not always to forecast. The chart on the right reflects third quarter operating cash flow as reported on a per-share metric for a number of our North American peers. The numbers speak for themselves. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to discuss the regional operating results for the quarter."

As you can see on Slide 9, North America produced 495,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter. Production was lower than the year-ago quarter as a result of lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin and lower ore feed at Mill 5 du",1039,"Thanks, Russell. As you can see on Slide 9, North America produced 495,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter. Production was lower than the year-ago quarter as a result of lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin and lower ore feed at Mill 5 due to the Gold Quarry slide that occurred in late 2009. On a positive note, we experienced higher mine production at Leeville, which offset some of the impacts of Gold Quarry. We saw production increases at La Herradura, which benefited from the commencement of production at the Soledad and Dipolos pits. 
Costs applicable to sales in North America were $565 per ounce due to a higher proportion of underground mining and additional surface mining costs due to the Gold Quarry slide, partially offset by copper and silver by-product credits. Twin Creeks' cost per ton was unfavorably impacted by the timing of leach ore placed at the end of 2009. And additionally, mining optimization work at Twin Creeks has focused on accelerating mill ore as opposed to leach ore to help offset the Gold Quarry slide.
In South America, we produced 187,000 equity ounces, a decrease of 33% as expected from the prior-year quarter, as shown on Slide 10. Production included contributions from Chaquicocha, which partially offset lower placed ore from La Quinua where paleosoils limited our leach ore placement. Costs applicable to sales were $420 per ounce, up 43% from 2009 due to lower production, higher waste mining and higher maintenance costs, production taxes and royalties as a result of the higher gold price. This was partially offset by favorable silver by-product credits.
In the third quarter, commercial production began at our La Zanja joint venture with Buenaventura who is the operator. La Zanja is located about 40 miles west of Yanacocha, and is expected to produce 15,000 equity ounces in 2010.
Turning to Slide 11. In the Asia-Pacific region, we produced 570,000 equity ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of $451 per ounce. At Batu Hijau, we encountered a dry season that was uncharacteristically wet, affecting our access to the bottom of the pit during the third quarter. On a positive note, we experienced higher grades in recoveries at KCGM, as positive mill reconciliations for July and August were coupled with good grade from the reward ore body. We also experienced solid overall performance at Jundee and Waihi. Costs moved upwards in the third quarter due to higher drilling, loading and hauling costs at Boddington, as well as higher proportion of underground mine operating development costs at Jundee.
Moving to Slide 12. We continue to work towards consistent production at Boddington. While we report Boddington as part of our Asia-Pacific region, we thought it would be helpful to also understand its contribution on a stand-alone basis relative to the rest of our portfolio. For the third quarter, gold production was 180,000 ounces, virtually unchanged from Q2. And copper production was 14 million pounds. We did have issues with the main circuit breaker and tailings stiffener [ph] in August, which did adversely impact mill throughput during the quarter. 
Since the end of the quarter, we had a good October at Boddington with 2.8 million tons milled. Our processing plant continues to perform in line with our expectations and should achieve nameplate capacity in the first quarter of 2011. As I mentioned earlier in my Asia-Pacific remarks, costs applicable to sales have been higher than anticipated due to a stronger Australian dollar and higher-than-expected mining and milling costs during the ramp-up.
Let's turn to Slide 13. On the positive side, we continue to see solid performance from the high-pressure grinding rolls and wet plant at Boddington, while recoveries and concentrate quality continue to be better than expected. Our challenges still involve lower gold grades, though that is based on less than 3% of reserves mined to date, dry plant wear rates and higher mining costs as a result of fragmentation issues and the stronger Australian dollar.
Turning to Slide 14. I would like to discuss Batu Hijau briefly, which is another component of our Asia-Pacific region. As an update to our ownership position, no shares were divested during the quarter, and our effective economic interest remains at 48.5%. We offered the final 7% ownership stake for sale in March. We have reached an accord on price with the central government. And it is important to point out that the final settlement price will be net of dividends paid in 2010. 
With regards to operations, we experienced unseasonably heavy rainfall in the third quarter, limiting our access to the bottom of the pit and requiring us to have higher-than-expected production from lower grade stockpiles. We've had a dry October, which has allowed us to extend Phase 5 mining through October as the rains have held off.
We typically plan to be out of the bottom of the pit by October 15, so any production we derive from the pit bottom beyond this date is a bonus. For the balance of the year, ore grades at Batu Hijau are expected to move lower when we suspend mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and begin processing ore from stockpiles as mining will be primarily for Phase 6 waste removal. We expect Phase 6 ore to become the primary ore feed commencing in 2014. 
On the expansion front, Indonesia's Forestry Minister approved the permitting of another 198 hectares at Batu Hijau. This permit was issued a few weeks ago and is valid until April 2025. It's important for operations moving forward as it allows for waste dump expansion into the newly permitted area starting in the second quarter of 2011.
Moving to Slide 15. Our Africa region had a solid quarter, producing 156,000 ounces, up slightly from the same quarter in 2009 due to higher grades in recoveries as we mined the higher grade ore from the Apensu pit. We also had a small contribution to our production total from the Amoma pit in the third quarter, which started up ahead of schedule. Costs applicable to sales decreased 5% to $422 per ounce due to higher production, partially offset by higher diesel and royalty costs. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Richard."

I'd like to now shift our focus from the quarter to the future. We have a number of exciting projects that will, over the next several years, bring reserves and resources into productive capacity, extending our mine life and providing incremental gold and copper exposure to our investors.
Normally, Guy Lansdown, our EVP of Discovery and Development, would cover this section. But he is in Ghana at the moment, so I'm going to take this over. 
Africa is our fastest growing region where we have three projects underway in addition to our existing operations at Ahafo. The first project is Akyem, which is expected to double our current annual production in Africa. We believe it has a potential for 8 million to 9 million ounces of gold. After some additional drilling, infill drilling in the first half of the year, we've refined our view of the ore body and completed our metallurgical test work. We've provided further updates on Slide 17. And as you can see, we're advancing towards completion of detailed engineering by the end of 2010 and expect the full funds decision in the first half of 2011. We're also in the process of developing mine planning and processing options with a goal of production startup in late 2013 to early 2014.
Moving to Slides 18 and 19, you'll see a picture of our underground decline at Subika, which is another compelling growth story within Newmont's Africa region and, in fact, within our Ahafo operation. The ore body is open at depth and strike with a current potential estimate of 9 million gold ounces. Work continues to advance on the decline, which is currently at approximately 1,050 meters.
As you'll see on Slides 20 and 21, we continue to advance our iron ore project at Nimba, where we are in a joint venture with BHP Billiton. We estimate there is current potential for up to 1.3 billion tons of iron ore at Nimba. We're advancing mining and transport agreements with the local governments and also implementing environmental and social responsibility programs. We expect to begin a pre-feasibility study by mid-2011.
Turning to Slides 22 and 23 at Conga in Peru. We recently received approval for our environmental impact assessment. Construction planning is underway supporting our efforts to extend the region's life for decades to come. With current potential of 15 million to 20 million gold ounces and 4 million to 6 million pounds of copper, Conga is one of our most compelling new projects, offering a longer-term productive capacity and creating a bridge to other potential projects and opportunities at our existing Yanacocha facility and within this burgeoning mining district. At Conga, we've procured mill engineering, camp buildings and treatment plants. Community relations and environmental work continues to strengthen our long-term relationships in the region.
We've also made significant progress at Hope Bay this year. Our 2010 drilling program was completed on schedule and on budget. The Doris North portal has been collared and the decline initiated as demonstrated in the picture on Slide 24. Our massive Sealift was successfully completed in late summer, and we're well provisioned for the next two years there. We believe the current potential at Hope Bay is up to 9 million ounces of gold as seen on Slide 25.
I'll round out my discussion on our gold projects with the most recent development. In late September, we received our exploration permits at Elang in Indonesia. And on Slides 26 and 27, you get a glimpse of the potential size and scope of this opportunity. As some of you may know, Elang is located about 60 kilometers east of Batu Hijau and is covered under the same contract of work.
Now with the permits on hand, we're anxious to resume our resource definition drilling in June of 2011 when the dry season returns. Our previous exploration results and our preliminary scoping study suggests that Elang is a substantial opportunity with deposits that could ultimately exceed the size of Batu Hijau, which contain about 19 million ounces of gold and 18 million of copper in reserves and NRM. Although it's still early in the development process, we're excited about this significant copper and gold opportunity in Indonesia.
Turning to Slide 28, you'll see that Newmont is well positioned to support these growth projects and to support our future. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, with nearly $7 billion in total available liquidity as of September 30. Our financial position enables us to be involved when we want to be involved, and look both externally and to develop core products internally and still return cash to shareholders, as evidenced by the 50% increase to our quarterly dividend announced on July 28. 
Over the next quarters, we plan to fund development of our Conga, Akyem and Hope Bay projects, as well as continue our development of the Nevada growth projects around Leeville and Gold Quarry, all of these from our exiting liquidity. In addition, we took the opportunity in the third quarter to show up our pension funding, and we expect to be nearly fully funded by the end of the fourth quarter, entirely from existing liquidity. 
We look forward to providing our full year 2011 outlook in the first quarter next year in our Investor Day in April. We also plan to update the market on the progress of our major projects at Conga and Akyem as we move towards full funding approvals in the first half of 2011.
I'll conclude on Slide 29 by highlighting that Newmont is consistently generating industry-leading cash flow in a strong metals price environment. Our financial results emphasize that our business captures the full costs of production, not just cash costs, but cash costs plus sustaining a new project capital, allowing us to develop compelling new growth opportunities, invest opportunistically and return capital to shareholders, while providing opportunities for our employees and the host communities where we operate. As a management team, it's our goal to consistently deliver those results, while providing a compelling investment opportunity.
With that, I'd like to thank you, all, for listening, and open the call for questions."

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we'll start on Slide 3. 
If you've been following Newmont recently, the themes of execution, cash flow, flexibility, margin expansion and leadership will sound very familiar to you. That's by design as we believe consistent delivery creates sustainable value.
Our consistent focus on production and cost management applied across our portfolio of assets gives us the ability to deliver the most cash flow leverage per share of any gold company in the world. That cash flow in turn gives us the flexibility to fund exploration, by far, the cheapest source of new reserve growth and to fund our considerable project development pipeline with an expectation of favorable real returns. And our free cash flow generation provides us the confidence to return capital to shareholders as evidenced by our 50% increase in our dividend announced in the last quarter and sustained this quarter.
While we continue to focus on optimizing the results from each of our existing operations, we're also transitioning our Boddington project through ramp-up and into steady-state operations. During the third quarter, we strengthened our senior management team at Boddington to support this transition. And we are now forming a special project team to optimize and de-bottleneck the mine and process plant as we complete that transition into ongoing operations.
An initial component of this optimization process has been the installation of a sixth MP-1000 secondary crusher, which will be commissioned this month. As a 20-year-plus asset with compelling exploration potential, our expectations for Boddington continue to be high. Alongside optimizing our existing operations and transitioning Boddington to full capacity, we're also simultaneously preparing for our next significant project development campaign, which includes Conga and Peru, Akyem in Ghana, Hope Bay in the Canadian Arctic and several near mine development opportunities in the Carlin Trend in Nevada.
Moving to Slide 4, you'll see a snapshot of our global production in the third quarter. Newmont produced 1.4 million equity ounces of gold at an average realized price of $1,221 per ounce and cost applicable to sales of $477 per ounce. Our North American region contributed 35% of our total quarterly equity gold production. South America contributed 13%, and Africa contributed 11%. Our Asia-Pacific region contributed the remaining 41% of our quarterly gold production and all of our 83 million pounds of equity copper production.
Within our APAC region, our newest mine, Boddington, produced 180,000 ounces of gold and 14 million pounds of copper in the quarter. With the first three quarters of the year behind us, we've narrowed our overall outlook for 2010 equity gold and copper production to 5.3 million to 5.4 million ounces for the year. We've also reduced our 2010 capital spending outlook by about $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. 
And as we suggested in our July earnings call, higher gold prices and unfavorable exchange ratios have led to higher costs in the third quarter. We've expanded our outlook for gold cost applicable to sales to a range of $485 to $500 per ounce for 2010, still below the gold industry average and highly influenced by higher gold and a higher Australian dollar rate. You can find more details on our 2010 outlook in the appendix to this presentation. 
I'd like to now turn the presentation over to our Chief Financial Officer, Russell Ball, to fill you in with more details on our financial performance.

Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter performance compared to the prior-year quarter. We recognized record revenue of $2.6 billion on higher equity gold and copper production and average net realized prices of $1,221 an ounce and $3.67 a p",611,"Thanks, Richard. Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter performance compared to the prior-year quarter. We recognized record revenue of $2.6 billion on higher equity gold and copper production and average net realized prices of $1,221 an ounce and $3.67 a pound, respectively. Looking at the screens earlier this morning, we were trading at $1,356 and $3.80, so significantly higher than the averages realized for the third quarter. 
With significantly higher operating margins, we reported adjusted net income for the third quarter of $1.08 a share, an increase of 37% from the year-ago quarter and some $0.10 to $0.12 above consensus. Reported net income was slightly higher than the adjusted net income due to a small net gain on an asset disposition which we backed out.
I didn't want to ignore the two red arrows on the slide, namely costs applicable to sales for both gold and copper, which were up 18% and 46%, respectively. And we'll cover this in more detail on Slide 7.
When you look at industry-wide cost trends as reflected on Slide 6, you will see that while we are faring better than the industry average, we are all experiencing upward cost pressures as mines age, the complexities of the ores we treat increases and average ore grades decrease. On the slide, Newmont's costs applicable to sales are shown in blue, and that compared against the GFMS average in gray. 
Our third quarter CAS of $477 an ounce is below the GFMS average of $535 per ounce for the second quarter, the most recent available. And we'll undoubtedly be well below the average for the third quarter when all producers have reported. The 61% operating margin for the third quarter, the highest in recent memory, what others will likely be eclipsed in the fourth quarter given where metal prices are trading today.
On Slide 7, we've highlighted our costs applicable to sales outlook from February 2010 to where we stand today. Our original guidance, as Richard mentioned earlier, was based on a $900 gold price and an AUD $80 exchange rate assumption. The higher realized gold price and stronger Australian dollar or maybe that should be a weaker U.S. dollar in today's context, collectively added about $19 an ounce to operating costs.  And as I've said on the second quarter call, these are higher operating costs we don't mind paying given the increase in margin. 
Lower production volume and higher spending, primarily at Boddington and Batu Hijau contributed another $11 per ounce in higher costs. Our copper CAS outlook remains unchanged at $0.85 to $0.95 per pound, with lower production costs from Batu Hijau offset by higher costs from Boddington.
Slide 8 focuses on free cash flow generation, as we believe that this metric is the ultimate determinant of value for this and any other business. We delivered operating cash flow in excess of $850 million for the quarter. And this was off the funding of pension obligations in the amount of approximately $60 million and $130 million prepayment of income taxes, which we expect to be refunded next year. I should note that included in operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2009 was $175 million of income tax refund.
So in summary, strong operating cash flow generation, but some big working capital movements that are not always to forecast. The chart on the right reflects third quarter operating cash flow as reported on a per-share metric for a number of our North American peers. The numbers speak for themselves. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to discuss the regional operating results for the quarter.

As you can see on Slide 9, North America produced 495,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter. Production was lower than the year-ago quarter as a result of lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin and lower ore feed at Mill 5 du",1039,"Thanks, Russell. As you can see on Slide 9, North America produced 495,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter. Production was lower than the year-ago quarter as a result of lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin and lower ore feed at Mill 5 due to the Gold Quarry slide that occurred in late 2009. On a positive note, we experienced higher mine production at Leeville, which offset some of the impacts of Gold Quarry. We saw production increases at La Herradura, which benefited from the commencement of production at the Soledad and Dipolos pits. 
Costs applicable to sales in North America were $565 per ounce due to a higher proportion of underground mining and additional surface mining costs due to the Gold Quarry slide, partially offset by copper and silver by-product credits. Twin Creeks' cost per ton was unfavorably impacted by the timing of leach ore placed at the end of 2009. And additionally, mining optimization work at Twin Creeks has focused on accelerating mill ore as opposed to leach ore to help offset the Gold Quarry slide.
In South America, we produced 187,000 equity ounces, a decrease of 33% as expected from the prior-year quarter, as shown on Slide 10. Production included contributions from Chaquicocha, which partially offset lower placed ore from La Quinua where paleosoils limited our leach ore placement. Costs applicable to sales were $420 per ounce, up 43% from 2009 due to lower production, higher waste mining and higher maintenance costs, production taxes and royalties as a result of the higher gold price. This was partially offset by favorable silver by-product credits.
In the third quarter, commercial production began at our La Zanja joint venture with Buenaventura who is the operator. La Zanja is located about 40 miles west of Yanacocha, and is expected to produce 15,000 equity ounces in 2010.
Turning to Slide 11. In the Asia-Pacific region, we produced 570,000 equity ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of $451 per ounce. At Batu Hijau, we encountered a dry season that was uncharacteristically wet, affecting our access to the bottom of the pit during the third quarter. On a positive note, we experienced higher grades in recoveries at KCGM, as positive mill reconciliations for July and August were coupled with good grade from the reward ore body. We also experienced solid overall performance at Jundee and Waihi. Costs moved upwards in the third quarter due to higher drilling, loading and hauling costs at Boddington, as well as higher proportion of underground mine operating development costs at Jundee.
Moving to Slide 12. We continue to work towards consistent production at Boddington. While we report Boddington as part of our Asia-Pacific region, we thought it would be helpful to also understand its contribution on a stand-alone basis relative to the rest of our portfolio. For the third quarter, gold production was 180,000 ounces, virtually unchanged from Q2. And copper production was 14 million pounds. We did have issues with the main circuit breaker and tailings stiffener [ph] in August, which did adversely impact mill throughput during the quarter. 
Since the end of the quarter, we had a good October at Boddington with 2.8 million tons milled. Our processing plant continues to perform in line with our expectations and should achieve nameplate capacity in the first quarter of 2011. As I mentioned earlier in my Asia-Pacific remarks, costs applicable to sales have been higher than anticipated due to a stronger Australian dollar and higher-than-expected mining and milling costs during the ramp-up.
Let's turn to Slide 13. On the positive side, we continue to see solid performance from the high-pressure grinding rolls and wet plant at Boddington, while recoveries and concentrate quality continue to be better than expected. Our challenges still involve lower gold grades, though that is based on less than 3% of reserves mined to date, dry plant wear rates and higher mining costs as a result of fragmentation issues and the stronger Australian dollar.
Turning to Slide 14. I would like to discuss Batu Hijau briefly, which is another component of our Asia-Pacific region. As an update to our ownership position, no shares were divested during the quarter, and our effective economic interest remains at 48.5%. We offered the final 7% ownership stake for sale in March. We have reached an accord on price with the central government. And it is important to point out that the final settlement price will be net of dividends paid in 2010. 
With regards to operations, we experienced unseasonably heavy rainfall in the third quarter, limiting our access to the bottom of the pit and requiring us to have higher-than-expected production from lower grade stockpiles. We've had a dry October, which has allowed us to extend Phase 5 mining through October as the rains have held off.
We typically plan to be out of the bottom of the pit by October 15, so any production we derive from the pit bottom beyond this date is a bonus. For the balance of the year, ore grades at Batu Hijau are expected to move lower when we suspend mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and begin processing ore from stockpiles as mining will be primarily for Phase 6 waste removal. We expect Phase 6 ore to become the primary ore feed commencing in 2014. 
On the expansion front, Indonesia's Forestry Minister approved the permitting of another 198 hectares at Batu Hijau. This permit was issued a few weeks ago and is valid until April 2025. It's important for operations moving forward as it allows for waste dump expansion into the newly permitted area starting in the second quarter of 2011.
Moving to Slide 15. Our Africa region had a solid quarter, producing 156,000 ounces, up slightly from the same quarter in 2009 due to higher grades in recoveries as we mined the higher grade ore from the Apensu pit. We also had a small contribution to our production total from the Amoma pit in the third quarter, which started up ahead of schedule. Costs applicable to sales decreased 5% to $422 per ounce due to higher production, partially offset by higher diesel and royalty costs. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Richard.

I'd like to now shift our focus from the quarter to the future. We have a number of exciting projects that will, over the next several years, bring reserves and resources into productive capacity, extending our mine life and providing incremental gold and copper exposure to our investors.
Normally, Guy Lansdown, our EVP of Discovery and Development, would cover this section. But he is in Ghana at the moment, so I'm going to take this over. 
Africa is our fastest growing region where we have three projects underway in addition to our existing operations at Ahafo. The first project is Akyem, which is expected to double our current annual production in Africa. We believe it has a potential for 8 million to 9 million ounces of gold. After some additional drilling, infill drilling in the first half of the year, we've refined our view of the ore body and completed our metallurgical test work. We've provided further updates on Slide 17. And as you can see, we're advancing towards completion of detailed engineering by the end of 2010 and expect the full funds decision in the first half of 2011. We're also in the process of developing mine planning and processing options with a goal of production startup in late 2013 to early 2014.
Moving to Slides 18 and 19, you'll see a picture of our underground decline at Subika, which is another compelling growth story within Newmont's Africa region and, in fact, within our Ahafo operation. The ore body is open at depth and strike with a current potential estimate of 9 million gold ounces. Work continues to advance on the decline, which is currently at approximately 1,050 meters.
As you'll see on Slides 20 and 21, we continue to advance our iron ore project at Nimba, where we are in a joint venture with BHP Billiton. We estimate there is current potential for up to 1.3 billion tons of iron ore at Nimba. We're advancing mining and transport agreements with the local governments and also implementing environmental and social responsibility programs. We expect to begin a pre-feasibility study by mid-2011.
Turning to Slides 22 and 23 at Conga in Peru. We recently received approval for our environmental impact assessment. Construction planning is underway supporting our efforts to extend the region's life for decades to come. With current potential of 15 million to 20 million gold ounces and 4 million to 6 million pounds of copper, Conga is one of our most compelling new projects, offering a longer-term productive capacity and creating a bridge to other potential projects and opportunities at our existing Yanacocha facility and within this burgeoning mining district. At Conga, we've procured mill engineering, camp buildings and treatment plants. Community relations and environmental work continues to strengthen our long-term relationships in the region.
We've also made significant progress at Hope Bay this year. Our 2010 drilling program was completed on schedule and on budget. The Doris North portal has been collared and the decline initiated as demonstrated in the picture on Slide 24. Our massive Sealift was successfully completed in late summer, and we're well provisioned for the next two years there. We believe the current potential at Hope Bay is up to 9 million ounces of gold as seen on Slide 25.
I'll round out my discussion on our gold projects with the most recent development. In late September, we received our exploration permits at Elang in Indonesia. And on Slides 26 and 27, you get a glimpse of the potential size and scope of this opportunity. As some of you may know, Elang is located about 60 kilometers east of Batu Hijau and is covered under the same contract of work.
Now with the permits on hand, we're anxious to resume our resource definition drilling in June of 2011 when the dry season returns. Our previous exploration results and our preliminary scoping study suggests that Elang is a substantial opportunity with deposits that could ultimately exceed the size of Batu Hijau, which contain about 19 million ounces of gold and 18 million of copper in reserves and NRM. Although it's still early in the development process, we're excited about this significant copper and gold opportunity in Indonesia.
Turning to Slide 28, you'll see that Newmont is well positioned to support these growth projects and to support our future. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, with nearly $7 billion in total available liquidity as of September 30. Our financial position enables us to be involved when we want to be involved, and look both externally and to develop core products internally and still return cash to shareholders, as evidenced by the 50% increase to our quarterly dividend announced on July 28. 
Over the next quarters, we plan to fund development of our Conga, Akyem and Hope Bay projects, as well as continue our development of the Nevada growth projects around Leeville and Gold Quarry, all of these from our exiting liquidity. In addition, we took the opportunity in the third quarter to show up our pension funding, and we expect to be nearly fully funded by the end of the fourth quarter, entirely from existing liquidity. 
We look forward to providing our full year 2011 outlook in the first quarter next year in our Investor Day in April. We also plan to update the market on the progress of our major projects at Conga and Akyem as we move towards full funding approvals in the first half of 2011.
I'll conclude on Slide 29 by highlighting that Newmont is consistently generating industry-leading cash flow in a strong metals price environment. Our financial results emphasize that our business captures the full costs of production, not just cash costs, but cash costs plus sustaining a new project capital, allowing us to develop compelling new growth opportunities, invest opportunistically and return capital to shareholders, while providing opportunities for our employees and the host communities where we operate. As a management team, it's our goal to consistently deliver those results, while providing a compelling investment opportunity.
With that, I'd like to thank you, all, for listening, and open the call for questions.

I want to just emphasize though that over the long term, we do expect that gold grades will still be at the mine average that we'd anticipated for a longer period of time.

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we'll start on Slide 3. 
If you've been following Newmont recently, the themes of execution, cash flow, flexibility, margin expansion and leadership will sound very familiar to you. That's by design as we believe consistent delivery creates sustainable value.
Our consistent focus on production and cost management applied across our portfolio of assets gives us the ability to deliver the most cash flow leverage per share of any gold company in the world. That cash flow in turn gives us the flexibility to fund exploration, by far, the cheapest source of new reserve growth and to fund our considerable project development pipeline with an expectation of favorable real returns. And our free cash flow generation provides us the confidence to return capital to shareholders as evidenced by our 50% increase in our dividend announced in the last quarter and sustained this quarter.
While we continue to focus on optimizing the results from each of our existing operations, we're also transitioning our Boddington project through ramp-up and into steady-state operations. During the third quarter, we strengthened our senior management team at Boddington to support this transition. And we are now forming a special project team to optimize and de-bottleneck the mine and process plant as we complete that transition into ongoing operations.
An initial component of this optimization process has been the installation of a sixth MP-1000 secondary crusher, which will be commissioned this month. As a 20-year-plus asset with compelling exploration potential, our expectations for Boddington continue to be high. Alongside optimizing our existing operations and transitioning Boddington to full capacity, we're also simultaneously preparing for our next significant project development campaign, which includes Conga and Peru, Akyem in Ghana, Hope Bay in the Canadian Arctic and several near mine development opportunities in the Carlin Trend in Nevada.
Moving to Slide 4, you'll see a snapshot of our global production in the third quarter. Newmont produced 1.4 million equity ounces of gold at an average realized price of $1,221 per ounce and cost applicable to sales of $477 per ounce. Our North American region contributed 35% of our total quarterly equity gold production. South America contributed 13%, and Africa contributed 11%. Our Asia-Pacific region contributed the remaining 41% of our quarterly gold production and all of our 83 million pounds of equity copper production.
Within our APAC region, our newest mine, Boddington, produced 180,000 ounces of gold and 14 million pounds of copper in the quarter. With the first three quarters of the year behind us, we've narrowed our overall outlook for 2010 equity gold and copper production to 5.3 million to 5.4 million ounces for the year. We've also reduced our 2010 capital spending outlook by about $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. 
And as we suggested in our July earnings call, higher gold prices and unfavorable exchange ratios have led to higher costs in the third quarter. We've expanded our outlook for gold cost applicable to sales to a range of $485 to $500 per ounce for 2010, still below the gold industry average and highly influenced by higher gold and a higher Australian dollar rate. You can find more details on our 2010 outlook in the appendix to this presentation. 
I'd like to now turn the presentation over to our Chief Financial Officer, Russell Ball, to fill you in with more details on our financial performance."
291795,99084160,84439,"Newmont Mining Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Newmont Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Richard. Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter performance compared to the prior-year quarter. We recognized record revenue of $2.6 billion on higher equity gold and copper production and average net realized prices of $1,221 an ounce and $3.67 a p",612,"Thanks, Richard. Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter performance compared to the prior-year quarter. We recognized record revenue of $2.6 billion on higher equity gold and copper production and average net realized prices of $1,221 an ounce and $3.67 a pound, respectively. Looking at the screens earlier this morning, we were trading at $1,356 and $3.80, so significantly higher than the averages realized for the third quarter. 
With significantly higher operating margins, we reported adjusted net income for the third quarter of $1.08 a share, an increase of 37% from the year-ago quarter and some $0.10 to $0.12 above consensus. Reported net income was slightly higher than the adjusted net income due to a small net gain on an asset disposition which we backed out.
I didn't want to ignore the two red arrows on the slide, namely costs applicable to sales for both gold and copper, which were up 18% and 46%, respectively. And we'll cover this in more detail on Slide 7.
When you look at industry-wide cost trends as reflected on Slide 6, you will see that while we are faring better than the industry average, we are all experiencing upward cost pressures as mines age, the complexities of the ores we treat increases and average ore grades decrease. On the slide, Newmont's costs applicable to sales are shown in blue, and that compared against the GFMS average in gray. 
Our third quarter CAS of $477 an ounce is below the GFMS average of $535 per ounce for the second quarter, the most recent available. And we'll undoubtedly be well below the average for the third quarter when all producers have reported. The 61% operating margin for the third quarter, the highest in recent memory, what others will likely be eclipsed in the fourth quarter given where metal prices are trading today.
On Slide 7, we've highlighted our costs applicable to sales outlook from February 2010 to where we stand today. Our original guidance, as Richard mentioned earlier, was based on a $900 gold price and an AUD $80 exchange rate assumption. The higher realized gold price and stronger Australian dollar or maybe that should be a weaker U.S. dollar in today's context, collectively added about $19 an ounce to operating costs.  And as I've said on the second quarter call, these are higher operating costs we don't mind paying given the increase in margin. 
Lower production volume and higher spending, primarily at Boddington and Batu Hijau contributed another $11 per ounce in higher costs. Our copper CAS outlook remains unchanged at $0.85 to $0.95 per pound, with lower production costs from Batu Hijau offset by higher costs from Boddington.
Slide 8 focuses on free cash flow generation, as we believe that this metric is the ultimate determinant of value for this and any other business. We delivered operating cash flow in excess of $850 million for the quarter. And this was off the funding of pension obligations in the amount of approximately $60 million and $130 million prepayment of income taxes, which we expect to be refunded next year. I should note that included in operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2009 was $175 million of income tax refund.
So in summary, strong operating cash flow generation, but some big working capital movements that are not always easy to forecast. The chart on the right reflects third quarter operating cash flow as reported on a per-share metric for a number of our North American peers. The numbers speak for themselves. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to discuss the regional operating results for the quarter."

As you can see on Slide 9, North America produced 495,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter. Production was lower than the year-ago quarter as a result of lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin and lower ore feed at Mill 5 du",1038,"Thanks, Russell. As you can see on Slide 9, North America produced 495,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter. Production was lower than the year-ago quarter as a result of lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin and lower ore feed at Mill 5 due to the Gold Quarry slide that occurred in late 2009. On a positive note, we experienced higher mine production at Leeville, which offset some of the impacts of Gold Quarry. We saw production increases at La Herradura, which benefited from the commencement of production at the Soledad and Dipolos pits. 
Costs applicable to sales in North America were $565 per ounce due to a higher proportion of underground mining and additional surface mining costs due to the Gold Quarry slide, partially offset by copper and silver by-product credits. Twin Creeks' cost per ton was unfavorably impacted by the timing of leach ore placed at the end of 2009. And additionally, mining optimization work at Twin Creeks has focused on accelerating mill ore as opposed to leach ore to help offset the Gold Quarry slide.
In South America, we produced 187,000 equity ounces, a decrease of 33% as expected from the prior-year quarter, as shown on Slide 10. Production included contributions from Chaquicocha, which partially offset lower placed ore from La Quinua where paleosoils limited our leach ore placement. Costs applicable to sales were $420 per ounce, up 43% from 2009 due to lower production, higher waste mining and higher maintenance costs, production taxes and royalties as a result of the higher gold price. This was partially offset by favorable silver by-product credits.
In the third quarter, commercial production began at our La Zanja joint venture with Buenaventura who is the operator. La Zanja is located about 40 miles west of Yanacocha, and is expected to produce 15,000 equity ounces in 2010.
Turning to Slide 11. In the Asia-Pacific region, we produced 570,000 equity ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of $451 per ounce. At Batu Hijau, we encountered a dry season that was uncharacteristically wet, affecting our access to the bottom of the pit during the third quarter. On a positive note, we experienced higher grades in recoveries at KCGM, as positive mill reconciliations for July and August were coupled with good grade from the reward ore body. We also experienced solid overall performance at Jundee and Waihi. Costs moved upwards in the third quarter due to higher drilling, loading and hauling costs at Boddington, as well as higher proportion of underground mine operating development costs at Jundee.
Moving to Slide 12. We continue to work towards consistent production at Boddington. While we report Boddington as part of our Asia-Pacific region, we thought it would be helpful to also understand its contribution on a stand-alone basis relative to the rest of our portfolio. For the third quarter, gold production was 180,000 ounces, virtually unchanged from Q2. And copper production was 14 million pounds. We did have issues with the main circuit breaker and tailings stiffener in August, which did adversely impact mill throughput during the quarter. 
Since the end of the quarter, we had a good October at Boddington with 2.8 million tons milled. Our processing plant continues to perform in line with our expectations and should achieve nameplate capacity in the first quarter of 2011. As I mentioned earlier in my Asia-Pacific remarks, costs applicable to sales have been higher than anticipated due to a stronger Australian dollar and higher-than-expected mining and milling costs during the ramp-up.
Let's turn to Slide 13. On the positive side, we continue to see solid performance from the high-pressure grinding rolls and wet plant at Boddington, while recoveries and concentrate quality continue to be better than expected. Our challenges still involve lower gold grades, though that is based on less than 3% of reserves mined to date, dry plant wear rates and higher mining costs as a result of fragmentation issues and the stronger Australian dollar.
Turning to Slide 14. I would like to discuss Batu Hijau briefly, which is another component of our Asia-Pacific region. As an update to our ownership position, no shares were divested during the quarter, and our effective economic interest remains at 48.5%. We offered the final 7% ownership stake for sale in March. We have reached an accord on price with the central government. And it is important to point out that the final settlement price will be net of dividends paid in 2010. 
With regards to operations, we experienced unseasonably heavy rainfall in the third quarter, limiting our access to the bottom of the pit and requiring us to have higher-than-expected production from lower grade stockpiles. We've had a dry October, which has allowed us to extend Phase 5 mining through October as the rains have held off.
We typically plan to be out of the bottom of the pit by October 15, so any production we derive from the pit bottom beyond this date is a bonus. For the balance of the year, ore grades at Batu Hijau are expected to move lower when we suspend mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and begin processing ore from stockpiles as mining will be primarily for Phase 6 waste removal. We expect Phase 6 ore to become the primary ore feed commencing in 2014. 
On the expansion front, Indonesia's Forestry Minister approved the permitting of another 198 hectares at Batu Hijau. This permit was issued a few weeks ago and is valid until April 2025. It's important for operations moving forward as it allows for waste dump expansion into the newly permitted area starting in the second quarter of 2011.
Moving to Slide 15. Our Africa region had a solid quarter, producing 156,000 ounces, up slightly from the same quarter in 2009 due to higher grades in recoveries as we mined the higher grade ore from the Apensu pit. We also had a small contribution to our production total from the Amoma pit in the third quarter, which started up ahead of schedule. Costs applicable to sales decreased 5% to $422 per ounce due to higher production, partially offset by higher diesel and royalty costs. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Richard."

I'd like to now shift our focus from the quarter to the future. We have a number of exciting projects that will, over the next several years, bring reserves and resources into productive capacity, extending our mine life and providing incremental gold and copper exposure to our investors.
Normally, Guy Lansdown, our EVP of Discovery and Development, would cover this section. But he is in Ghana at the moment, so I'm going to take this over. 
Africa is our fastest growing region where we have three projects underway in addition to our existing operations at Ahafo. The first project is Akyem, which is expected to double our current annual production in Africa. We believe it has a potential for 8 million to 9 million ounces of gold. After some additional drilling, infill drilling in the first half of the year, we've refined our view of the ore body and completed our metallurgical test work. We've provided further updates on Slide 17. And as you can see, we're advancing towards completion of detailed engineering by the end of 2010 and expect the full funds decision in the first half of 2011. We're also in the process of developing mine planning and processing options with a goal of production startup in late 2013 to early 2014.
Moving to Slides 18 and 19, you'll see a picture of our underground decline at Subika, which is another compelling growth story within Newmont's Africa region and, in fact, within our Ahafo operation. The ore body is open at depth and strike with a current potential estimate of 9 million gold ounces. Work continues to advance on the decline, which is currently at approximately 1,050 meters.
As you'll see on Slides 20 and 21, we continue to advance our iron ore project at Nimba, where we are in a joint venture with BHP Billiton. We estimate there is current potential for up to 1.3 billion tons of iron ore at Nimba. We're advancing mining and transport agreements with the local governments and also implementing environmental and social responsibility programs. We expect to begin a pre-feasibility study by mid-2011.
Turning to Slides 22 and 23 at Conga in Peru. We recently received approval for our environmental impact assessment. Construction planning is underway supporting our efforts to extend the region's life for decades to come. With current potential of 15 million to 20 million gold ounces and 4 million to 6 million pounds of copper, Conga is one of our most compelling new projects, offering a longer-term productive capacity and creating a bridge to other potential projects and opportunities at our existing Yanacocha facility and within this burgeoning mining district. At Conga, we've procured mill engineering, camp buildings and treatment plants. Community relations and environmental work continues to strengthen our long-term relationships in the region.
We've also made significant progress at Hope Bay this year. Our 2010 drilling program was completed on schedule and on budget. The Doris North portal has been collared and the decline initiated as demonstrated in the picture on Slide 24. Our massive Sealift was successfully completed in late summer, and we're well provisioned for the next two years there. We believe the current potential at Hope Bay is up to 9 million ounces of gold as seen on Slide 25.
I'll round out my discussion on our gold projects with the most recent development. In late September, we received our exploration permits at Elang in Indonesia. And on Slides 26 and 27, you get a glimpse of the potential size and scope of this opportunity. As some of you may know, Elang is located about 60 kilometers east of Batu Hijau and is covered under the same contract of work.
Now with the permits on hand, we're anxious to resume our resource definition drilling in June of 2011 when the dry season returns. Our previous exploration results and our preliminary scoping study suggests that Elang is a substantial opportunity with deposits that could ultimately exceed the size of Batu Hijau, which contained about 19 million ounces of gold and 18 million of copper in reserves and NRM. Although it's still early in the development process, we're excited about this significant copper and gold opportunity in Indonesia.
Turning to Slide 28, you'll see that Newmont is well positioned to support these growth projects and to support our future. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, with nearly $7 billion in total available liquidity as of September 30. Our financial position enables us to be involved when we want to be involved, and look both externally and to develop core products internally and still return cash to shareholders, as evidenced by the 50% increase to our quarterly dividend announced on July 28. 
Over the next quarters, we plan to fund development of our Conga, Akyem and Hope Bay projects, as well as continue our development of the Nevada growth projects around Leeville and Gold Quarry, all of these from our existing liquidity. In addition, we took the opportunity in the third quarter to show up our pension funding, and we expect to be nearly fully funded by the end of the fourth quarter, entirely from existing liquidity. 
We look forward to providing our full year 2011 outlook in the first quarter next year in our Investor Day in April. We also plan to update the market on the progress of our major projects at Conga and Akyem as we move towards full funding approvals in the first half of 2011.
I'll conclude on Slide 29 by highlighting that Newmont is consistently generating industry-leading cash flow in this strong metals price environment. Our financial results emphasize that our business captures the full costs of production, not just cash costs, but cash costs plus sustaining a new project capital, allowing us to develop compelling new growth opportunities, invest opportunistically and return capital to shareholders, while providing opportunities for our employees and the host communities where we operate. As a management team, it's our goal to consistently deliver those results, while providing a compelling investment opportunity.
With that, I'd like to thank you, all, for listening, and open the call for questions."

And the one where Batu Hijau is has seen the economic benefits. Elang is in a different Kabu-paten. And the local government is very keen to attract the investment. I would submit that some of the unrest back in the 2005 time frame was related to the impending divestiture. And as Richard said, we've worked through that process. We have alignment, while never in total agreement with the local governments. And we have their support, particularly at the regional level.

For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we'll start on Slide 3. If you've been following Newmont recently, the themes of execution, cash flow, flexibility, margin expansion and leadership will sound very familiar to you.",573," Thanks, John. For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we'll start on Slide 3.
 If you've been following Newmont recently, the themes of execution, cash flow, flexibility, margin expansion and leadership will sound very familiar to you. That's by design as we believe consistent delivery creates sustainable value.
 Our consistent focus on production and cost management applied across our portfolio of assets gives us the ability to deliver the most cash flow leverage per share of any gold company in the world. That cash flow in turn gives us the flexibility to fund exploration, by far, the cheapest source of new reserve growth and to fund our considerable project development pipeline with an expectation of favorable real returns. And our free cash flow generation provides us the confidence to return capital to shareholders as evidenced by our 50% increase in our dividend announced in the last quarter and sustained this quarter.
 While we continue to focus on optimizing the results from each of our existing operations, we're also transitioning our Boddington project through ramp-up and into steady-state operations. During the third quarter, we strengthened our senior management team at Boddington to support this transition. And we are now forming a special project team to optimize and de-bottleneck the mine and process plant as we complete that transition into ongoing operations.
 An initial component of this optimization process has been the installation of a sixth MP-1000 secondary crusher, which will be commissioned this month. As a 20-year-plus asset with compelling exploration potential, our expectations for Boddington continue to be high. Alongside optimizing our existing operations and transitioning Boddington to full capacity, we're also simultaneously preparing for our next significant project development campaign, which includes Conga and Peru, Akyem in Ghana, Hope Bay in the Canadian Arctic and several near mine development opportunities in the Carlin Trend in Nevada.
 Moving to Slide 4, you'll see a snapshot of our global production in the third quarter. Newmont produced 1.4 million equity ounces of gold at an average realized price of $1,221 per ounce and cost applicable to sales of $477 per ounce. Our North American region contributed 35% of our total quarterly equity gold production. South America contributed 13%, and Africa contributed 11%. Our Asia-Pacific region contributed the remaining 41% of our quarterly gold production and all of our 83 million pounds of equity copper production.
 Within our APAC region, our newest mine, Boddington, produced 180,000 ounces of gold and 14 million pounds of copper in the quarter. With the first three quarters of the year behind us, we've narrowed our overall outlook for 2010 equity gold and copper production to 5.3 million to 5.4 million ounces for the year. We've also reduced our 2010 capital spending outlook by about $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
 And as we suggested in our July earnings call, higher gold prices and unfavorable exchange ratios have led to higher costs in the third quarter. We've expanded our outlook for gold cost applicable to sales to a range of $485 to $500 per ounce for 2010, still below the gold industry average and highly influenced by higher gold and a higher Australian dollar rate. You can find more details on our 2010 outlook in the appendix to this presentation.
 I'd like to now turn the presentation over to our Chief Financial Officer, Russell Ball, to fill you in with more details on our financial performance.

Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter performance compared to the prior-year quarter. We recognized record revenue of $2.6 billion on higher equity gold and copper production and average net realized prices of $1,221 an ounce and $3.67 a",611," Thanks, Richard. Slide 5 summarizes our third quarter performance compared to the prior-year quarter. We recognized record revenue of $2.6 billion on higher equity gold and copper production and average net realized prices of $1,221 an ounce and $3.67 a pound, respectively. Looking at the screens earlier this morning, we were trading at $1,356 and $3.80, so significantly higher than the averages realized for the third quarter.
 With significantly higher operating margins, we reported adjusted net income for the third quarter of $1.08 a share, an increase of 37% from the year-ago quarter and some $0.10 to $0.12 above consensus. Reported net income was slightly higher than the adjusted net income due to a small net gain on an asset disposition which we backed out.
 I didn't want to ignore the two red arrows on the slide, namely costs applicable to sales for both gold and copper, which were up 18% and 46%, respectively. And we'll cover this in more detail on Slide 7.
 When you look at industry-wide cost trends as reflected on Slide 6, you will see that while we are faring better than the industry average, we are all experiencing upward cost pressures as mines age, the complexities of the ores we treat increases and average ore grades decrease. On the slide, Newmont's costs applicable to sales are shown in blue, and that compared against the GFMS average in gray.
 Our third quarter CAS of $477 an ounce is below the GFMS average of $535 per ounce for the second quarter, the most recent available. And we'll undoubtedly be well below the average for the third quarter when all producers have reported. The 61% operating margin for the third quarter, the highest in recent memory, what others will likely be eclipsed in the fourth quarter given where metal prices are trading today.
 On Slide 7, we've highlighted our costs applicable to sales outlook from February 2010 to where we stand today. Our original guidance, as Richard mentioned earlier, was based on a $900 gold price and an AUD $80 exchange rate assumption. The higher realized gold price and stronger Australian dollar or maybe that should be a weaker U.S. dollar in today's context, collectively added about $19 an ounce to operating costs.  And as I've said on the second quarter call, these are higher operating costs we don't mind paying given the increase in margin.
 Lower production volume and higher spending, primarily at Boddington and Batu Hijau contributed another $11 per ounce in higher costs. Our copper CAS outlook remains unchanged at $0.85 to $0.95 per pound, with lower production costs from Batu Hijau offset by higher costs from Boddington.
 Slide 8 focuses on free cash flow generation, as we believe that this metric is the ultimate determinant of value for this and any other business. We delivered operating cash flow in excess of $850 million for the quarter. And this was off the funding of pension obligations in the amount of approximately $60 million and $130 million prepayment of income taxes, which we expect to be refunded next year. I should note that included in operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2009 was $175 million of income tax refund.
 So in summary, strong operating cash flow generation, but some big working capital movements that are not always to forecast. The chart on the right reflects third quarter operating cash flow as reported on a per-share metric for a number of our North American peers. The numbers speak for themselves.
 And with that, I will turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to discuss the regional operating results for the quarter.

As you can see on Slide 9, North America produced 495,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter. Production was lower than the year-ago quarter as a result of lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin and lower ore feed at Mill 5 d",1039," Thanks, Russell. As you can see on Slide 9, North America produced 495,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter. Production was lower than the year-ago quarter as a result of lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin and lower ore feed at Mill 5 due to the Gold Quarry slide that occurred in late 2009. On a positive note, we experienced higher mine production at Leeville, which offset some of the impacts of Gold Quarry. We saw production increases at La Herradura, which benefited from the commencement of production at the Soledad and Dipolos pits.
 Costs applicable to sales in North America were $565 per ounce due to a higher proportion of underground mining and additional surface mining costs due to the Gold Quarry slide, partially offset by copper and silver by-product credits. Twin Creeks' cost per ton was unfavorably impacted by the timing of leach ore placed at the end of 2009. And additionally, mining optimization work at Twin Creeks has focused on accelerating mill ore as opposed to leach ore to help offset the Gold Quarry slide.
 In South America, we produced 187,000 equity ounces, a decrease of 33% as expected from the prior-year quarter, as shown on Slide 10. Production included contributions from Chaquicocha, which partially offset lower placed ore from La Quinua where paleosoils limited our leach ore placement. Costs applicable to sales were $420 per ounce, up 43% from 2009 due to lower production, higher waste mining and higher maintenance costs, production taxes and royalties as a result of the higher gold price. This was partially offset by favorable silver by-product credits.
 In the third quarter, commercial production began at our La Zanja joint venture with Buenaventura who is the operator. La Zanja is located about 40 miles west of Yanacocha, and is expected to produce 15,000 equity ounces in 2010.
 Turning to Slide 11. In the Asia-Pacific region, we produced 570,000 equity ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of $451 per ounce. At Batu Hijau, we encountered a dry season that was uncharacteristically wet, affecting our access to the bottom of the pit during the third quarter. On a positive note, we experienced higher grades in recoveries at KCGM, as positive mill reconciliations for July and August were coupled with good grade from the reward ore body. We also experienced solid overall performance at Jundee and Waihi. Costs moved upwards in the third quarter due to higher drilling, loading and hauling costs at Boddington, as well as higher proportion of underground mine operating development costs at Jundee.
 Moving to Slide 12. We continue to work towards consistent production at Boddington. While we report Boddington as part of our Asia-Pacific region, we thought it would be helpful to also understand its contribution on a stand-alone basis relative to the rest of our portfolio. For the third quarter, gold production was 180,000 ounces, virtually unchanged from Q2. And copper production was 14 million pounds. We did have issues with the main circuit breaker and tailings stiffener [ph] in August, which did adversely impact mill throughput during the quarter.
 Since the end of the quarter, we had a good October at Boddington with 2.8 million tons milled. Our processing plant continues to perform in line with our expectations and should achieve nameplate capacity in the first quarter of 2011. As I mentioned earlier in my Asia-Pacific remarks, costs applicable to sales have been higher than anticipated due to a stronger Australian dollar and higher-than-expected mining and milling costs during the ramp-up.
 Let's turn to Slide 13. On the positive side, we continue to see solid performance from the high-pressure grinding rolls and wet plant at Boddington, while recoveries and concentrate quality continue to be better than expected. Our challenges still involve lower gold grades, though that is based on less than 3% of reserves mined to date, dry plant wear rates and higher mining costs as a result of fragmentation issues and the stronger Australian dollar.
 Turning to Slide 14. I would like to discuss Batu Hijau briefly, which is another component of our Asia-Pacific region. As an update to our ownership position, no shares were divested during the quarter, and our effective economic interest remains at 48.5%. We offered the final 7% ownership stake for sale in March. We have reached an accord on price with the central government. And it is important to point out that the final settlement price will be net of dividends paid in 2010.
 With regards to operations, we experienced unseasonably heavy rainfall in the third quarter, limiting our access to the bottom of the pit and requiring us to have higher-than-expected production from lower grade stockpiles. We've had a dry October, which has allowed us to extend Phase 5 mining through October as the rains have held off.
 We typically plan to be out of the bottom of the pit by October 15, so any production we derive from the pit bottom beyond this date is a bonus. For the balance of the year, ore grades at Batu Hijau are expected to move lower when we suspend mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and begin processing ore from stockpiles as mining will be primarily for Phase 6 waste removal. We expect Phase 6 ore to become the primary ore feed commencing in 2014.
 On the expansion front, Indonesia's Forestry Minister approved the permitting of another 198 hectares at Batu Hijau. This permit was issued a few weeks ago and is valid until April 2025. It's important for operations moving forward as it allows for waste dump expansion into the newly permitted area starting in the second quarter of 2011.
 Moving to Slide 15. Our Africa region had a solid quarter, producing 156,000 ounces, up slightly from the same quarter in 2009 due to higher grades in recoveries as we mined the higher grade ore from the Apensu pit. We also had a small contribution to our production total from the Amoma pit in the third quarter, which started up ahead of schedule. Costs applicable to sales decreased 5% to $422 per ounce due to higher production, partially offset by higher diesel and royalty costs.
 I'll now turn the call back over to Richard.

I'd like to now shift our focus from the quarter to the future. We have a number of exciting projects that will, over the next several years, bring reserves and resources into productive capacity, extending our mine life and providing incremental gold and copper exposure to our investors.
 Normally, Guy Lansdown, our EVP of Discovery and Development, would cover this section. But he is in Ghana at the moment, so I'm going to take this over.
 Africa is our fastest growing region where we have three projects underway in addition to our existing operations at Ahafo. The first project is Akyem, which is expected to double our current annual production in Africa. We believe it has a potential for 8 million to 9 million ounces of gold. After some additional drilling, infill drilling in the first half of the year, we've refined our view of the ore body and completed our metallurgical test work. We've provided further updates on Slide 17. And as you can see, we're advancing towards completion of detailed engineering by the end of 2010 and expect the full funds decision in the first half of 2011. We're also in the process of developing mine planning and processing options with a goal of production startup in late 2013 to early 2014.
 Moving to Slides 18 and 19, you'll see a picture of our underground decline at Subika, which is another compelling growth story within Newmont's Africa region and, in fact, within our Ahafo operation. The ore body is open at depth and strike with a current potential estimate of 9 million gold ounces. Work continues to advance on the decline, which is currently at approximately 1,050 meters.
 As you'll see on Slides 20 and 21, we continue to advance our iron ore project at Nimba, where we are in a joint venture with BHP Billiton. We estimate there is current potential for up to 1.3 billion tons of iron ore at Nimba. We're advancing mining and transport agreements with the local governments and also implementing environmental and social responsibility programs. We expect to begin a pre-feasibility study by mid-2011.
 Turning to Slides 22 and 23 at Conga in Peru. We recently received approval for our environmental impact assessment. Construction planning is underway supporting our efforts to extend the region's life for decades to come. With current potential of 15 million to 20 million gold ounces and 4 million to 6 million pounds of copper, Conga is one of our most compelling new projects, offering a longer-term productive capacity and creating a bridge to other potential projects and opportunities at our existing Yanacocha facility and within this burgeoning mining district. At Conga, we've procured mill engineering, camp buildings and treatment plants. Community relations and environmental work continues to strengthen our long-term relationships in the region.
 We've also made significant progress at Hope Bay this year. Our 2010 drilling program was completed on schedule and on budget. The Doris North portal has been collared and the decline initiated as demonstrated in the picture on Slide 24. Our massive Sealift was successfully completed in late summer, and we're well provisioned for the next two years there. We believe the current potential at Hope Bay is up to 9 million ounces of gold as seen on Slide 25.
 I'll round out my discussion on our gold projects with the most recent development. In late September, we received our exploration permits at Elang in Indonesia. And on Slides 26 and 27, you get a glimpse of the potential size and scope of this opportunity. As some of you may know, Elang is located about 60 kilometers east of Batu Hijau and is covered under the same contract of work.
 Now with the permits on hand, we're anxious to resume our resource definition drilling in June of 2011 when the dry season returns. Our previous exploration results and our preliminary scoping study suggests that Elang is a substantial opportunity with deposits that could ultimately exceed the size of Batu Hijau, which contain about 19 million ounces of gold and 18 million of copper in reserves and NRM. Although it's still early in the development process, we're excited about this significant copper and gold opportunity in Indonesia.
 Turning to Slide 28, you'll see that Newmont is well positioned to support these growth projects and to support our future. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, with nearly $7 billion in total available liquidity as of September 30. Our financial position enables us to be involved when we want to be involved, and look both externally and to develop core products internally and still return cash to shareholders, as evidenced by the 50% increase to our quarterly dividend announced on July 28.
 Over the next quarters, we plan to fund development of our Conga, Akyem and Hope Bay projects, as well as continue our development of the Nevada growth projects around Leeville and Gold Quarry, all of these from our exiting liquidity. In addition, we took the opportunity in the third quarter to show up our pension funding, and we expect to be nearly fully funded by the end of the fourth quarter, entirely from existing liquidity.
 We look forward to providing our full year 2011 outlook in the first quarter next year in our Investor Day in April. We also plan to update the market on the progress of our major projects at Conga and Akyem as we move towards full funding approvals in the first half of 2011.
 I'll conclude on Slide 29 by highlighting that Newmont is consistently generating industry-leading cash flow in a strong metals price environment. Our financial results emphasize that our business captures the full costs of production, not just cash costs, but cash costs plus sustaining a new project capital, allowing us to develop compelling new growth opportunities, invest opportunistically and return capital to shareholders, while providing opportunities for our employees and the host communities where we operate. As a management team, it's our goal to consistently deliver those results, while providing a compelling investment opportunity.
 With that, I'd like to thank you, all, for listening, and open the call for questions.
