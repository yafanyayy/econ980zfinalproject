Sales in the quarter was $5.7 billion, and net earnings excluding highlighted items were $0.09 per share. For the year, sales were $22 billion and net earnings from continuing operations excluding highlighted items were $0.02 per share. Throughout last year, all of our businesses focused on reducing cost, improving cash flow and providing innovative products and solutions to our customers. In 2009, we reduced our overall cost structure by over $1.9 billion, with $1.5 billion coming in Mobile Devices. We generated over $870 million in operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, ending the year with $8 billion in total cash, up nearly $600 million from the end of 2008. In Mobile Devices, we reduced product platforms, simplified processes and delivered two Android-powered smartphone on time in the fourth quarter, all while implementing a major restructuring of the business. Our new devices have been well received by consumers resulting in shipments of 2 million smartphones in the fourth quarter. In 2009, we significantly reduced Mobile Devices operating loss and cash consumption compared to 2008. All that said, we are just at the beginning stage of our transition to a smartphone company, and we have a lot of work ahead of us. Broadband Mobility Solutions delivered over $1.6 billion in operating earnings for the full year despite the economic headwinds, continued to prioritize R&D to position this business for future growth and sustainable market leadership, and introduced industry-leading products, including a next-generation mission-critical communication platform with the APX family of multi-band radios, and our most advanced rugged mobile computer with the MC9500. As we head into 2010, our markets remain extremely competitive but offer opportunities for growth. Across the company, our priorities will continue to focus on driving innovation, solving customer needs, optimizing our cost structure and improving our financial results. I'll not turn the call over to Ed to review the financial results in more detail, following that, I'll come back to discuss Mobile Devices and then Greg will review Broadband Mobility Solutions.

On a GAAP basis, we reported fourth quarter net earnings of $0.06 per share. This includes net charges of $0.03 per share for highlighted items, which relate primarily to costs associated with business reorganization, preparing for separation of the two public companies and legal settlements, which were partially offset by a gain on a sale of an investment. Excluding highlighted items, earnings were at $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $0.02 per share in the third quarter. The sequential increase in earnings was driven by the increase in sales and improving gross margin percentage, as well as lower other income and expense costs. For the full year, on a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $0.05 per share compared to a loss of $1.87 per share in 2008.Excluding highlighted items earnings from continuing operations were $0.02 per share, flat for 2008. Consistent with previously reported results, earnings include non-cash charges for amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation expense. Beginning this quarter, we will provide details in these expenses to give you additional insight into our earnings performance.For the quarter and full year, on a pretax basis, stock-based compensation expense were $71 million and $296 million respectively. Amortization of intangibles was $68 million and $278 million respectively. Together, these expenses impacted earnings per share by $0.04 in the quarter and by $0.16 for the full year. Further details on our highlighted items, stock compensation expense and amortization of intangibles can be found on our website. Our remaining financial references will exclude highlighted items and include stock compensation expense and amortization of intangibles.Gross margin percentage in the quarter was 36% compared to 33.2% in the third quarter. Sequential improvement was due largely to favorable product mix in Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Mobile Devices, as well as further supply-chain efficiencies in Mobile Devices. For the full year, gross margin percentage improved to 32.3% from 29.9% in 2008, driven largely by the change in our overall sales mix among the businesses.Operating expenses in the quarter were $320 million or 15% below the year-ago level and up sequentially, primarily due to Mobile Devices' support of its new product launches. Throughout 2009, we maintained a continuous focus on improving our cost structure. Compared to the end of 2008, we reduced headcount levels by nearly 11,000 or 17%, dramatically reduced discretionary spending and reduced our real estate footprint by approximately 15%, by closing or downsizing several sites around the world. These and other actions contributed to a year-over-year reduction in operating expenses of over $1.9 billion.Operating earnings in the quarter were $311 million, up from $171 million in the third quarter. For the full year, operating earnings were $271 million, a 12% increase compared to 2008. Several other income and expense was the net income in the quarter compared to a net expense in the third quarter. This was driven in part by lower net interest expense and improvements in our investment portfolio results.In 2010, we expect total other income and expense to return to our quarterly net expense, including quarterly net interest expense levels more consistent with the third quarter of 2009. Our ongoing tax rate was 34% for the quarter and full year. We would expect our ongoing tax rate in 2010 to be in the 34% to 35% range.Moving now to the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $877 million, for the full year, operating cash flow was $629 million, and we ended the year with total cash of $8 billion. This compares to $7.2 million at the end of the third quarter, and $7.4 billion at the end of 2008.The Increase in total cash of nearly $600 million in 2009 was a result of consistent execution on many fronts, including reductions in operating costs and improved working capital management. In the quarter, we reduced inventory by $250 million driven by reductions in each of the businesses. The total inventory reduction for all of 2009 was over 50% or nearly $1.4 billion. Inventory turns improved to 11 from eight at the end of 2008, driven by improved inventory turn performance in all of our businesses. In Mobile Devices, turns are now in the mid-teens compared to mid-single digits in 2008.Fourth quarter accounts receivable were sequentially higher due to the higher sales level. This also reflects a decline in a level of sold receivables from 379 million in the third quarter to 280 million, as we continue to optimize the level of sold receivables. Even with this decline DSO remain flat with the third quarter at 57 days. During the quarter, we repatriated over 500 million, bringing total repatriations of 2009 to 2.5 billion. We increased our U.S. cash position to 3.4 billion compared 2.4 billion at the end of the third quarter, and 2 billion at the end of 2008. U.S. cash is now 43% of total cash compared to 27% at the end of 2008.Turning now to our outlook, excluding items of the variety typically highlighted in our quarterly earnings releases, we expect a first quarter net loss in the range of negative $0.01 to negative $0.03 per share. From a cash perspective, we expect total cash at the end of the first quarter to be flat to slightly below current levels. With that, I'll pass the call back to Sanjay to discuss Mobile Devices."

We shifted total of 12 million units, including 2 million Android-based smartphones. In the quarter, we deferred revenues and the related costs for certain smartphones sold and we'll be amortizing these amounts over 24 months as required under GAAP. The impact in the quarter is a deferral of approximately $200 million in sales and the associated gross margin. Including the deferred sales, our overall ASP was $169 compared to $124 in the third quarter. Beginning with the first quarter 2010, we expect to adopt new accounting rules that will require us to defer only a portion of the revenues for smartphones sold. As a result, the quarterly impact of deferred revenue will be significantly lower than what we experienced in the fourth quarter 2009. The operating loss in the quarter was 114 million, excluding highlighted items compared to an operating loss of 183 million in the third quarter. The sequential improvement reflect the higher gross margin percentage due to significant contribution from smartphones, as well as further supply-chain efficiencies.From an operational perspective, we made significant progress in 2009. Restructuring the business resulted in operating expenses that were nearly $1.5 billion lower than in 2008. Going forward, we'll continue to tightly manage our operating expenses as we dial down in some areas, including feature phones and redirect resources into smartphone innovation, supporting new product launches and building our brand. Last year, we also made a number of improvements in supply-chain and operational execution, with inventory turns in the mid-teens now and a high level of operating effectiveness, we expect to see benefits this year in gross margin, quality and time to market.  Since the launch of CLIQ with MOTOBLUR and DROID, we have added four additional smartphones to our portfolio. In late December, we announced our first two devices for the China market, both of which are now shipping including the TD-SCDMA OPhone for China Mobile, which features a thin 12.3mm form factor and mobile TV functionality. And the XT800 for China Telecom, a dual-mode, dual-sim device that features Android 2.0 and handwriting recognition.So far, in January, we have announced BACKFLIP with MOTOBLUR. BACKFLIP is a mid-tier device with a reverse flip QWERTY keyboard and a navigational touch panel on the back of the device. We plan to ship this device in several countries including U.S. before the end of the quarter, and MOTOROI featuring Android 2.0 and an eight-megapixel camera for SK Telecom, making it the first Android smartphone available in the Korean market.Later this quarter, we will announce our current smartphone to China market with another carrier. All of our smartphone devices are readily upgradable, subject only to hardware constraints. We work closely with our carrier customers to determine an appropriate and timely upgrade path for each device.  CLIQ, BACKFLIP and the majority of our new smartphones this year, will feature MOTOBLUR. MOTOBLUR is our application and services suite that runs on Android platform. Our current release of MOTOBLUR addresses the social networking segment of the market, by providing users with dynamic pushed Internet content in a unique user interface. It also aggregates and auto-delivers messages, contacts, social network broadcasts and other Internet content. With hundreds of thousands of activation already, we are able to better understand how to best serve our customers and evolve the suite of services.Some of our plans for MOTOBLUR include enhancements to address the prosumer segment of the market. These are users who pay for their own devices and use it for both their personal and work lives. By expanding MOTOBLUR to offer additional security and device management functionality, we will address the need of this part of the market. We also plan to broaden the scope of MOTOBLUR by doing to multimedia what we did to social messaging, by enabling users to share music, photos and other content in an interactive and dynamic way. In addition, we are planning to optimize device performance on the network to further conserve bandwidth and provide improved file management for consumers.The ecosystem around Android-powered smartphones also continues to evolve. With over 20,000 apps today, it is the fastest growing ecosystem in the industry. For consumers in China, we recently announced SHOP4APPS, Motorola's store for Android applications. SHOP4APPS will be available pre-loaded or over-the-air on Motorola smartphones. We're also providing a feature that allows users to select their own search provider. With our store, and the ability to customize these devices, consumers in China will have a wide choice in applications and services including search, e-mail and maps for their Motorola smartphone.Moving on to outlook. As we head into 2010, I think of our portfolio across three market segments. Smartphones, Feature phones and Voice-centric Low-end phones. First, in Smartphone, we plan to launch at least 20 devices, including at least one direct to consumer device with Google. We expect to ship between 11 to 14 million smartphones over the course of the year, with smartphones accounting for over 50% of our total sales this year.In Feature phones, in the mid to high tier, we expect our legacy portfolio to meaningfully decline throughout the year, as consumers migrate to smartphones. Finally in Voice-centric Low-end phones for emerging markets places largely, our focus will be to build brand awareness and meet customer needs for products at multiple price points. We'll utilize an ODM model for these devices and expect unit volumes to ramp throughout the year.For the first quarter, we expect total unit shipments and sales to be lowered compared to the fourth quarter. Given some market seasonality, we expect smartphone shipments to be down slightly from the fourth quarter. With our focus on smartphone innovation and support of new product launches, OpEx will be essentially flat with fourth quarter. The operating loss will be higher sequentially.In closing, we accomplished a lot in 2009 and the reception to our smartphone portfolio has been positive. We have seen a meaningful improvement in our brand recognition particularly, in the intent to buy of Motorola's smartphones. In 2010, we expect to improve financial results sequentially throughout the year, as we ramp our smartphone and ODM volumes. We expect more significant improvement to come in the second half, including a plan to be profitable in the fourth quarter. With that, I'll pass the call over to Greg, to discuss Broadband Mobility Solutions."

Broadband Mobility Solutions has delivered another strong quarter, with sequentially higher sales, operating margin and cash generation. For the full year, we generated $15 billion in sales and $1.8 billion in operating earnings and generated significant levels of operating cash flow. During the year, we reduced operating expenses, maintained a strong focus on innovation and R&D, and reduced working capital levels driven in a large part by improved inventory performance. We divested non-core businesses and acquired several companies to expand our technology capabilities and complement our portfolio of solutions. Overall, I'm pleased with the leadership, the operational execution and the financial results in each of our businesses, particularly in light of the difficult circumstances and uncertainty that we faced in 2009.Turning now to fourth quarter results. Sales in Home and Networks Mobility were $2 billion, operating margin, excluding highlighted items was 9.4% compared to 9.9% in the third quarter. For the full year, Home and Networks Mobility sales were $8 billion, with sales lower in both Home and Networks compared to 2008.Despite the decline in sales by reducing operating expenses and improving gross margin percentage, we achieved an operating margin of 9.1% compared to 9.6% in 2008. In Home, fourth quarter sales were $1 billion, digital entertainment device shipments were 3.4  million units, including our 100 millionth digital entertainment device. In the quarter, there was a slight seasonal uptick in CPE demand and a pick up in sales of infrastructure, compared to the third quarter.In November, we reached an agreement to acquire BitBand, a leading provider of content management and delivery systems, specializing in video on demand for IPTV. This acquisition will add to our portfolio of on-demand solutions and enable us to address a wider range of deployment scales, access networks and video formats. This month, we completed the acquisition of SecureMedia, a company that specializes in digital rights management for IP video networks. With this acquisition, we will be able to offer both standalone and integrated digital security solutions to IP video customers.Looking ahead for Home, we anticipate continued near-term pressure on demand for digital entertainment devices until market conditions improve in the U.S., particularly with regard to consumer spending and housing. Partially offsetting this, we do anticipate demand for video infrastructure equipment to gradually improve through the year, due to operators need for more bandwidth and provisioning of advanced services to consumers. That said, we expect operating margin in Home to improve in 2010 compared to mid-single digit margins in 2009, as we pursue opportunities to improve gross margin, further prioritize our investments and tightly manage our costs.In Networks, sales in the fourth quarter were approximately $1 billion, sales were lower sequentially due to the high level of WiMAX revenue in the third quarter. For the full year, network sales were nearly $4.1 billion, this included over $600 million in WiMAX sales and lower sales of 2G and 3G technologies on a year-over-year basis. The team did an outstanding job in driving cash and earnings in this business, by aggressively reducing operating costs and improving product mix resulting in a double-digit operating margin for the Networks organization for the year. As we look ahead to 2010, in Networks, we anticipate an overall year-on-year sales decline of approximately 10%, reflecting lower 2G and 3G sales, and WiMAX sales that are comparable to 2009 levels. If market conditions and product mix remain favorable, we expect to again, reach double-digit operating margin levels in 2010. Priorities in networks this year will continue to be on optimizing the 2G and 3G businesses, while continuing to balance our investment in 4G broadband technologies.  In WiMAX, we will build upon a strong portfolio of customers and leveraging our market leadership. In LTE, we will continue to evolve a competitive brand solution while focusing on existing wireless network customers, including KDDI, China Mobile and other leading operators.Turning to our outlook for the first quarter for Home and Networks Mobility, we expect the soft demand environment in Home to continue, and we also expect lower sales in Networks. As a result, as compared to the first quarter 2009, we expect sales to be down in the double-digit range and operating margin to be comparable. In Enterprise Mobility Solutions, fourth quarter sales were $2 billion, up 10% sequentially, consistent with seasonal trends. Excluding highlighted items, operating margin was 20.3% compared to 17.3% in the third quarter. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to higher sales and product mix. For the full year, sales in Enterprise Mobility Solutions were $7 billion, sales were lower than 2008, primarily due to economic conditions impacting the indirect channel for two-way communication solutions and the enterprise markets.Operating margin for the full year declined to 16% from 18.8% in 2008 due to the lower sales level, offset partially by a reduction in operating expenses. Fourth quarter sales in North America were higher sequentially. Demand for ASTRO system solutions was strong, sales of APX radios were higher, and sales in the indirect channel grew in double digits. Enterprise sales were also up sequentially in double digits. In the EMEA and Asia Pac regions, sales were higher sequentially, driven primarily by government and public safety markets. During the quarter, we further expanded our APX product portfolio by shipping the industry's first multi-band mobile radio. We also doubled the number of APX customers to over 200. In 2010, we plan to ship additional band releases for both the portable and mobile, as well as add Bluetooth capabilities and various accessory offerings. In the Enterprise, we remain focused on expanding our reach in key verticals. In the quarter, we broadened our distribution capabilities for wireless LAN solutions by establishing several new strategic partnerships. From a product perspective, our priority in Enterprise continues to be around key industry drivers, including enabling the mobile workforce and enhancing consumer in-store experiences.To this end, we recently announced a number of additions to our portfolio of solutions, including an evolution of our best-selling MC3000 family of mobile computers, with the MC3100, industry-leading data-capture and wireless technologies for indoor applications. The WT4090 wearable hands-free terminal with voice recognition and text-to-speech functionality aimed at the manufacturing and warehouse verticals, and wireless security service offered in partnership with Verizon business to help retailers enhance their wireless network security.As we head into 2010, in Government and Public Safety, backlog is up slightly from the end of 2008. Both inside and outside the U.S., we expect mission-critical communications to remain a high priority, and for our customers to focus on technology as a way to overcome resource limitations and further enhance security. We also expect continued momentum in our indirect channel, driven by stabilizing economic market conditions. In the enterprise markets, we believe demand trends are slowly improving, a few weeks ago we participated in the National Retail Federation trade show in New York. The mood and tone at the show was markedly better than a year ago, CIOs came in with better visibilities with their capital budgets and priorities, which include improving supply-chain efficiencies, getting more technology into the hands of associates and improving customer buying experiences. As momentum gradually recovers in retail, we expect it to positively impact customers in Transportation and Logistics, which is our second largest vertical.So with better visibility and gradually improving trends, in Enterprise Mobility Solutions, we expect 2010 sales growth in the low to mid-single digits, with operating net margins flat to slightly up year on year. For the first quarter, compared to the year-ago quarter, we expect EMS sales to be slightly up and operating margin flat to slightly up. In closing, Broadband Mobility Solutions delivered solid results in 2009, amidst challenging market conditions. I want to thank all of the associates in all of the businesses for their contributions and continued support of our customers. And now, I'm going to turn the call back over to Dean to start the Q&A."

Kind of, a little comment around that, and at what point is there diminishing returns, in terms of having too many SKUs out there, rather than just focusing on one or two hit-products? And then my question for you, Greg, is really in the Enterprise business versus Government in Enterprise Mobility. How swift do you see the pick up in the traditional Enterprise business in that segment in 2010. Would you expect it to be a relatively mild recovery or are you seeing, you mentioned some strength in indirect business there, are you seeing a relatively strong comeback in revenues?"

So I think that I've been relatively consistent on that point. Let me just kind of articulate how we come to our portfolio. First of all, we have certain experiences, that is the social networking experience, that is the multimedia experience, there's the enterprise experience, we have certain experiences, and then we have certain requirements for exclusivity and there are certain form factors which some segments of the market prefer. So if you take our experiences, exclusivity is for carriers and the form factors, which address certain segments of the marketplace, I think these three factors drive the portfolio. And if you look at the countries, U.S., China, and obviously some in Europe and some in Latin America, I think that really accounts for the number of smartphones we'll launch this year."

I think the 2G and 3G technologies while down, will probably have a longer tale in large part because of all these sophisticated mobile Internet devices, smartphones, and I'm referencing particularly, in the U.S. So I think the 2G legacy technologies while declining, will have a longer tale and still allow for some reasonable cash and earnings contribution in 2010, which is why referenced in my comments, that if those conditions remain that way, we would still expect all-in then [ph] to have Networks be in the double-digit operating margin range. WiMAX revenues are comparable year-over-year, but that's more or less because the WiMAX revenues of over $600 million in '09 represent probably two to 2.5 years worth of sales cycle. So the funnel continues to build, and while the revenue recognition comparable year-over-year, it still reflects growing overall WiMAX revenues and activity. I think that over time, you're right, you'll see us moderate the investment in 4G, reflective of the opportunity. We want to be profitable in all the business segments we're in, in Networks. And clearly, there's more and more of a trend and movement toward LTE and I think you'll see us shift the investment and we have, and we will continue to do that. But that still means WiMAX is viable in certain areas, Latin America, the Middle East, backhaul and will invest, reflective of that."

So I don't understand why the operating margins this quarter are not improving more substantially, if you have 20% sequential improvement in revenues, you have 40% Smartphones that carry substantially higher gross margin as you mentioned, and still the sequential improvement in operating margin is nice, but it's not something that is out of the expectations, or it's not a line with the growth in revenue. So the question is, what happens to the gross margin in the non-Smartphones when you introduce Smartphones? Do you see more pricing pressure? And then why don't you give us more explicit guidance for gross margin, it's very important for the model given that you're going to break up pretty soon?"

But really, the thing that drove our OpEx in fourth quarter this year, was our sales and marketing support.

I guess I'd like to give you little color on how we see those factors. Today, I guided you to our becoming profitable in the fourth quarter in Mobile Devices as you know, we have launched two products already, and we've guided you to the fact that we'll launched 20 Smartphones throughout 2010. And I think that we're making very good progress in Mobile Devices. I think most analysts now agree that in 2010, they'll be a modest, probably high single-digit to low double-digit increase in the handset marketplace. So I think that those two factors certainly begin to point us towards a more amenable environment in which we can contemplate a spend.

MDB is clearly improving, successful transition to an Android-base Smartphone portfolio operating losses narrowing and et cetera. The macroeconomic environment is improving as well. We've seen a stabilization in many of the economies we compete in. U.S. economy is expected to grow. I've talked about sequential growth in the former Symbol business, stabilization of indirect channels. So generally, the three things we've looked at have gotten better. As a result, we're still planning to separate this company. I think, with that progress we've made on separation and the alternative structures that Sanjay and I continually look at to maximize shareholder value. I've acknowledged -- there's a speculation in the media. But that said, Home is despite the difficult 2009, a strong business with long-term trends that are favorable, both in global expansion, the growth of HDTV, the continued expansion of IPTV. And as I mentioned, with the insatiable demand for more bandwidth. We expect to see an expansion of video infrastructure spending. So the long-term trends on Home are still favorable. We've invested just recently in my comments here, in SecureMedia and BitBand. So I think it's a strategic asset that is number one, in the U.S. and the world and we'll recover. And it is driven more or less by U.S.-based housing and a few other things. On networks, we continue to manage it and optimizing for earnings and cash. You know we've done the 3G agreement, probably three years ago with Huawei, if there's partnership that makes sense, that would enhance value, we'll always considered that. But I'm proud of what the team is doing and that business to, with the expansion and demand still for CDMA- and GSM-based 2G and 3G technologies, we'll have a long tail on it. So that's how we're viewing the overall portfolio and proceeding, but we are moving full steam ahead on separation."

This morning, Motorola reported sales in the first quarter $5 billion. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.03 per share from continuing operations, compared to a loss in the first quarter a year",338,"Thanks, Dean, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us. This morning, Motorola reported sales in the first quarter $5 billion. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.03 per share from continuing operations, compared to a loss in the first quarter a year ago. Excluding highlighted items, earnings were $0.02 a share, exceeding the guidance of a loss of $0.01 to loss of $0.03 per share that we provided on our last earnings call. 
Operating earnings increased substantially, reflecting year-on-year improvements in each of our businesses. We increased total cash by over $450 million and ended the quarter with total cash of $8.5 billion. 
In Mobile Devices, Smartphone unit shipments increased sequentially to 2.3 million units. Our portfolio of Smartphones increased to eight, and we ship to renounce devices with all four major carriers in North America and many others around the world. In Home, while sales were lower year-on-year, operating earnings and operating margin were higher. In Enterprise Mobility Solutions, sales grew 6% year-on-year driven by a recovery in the enterprise markets, and we secured our largest ever TETRA subscriber contract in Europe. In Networks, operating margin was up substantially, and we were awarded a contract by Zain to deploy an LTE network in Saudi Arabia. 
Regarding separation, we continue to make significant progress on our plan to create two independent public companies; one comprised of Mobile Devices and Home, and one comprised of Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Networks. And our target for the separation remains the first quarter of 2011. 
Additionally, we recently provided revised GAAP and non-GAAP financial results for each of our businesses to give further insight into our operating results ahead of our planned separation. And beginning this quarter, Sanjay will review the operating results for Home in addition to Mobile Devices, and I’ll continue to review both Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Networks. 
But now, Ed will provide additional details on our reporting changes in Motorola’s overall financial results for the quarter. So I'll now turn it over to Ed Fitzpatrick."

I'll begin today by outlining the three changes we had made to our financial reporting. First, starting this quarter, we are reporting the financial results of our Home business and our Networks business at separate segments. In the past, results of these businesses were reported as a single segment. Second, stock-based compensation costs, amortization of intangibles and corporate G&A costs that were previously included in the Other and Eliminations reporting segment, are now included in the business segment results. This change impacts the GAAP results of each business segment but has no impact on Motorola's consolidated GAAP financial results. Going forward, the Other and Eliminations segment will only include eliminations of inter-segment sales, transactions and a small amount of corporate operating expenses. Third, to supplement our GAAP reported results, we’ll present operating earnings on a non-GAAP basis, excluding items we have historically highlighted, as well as stock-based compensation costs and intangible amortization expense. Going forward, our quarterly earnings guidance will also be provided in this manner.
We believe this presentation of non-GAAP earnings will provide further details and insight on our operating performance. GAAP and non-GAAP results for 2007, ‘08 and ‘09 and this revised presentation format can be found on our website. Shortly after we file our first quarter 10-Q, we plan to file an 8-K, which will include revised 2009 10-K footnotes, which reflect the new segment presentation and the allocation of certain corporate costs to the segments. 
Turning now to our financial results. Motorola's total sales were $5 billion in the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.03 per share compared to a GAAP loss of $0.13 per share a year ago. This includes net income of $0.01 per share for highlighted items, highlighted items include a tax related gain and a legal recovery, offset partially by charges associated with preparing for separation, a change in healthcare tax regulation and business reorganization.
Based on the way we've historically provided non-GAAP earnings per share and compared to our first quarter guidance of minus $0.01 to minus $0.03 per share, first quarter earnings were positive $0.02 per share. As I mentioned earlier, beginning this quarter, we will present non-GAAP earnings which will also exclude stock-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangibles. In the first quarter, these expenses totaled $0.04 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings for the first quarter in this new presentation format were $0.06 per share. This compares to a loss of $0.04 per share in the first quarter of 2009. Further details in our non-GAAP earnings can be found on our website and our remaining financial references will exclude highlighted items, stock-based compensation costs and intangible amortization expense.
Gross margin percentage in the quarter increased to 35.7% from 28.9% in the first quarter of 2009. The increase was due to year-on-year improvements in all four businesses, particularly in Mobile Devices. Operating expenses in the quarter were lower year-on-year and sequentially, reflecting our continued efforts to tightly manage spending and optimize our cost structure. Total other income and expense was a net expense but lower than anticipated and contributed favorably to our results. This was due primarily to recovery in the value of certain fixed income securities held in our Sigma Fund and interest income related to a tax settlement. Our ongoing tax rate was 35% for the quarter.
Moving now to the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $485 million. We ended the quarter with total cash of $8.5 billion compared to $8 billion at the end of 2009. The increase in total cash of over $450 million is primarily attributable to both improved working capital and earnings. Inventory declined by $57 million with inventory turns at 10.4 compared to 11.2 turns in the fourth quarter and seven turns in the year ago quarter. The cash receivable were lower sequentially and year-over-year. DSO, day sales outstanding, was 57 days, flat with the fourth quarter and lower than the 63 days in the year ago quarter.
Turning now to our outlook. We expect second quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.09 per share. As I mentioned earlier, this guidance excludes $0.04 per share related to stock base compensation and intangible amortization expenses, as well as I have historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings release. 
With that, I'll pass the call to Sanjay to discuss Mobile Devices and Home."

In the first quarter, we executed well on our Smartphone plans and continued to build momentum. This market is expected to grow more than 40% this year, driven by continued growth in North America and Western Europe and increasing demand in China. In Smartphones, we launched six new devices, bringing our portfolio to eight, shipped 2.3 million units and now reach over 100 carriers, distributors and retailers globally. 
Mobile Devices overall sales were $1.6 billion and total shipment of 8.5 million units. Our overall ASP increased to approximately $192.00 from $169.00 in fourth quarter due to a more favorable product mix. The operating loss in the quarter was $148 million compared to a loss of $385 million in the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, the loss increased due to a lower unit volume and gross margin level in our feature phone portfolio, offset primarily by growth in Smartphones. Operating expenses were lower driven by further reduction in headcount and tight control over G&A costs, offset partially by increased spending in support of the brand and new product launches.
Sales in North America accounted for 66% of our total sales, and Smartphones accounting for approximately half of the sales in the region. Three of our new Smartphones began shipping in U.S. during the quarter. BACKFLIP was introduced with AT&T and featured prominently in their NCAA tournament promotion slot. CLIQ XT, a touch screen with virtual quality keyboard was launched with T-Mobile and DEVOUR, our second Smartphone with Verizon Wireless, began selling in late March.
In China, about two weeks ago, Frank Meng joined us as President of Mobile Devices in home of Greater China. Frank has over 25 years in telecom and will lead our business and sales operation in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. I have worked with Frank before. I know he will do -- he'll be a great addition to our team. 
From a product perspective, we're getting good traction in China. During the quarter, we began shipping Smartphones for China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom. We also launched BACKFLIP, our second device in China with MOTOBLUR, into the retail channel and opened SHOP4APPS, our applications and services store. With our store consumers have the ability to customize their Motorola Android device with a wide choice of applications and services, including search, e-mail and map. In the first quarter, Motorola devices accounted for the largest share of Android-powered devices sold in China. We expect this momentum to continue, with China expected to be our second-largest Smartphone market this year after North America.
With regards to our portfolio, in Smartphones, we remain on track to launch at least 20 Smartphones and expect to ship 12 million to 14 million Smartphone units this year. MOTOBLUR, our user interface and cloud-based services platform, will continue to be featured on a majority of our Smartphones. It provides consumers with push Internet content and aggregates and delivers messages and contacts from a variety of social networking sites. Data traffic on BLUR-enabled devices continues to grow rapidly, driven largely by video. Our next release of MOTOBLUR will enhance user experiences by providing new functionality in areas such as multimedia consumption and music. In our mid- to high-tier phone portfolio, feature phone portfolio, which includes iDEN, ruggedized devices and a modest number of other devices, we expect unit volume to decline in the second quarter and then remain fairly stable through the second half. In voice-centric devices, we will utilize ODM partners and expect unit volume to begin to ramp in the second half of the year. Our focus is to build brand awareness and meet customer requirements for a broad portfolio of products at multiple price points. Across this portfolio, we're targeting modest profitability and minimum working capital investment. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, Smartphone shipments will be higher sequentially. Overall, unit volumes will be lower. However, due to a further decline in feature phones, we expect sales to be flat and operating loss to improve driven by an improved product mix. We expect further reduction in operating loss in third quarter and expect to be profitable in fourth quarter, driven by higher Smartphone sales.
Turning now to the Home business. In February, we provided an update to our separation plan and indicated that we are combining the Mobile Devices and Home businesses. This allows us to address the opportunity ahead of us, resulting from the convergence of mobility, media computing and the Internet. Since announcing our plans, I've had the opportunity to speak with a number of our largest customers and the feedback has been very positive. 
Turning to the results in the first quarter. Home sales were $838 million. In digital entertainment devices, we shipped 3.1 million units and held share in the quarter. Customer demand remains constrained, particularly in the U.S. Sales of video and access infrastructure accounted for approximately 25% of overall Home sales and were up from a year ago. This was driven by renewed network investments1 following spending deferrals by operators last year. Operating earnings were higher year-on-year and operating margin increased to 5.6% from 3.4% in the first quarter of last year. The improvement was driven by a favorable product mix and operating cost reductions. 
In Home, we expect longer-term demand recovery to be driven by a number of factors. Analog to digital transitions are still underway, particularly outside the U.S. Digital households are expected to grow in the double digits over the next four to five years, driven by growth of high-definition video and multi-room solutions. DVR penetration will also continue to grow. 
From an infrastructure perspective, consumer demand will continue to drive the need for more bandwidth-optimized network in storage and services. That said, R&D investments are focused on strengthening our core portfolio and on emerging growth areas, including content management and security solutions for IPTV, 3D TV and advanced interactive services. We are also developing solutions which enable consumers to securely transfer content from their DVR for viewing on a mobile device. In the first quarter, we introduced enhancements to our DCX line of set-top boxes that support viewing 3D TV. We also began trialing a new digital entertainment device for Verizon's FiOS service, which significantly reduces energy consumption.
Turning now to our outlook. In Home, the industry has solid long-term fundamentals. We are focused on managing our cost structure and prioritizing R&D on future growth opportunities. In the second quarter, we expect Home sales and operating margin to be up from the first quarter. For the full year, we now expect sales to decline by 5% to 7% compared to 2009. This reflects lower demand for digital entertainment devices, offset partially by higher sales of video and access infrastructure. That said, however, we're on-track to increase operating earning this year due to a more favorable product mix and improvement in our cost structure. 
In closing, the increasing availability of broadband inside and outside the home is enabling consumers to watch more video content than ever before. They're consuming it when they want it, where they want it and on many different devices. This is driving convergence in what consumers expect from mobile devices and home entertainment devices. Demand is also increasing for interactive personalized user-driven services in home and on the go. The Mobile Devices and Home businesses are uniquely positioned to address these opportunities. Together, we will have an industry-leading intellectual property position in wireless, in video and in content delivery and rights management. We have core strengths in end-to-end solutions, design-operator relationship and a global brand. By leveraging these assets and by driving our operating synergies, we'll provide a broad range of converged devices and uniform multiscreen experiences, as well as mobile Internet content management and delivery services. 
With that, I'll pass the call back to Greg to discuss EMS and networks."

Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Networks delivered an excellent quarter with solid top line results, improved year-on-year operating earnings, operating margin and cash flow generation. 
In EMS, first quarter sales were $1.7 billion, up 6% from the first quarter of last year. Government market sales were up slightly and our enterprise markets recovery is underway, evidenced by double-digit sales growth. We performed very well in all of our key markets, driven by an industry-leading portfolio. Operating margin increased to 12.8% from 10.8% in the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to higher sales and a more favorable product mix. First quarter sales in North America grew 5% compared to the first quarter a year ago. Growth was largely driven by higher Enterprise sales, including mobile computing, scanning and wireless LAN. 
Momentum continued in retail and in transportation and logistics, including a win with Con-Way, an industry leader in freight transportation and logistics, who selected our MC75 mobile computers to optimize their delivery processes. 
In public safety, RFP activity remained at a healthy pace. Key awards in the quarter included three statewide expansion projects, including a P25 system upgrade with the State of Michigan and several quiet country and city-wide projects across the U.S. We also secured several wins in Canada, including one which displaced the incumbent radio supplier. 
Outside North America, sales grew 7%, driven by higher safety and Enterprise sales in Asia and higher Enterprise sales in EMEA. Additionally, during the quarter, we secured several significant awards. In Germany, we received an award for over 50,000 radios from the German federal government, our largest ever TETRA terminal contract in Europe. In China, we were selected by the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau (sic) [Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau], for the largest ever 350-megahertz TETRA project in China. This system includes integrated command and control and over 30,000 radios and strengthens our customers' capabilities in preparation for the Shanghai World Expo 2010. Both of these awards further strengthen our position as the world's largest and leading TETRA supplier.
With respect to our go-to-market strategy, we recently announced PartnerEmpower, an industry-leading sales channel program. Launched globally this quarter, this program brings together our government, public safety and enterprise sales channel activities under one unified framework, enabling a stronger and more distinctive global channel brand and acceleration of growth opportunities for EMS and our highly valued network of 25,000 channel partners. This program will enhance channel partner competency, simplify processes, strengthen relationships and make it easier for customers to do business with us. 
From a product perspective, we made a number of portfolio enhancements during the quarter. We expanded our MOTOTRBO product line with the addition of 800- and 900-megahertz portables and mobiles. To simplify customer migration from analog to digital, we also introduced new portable and mobile radios with multimode functionality. For the enterprise market, we recently announced a series of rugged digital barcode scanners developed for harsh industrial environments. We also announced the cordless digital imager, which can improve patient safety and caregiver productivity to take advantage of opportunities in healthcare. In wireless LAN, we expanded our portfolio with a solution for centralized management of multi-vendor devices. And finally, our recently introduced TEAM portfolio of solutions continued to gain traction with a significant award from a major retailer in the U.S. TEAM solutions provide advanced communication functionality across an enterprise Voice Over LAN network. They integrate mobile communications, including push-to-talk, enterprise Voice Over IP and task-specific devices such as mobile commuters and barcode scanners. By enabling a wide array of devices, TEAM increases enterprise collaboration, mobility and productivity and enhances experiences for consumers.
Looking ahead, EMS is positioned very well. The year is off to an excellent start. Recovery's taking hold and Enterprise customers are beginning to reinvest. We are encouraged by the level of customer engagement across all of our verticals and by several key wins during the quarter. That said, many of our government customers around the world continue to operate under tight budget constraints. 
Regarding our outlook in the second quarter, we expect EMS sales and operating margin to be up sequentially. We now expect full year sales growth in the mid-single digits, with slightly improved operating margin compared to 2009. In Networks, sales in the first quarter were $896 million as we anticipated sales decline year-on-year due to lower 2G and 3G sales, primarily in EMEA, offset partially by higher WiMAX sales. That said, growth in Smartphones and data traffic is driving continued demand for wireless network expansion and optimization. We are profitable in each of the individual legacy technologies, and we will continue to focus on optimizing this business. 
Operating margin improved to 14% from 9.2% in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by a favorable sales mix, including strong CDMA sales in both the U.S. and Japan and lower operating expenses. In LTE, development of our RAM solutions and operator field trial activities continued. We recently received an award from Zain for a network in Saudi Arabia, our second commercial LTE award. In China, our trial efforts with China Mobile have been very successful and over the next six months, we'll be working with them working with them to provide indoor TD-LTE coverage at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai.
Moving on to our outlook for Networks, we expect second quarter sales and operating margin to be up slightly on a sequential basis with continued strength in CDMA. Following strong first half results, we expect a more normalized sales mix and lower operating margin levels in the second half. For the full year, we continue to expect sales to be down approximately 10% top line with operating margin now in the range of 10% to 11% for the full year. 
In closing, Motorola performed well in the first quarter. Earnings per share were up year-on-year and total cash increased. We're making excellent progress on the separation with work advancing in all areas. We anticipate filing of Form 10 in the summer, which will provide you with additional details about the separation. And as we head into the second quarter, we have the momentum to deliver higher earnings, generate cash, introduce new products and ultimately satisfy our customers. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Dean to start the Q&A."

To the broader point of not having raised the high end of the guidance, clearly, I think we are comfortable with the range that we have provided to you on our guidance. With respect to competition, you're absolutely right. This is a very, very competitive marketplace. And particularly in fourth quarter, I anticipate that there will be new devices from multiple people with probably three or four operating environments in the marketplace. There will be, obviously, devices in Android and other operating environments. We have taken the competition and the competitive environment into account when we provide you guidance, obviously. And I feel that we are well-positioned to compete at each of our carriers in light of the competitive environment. And I actually think -- I think that my comfort level, if anything, is slightly greater today than it would have been last quarter because we have greater visibility.

There are three devices we've launched with each of the carriers. And really the XT800 in particular, but all three of them are getting very good traction in the marketplace.

So I feel very comfortable that we're not building inventory in the channel. But the sell-through is very commensurate with the shipment that we've made. So that's first part. Second part of your question was, what is the driving the ramp? Is it that we're growing in U.S. and China or are we playing in elsewhere? Well, U.S. will play -- U.S. is about 65% of our shipment in Smartphone market here this quarter. U.S. will continue to play a very important role in our shipments. But China and Europe will also play a role. As you know, because of our global presence, we're able to launch in China, Europe and in Latin America. But a combination of these things will give us the ability to deliver on the profitability part of the promise that we have delivered to the Street. In terms of 14 million, clearly, that's the high range of the target. I won't comment on how we get to 14 million.

You would see meaningful differentiation in the marketplace from us as well. And distribution is clearly important. We have global distribution. We have global brand and we have global presence we have global carrier relationship and retail relationship. I think that there is sometimes a view that this business is either about OS or about brand. The reality is that to succeed in this business, you have to succeed in operating system, integration of hardware and software, global distribution, brand, execution at the right time, IP position, user interface. All of these things would deliver with quality, do all the back-end supply and demand planning and delivering all of that and do all of that efficiently. And sometimes, I think that as this business has just kind of made it into a cardboard cutout of the business. I really believe that as a machine over the last 20, 22 months, we have improved significantly in our operational efficiency.

$100 [ph] million of revenue last year, we have guided to comparable revenue in 2010, so $600 million as well. And the opportunity for us is, I think that we expect to see some WiMAX customers. More and more migrate to TD-LTE. The fact that Motorola got out to an early start several years ago on WiMAX, and the fact that there's approximately 70% re-usability in the R&D spend between WiMAX and LTE, we think gives us a lead at the moment in the RAN base station business. So in revenue, we expect comparable, $600 million in 2010, $600 million last year. But we think our position on TD-LTE, FDD LTE and WiMAX remains pretty strong.

I apologize if I don't answer; please feel free to ask again. So first of all, let me just go to ASP. Our ASP improved, as you noticed. We went to $192 million ASP from $169 million ASP, really driven by mix shift, more towards Smartphone and less towards feature phone. Our Smartphone gross margin is very much dependent on mix. As you probably recognized, in fourth quarter, we had very limited number of Smartphones. In first quarter, we have more Smartphones. And then really, it's a function of mix shift there. Feature phone gross margins are definitely under pressure, particularly in  first quarter, we saw gross margin for feature phones come down relative to fourth quarter last year. Feature phone gross margins as an industry is under pressure. We are bringing down Smartphones lower down the tier. That has an impact on the Smartphone gross margin, but it has a much greater impact on feature phone gross margin. And I actually believe in the longer term, our Smartphone gross margin will be in the range of industry average. I think industry average is coming down, and our gross margin is actually going up.

And it allows us to think about what is the next service or what is the best way to serve our customers. It also, actually, meaningfully reduces their data consumption, which our carriers seem to like quite a bit. Because if you go to a Facebook website, the website is something like 300 kilobytes, whereas if we are able to take the relevant updates and push it to your home screen and do it in an efficient way, that, that changes quite a bit of the data consumption traffic.

That was down from what I had as an estimate for ASP in the prior quarter. So wondering what the trend in the Smartphone ASP was? And was that due to mix, fewer DROIDs and milestones and possibly more of other types of devices? And if you can give us a handle as to how ASPs did trend this quarter and how they trend going forward within the Android smartphone bucket? And then when you gave guidance for the second quarter of up, is there any way you can give us a sense, is that seasonally up and what you consider seasonal? Or should that be up more depending on, because of new product launches that you anticipate either this quarter or some of the ones you made at the end of last quarter that you expect to ramp? So seasonally, looks to me, would be around 5%, 6% up into the second quarter? Is that what you're thinking? Or are you thinking that it'll be more significant due to the product launches? And then, Greg, it sounds like things are going very strong, especially in Germany and other places. But when we keep looking at the newspaper and hearing things about Europe and what's going on with governments there and bonds and government debt being downgraded, does any of that impact you? And impact some of the contracts that are in your pipeline that you're working on or that some of those countries may be looking project-wise to, going forward?"

And I actually anticipate that, that portion will continue to increase as we go through the year. So yes, I think that -- if I could say this, the quality of our revenue, I think, as we go through the year -- and by that I mean revenue with high gross margin or improving gross margin actually is getting better as we go through the year. In terms of ASP for Android devices, I actually anticipate that it'll come down a little bit from where we are today, partially because we are going into a lower -- we are driving Smartphones into feature phone territory. So the ASP will come down a little bit. But at the same time, consistent with the question earlier, there is a scope for higher ASP devices and there is convergence with computing and mobility. So I'm uncertain. It will depend on product mix. It's uncertain exactly where the ASP ends up. On balance, I would say because there's greater volume in lower end rather than higher end, there's probably a slight declining trend in ASP. And then your question around second quarter seasonality, I guess the question, I think, if I can re-ask the question this way, you're asking whether we'll take market share or just stay current with the marketplace. My anticipation is that we will gain some market share in second quarter."

I see the feature phone market in the whole industry, leaving aside Motorola, compressing in terms of both revenue and profitability. And as I've commented in prior earnings call, we have de-emphasized our presence in that market, and we're not spending a lot of R&D in that market. That market, that feature phone segment for us consists of two segments really. If I can break that up into two segments, mid- to high-tier and what we call voice centric segment. And maybe I can deal with them separately. The mid- to high tier has three kinds of devices for us; iDEN; some ruggedized devices; HP devices, that we have particular place in the marketplace for; and some legacy devices, and we're introducing some other devices in this marketplace. Those are the three things that form the mid to high tier. I think it's consistent with the guidance that I provided earlier, I see iDEN as being somewhat flat quarter on quarter. Again, it’s not just driven by Sprint and ii [ph] and the rest of the world. I feel good. Again, the ruggedized device, that is a distinct market for that and we continue to play in that marketplace. So I feel that in that segment, in second half of this year, the volumes have come down to a level where I think they can remain somewhat stable through second half. As I look at voice-centric devices, these are the devices that I would say are below $100, meaningfully sometimes below $100. We are utilizing ODM partners, and we’re really not looking to take much working capital risk or inventory risk in this business. But we claim this market because a number of emerging and growth markets, our retail partners and our customers, want a broad range of offering from us. Our brand name extension is important. Our expectation is from zero to modest operating profit in this area. But we do not want to run any inventory or working capital risk, so that's kind of our strategy. And to the last part of your question, as to why we do it. Brand name extension and meeting our customer requirements, those are the reasons."

It's probably one of our highest single priority outside of United States. I've said just broadening my answer beyond actually the question that you asked. Europe is going to become a little more important. I think data networks best deployed there. If you look at Latin America, we have a number of launches and actually very well positioned there with our brand name and launches of product. But data consumption there is nearly all prepaid. And Smartphone market, as of right now, is somewhat limited. But we’re actually very hopeful that, that market could be made, could be activated with lower tier Smartphone. So our strategy in Latin America is lower-tier Smartphone. In Europe, we will participate, but in 2010, I don't anticipate a big presence in Europe. We will have carriers. We will have partners, and we'll participate. But we're not anticipating spending a large amount of marketing dollars in Europe.

I think that one of the things that's happening is, with the explosion of just the mobile Internet Smartphones, it's putting more and more requirements for bandwidth on all networks in all geographies. We are a subsequent beneficiary of that as it relates to CDMA in the form of Verizon and Sprint; more Verizon than Sprint, which was a bigger customer for ours on the infrastructure side, proportionately, and KDDI. And all we're saying in terms of the full year, while the strength is strong and carriers are upgrading their network's EVDO and ultimately positioning themselves for LTE downstream, that we have a more favorable product mix in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year.

So first of all, as you know, we have upgraded DROID to 2.1, and it's progressing extremely well. The DROID upgrade is largely complete. So most DROID devices, I actually know the percentage, have been upgraded. Obviously, the users have to take a small action to participate in that upgrade. We are rolling out upgrade on milestones in Europe and some other countries and other devices, CLIQ and others are slated for second quarter upgrade, we actually rolled out our fourth software upgrade on CLIQ, on T-Mobile's network, just a week ago. And on CLIQ XT, we will roll out our first upgrade. In some ways, I think this migration to offer the software upgrade is very new thing for a lot of us. And I think I would say to you that Motorola, along with a handful of other people, has learned how to do that effectively. And I think that, that gives us a competitive position. If you look at what are the factors in the timing of upgrades rolling out, sort of access to [ph] software -- software versions related to carrier services. So it's not just a matter of taking Android software. A lot of phones that we deliver have to incorporate carrier-branded services, and some of those services are migrating to new versions as well. So when we do the software upgrades, we need to go to newer versions of carrier-branded services. Clearly, BLUR has to be upgraded. There are some dependencies on hardware. So 2.1, as you know, was released on one chipset. Our DROID was another chipset. There are some minor migrations that need to be done there. There is a carrier back-end testing and certification process. There's a carrier push plan. And frankly, all parties are learning as to how to do this well. I think those are the things that are taking a little bit of time. I expect -- I think we are at the leading edge of getting this done right, and I think we're learning. And I'm hoping that this will become a competitive advantage for us. It allows us to decouple hardware launches sometimes with software feature and upgrade the software feature, and that makes our development process more agile and flexible. We are here, very focused on making sure we do this well."

Each of our businesses delivered improved operating results year-over-year and sequentially. We generated $242 million of operating cash flow, completed $500 million debt tender offer and ended the quarter with total cash of $8.3 billion. 
In Mobile Devices, Smartphone unit shipments increased sequentially to 2.7 million units and a non-GAAP operating loss decline. DROID X, launched with Verizon in mid-July, is off to a great start and is exceeding our expectations.
In Home, sales were up sequentially and operating margin was higher. In EMS, sales grew 10% year-over-year driven by continued recovery in the Enterprise market and operating margin was higher. In Networks, second quarter sales and margins were up sequentially. We also announced that Nokia Siemens Networks plans to acquire the majority of the assets of our Networks business. Greg will comment further on the Networks transaction later in this call. 
Regarding separation, we continue to make significant progress in our plan to create two independent publicly traded companies. This month, we filed our initial Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC. The filing contains information relating to the separation and the business strategies of Motorola Mobility, which will be comprised of Mobile Devices and Home.

This compares to $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2009. Highlighted items totaled net income of $0.02 per share. This includes income related to a legal settlement, tax recovery and the sale of certain businesses and investments, partially offset by expenses associated with separation and reorganization costs.
Stock compensation and intangible amortization expenses were $0.04 per share, consistent with prior quarters. Further details on non-GAAP earnings are included as part of today's press release. All remaining financial references will exclude highlighted items, stock compensation and intangible amortization. 
Gross margins in the quarter increased to 37.3% from 31.1% in the second quarter of 2009. The increase was due to the improvements in all of the businesses with the most significant improvement coming in Mobile Devices. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 4% year-over-year. The increase primarily relates to investments in sales and marketing as well as advertising and promotional expenses in support of key products across all of our businesses. With the updated geographical mix of income that we anticipate for this year, we now expect a full year tax rate of 36% to 37%, up from our previous estimate of 34% to 35%. As a result, the ongoing tax rate in the quarter was 40%. While our income statement tax rate will be higher than previously anticipated, we do not expect any meaningful change in cash taxes paid this year.
Moving now to the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $242 million. This includes a legal settlement in relation to a patent infringement litigation which resulted in a one-time cash inflow of $175 million. Inventory increased by $48 million sequentially. However, inventory turns improved to 11 compared to 10 turns in the first quarter and nine turns in the second quarter of last year. Accounts receivable also increased in the quarter, reflecting the sequential sales growth, less favorable linearity and a lower level of cash inflow from sales of receivables. As a result, days sales outstanding were 61 days, up from 57 days in the first quarter. We do expect to drive the DSOs below the current level during the second half. 
During the quarter, we completed a $500 million debt tender offer in closing the sale of our Israel-based Wireless Network Operator business. Total cash at the end of the quarter was $8.3 billion compared to $8.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Net cash at the end of the quarter was $4.9 billion, up from $4.6 billion in the first quarter and $2.5 billion in the second quarter of 2009.
Turning now to our outlook. We expect third quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. This guidance includes the Networks business and excludes $0.04 per share related to stock compensation and intangible amortization expenses as well as items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings releases. 
With that, I'll pass the call to Sanjay to discuss Motorola Mobility."

Mobile Devices second quarter sales were over $1.7 billion on total shipment of 8.3 million units, including 2.7 million Smartphones. Overall, ASP increased to approximately $207 from $192 in the first quarter due to a more favorable product m",1120,"Thanks, Ed. Mobile Devices second quarter sales were over $1.7 billion on total shipment of 8.3 million units, including 2.7 million Smartphones. Overall, ASP increased to approximately $207 from $192 in the first quarter due to a more favorable product mix.
We now have over 300 Smartphone launches with carriers, distributors and retailers in 85 countries. While we continue to build momentum in U.S., our sales outside North America accounted for 34% of our total sales. The operating loss in the quarter declined to $109 million compared to a loss of $148 million in the first quarter on a sequential basis. The loss declined due to a higher Smartphone unit volume and improved overall gross margin percentage, offset partially by slightly higher operating expenses. 
During the quarter, we made four additions to our Smartphone portfolio: The i1, the world's first push-to-talk Android-powered Smartphone, began shipping to Sprint in May. The DROID X, with its rich mobile Internet experience and enhanced Enterprise capabilities is getting a great reception from consumers.
Two devices with the most social stay-connected focus included the FLIPOUT, which features a compact pivoting design and enhanced MOTOBLUR functionality, will ship to Latin America, Europe and U.S. this quarter. And CHARM, also with enhanced MOTOBLUR functionality, will ship to T-Mobile. With our enhancements to MOTOBLUR, consumers will have increased control over their mobile experience. Enhancements include customizable content filters, the ability to move and re-size widgets and new ways to manage and improve battery life and data usage. MOTOBLUR is a clear satisfier for consumers and we expect it to create consumer stickiness and improve long-term repurchase intent for our devices.
In China, our second largest Smartphone market, sales grew nearly 9% sequentially. With seven Smartphones now in the market, sales were solid for all three major carriers with our top seller being the XT800 for China Telecom. As we expand our portfolio further in the second half, we will continue to focus on differentiating ourselves in a number of ways. These include a broad-based portfolio of Smartphones with tightly integrated consumer experiences, focused R&D investment, continued supply chain and manufacturing execution, uncompromising quality in hardware and RF design and a strong brand. 
From a brand perspective, the strength of our Smartphone portfolio is improving brand awareness, purchase intent and relevancy in key markets. With an expanding portfolio of leadership products, we can leverage a strengthening brand to grow in North America, China and Latin America. Our focus will expand to include more emphasis on Europe and other strategic markets next year.
With regards to the portfolio, we now expect to launch more than 20 Smartphones this year. Regarding our Smartphone shipment guidance, I remain confident in the range of 12 million to 14 million units shipped this year. In mid- to high-tier feature phones, as we anticipated, volume declined in the second quarter. Through the second half, we expect feature phone unit volume to remain relatively stable. In voice-centric devices, we expect to build brand awareness, meet retail channel requirements and yield modest financial returns. 
Looking ahead, on a sequential basis, we expect third quarter Smartphone unit volume, overall unit volume and total sales to be higher. And for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2006, Mobile Devices will grow its top line on a year-over-year basis. With a sequentially higher unit volume and improved mix, we expect a further reduction in the operating loss. And in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect to be profitable, driven by further increases in Smartphone volumes.
Turning now to the results for Home in second quarter. Home sales were $886 million, up 6% sequentially. Sales of customer premise equipment were up slightly and reflected a higher demand for HD set-tops compared to the first quarter. Competitiveness amongst our customer base, growing HD content and channel offering and on-demand services are all contributing to network expansion. As a result, sales of video and access infrastructure were up sequentially, up double digits year-over-year and accounted for over 25% of total Home sales. Sales outside North America were up slightly year-over-year and sequentially and accounted for approximately 30% of total sales. Operating margin increased to 6.4% from 4.8% in the second quarter of last year. The improvement was driven by favorable product mix and lower operating costs.
In Home, we focused on extending our video leadership position capabilities and portfolio of solutions to support our customers' needs to deliver content and advanced services in a more personalized fashion for consumers. This includes whole-home network solutions, 3D TV, interactive services and conversion experiences, such as uniform delivery of content to a multi-screen environment. In the quarter, we introduced an advanced HD IPTV set-top box with KDDI in Japan, which addresses the trend towards fixed-mobile convergence. It supports ultra high-speed broadband connections and personalized media experiences, including set-top-to-mobile device content transfer.
We announced software enhancements for our DCX line of set-tops, which provide consumers with a simplified 3D viewing experience in the home. For operators, it provides a solution to deploy 3D content using existing video delivery infrastructure. We expanded our portfolio with an all-digital set-top that can serve as a multimedia IP hub for whole-home networks, giving consumers more control and access to content anywhere in the home.
Finally, we announced Medios, a suite of software solutions that evolves with current network element to allow operators to receive, store and distribute content across a multiple-screen environment. It also provides merchandising tool and security that enable advanced, on-demand services and commerce.
Turning now to outlook. In Home, we now expect sales for the full year to decline by approximately 7%, which is at the top end of the range we've previously provided. Operating margin is expected to increase, driven by a favorable product mix and improvement in the cost structure. For the third quarter, we expect Home sales to be comparable with higher operating margin as compared to the second quarter. 
In closing, the filing of our initial Registration Statement with the SEC earlier this month was a milestone event, as we continue on a path to create a new, independent public company. 
The convergence of Wireless, Media and Internet and Computing is creating a digital lifestyle for consumers globally. Consumers increasingly want to communicate, manage content and experience entertainment and the Internet in a way that's more personal, intuitive and contextual. And they want to do so from any location and on any screen. Motorola Mobility's core strength in synergies and technology, design and customer relationships, together with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio and a re-energized brand, puts us in a unique position to address this growing marketplace. 
With that, I'll pass the call over to Greg to discuss Motorola Solutions. Greg?"
99186,109429083,70391,"Motorola Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. Last week, we announced an agreement with Nokia Siemens Networks to purchase the majority of our Wireless Network assets, including CDMA, GSM, WiMAX and LTE.

Last week, we announced an agreement with Nokia Siemens Networks to purchase the majority of our Wireless Network assets, including CDMA, GSM, WiMAX and LTE. NSN is the right partner for our Network's customers and our employees, given their position in the industry and their commitment to long-term growth.
We will receive $1.35 billion in value from the transaction, which includes $1.2 billion from NSN and $150 million for retained accounts receivable. We also retain our profitable iDEN business, substantially all of the Wireless Network's patents and also a portfolio of long-term receivables. We're proud of the track record and accomplishments delivered by the business and its employees. This is particularly true over the last few years amidst a very challenging competitive and economic environment. With the transition to Nokia Siemens Networks, our employees will be able to continue to deliver innovative solutions and serve our customers around the world. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year. Over the next several months, we'll work with NSN on a smooth transition and continue to meet the needs of our customers around the world.
Turning now to results for the quarter. Both Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Networks delivered a very strong financial and operational performance. In EMS, second quarter sales were $1.9 billion, up 10% compared to the year-ago quarter. In our Enterprise market, recovery continues, evidenced by double-digit sales growth in all four geographic regions. Government sales were also up over last year with growth largely coming from the Americas.
Operating margin increased to 15.8% from 13.4% in the second quarter of last year. The increase was due primarily to higher sales and a more favorable product mix. Second quarter sales in North America grew 14% year-over-year. Growth was driven by both Public Safety and Enterprise markets. Notable new subscriber wins included awards in California, New York and Canada. Major P25 system wins included counties in New York, Washington, Maryland and Georgia, two of which displaced incumbent suppliers. 
In Enterprise, sales were strong in all product categories. In RFID Solutions, we're beginning to see stronger interest levels driven by inventory control benefits and the opportunity for retailers to increase sales per customer. In this regard, our mobile RFID platform was recently deployed by Wal-Mart U.S. to support their apparel tracking program. Over time, we expect Wal-Mart U.S. and other retailers to expand their use of RFID Solutions across a wide variety of product categories.
In EMEA, total sales were up 1% in the quarter amid continuing economic and fiscal challenges. Particularly in Europe, we continue to see good customer engagement but lower top line growth compared to other regions. The growth that we are experiencing is being driven by Enterprise markets growing at double digit rates. Part of this growth is being driven by a very successful reception to our personal shopping systems, which improve the convenience of in-store shopping experience. With demonstrated benefits such as improved service levels and enhanced customer loyalty, demand by retailers has been strong, including recent sales to Carrefour, ECA and TESSCO. 
In Asia, sales in the quarter were up 2% compared to a year ago, normalizing for a major system implementation in Malaysia last year. Asia sales were up 18% over last year. Enterprise markets continue to perform very well, and major new orders included Public Safety and transportation wins in China and in India.
From an R&D perspective, we continue to invest in this business during the tough economic climate of 2008 and 2009. As a result, we are well positioned for emerging growth opportunities in both Enterprise and Public Safety markets. This past quarter in the Enterprise market, we announced the smallest and lightest Enterprise Digital Assistant in our Mobile Computing platform. The ES400 features a customizable user interface, integrated voice and data capabilities, as well as mobile computing and scanning functionality. This device is targeted at improving the productivity and efficiency of mobile workforces and offers Enterprise-class security for business-critical applications and information. We also introduced the industry's first TETRA wideband data-capable mobile radio and the world's smallest single-unit data-capable base station, offering a cost-effective solution for expanding coverage.
Finally, we recently outlined our strategy for delivering next-generation, advanced communication solutions for Public Safety. Our solutions address the growing need to supplement voice with rich data, imaging and video communications enabled by broadband networks. By connecting multiple agencies and jurisdictions with mission-critical voice and LTE networks, we can enhance situational awareness, improve productivity and heighten preparedness for emergency situations. 
Today, we are announcing that we were awarded the first phase of a 700-megahertz LTE network for Public Safety across multiple counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. This agreement represents a first step in deploying a unified state-of-the-art, private, mission-critical broadband multimedia network. By combining a Public Safety-hardened LTE network with the existing voice and data networks, the San Francisco Bay Area has the opportunity to equip their first responders with the advanced communications tools that they need to better protect themselves and their communities. This system is the first of its kind and further demonstrates Motorola's leadership and commitment to delivering innovative, next-generation Public Safety solutions.
Looking ahead for the third quarter. On a sequential basis, we expect sales to be comparable with higher operating margin. We still continue to expect full year sales growth in the mid-single digits, with slightly improved operating margin for the full year compared to 2009.
Turning now to Networks. Sales were $967 million, down slightly from a year ago and up 8% from the first quarter, driven by strong CDMA sales in North America. Operating margin was 19.8% compared to 14.9% in the year-ago quarter. As was the case in the first quarter, the margin level was driven primarily by a favorable mix. 
In LTE, we continue to make progress in our KDDI implementation. In China, we successfully completed Phase I field trials of our TD-LTE solution. We are now moving forward with Phase II of that trial. We also continue to showcase our LTE capabilities in partnership with China Mobile at the Shanghai World Expo. 
Regarding out outlook following a very strong first half in CDMA, we do expect to gradually return to a more normalized sales mix and operating margin level by the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, on a sequential basis, we expect sales to be comparable with lower operating margin. For the full year, we expect sales to be down approximately 10% compared to 2009 with operating margin now expected to be in the range for the full year of 13% to 14%.
In closing, all of Motorola's businesses performed well in the quarter, delivering improved financial results year-over-year. In the first half, we generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.15 per share compared to breakeven on a per-share basis in the first half of last year. And net cash is up $2.4 billion from the second quarter of 2009. As we head into the third quarter, we expect to deliver higher earnings, generate positive operating cash flow and, for the first time in 3½ years, we expect Motorola's quarterly sales to grow year-over-year. 
In the coming months, we will also continue to make progress on separation and creating two companies poised for long-term success. Sanjay talked about Motorola Mobility being uniquely positioned for converging consumer demands. For Motorola Solutions, with a sharpened strategic focus, we are solidly positioned for profitable growth. We plan to leverage our market leadership in Public Safety, Mobile Computing, Data Capture and Wireless LAN to provide next-generation solutions for our Government, Public Safety and Enterprise customers around the world. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dean to start the Q&A."

Remember that DROID X is not a Google-experienced device, it's a Motorola-experienced device, and we have spent a lot of time integrating a lot of experiences, which are unique to Motorola. MOTOBLUR is one. Certainly, the user interface is meaningfully improved also from what we delivered in our first MOTOBLUR experience. So I think that the first part of it is of our own execution of our product. We believe that we have delivered a very good quality product. And the short period that, that product has been in the market, we've seen very good quality and the return rate is very good also. I think we need to get associates in each of the retail channels to view Motorola DROID as a safe device that they can recommend to their customers. We achieved that with DROID, and we believe we are well on the way of achieving that with the DROID X. I would say that improvement in our brand name and brand positioning is very important to us. Our relationship with our carriers is very important to us. And I really think the expansion of our footprint outside of United States and with other carriers is also going to be important to us. In terms of iPhone, I really don't know the dynamics around that discussion with various different carriers in the United States.

And it just seems like you're not seeing any issues. Can you talk about that a little bit? And then what's the conversation like with Enterprise these days? Are they really looking to ramp up spending? It sounds like things are going real well. But is there sort of overall spending coming up? Or is just a shift in their spend toward you?"

And just to clarify, on the full year, we left guidance for the full year still at mid-single digits. I do want to point out that at the end of May, we sold MIRS, which was the Israeli-based iDEN wireless operator network. So when you normalize for MIRS coming out for the seven months left in 2010, the growth rate for EMS on a normalized basis is solidly in the 5% to 8% sales growth range with operating margin for the full year approximately in the 16% to 17% range. That said, Phil, you're right, Government, the Public Safety has been pretty resilient. It was generally flattish in Europe and Asia, up in the Americas. And I think it's a reflection of, despite the stress and duress of state budgets, the prioritization and the importance of mission-critical infrastructure and upgrading that technology to improve interoperability. We always watch it every quarter. And so far, it has performed quite well for the first half of 2010. In terms of the conversation with Enterprise, it's excellent. The engagements are up, the funnel is up. We've grown in double digits on the Enterprise side in Q2. And I think it's a reflection of overall spending coming up and a prioritization and kind of a pickup, if you will, Phil, of investment that was suspended for the previous three, four, five quarters given the economic downturn. And with a positive ROI and fairly rapid payback around inventory management, in-store shopping and so on, it's picking up nicely."

Our view is, and we're investing now and have been last year as well, we are delivering a private broadband LTE experience that will have roaming capabilities in rural areas and interoperability with the wireless operator in those respective regions. But in terms of LTE expertise and the investment in R&D we're making in LTE in the private broadband side, selling Networks to Nokia Siemens does not affect that. We're still full steam ahead."

As you know, we have an approximately $500 million debt payment due in the fourth quarter. Our goal will be to offset as much as we can that debt payment. I would suspect our cash balance to be down slightly because of the $500 million payment. But we'll do our best to offset that. The only way we get there is by continuing to improve the working capital metrics. We've done a decent job. We slipped a little bit this quarter with receivables, as I mentioned. But we do expect to improve on that. But the working capital balances will grow, as I've mentioned on previous calls. It's just we've got to continue to improve the metrics. As sales grow throughout the third and fourth quarter, working capital will grow, but we'll try to offset that as best we can. So I hope that gives you a bit of color on where we expect to end the year. Right now, I would outlook slightly down because of the debt payment.

So I think the core continues to grow, and we'll continue to invest in the upgrade and technology refresh cycle. The second is 60% of the businesses is in North America, 40% is in international. I think international represents a significant growth opportunity as a category where we can get increased penetration and, over time, grow that composition from an international expansion perspective. Third would be Enterprise. And you're right, it's a bit cyclical. But we are coming out of a trough cycle and with investment and enhancement in Wireless LAN, but specifically Wireless LAN security in our Symbol 802.11 technologies; in RFID, I think which was overhyped three or four years ago and is now beginning to be more front and center. Reference Wal-Mart U.S. and the RFID apparel tracking system, which, at the moment, is only encompassing jeans, and we'll look for multiple products, multiple retailers. And the third opportunity for growth is vertical expansion. We're particularly strong, obviously, in Government and Public Safety, in transportation, in logistics and retail. But there's a whole adjacency around manufacturing, education, healthcare and other verticals where we can repurpose product and strike partnerships for vertical expansion with existing product. And then lastly, the San Francisco example this morning, I think next-generation Public Safety opportunities, this is seismic. This is a fundamental, structural change to this business that will move us from narrowband push-to-talk voice and enable us to be a full suite provider of narrowband and broadband with Motorola's worldwide-recognized brand in Public Safety. So the whole notion of building out a next-generation broadband LTE network for Public Safety is pretty substantial and will take several years. And lastly, just one more, I do think there's an opportunity on the services side and for us to evaluate services that are in markets that are logical for us to extend to, whether it be Hosted Applications, Public Safety, National Security, Enterprise, Hosted Services, that's another category that I think could be meaningful for us to grow."

And when you shipped 2.6 million units, you had guided up last quarter. Is that sort of where you had in mind, the 2.6 million? Or did you have a lower number in mind and you actually saw some benefit from HTC to get you there? What I'm trying to understand is how much maybe you got from that break by being the only supplier at Verizon versus you had mentioned some supply constraints, and whether that kind of cut off what you had been anticipating. And then in your guidance, if you look at the same thing going forward, you're now guiding up. You'd guided up last quarter. The last couple quarters, we ended up with plus-300,000 in Q1, plus-400,000 this quarter. When you guide up, how should we look at guiding up? You're clearly in a lot more geographies now, a lot more SKU numbers out there right now. But I would have imagined that you may have been able to sell more given the circumstances last quarter. So just trying to understand, when you say up this quarter, are we looking at up a million? Or are we looking at half a million? How we should look at that opportunity? Greg, you talked a little bit about FID, but it seems that it's -- like you said something that may be kind of coming into its own now after being a little bit overhyped several years ago. Do you see that as being one of your large growth drivers going forward?

Both businesses are very well positioned from an intellectual property standpoint. And I emphasize that significantly; we've stayed very linked at the hip in that regard. And as you saw, when we sold the Networks business to Nokia Siemens, we, Motorola, retained substantially all of the Wireless Networking patents. I do think EMS is well positioned from an LTE intellectual property standpoint. Of course, Sanjay's business will be as well, post-separation. In terms of private broadband LTE, I don't want to get out in front of my headlights, but it is a very big opportunity. It's also an opportunity, though, that's going to take a long time and several years to build out. Recognize that today, the LTE standard is for broadband data. It does not have voice in the standard. All of our mission-critical data systems, P25, are voice-oriented with narrowband data. So I would expect the existing systems and architecture infrastructure to be predominant for the next few years. Over time, private broadband LTE gets more significant. But I view them as coexisting and I view a public-private interoperable set of networks several years down the road."

So in a Public Safety network, it has to be instant on, always on and available, regardless of any instance and regardless of location. As people talk about utilizing carrier networks, they're not designed like that. They're not hardened like that. They're designed for consumer cellular usage. So as the Public Safety officials design these networks going forward, they will design them with a hardened, mission-critical priority in preemption, which is appropriate, for narrowband voice and priority access and preemption, I should say, for data as well. But they're different networks and they're designed differently. And there is no substitute for a hardened Public Safety private network that has spectrum that is dedicated for those events and not designed to manage congestion or peak load. It has to be always available, always on. That's the primary difference."

In terms of just Smartphone gross margin, we're not quite in the 30s. I think the market today is low- to mid-30s, leaving aside some outliers. I anticipate that we have an opportunity in the high end to get to that. But remember that we have a much broader portfolio. Particularly in second half this year, we will launch what I'd classify as lower-end Smartphones. That clearly grows our volume base. But that product mix will determine the overall Smartphone volume. I anticipate, if you take the mix into account, that we are not going to be meaningfully away from where the industry is converging to. So I feel pretty good about the Smartphone gross margin trajectory we have here. And your second question was Europe. Actually, we have a pretty good position in Europe for second half. I don't think that you will see a dramatic investment from us in Europe. And in Europe, probably, our brand name is most challenged, and it requires the largest amount of investment.

This morning, Motorola reported sales in the second quarter of $5.4 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings were $0.09 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the second quarter of last year. 
Each of our businesses delivered improved operating results year-over-year and sequentially. We generated $242 million of operating cash flow, completed $500 million debt tender offer and ended the quarter with total cash of $8.3 billion. 
In Mobile Devices, Smartphone unit shipments increased sequentially to 2.7 million units and a non-GAAP operating loss decline. DROID X, launched with Verizon in mid-July, is off to a great start and is exceeding our expectations.
In Home, sales were up sequentially and operating margin was higher. In EMS, sales grew 10% year-over-year driven by continued recovery in the Enterprise market and operating margin was higher. In Networks, second quarter sales and margins were up sequentially. We also announced that Nokia Siemens Networks plans to acquire the majority of the assets of our Networks business. Greg will comment further on the Networks transaction later in this call. 
Regarding separation, we continue to make significant progress in our plan to create two independent publicly traded companies. This month, we filed our initial Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC. The filing contains information relating to the separation and the business strategies of Motorola Mobility, which will be comprised of Mobile Devices and Home. Upon separation, Enterprise Mobility Solutions and the iDEN Infrastructure business will comprise the company to be led by Greg Brown and will be called Motorola Solutions. Our target for the separation remains the first quarter of 2011.

Motorola sales were $5.4 billion in the second quarter, On a GAAP basis, second quarter earnings were $0.07 per share compared to $0.01 per share a year ago. As Sanjay stated, non-GAAP earnings, which exclude highlighted items, stock compensation and intangible amortization, were $0.09 per share. This compares to $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2009. Highlighted items totaled net income of $0.02 per share. This includes income related to a legal settlement, tax recovery and the sale of certain businesses and investments, partially offset by expenses associated with separation and reorganization costs.
Stock compensation and intangible amortization expenses were $0.04 per share, consistent with prior quarters. Further details on non-GAAP earnings are included as part of today's press release. All remaining financial references will exclude highlighted items, stock compensation and intangible amortization. 
Gross margins in the quarter increased to 37.3% from 31.1% in the second quarter of 2009. The increase was due to the improvements in all of the businesses with the most significant improvement coming in Mobile Devices. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 4% year-over-year. The increase primarily relates to investments in sales and marketing as well as advertising and promotional expenses in support of key products across all of our businesses. With the updated geographical mix of income that we anticipate for this year, we now expect a full year tax rate of 36% to 37%, up from our previous estimate of 34% to 35%. As a result, the ongoing tax rate in the quarter was 40%. While our income statement tax rate will be higher than previously anticipated, we do not expect any meaningful change in cash taxes paid this year.
Moving now to the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $242 million. This includes a legal settlement in relation to a patent infringement litigation which resulted in a one-time cash inflow of $175 million. Inventory increased by $48 million sequentially. However, inventory turns improved to 11 compared to 10 turns in the first quarter and nine turns in the second quarter of last year. Accounts receivable also increased in the quarter, reflecting the sequential sales growth, less favorable linearity and a lower level of cash inflow from sales of receivables. As a result, days sales outstanding were 61 days, up from 57 days in the first quarter. We do expect to drive the DSOs below the current level during the second half. 
During the quarter, we completed a $500 million debt tender offer and closed on the sale of our Israel-based Wireless Network Operator business. Total cash at the end of the quarter was $8.3 billion compared to $8.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Net cash at the end of the quarter was $4.9 billion, up from $4.6 billion in the first quarter and $2.5 billion in the second quarter of 2009.
Turning now to our outlook. We expect third quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. This guidance includes the Networks business and excludes $0.04 per share related to stock compensation and intangible amortization expenses as well as items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings releases. 
With that, I'll pass the call to Sanjay to discuss Motorola Mobility."

Mobile Devices second quarter sales were over $1.7 billion on total shipment of 8.3 million units, including 2.7 million Smartphones. Overall, ASP increased to approximately $207 from $192 in the first quarter due to a more favorable product mix.
We now have over 300 Smartphone launches with carriers, distributors and retailers in 85 countries. While we continue to build momentum in U.S., our sales outside North America accounted for 34% of our total sales. The operating loss in the quarter declined to $109 million compared to a loss of $148 million in the first quarter on a sequential basis. The loss declined due to a higher Smartphone unit volume and improved overall gross margin percentage, offset partially by slightly higher operating expenses. 
During the quarter, we made four additions to our Smartphone portfolio: The i1, the world's first push-to-talk Android-powered Smartphone, began shipping to Sprint in May. The DROID X, with its rich mobile Internet experience and enhanced Enterprise capabilities, is getting a great reception from consumers.
Two devices with the most social stay-connected focus included the FLIPOUT, which features a compact pivoting design and enhanced MOTOBLUR functionality, will ship to Latin America, Europe and U.S. this quarter. And CHARM, also with enhanced MOTOBLUR functionality, was shipped to T-Mobile. With our enhancements to MOTOBLUR, consumers will have increased control over their mobile experience. Enhancements include customizable content filters, the ability to move and re-size widgets and new ways to manage and improve battery life and data usage. MOTOBLUR is a clear satisfier for consumers and we expect it to create consumer stickiness and improve long-term repurchase intent for our devices.
In China, our second largest Smartphone market, sales grew nearly 9% sequentially. With seven Smartphones now in the market, sales were solid for all three major carriers with our top seller being the XT800 for China Telecom. As we expand our portfolio further in the second half, we will continue to focus on differentiating ourselves in a number of ways. These include a broad-based portfolio of Smartphones with tightly integrated consumer experiences, focused R&D investment, continued supply chain and manufacturing execution, uncompromising quality in hardware and RF design and a strong brand. 
From a brand perspective, the strength of our Smartphone portfolio is improving brand awareness, purchase intent and relevancy in key markets. With an expanding portfolio of leadership products, we can leverage a strengthening brand to grow in North America, China and Latin America. Our focus will expand to include more emphasis on Europe and other strategic markets next year.
With regards to the portfolio, we now expect to launch more than 20 Smartphones this year. Regarding our Smartphone shipment guidance, I remain confident in the range of 12 million to 14 million units shipped this year. In mid- to high-tier feature phones, as we anticipated, volume declined in the second quarter. Through the second half, we expect feature phone unit volume to remain relatively stable. In voice-centric devices, we expect to build brand awareness, meet retail channel requirements and yield modest financial returns. 
Looking ahead, on a sequential basis, we expect third quarter Smartphone unit volume, overall unit volume and total sales to be higher. And for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2006, Mobile Devices will grow its top line on a year-over-year basis. With a sequentially higher unit volume and improved mix, we expect a further reduction in the operating loss. And in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect to be profitable, driven by further increases in Smartphone volumes.
Turning now to the results for Home in second quarter. Home sales were $886 million, up 6% sequentially. Sales of customer premise equipment were up slightly and reflected a higher demand for HD set-tops compared to the first quarter. Competitiveness amongst our customer base, growing HD content and channel offering and on-demand services are all contributing to network expansion. As a result, sales of video and access infrastructure were up sequentially, up double digits year-over-year and accounted for over 25% of total Home sales. Sales outside North America were up slightly year-over-year and sequentially and accounted for approximately 30% of total sales. Operating margin increased to 6.4% from 4.8% in the second quarter of last year. The improvement was driven by favorable product mix and lower operating costs.
In Home, we focused on extending our video leadership position capabilities and portfolio of solutions to support our customers' needs to deliver content and advanced services in a more personalized fashion for consumers. This includes whole-home network solutions, 3D TV, interactive services and conversion experiences, such as uniform delivery of content to a multi-screen environment. In the quarter, we introduced an advanced HD IPTV set-top box with KDDI in Japan, which addresses the trend towards fixed-mobile convergence. It supports ultra high-speed broadband connections and personalized media experiences, including set-top-to-mobile device content transfer.
We announced software enhancements for our DCX line of set-tops, which provide consumers with a simplified 3D viewing experience in the home. For operators, it provides a solution to deploy 3D content using existing video delivery infrastructure. We expanded our portfolio with an all-digital set-top that can serve as a multimedia IP hub for whole-home networks, giving consumers more control and access to content anywhere in the home.
Finally, we announced Medios, a suite of software solutions that evolves with current network element to allow operators to receive, store and distribute content across a multiple-screen environment. It also provides merchandising tool and security that enable advanced, on-demand services and commerce.
Turning now to outlook. In Home, we now expect sales for the full year to decline by approximately 7%, which is at the top end of the range we've previously provided. Operating margin is expected to increase, driven by a favorable product mix and improvement in the cost structure. For the third quarter, we expect Home sales to be comparable with higher operating margin as compared to the second quarter. 
In closing, the filing of our initial Registration Statement with the SEC earlier this month was a milestone event, as we continue on a path to create a new, independent public company. 
The convergence of Wireless, Media and Internet and Computing is creating a digital lifestyle for consumers globally. Consumers increasingly want to communicate, manage content and experience entertainment and the Internet in a way that's more personal, intuitive and contextual. And they want to do so from any location and on any screen. Motorola Mobility's core strength in synergies and technology, design and customer relationships, together with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio and a re-energized brand, puts us in a unique position to address this growing marketplace. 
With that, I'll pass the call over to Greg to discuss Motorola Solutions. Greg?"

Last week, we announced an agreement with Nokia Siemens Networks to purchase the majority of our Wireless Network assets, including CDMA, GSM, WiMAX and LTE. NSN is the right partner for our Network's customers and our employees, given their position in the industry and their commitment to long-term growth.
We will receive $1.35 billion in value from the transaction, which includes $1.2 billion from NSN and $150 million for retained accounts receivable. We also retain our profitable iDEN business, substantially all of the Wireless Network's patents and also a portfolio of long-term receivables. We're proud of the track record and accomplishments delivered by the business and its employees. This is particularly true over the last few years amidst a very challenging competitive and economic environment. With the transition to Nokia Siemens Networks, our employees will be able to continue to deliver innovative solutions and serve our customers around the world. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year. Over the next several months, we'll work with NSN on a smooth transition and continue to meet the needs of our customers around the world.
Turning now to results for the quarter. Both Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Networks delivered a very strong financial and operational performance. In EMS, second quarter sales were $1.9 billion, up 10% compared to the year-ago quarter. In our Enterprise market, recovery continues, evidenced by double-digit sales growth in all four geographic regions. Government sales were also up over last year with growth largely coming from the Americas.
Operating margin increased to 15.8% from 13.4% in the second quarter of last year. The increase was due primarily to higher sales and a more favorable product mix. Second quarter sales in North America grew 14% year-over-year. Growth was driven by both Public Safety and Enterprise markets. Notable new subscriber wins included awards in California, New York and Canada. Major P25 system wins included counties in New York, Washington, Maryland and Georgia, two of which displaced incumbent suppliers. 
In Enterprise, sales were strong in all product categories. In RFID Solutions, we're beginning to see stronger interest levels driven by inventory control benefits and the opportunity for retailers to increase sales per customer. In this regard, our mobile RFID platform was recently deployed by Wal-Mart U.S. to support their apparel tracking program. Over time, we expect Wal-Mart U.S. and other retailers to expand their use of RFID Solutions across a wide variety of product categories.
In EMEA, total sales were up 1% in the quarter amid continuing economic and fiscal challenges. Particularly in Europe, we continue to see good customer engagement but lower top line growth compared to other regions. The growth that we are experiencing is being driven by Enterprise markets growing at double digit rates. Part of this growth is being driven by a very successful reception to our personal shopping systems, which improve the convenience of in-store shopping experience. With demonstrated benefits such as improved service levels and enhanced customer loyalty, demand by retailers has been strong, including recent sales to Carrefour, ECA and TESSCO. 
In Asia, sales in the quarter were up 2% compared to a year ago, normalizing for a major system implementation in Malaysia last year. Asia sales were up 18% over last year. Enterprise markets continue to perform very well, and major new orders included Public Safety and transportation wins in China and in India.
From an R&D perspective, we continue to invest in this business during the tough economic climate of 2008 and 2009. As a result, we are well positioned for emerging growth opportunities in both Enterprise and Public Safety markets. This past quarter in the Enterprise market, we announced the smallest and lightest Enterprise Digital Assistant in our Mobile Computing platform. The ES400 features a customizable user interface, integrated voice and data capabilities, as well as mobile computing and scanning functionality. This device is targeted at improving the productivity and efficiency of mobile workforces and offers Enterprise-class security for business-critical applications and information. We also introduced the industry's first TETRA wideband data-capable mobile radio and the world's smallest single-unit data-capable base station, offering a cost-effective solution for expanding coverage.
Finally, we recently outlined our strategy for delivering next-generation, advanced communication solutions for Public Safety. Our solutions address the growing need to supplement voice with rich data, imaging and video communications enabled by broadband networks. By connecting multiple agencies and jurisdictions with mission-critical voice and LTE networks, we can enhance situational awareness, improve productivity and heighten preparedness for emergency situations. 
Today, we are announcing that we were awarded the first phase of a 700-megahertz LTE network for Public Safety across multiple counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. This agreement represents a first step in deploying a unified state-of-the-art, private, mission-critical broadband multimedia network. By combining a Public Safety-hardened LTE network with the existing voice and data networks, the San Francisco Bay Area has the opportunity to equip their first responders with the advanced communications tools that they need to better protect themselves and their communities. This system is the first of its kind and further demonstrates Motorola's leadership and commitment to delivering innovative, next-generation Public Safety solutions.
Looking ahead for the third quarter. On a sequential basis, we expect sales to be comparable with higher operating margin. We still continue to expect full year sales growth in the mid-single digits, with slightly improved operating margin for the full year compared to 2009.
Turning now to Networks. Sales were $967 million, down slightly from a year ago and up 8% from the first quarter, driven by strong CDMA sales in North America. Operating margin was 19.8% compared to 14.9% in the year-ago quarter. As was the case in the first quarter, the margin level was driven primarily by a favorable mix. 
In LTE, we continue to make progress in our KDDI implementation. In China, we successfully completed Phase I field trials of our TD-LTE solution. We are now moving forward with Phase II of that trial. We also continue to showcase our LTE capabilities in partnership with China Mobile at the Shanghai World Expo. 
Regarding out outlook following a very strong first half in CDMA, we do expect to gradually return to a more normalized sales mix and operating margin level by the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, on a sequential basis, we expect sales to be comparable with lower operating margin. For the full year, we expect sales to be down approximately 10% compared to 2009 with operating margin now expected to be in the range for the full year of 13% to 14%.
In closing, all of Motorola's businesses performed well in the quarter, delivering improved financial results year-over-year. In the first half, we generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.15 per share compared to breakeven on a per-share basis in the first half of last year. And net cash is up $2.4 billion from the second quarter of 2009. As we head into the third quarter, we expect to deliver higher earnings, generate positive operating cash flow and, for the first time in 3½ years, we expect Motorola's quarterly sales to grow year-over-year. 
In the coming months, we will also continue to make progress on separation and creating two companies poised for long-term success. Sanjay talked about Motorola Mobility being uniquely positioned for converging consumer demands. For Motorola Solutions, with a sharpened strategic focus, we are solidly positioned for profitable growth. We plan to leverage our market leadership in Public Safety, Mobile Computing, Data Capture and Wireless LAN to provide next-generation solutions for our Government, Public Safety and Enterprise customers around the world. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dean to start the Q&A."

Remember that DROID X is not a Google-experienced device, it's a Motorola-experienced device, and we have spent a lot of time integrating a lot of experiences, which are unique to Motorola. MOTOBLUR is one. Certainly, the user interface is meaningfully improved also from what we delivered in our first MOTOBLUR experience. So I think that the first part of it is of our own execution of our product. We believe that we have delivered a very good quality product. And the short period that, that product has been in the market, we've seen very good quality and the return rate is very good also. I think we need to get associates in each of the retail channels to view Motorola DROID as a safe device that they can recommend to their customers. We achieved that with DROID, and we believe we are well on the way of achieving that with the DROID X. I would say that improvement in our brand name and brand positioning is very important to us. Our relationship with our carriers is very important to us. And I really think the expansion of our footprint outside of United States and with other carriers is also going to be important to us. In terms of iPhone, I really don't know the dynamics around that discussion with various different carriers in the United States. I can tell you that I think DROID is a meaningful economic proposition for Verizon. My perspective is that as long as we continue to execute the way we're doing it, Verizon will continue to invest in both us as well as DROID as a brand name."

That said, Phil, you're right, Government, the Public Safety has been pretty resilient. It was generally flattish in Europe and Asia, up in the Americas.

We always watch it every quarter. And so far, it has performed quite well for the first half of 2010. In terms of the conversation with Enterprise, it's excellent. The engagements are up, the funnel is up. We've grown in double digits on the Enterprise side in Q2.

And also just to follow on with Greg, can you outline a little bit the two to three opportunities you're going to see for EMS post-separation, given that you already have a number one share globally in Public Safety? And it's clear we're in an Enterprise-spending cycle right now, but maybe that would be somewhat of a risky assumption to assume it continues all for 2011 and 2012.

As you know, we have an approximately $500 million debt payment due in the fourth quarter. Our goal will be to offset as much as we can that debt payment. I would suspect our cash balance to be down slightly because of the $500 million payment. But we'll do our best to offset that. The only way we get there is by continuing to improve the working capital metrics. We've done a decent job. We slipped a little bit this quarter with receivables, as I mentioned. But we do expect to improve on that. But the working capital balances will grow, as I've mentioned on previous calls. It's just we've got to continue to improve the metrics. As sales grow throughout the third and fourth quarter, working capital will grow, but we'll try to offset that as best we can. So I hope that gives you a bit of color on where we expect to end the year. Right now, I would outlook slightly down because of the debt payment. But we'll try to offset that as much as we possibly can. On the cash from ops, I think it flows. I think you can back into it. We talked about CapEx being in the 1%, 1½% to as high as 2% range, so you could kind of back into the operating cash flow for the rest of the year."

So I think the core continues to grow, and we'll continue to invest in the upgrade and technology refresh cycle. The second is 60% of the businesses is in North America, 40% is in international. I think international represents a significant growth opportunity as a category where we can get increased penetration and, over time, grow that composition from an international expansion perspective. Third would be Enterprise. And you're right, it's a bit cyclical. But we are coming out of a trough cycle and with investment and enhancement in Wireless LAN, but specifically Wireless LAN security in our Symbol 802.11 technologies; in RFID, I think which was overhyped three or four years ago and is now beginning to be more front and center. Reference Wal-Mart U.S. and the RFID apparel tracking system, which, at the moment, is only encompassing jeans, and we'll look for multiple products, multiple retailers. And the third opportunity for growth is vertical expansion. We're particularly strong, obviously, in Government and Public Safety, in transportation, in logistics and retail. But there's a whole adjacency around manufacturing, education, healthcare and other verticals where we can repurpose product and strike partnerships for vertical expansion with existing product. And then lastly, the San Francisco example this morning, I think next-generation Public Safety opportunities, this is seismic. This is a fundamental, structural change to this business that will move us from narrowband push-to-talk voice and enable us to be a full suite provider of narrowband and broadband with Motorola's worldwide-recognized brand in Public Safety. So the whole notion of building out a next-generation broadband LTE network for Public Safety is pretty substantial and will take several years. And lastly, just one more, I do think there's an opportunity on the services side and for us to evaluate services that are in markets that are logical for us to extend to, whether it be Hosted Applications, Public Safety, National Security, Enterprise, Hosted Services, that's another category that I think could be meaningful for us to grow."

And when you shipped 2.6 million units, you had guided up last quarter. Is that sort of where you had in mind, the 2.6 million? Or did you have a lower number in mind and you actually saw some benefit from HTC to get you there? What I'm trying to understand is how much maybe you got from that break by being the only supplier at Verizon versus you had mentioned some supply constraints, and whether that kind of cut off what you had been anticipating. And then in your guidance, if you look at the same thing going forward, you're now guiding up. You'd guided up last quarter. The last couple quarters, we ended up with plus-300,000 in Q1, plus-400,000 this quarter. When you guide up, how should we look at guiding up? You're clearly in a lot more geographies now, a lot more SKU numbers out there right now. But I would have imagined that you may have been able to sell more given the circumstances last quarter. So just trying to understand, when you say up this quarter, are we looking at up a million? Or are we looking at half a million? How we should look at that opportunity? Greg, you talked a little bit about FID, but it seems that it's -- like you said something that may be kind of coming into its own now after being a little bit overhyped several years ago. Do you see that as being one of your large growth drivers going forward? And in terms of margins, and you look at your different businesses that you're in, and specifically, I'm looking away from Public Safety; more on the Wireless Enterprise side.

It's also an opportunity, though, that's going to take a long time and several years to build out. Recognize that today, the LTE standard is for broadband data. It does not have voice in the standard. All of our mission-critical data systems, P25, are voice-oriented with narrowband data.

And then on the handset side, you said in the past that Android should be achieving or getting to mid-30s kind of gross margin. Now that you went with the first DROID, you went through almost a whole cycle. Can you look back and say you touched these levels? And then also if you can project going forward, is mid-30s still a good proxy for margins? The last thing is just to update Android in Europe. I haven't heard on this call any discussions of that region."

In terms of just Smartphone gross margin, we're not quite in the 30s. I think the market today is low- to mid-30s, leaving aside some outliers. I anticipate that we have an opportunity in the high end to get to that. But remember that we have a much broader portfolio. Particularly in second half this year, we will launch what I'd classify as lower-end Smartphones. That clearly grows our volume base. But that product mix will determine the overall Smartphone volume. I anticipate, if you take the mix into account, that we are not going to be meaningfully away from where the industry is converging to. So I feel pretty good about the Smartphone gross margin trajectory we have here. And your second question was Europe. Actually, we have a pretty good position in Europe for second half. I don't think that you will see a dramatic investment from us in Europe. And in Europe, probably, our brand name is most challenged, and it requires the largest amount of investment. You will see us be present in meaningful ways, but we will not -- we will do that with particular carriers in particular regions. You won't see us go to Europe with a large campaign in 2010."

I think that's probably one place that I see, if we can justify that on the quarterly shipment or in a very short period of time, I think that I could see myself making a decision where we go and make some investments. In terms of operating expense, I feel that I guided you that year-on-year, my operating expenses will be roughly flat.

On a year-over-year basis, overall sales, earnings and total cash are all higher. Additionally, we also continue to make excellent progress on our planned separation.
Our reported sales were $4.9 billion, up nearly 13% over the same period a year ago. This excludes the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by Nokia Siemens Networks, which is classified as discontinued operations. If we were to include sales from discontinued operations, sales would have been $5.8 billion, up 6% over the year-ago quarter. This is the first top line growth quarter for Motorola since the fourth quarter of 2006, and was driven by growth in Mobile Devices, Home and Enterprise Mobility Solutions.
Non-GAAP earnings, including both continuing and discontinued operations were $0.16 a share. This exceeded our guidance of $0.10 to $0.12 per share that we provided on the last earnings call. Ed will comment further on the reporting changes associated with our planned sale to NSN and our third quarter results in a few moments.
In the quarter, Mobile Devices increased smartphone shipments to 3.8 million units and achieved operating profitability on a non-GAAP basis. In Home, sales were up sequentially and operating margin was higher. In EMS, sales grew 9% year-over-year driven by strong demand in the Enterprise markets. Operating margin and cash generation were very strong as well. In Networks, financial performance also continued to be very strong, again, in the third quarter. Solid operating profitability, combined with continued balance sheet management resulted in $502 million of operating cash flow. As a result, total cash at the end of the quarter increased to $9 billion.
During the quarter, we made further progress in our plan to create two independent public companies, which included finalizing various company agreements and completing further updates to Motorola Mobility's Form 10 Registration Statement filed with the SEC. Separation of Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions remains targeted for some time in the first quarter of 2011. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide additional details on the financial results for the quarter. I'll then come back to review Motorola Solutions and then Sanjay will discuss Motorola Mobility. Ed?"

I'll begin today by outlining the changes we have made in our financial reporting. First, financial results related to the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by NSN are now classified as discontinued operations. As such, they are not included in the Motorola reported sales or in earnings from continuing operations. Second, the results of operations for previously disposed businesses, which were deemed to be immaterial at the time of the disposition, have now been reclassified from the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment as discontinued operations. These businesses include an Israel-based wireless network operator, the biometrics business and good technology.
The assets and liabilities of the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by NSN and the assets and liabilities of previously disposed businesses prior to the disposal are now reported assets and liabilities held for sale in the applicable reporting periods. Third, the iDen Infrastructure business and certain licensing activities formally related to the Networks business are now reported as part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. Finally, certain operating costs, which historically have been allocated to Networks are now allocated to EMS segment since the underlying activities will not be transferred to NSN. This is an understanding of these changes on a historical basis a revised presentation in the results of Motorola and EMS segment for 2007 to the first half of 2010 we recently filed in 8-K and can be found on our website. Previously reported segment results for Mobile Devices and Home are unchanged. With that, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter.
Motorola sales from continuing operations were $4.9 billion in the third quarter, up 13% from the third quarter of 2009. As Greg mentioned, inclusive of discontinued operations, third quarter sales would have been $5.8 million, up 6% from the third quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, third quarter total earnings were $0.05 per share. These results include $0.00 per share from continuing operations and $0.05 per share from discontinued operations, which I've described earlier. 
On a non-GAAP basis, total earnings were $0.16 per share, which exceeded our guidance of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. In addition to solid operating results in Mobile Devices, Home and EMS, our strong earnings performance reflected continued CDMA momentum and network favorable to other income and expense results and a lower tax rate.
Non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter totaled $0.12 per share, including piloted items, totaling a net expense of $0.08 per share. This is comprised of expenses associated with restructuring and separation and a non-cash income tax expense related to anticipated capital reductions and certain foreign operations, partially offset by income-related to an IP reserve and stock compensation and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share consistent with prior quarters. 
For continuing operations, non-GAAP earnings were $0.12 per share. This compares to $0.04 per share in the second quarter and $0.01 per share in the year ago quarter. Further details on non-GAAP earnings are included as part of today's press release and available on our website. All remaining financial references will exclude discontinued operations, highlighted items, stock compensation expense and intangible amortization.
Gross margin percentage in the quarter increased to 36.8% from 33.3% in the third quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by improvements in both Mobile Devices and Home. Sequentially, gross margin percentage was up slightly, reflecting margin percentage improvement in each business offset partially by a shift in business mix. Operating expenses in the quarter were flat sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. The increase was driven by investments in sales and marketing to support business growth and new product introductions. Total other income and expense was a lower net expense and anticipated due to lower net interest expense and favorable results associated with foreign currency translation and investments held in the Sigma fund.
With the exclusion of networks and other changes in the geographical mix of income anticipated for the year, we now expect a full year ongoing tax rate of 34% to 35%, down from our previous estimate of 36% to 37%. This change, along with the favorable tax adjustment, resulted an ongoing tax rate in the quarter of 28%. 
Moving now for the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $502 million, including a third consecutive quarter of improving cash flow results in Mobile Devices. Total inventory increased by $280 million sequentially, driven primarily by anticipated fourth quarter demand in Mobile Devices. Inventory turned 9x down, compared to 11 turns in the second quarter and flat with nine turns in the third quarter of last year.
Accounts receivable also increased in the quarter, reflecting a sequential sales growth. Days sales outstanding were 60 days compared to 61 days in the second quarter and 58 days in the year-ago quarter. Total cash at the end of the quarter was $9 billion compared to $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. Net cash at the end of the quarter was $5.6 billion compared to $4.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2009. 
Turning now to our outlook. We expect fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.16 per share. This guidance excludes a portion of the Networks business that is held for sale, stock-based compensation and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share and items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings release. 
With that, I'll pass the call to Greg to discuss Motorola Solutions."

In the EMS, third quarter sales were over $1.9  billion, up 9% compared to the year-ago quarter. Enterprise markets continued to perform well, evidenced again by double-digit sales growth in all four geographic regions. In the government market, sales were up slightly against the year-ago quarter. New orders, particularly in the Enterprise remain solid, resulting in an increase in total overall EMS backlog compared to the end of the second quarter. Operating margin was 16.5% compared to 15.9% in the second quarter and 16.9% in the third quarter of last year.
Third quarter sales in North America grew 5% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Enterprise markets, primarily retail. On the government side, sales were higher and orders included major public safety wins with the U.S. Marshals Service, Washington Metro Area Transportation Authority, Nashville-Davidson County Metropolitan Government in Tennessee and the State of Arkansas. Demand for the recently announced ES400 Enterprise Digital Assistant has been strong. The ES400 offers Enterprise grade durability and functionality for business critical applications, and it recently began shipping and will be available globally during the fourth quarter.
In the EMEA, total sales were up 13% in the quarter. Growth continue to be driven by Enterprise markets, including personal shopping and field Mobility Solutions for retail, manufacturing, transportation and logistics customers. Radio solutions sales were also higher due in part to continued analog to digital transition. 
In Asia, sales in the quarter were up 7% compared to a year ago. Enterprise markets and Public Safety continue to perform very well. And finally, yesterday, it was announced that we signed a three-year extension to our iDEN Infrastructure supply agreements with NII, a leading provider of mobile communications for business customers in Latin America. In the quarter, we expanded our mobile computing portfolio with the MC65, a compact, rugged Enterprise mobile computer with integrated GPS and data capture. The MC65 is aimed at improving productivity and task-oriented environments including Field Service, field sales, transportation and Public Safety. 
We also announced MOTOTRBO connect plus, a scalable two-way radio system designed to accommodate high-volume, wide-area communications for mobile work teams. We expanded our APX P25 mission-critical two-way radio series with additional mobiles and portables, including radios designed for extreme situations and single-band users and the first encrypted mission-critical Bluetooth earpiece, enabling secure communications when paired with our APX Portable radios.
Finally, we had the next-generation interoperability solution, which increases the effectiveness of first responders by connecting disparate radio systems and allowing them to operate as one. 
Regarding Public Safety broadband on our last call, we announced that we were awarded the first phase of a 700 megahertz LTE Public Safety network to serve multiple counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. This agreement represents the initial step in deploying a unified state-of-the-art private mission-critical broadband network. As Public Safety systems are expanded to include broadband data, they will need to inter-operate with carrier networks. To this end, we recently signed a significant partnership with Ericsson. In this arrangement, Ericsson will provide LTE-based station equipment to Motorola. We will configure it. We will harden it for Public Safety use, and we will provide the overall broadband network solution architecture for our customers.
With respect to the Networks business in July, we announced that NSN would purchase the majority of our wireless network assets, including CDMA, GSM, WiMAX and LTE. In this transaction, which is expected to close by early 2011, we will receive approximately $1.35 billion in value, including $1.2 billion from NSN and $150 million for retained accounts receivables. In the third quarter, the portion of the Networks business being acquired by NSN accounted for $871 million in sales and $177 million in GAAP earnings. The strong results were again driven primarily by the CDMA business in North America.
Before we move to our outlook for EMS and Networks, I want to provide some background on the EMS cost structure. As Ed mentioned earlier, there are costs associated with certain activities previously allocated to Networks which will not be part of the NSN transaction. These costs are now allocated to EMS. So as we head toward separation, we are identifying and taking the appropriate actions to better align our cost structure for the remaining businesses. These actions may include facility rationalization, discretionary spending reductions and where necessary, staff reductions. We do not expect these actions to impact our critical R&D priorities or our critical customer facing operations.
Regarding our outlook for EMS for the fourth quarter and taking into consideration the impact of our discontinued operations reporting, we expect sales and operating margin to be higher on a sequential basis, and we expect full year sales growth of 7% to 8%, with full year operating margin of approximately 16%. 
For the Networks business classified in discontinued operations, in the fourth quarter, we expect sequentially higher sales, including the higher WiMAX sales and lower CDMA sales. With the change in product mix, we expect operating margin to be lower, resulting in approximately $0.03 per share for discontinued operations. This is not incorporated in the guidance Ed provided earlier of $0.14 to $0.16 per share, which comprises only continuing operations. 
And with that, I'll now pass the call over to Sanjay to discuss Motorola Mobility."
99186,113456460,82672,"Motorola Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Greg, and good morning. Mobile Devices reached a major milestone in the third quarter. We were profitable for the first time in over three and a half years. Our sales surpassed $2 billion and were up 20% year-over-year. Total shipments were 9.1 mi",1454,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning. Mobile Devices reached a major milestone in the third quarter. We were profitable for the first time in over three and a half years. Our sales surpassed $2 billion and were up 20% year-over-year. Total shipments were 9.1 million units, including smartphone shipment of 3.8 million units. Overall, ASP increased to approximately $223 from $207 in the second quarter, driven by smartphones, which continue to account for over half of our total sales. 
In North America, smartphone sales remained strong, led by our family of DROID devices. Devices at other U.S. carriers continue to perform well also. In a recent JD Power survey of smartphone users, Motorola ranked number two in the U.S. in customer satisfaction, recognition of our focus and high-quality consumer experiences. 
Sales outside of North America grew 10% sequentially and accounted for 32% of total sales. Operating profit in the quarter of $3 million compares to a loss of $109 million in the second quarter. The sequential improvement was driven by a higher smartphone unit volume and improved overall gross margin percentage. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined also.
Since our last earnings call, we have added 12 devices to our smartphone portfolio, all of which will be in stores for the holiday season. This brings the number of smartphones we have introduced this year to 22. In North America, DROID X continues to sell extremely well. DROID 2, which features an improved keyboard and faster processor compared to the original DROID also sold well in the quarter. Earlier in the month, we announced DROID PRO, our first device optimized for both personal and business use. Usable in over 200 countries, it features a one gigahertz processor, candy bar form factor, QWERTY keyboard and Adobe Flash 10.1. To address corporate connectivity and security needs, we have added security features on top of Android OS. This makes our devices more secure and more manageable in using standard Enterprise tools and technologies. As a result, we expect DROID PRO to be very competitive with other devices in the market aimed at business users.
Finally at Verizon, we announced CITRUS, an entry-level pocketable device with an eco-friendly design for first-time smartphone users. At AT&T, we launched three more devices: BRAVO, FLIPSIDE and FLIPOUT. With a variety of screen sizes and form factors and affordable retail price points, these devices give consumers added choice in their smartphone experiences.
Another device that we believe will gain strong consumer acceptance is DEFY. Optimized for active lifestyle, DEFY  is compact, water-resistant, scratch-resistant and dust-proof. It draws on our successes in designing and delivering rugged, durable Mobile Devices. 
In addition to T-Mobile, DEFY is also available in a number of markets outside of U.S. Outside North America, sales growth was driven by a 30% sequential growth in smartphone revenues. In China, our second-largest smartphone market we're one of the leading Android Smartphone suppliers. Unit shipments were up over 70% sequentially. We launched five new Smartphones, including three marketed under our well-known MING brand. MING has been a Motorola brand in China since 2006. It represents devices developed specifically for Chinese consumers that featured distinctive designs, including a signature transparent flip cover. This devices bring our total China Smartphone portfolio to 13%, all released in less than a year.
In Latin America, the Smartphone market is gaining traction as mid- and low-tier devices become available. Unit shipments in the quarter were up over 20% sequentially. Earlier this month, we announced SPICE, an affordable smartphone, which we'll launch initially in Brazil and then expand into other markets. This brings the number of smartphones we have introduced in the region to 10.
In Western Europe, we are making good progress. Sales increased sequentially across a broad range of devices, including the recently launched Milestone 2 and DEFY. The majority of our new devices feature enhanced MOTOBLUR capabilities. Improvements to MOTOBLUR provide consumers with increased control over their mobile experiences, device customization and device management. In addition, with over 3 million users, MOTOBLUR provides us with important feedback for our future product and experience development.
Finally, we added to our portfolio of Bluetooth companion devices that allow consumers to stay productive and hands-free. Device shipping in the fourth quarter feature advanced noise-cancellation technology and include the first device to give consumers the option to respond to text with their voice.
As we look ahead, we will continue to enhance and broaden our smartphone portfolio. With the belief that one size does not fit all, our smartphone focus will continue in three primary areas: First, high-performance smartphones as the leading edge of innovation that deliver the best experiences to consumers who enjoy everything that mobile Internet has to offer, including multimedia, gaming and social collaboration; second, devices with broad appeal that meet the browsing and social messaging needs of consumers who are interested in intuitive, easy-to-use, pocketable devices with affordable data plans; and third, devices that address the rapidly growing opportunity with business users. These consumers want to stay informed and connected in their work life and their personal life and make their own technology choices. 
Increasingly, CIO support giving employees a choice. If giving that choice, we believe a large number of business users will seriously consider an alternative to their current device brand. 
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter on a sequential basis, we expect unit shipments and total sales to be higher. The sequential increase in smartphone shipments will be driven largely by our mid-ranged devices. We expect operating earnings to be higher due to higher sales offset partially by an increase in sales and marketing expenses to support the large number of new product launches. For the year, smartphone shipments are now expected to hit the upper end of our 12 million to 14 million unit range. 
Launching over 20 Smartphone devices and achieving profitability have been major goals for us in the transition of this business. Attaining these milestones has been made possible by a tremendous amount of work by a dedicated team of people here at Motorola. These accomplishments are reflective of the innovation and determination of the Mobile Devices organization. 
Turning now to the results for the Home in the third quarter. Home sales were $912 million, up 3% sequentially. Sales of digital entertainment devices were higher and reflected an improved mix, including higher demand for Mocha enabled set-tops for whole Home digital networks. Sales of video and access infrastructure were up over 30% year-over-year and continue to account for over 25% of total Home sales.
Looking regionally, sales in North America were flat year-on-year. Sales outside of North America were higher and accounted for approximately 25% of total Home sales. We continue to improve profitability, with operating margin increasing to 8.4% from 5% in third quarter of last year. Improvement in the quarter was driven by a more favorable product mix and a reduction in operating costs. 
In Home, our R&D effort continues to be directed towards leveraging our video leadership to deliver solutions that support the trend towards more personalized content and services. This includes digital Home networks, 3D TV, interactive services and converged experiences. That said, with continued macro-environment challenges, we are also focused on prioritizing our current product portfolio and tightly managing the cost structure.
With respect to enhancing the portfolio, during the quarter, we launched the Motorola EDGE software solution. With these applications, operators can more easily manage broadband services in a multi-screen digital Home. They also help operators to reduce operating costs and accelerate revenue-producing services. We also announced a hosted switch to digital video solution. This solution will enable independent video operators to achieve bandwidth efficiencies previously available only to operators with on-site capabilities.
Finally, we supported Verizon with the launch of its multi-screen video service by providing our Medios software suite. This solution facilitates the preparation of content for distribution and enable subscriber to share video mix devices such as set-tops, personal computers and smartphones.
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect Home sales and operating earnings to be sequentially higher. For the full year, despite the top line decline, we continue to expect to deliver higher operating margin compared to 2009.
In closing, Motorola's business has performed very well in the quarter and have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. We also continue to focus on our preparations to create two public companies in the first quarter. Motorola Mobility will be well positioned to address the growing opportunity in Smartphones and converged experiences. And Motorola Solution will be poised to leverage its leadership position in mission-critical and business-critical communication solutions. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dean to start the Q&A."

But to address the substance of your question, we expect to continue a very meaningful relationship with Verizon. We think the DROID franchise is economically very valuable for Verizon, and they will continue to invest and foster the DROID franchise. And as you know, we are a meaningful participant in that franchise. We will also diversify our portfolio within United States with other operators. We are also focused on diversifying our portfolio outside of the United States. As we said, we have seen meaningful increase in our revenue in China, and we expect that we will focus in expanding our presence in China and Latin America, and to a certain extent, in Europe also. We have, as I look into 2011, we have very multiple design wins with a number of operators, both in the United States and elsewhere. And as we look further beyond just the smartphone category, I see opportunities for us in the converged category as we see convergence between computing and mobility. So if you look at all of these factors, I feel that, clearly, in first quarter, there will be some seasonality and there will be competitive pressure as there is in fourth quarter.

Or if that's not really an issue that would be helpful to understand that. And then, following up with some other questions. When you look at your Q4 guidance, you're now talking about the high end of $12 million to $14 million does that imply a certain number north of $5 million for the fourth quarter? Can you talk about how you get there vis-à-vis your current main customer base? Obviously, the larger is AT&T, but how much more is China going to be in the mix? I believe China right now is somewhere around 12%, 13% of your units. Where does that go in the fourth quarter to get you up almost 1.5 million to 2 million units from Q3? And if you can kind of, again, just talk about at least geographically, if not more specific as to how you get from the 3.7 million now into the 5 million more, where they are coming from so we could feel comfortable that you can actually get there without relying continually on, essentially Verizon and the same guys that you have them? And then, just for Greg, North America seem to have slowed in government to decelerate let's say about 5% year-over-year growth versus I believe it was north of 10% last quarter.

Now having said that, we're also evaluating Nokia Siemens, and there's nothing to preclude or prevent us from adding an additional partner beyond Ericsson. But we were impressed with the capability of their technology. Obviously, their significant footprint and incumbency, and we think it's a great partnership. The interesting part of that, it doesn't -- so we're divesting of the net wireless Networks business, and what you'll see is Motorola Solutions have a very strong position in public safety LTE or private network LTE. So we're developing LTE infrastructure for private networks and for private broadband within our Public Safety group. As we inter-operate or roam onto a carrier network, we will take the e-node B equipment from Ericsson, harden it, provide encryption and software, secure it and provide it as an overall Public Safety solution with the Ericsson-based station embedded in an overall Motorola Solutions architecture and solution to our end-user customer. So we're very optimistic about it. We think it's a very important strategic alliance.

And finally, I just say on the convergence piece, as we look at what MOTOBLUR is doing today and we talked about the EDGE capability from the Home, linking those together and being able to enable us to manage and enhance those capabilities to the consumer and really bring this converged world such that the consumer gets their content on any of their device that they want creates some wonderful opportunities into the future. So you'll start beginning to see in 2011 some converged experiences from us. And then as we move forward more, more opportunity to differentiate our products, both Home, Mobile in this converged world."

Motorola really has a leading position in Android as an earlier adopter of it. But it's pretty clear that some of the bigger players such as Samsung and such as kind of for the first part of this year not come to market. Sanjay, can you talk a little bit about your positioning relative to as you see the additional competition heating up there? Do you think you can get to kind of industry average smartphone profitability longer term, I guess, longer term should the industry average profit will it become lower?

I think it's a very competitive good product in the marketplace. HTC continues to deliver good products in the marketplace. On the other hand, I think you're right in characterizing Motorola as the leading, if not, one of the leading handset manufacturers here. I see no reason for us not to get to industry standard profitability and gross margin and profitability over the long period of time. And I see in my guidance, I've always said that this is going to be high single-digit, low double-digit kind of number is where we want to end up in terms of our operating earnings in the long term. But clearly, as I've said in a number of recent comments, I see that the job of transforming this organization is half done. We have some more work to do in terms of becoming a much more software-centric, experience-focused organization. But in one year, we have delivered 22 products. Our focus and execution, our focus and innovation and differentiation is far greater today. And I feel we've very well positioned, not just in the fundamental or transformation that we're making in the organization but the response we're getting to the portfolio in 2011 from our customers. So again, we can -- things that we have a good portfolio. Until our customers accept our products and range our products, we don't have real basis to be optimistic. On the basis of that feedback, on the basis of ranging that we're seeing of our products not just in the United States but elsewhere, I feel pretty comfortable that we're making good progress. And more precisely, I feel that we should definitely get to industry level profitability."

First of all, what I call the performance tier or the high tier of smartphone market today carries the disproportionately high amount of gross margin with it. Because, as you know, off the price points that has been said, $199 and $99, and the lifetime ownership costs of these devices is such that you're biased towards buying a higher-tier in U.S. I actually continue to believe that we will do well, if not extremely well, in that tier. So I think in your question, you'll assume that the competitive pressure is there forced us to diversify in the middle. I don't think it's a matter of one or the other. I think that you will see us do both. You will see us focus very, very much in leading in the performance tier because the halo of performance tier is probably just as important in driving mid tier as anything else, and the performance in North America actually is just as important in driving outside U.S. smartphone sales as anything else. You will see our brand name being relevant in China and Latin America, and we will focus there as a matter of first step. But Europe, I think is a very important marketplace. And the dynamics there, particularly right now, potentially create an opportunity for us to capitalize on. So we will focus on those things. But I think we have not, by the way, guided you to improving OpEx as our sales increase. But I really believe that performance tier is important for us to succeed on as I think you imply in your comments. But the diversification with mid tier is also important because the base of smartphone is increasing and more feature phone consumers are coming to smartphone. And we have to win in both places."

Again, after that, I think we'll have other things to consider. The Motorola Solutions business is a market-leading business in Public Safety. Its market-leading in Mobile Computing and Advanced Data Capture, we'll have a very strong IPR position. And from an organic standpoint, has a solid path of growth, irrespective of some of the headwinds we've had with state and local government budgets, we're still growing.

On a year-over-year basis, overall sales, earnings and total cash are all higher. Additionally, we also continue to make excellent progress on our planned separation.
Our reported sales were $4.9 billion, up nearly 13% over the same period a year ago. This excludes the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by Nokia Siemens Networks, which is classified as discontinued operations. If we were to include sales from discontinued operations, sales would have been $5.8 billion, up 6% over the year-ago quarter. This is the first top line growth quarter for Motorola since the fourth quarter of 2006, and was driven by growth in Mobile Devices, Home and Enterprise Mobility Solutions.
Non-GAAP earnings, including both continuing and discontinued operations were $0.16 a share. This exceeded our guidance of $0.10 to $0.12 per share that we provided on the last earnings call. Ed will comment further on the reporting changes associated with our planned sale to NSN and our third quarter results in a few moments.
In the quarter, Mobile Devices increased smartphone shipments to 3.8 million units and achieved operating profitability on a non-GAAP basis. In Home, sales were up sequentially and operating margin was higher. In EMS, sales grew 9% year-over-year driven by strong demand in the Enterprise markets. Operating margin and cash generation were very strong as well. In Networks, financial performance also continued to be very strong, again, in the third quarter. Solid operating profitability, combined with continued balance sheet management resulted in $502 million of operating cash flow. As a result, total cash at the end of the quarter increased to $9 billion.
During the quarter, we made further progress in our plan to create two independent public companies, which included finalizing various company agreements and completing further updates to Motorola Mobility's Form 10 Registration Statement filed with the SEC. Separation of Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions remains targeted for some time in the first quarter of 2011. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide additional details on the financial results for the quarter. I'll then come back to review Motorola Solutions and then Sanjay will discuss Motorola Mobility. Ed?

I'll begin today by outlining the changes we have made in our financial reporting. First, financial results related to the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by NSN are now classified as discontinued operations. As such, they are not included in the Motorola reported sales or in earnings from continuing operations. Second, the results of operations for previously disposed businesses, which were deemed to be immaterial at the time of the disposition, have now been reclassified from the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment as discontinued operations. These businesses include an Israel-based wireless network operator, the biometrics business and good technology.
The assets and liabilities of the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by NSN and the assets and liabilities of previously disposed businesses prior to the disposal are now reported assets and liabilities held for sale in the applicable reporting periods. Third, the iDen Infrastructure business and certain licensing activities formally related to the Networks business are now reported as part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. Finally, certain operating costs, which historically have been allocated to Networks are now allocated to EMS segment since the underlying activities will not be transferred to NSN. This is an understanding of these changes on a historical basis a revised presentation in the results of Motorola and EMS segment for 2007 to the first half of 2010 we recently filed in 8-K and can be found on our website. Previously reported segment results for Mobile Devices and Home are unchanged. With that, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter.
Motorola sales from continuing operations were $4.9 billion in the third quarter, up 13% from the third quarter of 2009. As Greg mentioned, inclusive of discontinued operations, third quarter sales would have been $5.8 million, up 6% from the third quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, third quarter total earnings were $0.05 per share. These results include $0.00 per share from continuing operations and $0.05 per share from discontinued operations, which I've described earlier. 
On a non-GAAP basis, total earnings were $0.16 per share, which exceeded our guidance of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. In addition to solid operating results in Mobile Devices, Home and EMS, our strong earnings performance reflected continued CDMA momentum and network favorable to other income and expense results and a lower tax rate.
Non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter totaled $0.12 per share, including piloted items, totaling a net expense of $0.08 per share. This is comprised of expenses associated with restructuring and separation and a non-cash income tax expense related to anticipated capital reductions and certain foreign operations, partially offset by income-related to an IP reserve and stock compensation and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share consistent with prior quarters. 
For continuing operations, non-GAAP earnings were $0.12 per share. This compares to $0.04 per share in the second quarter and $0.01 per share in the year ago quarter. Further details on non-GAAP earnings are included as part of today's press release and available on our website. All remaining financial references will exclude discontinued operations, highlighted items, stock compensation expense and intangible amortization.
Gross margin percentage in the quarter increased to 36.8% from 33.3% in the third quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by improvements in both Mobile Devices and Home. Sequentially, gross margin percentage was up slightly, reflecting margin percentage improvement in each business offset partially by a shift in business mix. Operating expenses in the quarter were flat sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. The increase was driven by investments in sales and marketing to support business growth and new product introductions. Total other income and expense was a lower net expense and anticipated due to lower net interest expense and favorable results associated with foreign currency translation and investments held in the Sigma fund.
With the exclusion of networks and other changes in the geographical mix of income anticipated for the year, we now expect a full year ongoing tax rate of 34% to 35%, down from our previous estimate of 36% to 37%. This change, along with the favorable tax adjustment, resulted an ongoing tax rate in the quarter of 28%. 
Moving now for the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $502 million, including a third consecutive quarter of improving cash flow results in Mobile Devices. Total inventory increased by $280 million sequentially, driven primarily by anticipated fourth quarter demand in Mobile Devices. Inventory turned 9x down, compared to 11 turns in the second quarter and flat with nine turns in the third quarter of last year.
Accounts receivable also increased in the quarter, reflecting a sequential sales growth. Days sales outstanding were 60 days compared to 61 days in the second quarter and 58 days in the year-ago quarter. Total cash at the end of the quarter was $9 billion compared to $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. Net cash at the end of the quarter was $5.6 billion compared to $4.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2009. 
Turning now to our outlook. We expect fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.16 per share. This guidance excludes a portion of the Networks business that is held for sale, stock-based compensation and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share and items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings release. 
With that, I'll pass the call to Greg to discuss Motorola Solutions.

On the government side, sales were higher and orders included major public safety wins with the U.S. Marshals Service, Washington Metro Area Transportation Authority, Nashville-Davidson County Metropolitan Government in Tennessee and the State of Arkansas. Demand for the recently announced ES400 Enterprise Digital Assistant has been strong. The ES400 offers Enterprise grade durability and functionality for business critical applications, and it recently began shipping and will be available globally during the fourth quarter.
In the EMEA, total sales were up 13% in the quarter. Growth continue to be driven by Enterprise markets, including personal shopping and field Mobility Solutions for retail, manufacturing, transportation and logistics customers. Radio solutions sales were also higher due in part to continued analog to digital transition. 
In Asia, sales in the quarter were up 7% compared to a year ago. Enterprise markets and Public Safety continue to perform very well. And finally, yesterday, it was announced that we signed a three-year extension to our iDEN Infrastructure supply agreements with NII, a leading provider of mobile communications for business customers in Latin America. In the quarter, we expanded our mobile computing portfolio with the MC65, a compact, rugged Enterprise mobile computer with integrated GPS and data capture. The MC65 is aimed at improving productivity and task-oriented environments including Field Service, field sales, transportation and Public Safety. 
We also announced MOTOTRBO connect plus, a scalable two-way radio system designed to accommodate high-volume, wide-area communications for mobile work teams. We expanded our APX P25 mission-critical two-way radio series with additional mobiles and portables, including radios designed for extreme situations and single-band users and the first encrypted mission-critical Bluetooth earpiece, enabling secure communications when paired with our APX Portable radios.
Finally, we had the next-generation interoperability solution, which increases the effectiveness of first responders by connecting disparate radio systems and allowing them to operate as one. 
Regarding Public Safety broadband on our last call, we announced that we were awarded the first phase of a 700 megahertz LTE Public Safety network to serve multiple counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. This agreement represents the initial step in deploying a unified state-of-the-art private mission-critical broadband network. As Public Safety systems are expanded to include broadband data, they will need to inter-operate with carrier networks. To this end, we recently signed a significant partnership with Ericsson. In this arrangement, Ericsson will provide LTE-based station equipment to Motorola. We will configure it. We will harden it for Public Safety use, and we will provide the overall broadband network solution architecture for our customers.
With respect to the Networks business in July, we announced that NSN would purchase the majority of our wireless network assets, including CDMA, GSM, WiMAX and LTE. In this transaction, which is expected to close by early 2011, we will receive approximately $1.35 billion in value, including $1.2 billion from NSN and $150 million for retained accounts receivables. In the third quarter, the portion of the Networks business being acquired by NSN accounted for $871 million in sales and $177 million in GAAP earnings. The strong results were again driven primarily by the CDMA business in North America.
Before we move to our outlook for EMS and Networks, I want to provide some background on the EMS cost structure. As Ed mentioned earlier, there are costs associated with certain activities previously allocated to Networks which will not be part of the NSN transaction. These costs are now allocated to EMS. So as we head toward separation, we are identifying and taking the appropriate actions to better align our cost structure for the remaining businesses. These actions may include facility rationalization, discretionary spending reductions and where necessary, staff reductions. We do not expect these actions to impact our critical R&D priorities or our critical customer facing operations.
Regarding our outlook for EMS for the fourth quarter and taking into consideration the impact of our discontinued operations reporting, we expect sales and operating margin to be higher on a sequential basis, and we expect full year sales growth of 7% to 8%, with full year operating margin of approximately 16%. 
For the Networks business classified in discontinued operations, in the fourth quarter, we expect sequentially higher sales, including the higher WiMAX sales and lower CDMA sales. With the change in product mix, we expect operating margin to be lower, resulting in approximately $0.03 per share for discontinued operations. This is not incorporated in the guidance Ed provided earlier of $0.14 to $0.16 per share, which comprises only continuing operations. 
And with that, I'll now pass the call over to Sanjay to discuss Motorola Mobility.

Mobile Devices reached a major milestone in the third quarter. We were profitable for the first time in over three and a half years. Our sales surpassed $2 billion and were up 20% year-over-year. Total shipments were 9.1 mi",1454,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning. Mobile Devices reached a major milestone in the third quarter. We were profitable for the first time in over three and a half years. Our sales surpassed $2 billion and were up 20% year-over-year. Total shipments were 9.1 million units, including smartphone shipment of 3.8 million units. Overall, ASP increased to approximately $223 from $207 in the second quarter, driven by smartphones, which continue to account for over half of our total sales. 
In North America, smartphone sales remained strong, led by our family of DROID devices. Devices at other U.S. carriers continue to perform well also. In a recent JD Power survey of smartphone users, Motorola ranked number two in the U.S. in customer satisfaction, recognition of our focus and high-quality consumer experiences. 
Sales outside of North America grew 10% sequentially and accounted for 32% of total sales. Operating profit in the quarter of $3 million compares to a loss of $109 million in the second quarter. The sequential improvement was driven by a higher smartphone unit volume and improved overall gross margin percentage. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined also.
Since our last earnings call, we have added 12 devices to our smartphone portfolio, all of which will be in stores for the holiday season. This brings the number of smartphones we have introduced this year to 22. In North America, DROID X continues to sell extremely well. DROID 2, which features an improved keyboard and faster processor compared to the original DROID also sold well in the quarter. Earlier in the month, we announced DROID PRO, our first device optimized for both personal and business use. Usable in over 200 countries, it features a one gigahertz processor, candy bar form factor, QWERTY keyboard and Adobe Flash 10.1. To address corporate connectivity and security needs, we have added security features on top of Android OS. This makes our devices more secure and more manageable in using standard Enterprise tools and technologies. As a result, we expect DROID PRO to be very competitive with other devices in the market aimed at business users.
Finally at Verizon, we announced CITRUS, an entry-level pocketable device with an eco-friendly design for first-time smartphone users. At AT&T, we launched three more devices: BRAVO, FLIPSIDE and FLIPOUT. With a variety of screen sizes and form factors and affordable retail price points, these devices give consumers added choice in their smartphone experiences.
Another device that we believe will gain strong consumer acceptance is DEFY. Optimized for active lifestyle, DEFY  is compact, water-resistant, scratch-resistant and dust-proof. It draws on our successes in designing and delivering rugged, durable Mobile Devices. 
In addition to T-Mobile, DEFY is also available in a number of markets outside of U.S. Outside North America, sales growth was driven by a 30% sequential growth in smartphone revenues. In China, our second-largest smartphone market we're one of the leading Android Smartphone suppliers. Unit shipments were up over 70% sequentially. We launched five new Smartphones, including three marketed under our well-known MING brand. MING has been a Motorola brand in China since 2006. It represents devices developed specifically for Chinese consumers that featured distinctive designs, including a signature transparent flip cover. This devices bring our total China Smartphone portfolio to 13%, all released in less than a year.
In Latin America, the Smartphone market is gaining traction as mid- and low-tier devices become available. Unit shipments in the quarter were up over 20% sequentially. Earlier this month, we announced SPICE, an affordable smartphone, which we'll launch initially in Brazil and then expand into other markets. This brings the number of smartphones we have introduced in the region to 10.
In Western Europe, we are making good progress. Sales increased sequentially across a broad range of devices, including the recently launched Milestone 2 and DEFY. The majority of our new devices feature enhanced MOTOBLUR capabilities. Improvements to MOTOBLUR provide consumers with increased control over their mobile experiences, device customization and device management. In addition, with over 3 million users, MOTOBLUR provides us with important feedback for our future product and experience development.
Finally, we added to our portfolio of Bluetooth companion devices that allow consumers to stay productive and hands-free. Device shipping in the fourth quarter feature advanced noise-cancellation technology and include the first device to give consumers the option to respond to text with their voice.
As we look ahead, we will continue to enhance and broaden our smartphone portfolio. With the belief that one size does not fit all, our smartphone focus will continue in three primary areas: First, high-performance smartphones as the leading edge of innovation that deliver the best experiences to consumers who enjoy everything that mobile Internet has to offer, including multimedia, gaming and social collaboration; second, devices with broad appeal that meet the browsing and social messaging needs of consumers who are interested in intuitive, easy-to-use, pocketable devices with affordable data plans; and third, devices that address the rapidly growing opportunity with business users. These consumers want to stay informed and connected in their work life and their personal life and make their own technology choices. 
Increasingly, CIO support giving employees a choice. If giving that choice, we believe a large number of business users will seriously consider an alternative to their current device brand. 
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter on a sequential basis, we expect unit shipments and total sales to be higher. The sequential increase in smartphone shipments will be driven largely by our mid-ranged devices. We expect operating earnings to be higher due to higher sales offset partially by an increase in sales and marketing expenses to support the large number of new product launches. For the year, smartphone shipments are now expected to hit the upper end of our 12 million to 14 million unit range. 
Launching over 20 Smartphone devices and achieving profitability have been major goals for us in the transition of this business. Attaining these milestones has been made possible by a tremendous amount of work by a dedicated team of people here at Motorola. These accomplishments are reflective of the innovation and determination of the Mobile Devices organization. 
Turning now to the results for the Home in the third quarter. Home sales were $912 million, up 3% sequentially. Sales of digital entertainment devices were higher and reflected an improved mix, including higher demand for Mocha enabled set-tops for whole Home digital networks. Sales of video and access infrastructure were up over 30% year-over-year and continue to account for over 25% of total Home sales.
Looking regionally, sales in North America were flat year-on-year. Sales outside of North America were higher and accounted for approximately 25% of total Home sales. We continue to improve profitability, with operating margin increasing to 8.4% from 5% in third quarter of last year. Improvement in the quarter was driven by a more favorable product mix and a reduction in operating costs. 
In Home, our R&D effort continues to be directed towards leveraging our video leadership to deliver solutions that support the trend towards more personalized content and services. This includes digital Home networks, 3D TV, interactive services and converged experiences. That said, with continued macro-environment challenges, we are also focused on prioritizing our current product portfolio and tightly managing the cost structure.
With respect to enhancing the portfolio, during the quarter, we launched the Motorola EDGE software solution. With these applications, operators can more easily manage broadband services in a multi-screen digital Home. They also help operators to reduce operating costs and accelerate revenue-producing services. We also announced a hosted switch to digital video solution. This solution will enable independent video operators to achieve bandwidth efficiencies previously available only to operators with on-site capabilities.
Finally, we supported Verizon with the launch of its multi-screen video service by providing our Medios software suite. This solution facilitates the preparation of content for distribution and enable subscriber to share video mix devices such as set-tops, personal computers and smartphones.
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect Home sales and operating earnings to be sequentially higher. For the full year, despite the top line decline, we continue to expect to deliver higher operating margin compared to 2009.
In closing, Motorola's business has performed very well in the quarter and have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. We also continue to focus on our preparations to create two public companies in the first quarter. Motorola Mobility will be well positioned to address the growing opportunity in Smartphones and converged experiences. And Motorola Solution will be poised to leverage its leadership position in mission-critical and business-critical communication solutions. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dean to start the Q&A.

But to address the substance of your question, we expect to continue a very meaningful relationship with Verizon. We think the DROID franchise is economically very valuable for Verizon, and they will continue to invest and foster the DROID franchise. And as you know, we are a meaningful participant in that franchise. We will also diversify our portfolio within United States with other operators. We are also focused on diversifying our portfolio outside of the United States. As we said, we have seen meaningful increase in our revenue in China, and we expect that we will focus in expanding our presence in China and Latin America, and to a certain extent, in Europe also. We have, as I look into 2011, we have very multiple design wins with a number of operators, both in the United States and elsewhere. And as we look further beyond just the smartphone category, I see opportunities for us in the converged category as we see convergence between computing and mobility. So if you look at all of these factors, I feel that, clearly, in first quarter, there will be some seasonality and there will be competitive pressure as there is in fourth quarter. But we feel comfortable with our position in light of some of the factors that you mentioned.

We believe that providing end-to-end solution to our consumers is going to be important. To address the second part of your question, we see the following ways that we will differentiate. First of all, we will focus on certain key experiences on top of the Android ecosystem. One, you've seen the recent focus on Enterprise experiences. Second, I think you would see us focused a lot more on MOTOBLUR as a service and making sure that we provide end-to-end services from a point of view of personalization, customization, as well as diagnostic support. These devices are getting more and more complex, and our consumers want support to make sure that their devices are working extremely well. So I think that will be very important for us.

But as we see our base expanding, we see more midrange shipments. So I can't, with precision, tell you what our ASP will be, but those are the factors that will drive that. Going forward, in terms of tablets, it's not clear if gingerbread is the right platform for tablets or not. I think that will become clear over a period of time. We are very engaged in the tablet market. And certainly, I think tablets have the possibility, depending on the volume and mix, of driving our ASP higher.

Or if that's not really an issue that would be helpful to understand that. And then, following up with some other questions. When you look at your Q4 guidance, you're now talking about the high end of $12 million to $14 million does that imply a certain number north of $5 million for the fourth quarter? Can you talk about how you get there vis-à-vis your current main customer base? Obviously, the larger is AT&T, but how much more is China going to be in the mix? I believe China right now is somewhere around 12%, 13% of your units. Where does that go in the fourth quarter to get you up almost 1.5 million to 2 million units from Q3? And if you can kind of, again, just talk about at least geographically, if not more specific as to how you get from the 3.7 million now into the 5 million more, where they are coming from so we could feel comfortable that you can actually get there without relying continually on, essentially Verizon and the same guys that you have them? And then, just for Greg, North America seem to have slowed in government to decelerate let's say about 5% year-over-year growth versus I believe it was north of 10% last quarter. Is that just a function of how the seasons work and the ups and downs of the year-over-year, or is there something going on with North America maybe going to the end of the year?

Two things really: One, continued performance of our what we call high-tier performance category products; and then secondly, diversification in the mid-tier at other carriers in United States, but also China and internationally, Latin America and Europe. I think those are the things that will drive it. Generally, as you know, fourth quarter, there's general uplift in sales in our business. There's that effect.

But we were impressed with the capability of their technology. Obviously, their significant footprint and incumbency, and we think it's a great partnership. The interesting part of that, it doesn't -- so we're divesting of the net wireless Networks business, and what you'll see is Motorola Solutions have a very strong position in public safety LTE or private network LTE. So we're developing LTE infrastructure for private networks and for private broadband within our Public Safety group. As we inter-operate or roam onto a carrier network, we will take the e-node B equipment from Ericsson, harden it, provide encryption and software, secure it and provide it as an overall Public Safety solution with the Ericsson-based station embedded in an overall Motorola Solutions architecture and solution to our end-user customer. So we're very optimistic about it. We think it's a very important strategic alliance.

I think your question was with respect to diversification and the timing thereof. I would say that clearly, we have a North American buyers to our sales focus at the moment, and we're looking to diversify both within United States and as well as outside of United States. And you're right, it won't happen instantly. But I think we feel with the diversification, which is already happening and the increased focus on diversifying, combined with our opportunity that exist for us within the convergence of computing and mobility, I think that such competitive pressures as we may see in first quarter, we will be able to cope with that circumstance in a relatively good way. I would actually like to take this opportunity to say one more thing that I see what is happening in Home, and the convergence between ourselves and Home is being very important factor. And in fact, I'd like Dan to just comment on Dan's view on what is happening in Home and the convergence opportunities there.

I think we now have been at this combined Mobile Device and Home for a little over eight months. It's very clear that some of the ideas that led to putting these two businesses together really are becoming much more positive. We see many opportunities for content linkages between the set-top and the mobile device world, sharing content back and forth and our focus on being able to deliver solutions in 2011 that demonstrate that capability. Sanjay touched on the tablet space and our future participation in this space, and that creates another new great opportunity in the converged world. When you think about adding the screen in the Home and the ability to supplement your large viewing screen with a smaller viewing screen simultaneously around content. So collectively, we have energy today focused around expanding that capability that could be provided on the set-top, as well as in the mobile space to enable it. And finally, I just say on the convergence piece, as we look at what MOTOBLUR is doing today and we talked about the EDGE capability from the Home, linking those together and being able to enable us to manage and enhance those capabilities to the consumer and really bring this converged world such that the consumer gets their content on any of their device that they want creates some wonderful opportunities into the future. So you'll start beginning to see in 2011 some converged experiences from us. And then as we move forward more, more opportunity to differentiate our products, both Home, Mobile in this converged world.

I think it's a very competitive good product in the marketplace. HTC continues to deliver good products in the marketplace. On the other hand, I think you're right in characterizing Motorola as the leading, if not, one of the leading handset manufacturers here. I see no reason for us not to get to industry standard profitability and gross margin and profitability over the long period of time. And I see in my guidance, I've always said that this is going to be high single-digit, low double-digit kind of number is where we want to end up in terms of our operating earnings in the long term. But clearly, as I've said in a number of recent comments, I see that the job of transforming this organization is half done. We have some more work to do in terms of becoming a much more software-centric, experience-focused organization. But in one year, we have delivered 22 products. Our focus and execution, our focus and innovation and differentiation is far greater today. And I feel we've very well positioned, not just in the fundamental or transformation that we're making in the organization but the response we're getting to the portfolio in 2011 from our customers. So again, we can -- things that we have a good portfolio. Until our customers accept our products and range our products, we don't have real basis to be optimistic. On the basis of that feedback, on the basis of ranging that we're seeing of our products not just in the United States but elsewhere, I feel pretty comfortable that we're making good progress. And more precisely, I feel that we should definitely get to industry level profitability.

First of all, what I call the performance tier or the high tier of smartphone market today carries the disproportionately high amount of gross margin with it. Because, as you know, off the price points that has been said, $199 and $99, and the lifetime ownership costs of these devices is such that you're biased towards buying a higher-tier in U.S. I actually continue to believe that we will do well, if not extremely well, in that tier. So I think in your question, you'll assume that the competitive pressure is there forced us to diversify in the middle. I don't think it's a matter of one or the other. I think that you will see us do both. You will see us focus very, very much in leading in the performance tier because the halo of performance tier is probably just as important in driving mid tier as anything else, and the performance in North America actually is just as important in driving outside U.S. smartphone sales as anything else. You will see our brand name being relevant in China and Latin America, and we will focus there as a matter of first step. But Europe, I think is a very important marketplace. And the dynamics there, particularly right now, potentially create an opportunity for us to capitalize on. So we will focus on those things. But I think we have not, by the way, guided you to improving OpEx as our sales increase. But I really believe that performance tier is important for us to succeed on as I think you imply in your comments. But the diversification with mid tier is also important because the base of smartphone is increasing and more feature phone consumers are coming to smartphone. And we have to win in both places.

Its market-leading in Mobile Computing and Advanced Data Capture, we'll have a very strong IPR position. And from an organic standpoint, has a solid path of growth, irrespective of some of the headwinds we've had with state and local government budgets, we're still growing.

On a year-over-year basis, overall sales, earnings and total cash are all higher. Additionally, we also continue to make excellent progress on our planned separation.
Our reported sales were $4.9 billion, up nearly 13% over the same period a year ago. This excludes the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by Nokia Siemens Networks, which is classified as discontinued operations. If we were to include sales from discontinued operations, sales would have been $5.8 billion, up 6% over the year-ago quarter. This is the first top line growth quarter for Motorola since the fourth quarter of 2006, and was driven by growth in Mobile Devices, Home and Enterprise Mobility Solutions.
Non-GAAP earnings, including both continuing and discontinued operations were $0.16 a share. This exceeded our guidance of $0.10 to $0.12 per share that we provided on the last earnings call. Ed will comment further on the reporting changes associated with our planned sale to NSN and our third quarter results in a few moments.
In the quarter, Mobile Devices increased smartphone shipments to 3.8 million units and achieved operating profitability on a non-GAAP basis. In Home, sales were up sequentially and operating margin was higher. In EMS, sales grew 9% year-over-year driven by strong demand in the Enterprise markets. Operating margin and cash generation were very strong as well. In Networks, financial performance also continued to be very strong, again, in the third quarter. Solid operating profitability, combined with continued balance sheet management resulted in $502 million of operating cash flow. As a result, total cash at the end of the quarter increased to $9 billion.
During the quarter, we made further progress in our plan to create two independent public companies, which included finalizing various company agreements and completing further updates to Motorola Mobility's Form 10 Registration Statement filed with the SEC. Separation of Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions remains targeted for some time in the first quarter of 2011.

I'll begin today by outlining the changes we have made in our financial reporting. First, financial results related to the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by NSN are now classified as discontinued operations. As such, they are not included in the Motorola reported sales or in earnings from continuing operations. Second, the results of operations for previously disposed businesses, which were deemed to be immaterial at the time of the disposition, have now been reclassified from the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment as discontinued operations. These businesses include an Israel-based wireless network operator, the biometrics business and good technology.
The assets and liabilities of the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by NSN and the assets and liabilities of previously disposed businesses prior to the disposal are now reported assets and liabilities held for sale in the applicable reporting periods. Third, the iDen Infrastructure business and certain licensing activities formally related to the Networks business are now reported as part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. Finally, certain operating costs, which historically have been allocated to Networks are now allocated to EMS segment since the underlying activities will not be transferred to NSN. This is an understanding of these changes on a historical basis a revised presentation in the results of Motorola and EMS segment for 2007 to the first half of 2010 we recently filed in 8-K and can be found on our website. Previously reported segment results for Mobile Devices and Home are unchanged. With that, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter.
Motorola sales from continuing operations were $4.9 billion in the third quarter, up 13% from the third quarter of 2009. As Greg mentioned, inclusive of discontinued operations, third quarter sales would have been $5.8 million, up 6% from the third quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, third quarter total earnings were $0.05 per share. These results include $0.00 per share from continuing operations and $0.05 per share from discontinued operations, which I've described earlier. 
On a non-GAAP basis, total earnings were $0.16 per share, which exceeded our guidance of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. In addition to solid operating results in Mobile Devices, Home and EMS, our strong earnings performance reflected continued CDMA momentum and network favorable to other income and expense results and a lower tax rate.
Non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter totaled $0.12 per share, including piloted items, totaling a net expense of $0.08 per share. This is comprised of expenses associated with restructuring and separation and a non-cash income tax expense related to anticipated capital reductions and certain foreign operations, partially offset by income-related to an IP reserve and stock compensation and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share consistent with prior quarters. 
For continuing operations, non-GAAP earnings were $0.12 per share. This compares to $0.04 per share in the second quarter and $0.01 per share in the year ago quarter. Further details on non-GAAP earnings are included as part of today's press release and available on our website. All remaining financial references will exclude discontinued operations, highlighted items, stock compensation expense and intangible amortization.
Gross margin percentage in the quarter increased to 36.8% from 33.3% in the third quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by improvements in both Mobile Devices and Home. Sequentially, gross margin percentage was up slightly, reflecting margin percentage improvement in each business offset partially by a shift in business mix. Operating expenses in the quarter were flat sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. The increase was driven by investments in sales and marketing to support business growth and new product introductions. Total other income and expense was a lower net expense and anticipated due to lower net interest expense and favorable results associated with foreign currency translation and investments held in the Sigma fund.
With the exclusion of networks and other changes in the geographical mix of income anticipated for the year, we now expect a full year ongoing tax rate of 34% to 35%, down from our previous estimate of 36% to 37%. This change, along with the favorable tax adjustment, resulted an ongoing tax rate in the quarter of 28%. 
Moving now for the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $502 million, including a third consecutive quarter of improving cash flow results in Mobile Devices. Total inventory increased by $280 million sequentially, driven primarily by anticipated fourth quarter demand in Mobile Devices. Inventory turned 9x down, compared to 11 turns in the second quarter and flat with nine turns in the third quarter of last year.
Accounts receivable also increased in the quarter, reflecting a sequential sales growth. Days sales outstanding were 60 days compared to 61 days in the second quarter and 58 days in the year-ago quarter. Total cash at the end of the quarter was $9 billion compared to $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. Net cash at the end of the quarter was $5.6 billion compared to $4.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2009. 
Turning now to our outlook. We expect fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.16 per share. This guidance excludes a portion of the Networks business that is held for sale, stock-based compensation and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share and items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings release. 
With that, I'll pass the call to Greg to discuss Motorola Solutions."

In the EMS, third quarter sales were over $1.9 billion, up 9% compared to the year-ago quarter. Enterprise markets continued to perform well, evidenced again by double-digit sales growth in all four geographic regions. In the government market",874,"Thanks, Ed. In the EMS, third quarter sales were over $1.9 billion, up 9% compared to the year-ago quarter. Enterprise markets continued to perform well, evidenced again by double-digit sales growth in all four geographic regions. In the government market, sales were up slightly against the year-ago quarter. New orders, particularly in the Enterprise remain solid, resulting in an increase in total overall EMS backlog compared to the end of the second quarter. Operating margin was 16.5% compared to 15.9% in the second quarter and 16.9% in the third quarter of last year.
Third quarter sales in North America grew 5% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Enterprise markets, primarily retail. On the government side, sales were higher and orders included major public safety wins with the U.S. Marshals Service, Washington Metro Area Transportation Authority, Nashville-Davidson County Metropolitan Government in Tennessee and the State of Arkansas. Demand for the recently announced ES400 Enterprise Digital Assistant has been strong. The ES400 offers Enterprise grade durability and functionality for business critical applications, and it recently began shipping and will be available globally during the fourth quarter.
In the EMEA, total sales were up 13% in the quarter. Growth continue to be driven by Enterprise markets, including personal shopping and field Mobility Solutions for retail, manufacturing, transportation and logistics customers. Radio solutions sales were also higher due in part to continued analog to digital transition. 
In Asia, sales in the quarter were up 7% compared to a year ago. Enterprise markets and Public Safety continue to perform very well. And finally, yesterday, it was announced that we signed a three-year extension to our iDEN Infrastructure supply agreements with NII, a leading provider of mobile communications for business customers in Latin America. In the quarter, we expanded our mobile computing portfolio with the MC65, a compact, rugged Enterprise mobile computer with integrated GPS and data capture. The MC65 is aimed at improving productivity and task-oriented environments including Field Service, field sales, transportation and Public Safety. 
We also announced MOTOTRBO connect plus, a scalable two-way radio system designed to accommodate high-volume, wide-area communications for mobile work teams. We expanded our APX P25 mission-critical two-way radio series with additional mobiles and portables, including radios designed for extreme situations and single-band users and the first encrypted mission-critical Bluetooth earpiece, enabling secure communications when paired with our APX Portable radios.
Finally, we had the next-generation interoperability solution, which increases the effectiveness of first responders by connecting disparate radio systems and allowing them to operate as one. 
Regarding Public Safety broadband on our last call, we announced that we were awarded the first phase of a 700 megahertz LTE Public Safety network to serve multiple counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. This agreement represents the initial step in deploying a unified state-of-the-art private mission-critical broadband network. As Public Safety systems are expanded to include broadband data, they will need to inter-operate with carrier networks. To this end, we recently signed a significant partnership with Ericsson. In this arrangement, Ericsson will provide LTE-based station equipment to Motorola. We will configure it. We will harden it for Public Safety use, and we will provide the overall broadband network solution architecture for our customers.
With respect to the Networks business in July, we announced that NSN would purchase the majority of our wireless network assets, including CDMA, GSM, WiMAX and LTE. In this transaction, which is expected to close by early 2011, we will receive approximately $1.35 billion in value, including $1.2 billion from NSN and $150 million for retained accounts receivables. In the third quarter, the portion of the Networks business being acquired by NSN accounted for $871 million in sales and $177 million in GAAP earnings. The strong results were again driven primarily by the CDMA business in North America.
Before we move to our outlook for EMS and Networks, I want to provide some background on the EMS cost structure. As Ed mentioned earlier, there are costs associated with certain activities previously allocated to Networks which will not be part of the NSN transaction. These costs are now allocated to EMS. So as we head toward separation, we are identifying and taking the appropriate actions to better align our cost structure for the remaining businesses. These actions may include facility rationalization, discretionary spending reductions and where necessary, staff reductions. We do not expect these actions to impact our critical R&D priorities or our critical customer facing operations.
Regarding our outlook for EMS for the fourth quarter and taking into consideration the impact of our discontinued operations reporting, we expect sales and operating margin to be higher on a sequential basis, and we expect full year sales growth of 7% to 8%, with full year operating margin of approximately 16%. 
For the Networks business classified in discontinued operations, in the fourth quarter, we expect sequentially higher sales, including the higher WiMAX sales and lower CDMA sales. With the change in product mix, we expect operating margin to be lower, resulting in approximately $0.03 per share for discontinued operations. This is not incorporated in the guidance Ed provided earlier of $0.14 to $0.16 per share, which comprises only continuing operations. 
And with that, I'll now pass the call over to Sanjay to discuss Motorola Mobility."
99186,113456460,82846,"Motorola Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Greg, and good morning. Mobile Devices reached a major milestone in the third quarter. We were profitable for the first time in over three and a half years. Our sales surpassed $2 billion and were up 20% year-over-year. Total shipments were 9.1 mi",1454,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning. Mobile Devices reached a major milestone in the third quarter. We were profitable for the first time in over three and a half years. Our sales surpassed $2 billion and were up 20% year-over-year. Total shipments were 9.1 million units, including smartphone shipment of 3.8 million units. Overall, ASP increased to approximately $223 from $207 in the second quarter, driven by smartphones, which continue to account for over half of our total sales. 
In North America, smartphone sales remained strong, led by our family of DROID devices. Devices at other U.S. carriers continue to perform well also. In a recent JD Power survey of smartphone users, Motorola ranked number two in the U.S. in customer satisfaction, recognition of our focus and high-quality consumer experiences. 
Sales outside of North America grew 10% sequentially and accounted for 32% of total sales. Operating profit in the quarter of $3 million compares to a loss of $109 million in the second quarter. The sequential improvement was driven by a higher smartphone unit volume and improved overall gross margin percentage. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined also.
Since our last earnings call, we have added 12 devices to our smartphone portfolio, all of which will be in stores for the holiday season. This brings the number of smartphones we have introduced this year to 22. In North America, DROID X continues to sell extremely well. DROID 2, which features an improved keyboard and faster processor compared to the original DROID also sold well in the quarter. Earlier in the month, we announced DROID PRO, our first device optimized for both personal and business use. Usable in over 200 countries, it features a one gigahertz processor, candy bar form factor, QWERTY keyboard and Adobe Flash 10.1. To address corporate connectivity and security needs, we have added security features on top of Android OS. This makes our devices more secure and more manageable in using standard Enterprise tools and technologies. As a result, we expect DROID PRO to be very competitive with other devices in the market aimed at business users.
Finally at Verizon, we announced CITRUS, an entry-level pocketable device with an eco-friendly design for first-time smartphone users. At AT&T, we launched three more devices: BRAVO, FLIPSIDE and FLIPOUT. With a variety of screen sizes and form factors and affordable retail price points, these devices give consumers added choice in their smartphone experiences.
Another device that we believe will gain strong consumer acceptance is DEFY. Optimized for active lifestyle, DEFY is compact, water-resistant, scratch-resistant and dust-proof. It draws on our successes in designing and delivering rugged, durable Mobile Devices. 
In addition to T-Mobile, DEFY is also available in a number of markets outside of U.S. Outside North America, sales growth was driven by a 30% sequential growth in smartphone revenues. In China, our second-largest smartphone market we're one of the leading Android Smartphone suppliers. Unit shipments were up over 70% sequentially. We launched five new Smartphones, including three marketed under our well-known MING brand. MING has been a Motorola brand in China since 2006. It represents devices developed specifically for Chinese consumers that featured distinctive designs, including a signature transparent flip cover. These devices bring our total China Smartphone portfolio to 13%, all released in less than a year.
In Latin America, the Smartphone market is gaining traction as mid- and low-tier devices become available. Unit shipments in the quarter were up over 20% sequentially. Earlier this month, we announced SPICE, an affordable smartphone, which we'll launch initially in Brazil and then expand into other markets. This brings the number of smartphones we have introduced in the region to 10.
In Western Europe, we are making good progress. Sales increased sequentially across a broad range of devices, including the recently launched Milestone 2 and DEFY. The majority of our new devices feature enhanced MOTOBLUR capabilities. Improvements to MOTOBLUR provide consumers with increased control over their mobile experiences, device customization and device management. In addition, with over 3 million users, MOTOBLUR provides us with important feedback for our future product and experience development.
Finally, we added to our portfolio of Bluetooth companion devices that allow consumers to stay productive and hands-free. Device shipping in the fourth quarter feature advanced noise-cancellation technology and include the first device to give consumers the option to respond to text with their voice.
As we look ahead, we will continue to enhance and broaden our smartphone portfolio. With the belief that one size does not fit all, our smartphone focus will continue in three primary areas: First, high-performance smartphones as the leading edge of innovation that deliver the best experiences to consumers who enjoy everything that mobile Internet has to offer, including multimedia, gaming and social collaboration; second, devices with broad appeal that meet the browsing and social messaging needs of consumers who are interested in intuitive, easy-to-use, pocketable devices with affordable data plans; and third, devices that address the rapidly growing opportunity with business users. These consumers want to stay informed and connected in their work life and their personal life and make their own technology choices. 
Increasingly, CIO support giving employees a choice. If giving that choice, we believe a large number of business users will seriously consider an alternative to their current device brand. 
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter on a sequential basis, we expect unit shipments and total sales to be higher. The sequential increase in smartphone shipments will be driven largely by our mid-ranged devices. We expect operating earnings to be higher due to higher sales offset partially by an increase in sales and marketing expenses to support the large number of new product launches. For the year, smartphone shipments are now expected to hit the upper end of our 12 million to 14 million unit range. 
Launching over 20 Smartphone devices and achieving profitability have been major goals for us in the transition of this business. Attaining these milestones has been made possible by a tremendous amount of work by a dedicated team of people here at Motorola. These accomplishments are reflective of the innovation and determination of the Mobile Devices organization. 
Turning now to the results for the Home in the third quarter. Home sales were $912 million, up 3% sequentially. Sales of digital entertainment devices were higher and reflected an improved mix, including higher demand for Mocha enabled set-tops for whole Home digital networks. Sales of video and access infrastructure were up over 30% year-over-year and continue to account for over 25% of total Home sales.
Looking regionally, sales in North America were flat year-on-year. Sales outside of North America were higher and accounted for approximately 25% of total Home sales. We continue to improve profitability, with operating margin increasing to 8.4% from 5% in third quarter of last year. Improvement in the quarter was driven by a more favorable product mix and a reduction in operating costs. 
In Home, our R&D effort continues to be directed towards leveraging our video leadership to deliver solutions that support the trend towards more personalized content and services. This includes digital Home networks, 3D TV, interactive services and converged experiences. That said, with continued macro-environment challenges, we are also focused on prioritizing our current product portfolio and tightly managing the cost structure.
With respect to enhancing the portfolio, during the quarter, we launched the Motorola EDGE software solution. With these applications, operators can more easily manage broadband services in a multi-screen digital Home. They also help operators to reduce operating costs and accelerate revenue-producing services. We also announced a hosted switch to digital video solution. This solution will enable independent video operators to achieve bandwidth efficiencies previously available only to operators with on-site capabilities.
Finally, we supported Verizon with the launch of its multi-screen video service by providing our Medios software suite. This solution facilitates the preparation of content for distribution and enable subscriber to share video mix devices such as set-tops, personal computers and smartphones.
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect Home sales and operating earnings to be sequentially higher. For the full year, despite the top line decline, we continue to expect to deliver higher operating margin compared to 2009.
In closing, Motorola's business has performed very well in the quarter and have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. We also continue to focus on our preparations to create two public companies in the first quarter. Motorola Mobility will be well positioned to address the growing opportunity in Smartphones and converged experiences. And Motorola Solution will be poised to leverage its leadership position in mission-critical and business-critical communication solutions. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dean to start the Q&A."

But to address the substance of your question, we expect to continue a very meaningful relationship with Verizon. We think the DROID franchise is economically very valuable for Verizon, and they will continue to invest and foster the DROID franchise. And as you know, we are a meaningful participant in that franchise. We will also diversify our portfolio within United States with other operators. We are also focused on diversifying our portfolio outside of the United States. As we said, we have seen meaningful increase in our revenue in China, and we expect that we will focus in expanding our presence in China and Latin America, and to a certain extent, in Europe also. We have, as I look into 2011, we have very multiple design wins with a number of operators, both in the United States and elsewhere. And as we look further beyond just the smartphone category, I see opportunities for us in the converged category as we see convergence between computing and mobility. So if you look at all of these factors, I feel that, clearly, in first quarter, there will be some seasonality and there will be competitive pressure as there is in fourth quarter.

If we assume that there is a decline in the handset units and revenue in Q1, even for this quarter's levels. And then, taking your comment about flat to up sales and marketing in 2011, should we assume that Q1 might go back into the red? Or are there some other variable costs within the business where you can further lower your break-even mark?"

So I will not give you precision, but I understand your question. I'll make the following comments. First of all, my comments with relation to seasonality where for industry seasonality, we have seen over the last few years between 7% and 10% seasonality, and we expect that quarter-on-quarter, from fourth quarter to first quarter, we will see a decline in smartphone sales. As I said earlier, there are some particular competitive situations developing in first quarter. And of course, we have large number of new product introductions, and execution and timing of those launches will be very important for us. But as I look more broadly at our portfolio in 2011, I feel extremely comfortable, extremely comfortable that we are well positioned. I won't guide you with specificity about some of the particular things that you talked about. The only thing I would say is that we have been very diligent about managing our cost structure and optimizing our cost structure as the need has arisen. So we will keep that in mind also."

Can you talk about how you get there vis-à-vis your current main customer base? Obviously, the larger is AT&T, but how much more is China going to be in the mix? I believe China right now is somewhere around 12%, 13% of your units. Where does that go in the fourth quarter to get you up almost 1.5 million to 2 million units from Q3?

As Patrick talked about ending the year, call it at approximately $8.8 billion of cash. That assumes we paid down, and we plan to do that, the $527 million note in November. But I think you're also -- in your calculus there, assuming that we would close Networks in fiscal 2010. And we have guided that, that may occur in early 2011. So that shouldn't be assumed in the calculation of the cash end of your forecast that you're calculating. And having said that, we obviously remain co-Motorola Solutions will be keeping the debt. We'll also have other obligations. We'll have to look at our net cash position as we exit Q4 and go in to next year. I think it's premature to speculate on how we ultimately make decisions with Motorola Solutions in the optimal allocation of capital. But we want to finish the year strong across all of the businesses, which Sanjay and I want to successfully separate the firm sometime in Q1 of 2011. And then in terms of future capital allocation plans and what we would do, we would update you accordingly at that point in time."

And you're right, it won't happen instantly. But I think we feel with the diversification, which is already happening and the increased focus on diversifying, combined with our opportunity that exist for us within the convergence of computing and mobility, I think that such competitive pressures as we may see in first quarter, we will be able to cope with that circumstance in a relatively good way. I would actually like to take this opportunity to say one more thing that I see what is happening in Home, and the convergence between ourselves and Home as being a very important factor. And in fact, I'd like Dan to just comment on Dan's view on what is happening in Home and the convergence opportunities there."

We see many opportunities for content linkages between the set-top and the mobile device world, sharing content back and forth and are focused on being able to deliver solutions in 2011 that demonstrate that capability. Sanjay touched on the tablet space and our future participation in this space, and that creates another new great opportunity in the converged world. When you think about adding the screen in the Home and the ability to supplement your large viewing screen with a smaller viewing screen simultaneously around content. So collectively, we have energy today focused around expanding that capability that could be provided on the set-top, as well as in the mobile space to enable it. And finally, I just say on the convergence piece, as we look at what MOTOBLUR is doing today and we talked about the EDGE capability from the Home, linking those together and being able to enable us to manage and enhance those capabilities to the consumer and really bring this converged world such that the consumer gets their content on any of their device that they want creates some wonderful opportunities into the future.

On the other hand, I think you're right in characterizing Motorola as the leading, if not, one of the leading handset manufacturers here. I see no reason for us not to get to industry standard profitability and gross margin and profitability over the long period of time. And I see in my guidance, I've always said that this is going to be high single-digit, low double-digit kind of number is where we want to end up in terms of our operating earnings in the long term. But clearly, as I've said in a number of recent comments, I see that the job of transforming this organization is half done. We have some more work to do in terms of becoming a much more software-centric, experience-focused organization. But in one year, we have delivered 22 products. Our focus and execution, our focus and innovation and differentiation is far greater today. And I feel we've very well positioned, not just in the fundamental or transformation that we're making in the organization but the response we're getting to the portfolio in 2011 from our customers. So again, we can think that we have a good portfolio, until our customers accept our products and range our products, we don't have real basis to be optimistic. On the basis of that feedback, on the basis of ranging that we're seeing of our products not just in the United States but elsewhere, I feel pretty comfortable that we're making good progress. And more precisely, I feel that we should definitely get to industry level profitability."

First of all, what I call the performance tier or the high tier of smartphone market today carries the disproportionately high amount of gross margin with it. Because, as you know, off the price points that has been said, $199 and $99, and the lifetime ownership costs of these devices is such that you're biased towards buying a higher-tier in U.S. I actually continue to believe that we will do well, if not extremely well, in that tier. So I think in your question, you'll assume that the competitive pressure is there forced us to diversify in the middle. I don't think it's a matter of one or the other. I think that you will see us do both. You will see us focus very, very much in leading in the performance tier because the halo of performance tier is probably just as important in driving mid tier as anything else, and the performance in North America actually is just as important in driving outside U.S. smartphone sales as anything else. You will see our brand name being relevant in China and Latin America, and we will focus there as a matter of first step. But Europe, I think is a very important marketplace. And the dynamics there, particularly right now, potentially create an opportunity for us to capitalize on. So we will focus on those things. But I think we have not, by the way, guided you to improving OpEx as our sales increase. But I really believe that performance tier is important for us to succeed on as I think you imply in your comments. But the diversification with mid tier is also important because the base of smartphone is increasing and more feature phone consumers are coming to smartphone. And we have to win in both places."

On a year-over-year basis, overall sales, earnings and total cash are all higher. Additionally, we also continue to make excellent progress on our planned separation.
Our reported sales were $4.9 billion, up nearly 13% over the same period a year ago. This excludes the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by Nokia Siemens Networks, which is classified as discontinued operations. If we were to include sales from discontinued operations, sales would have been $5.8 billion, up 6% over the year-ago quarter. This is the first top line growth quarter for Motorola since the fourth quarter of 2006, and was driven by growth in Mobile Devices, Home and Enterprise Mobility Solutions.
Non-GAAP earnings, including both continuing and discontinued operations were $0.16 a share. This exceeded our guidance of $0.10 to $0.12 per share that we provided on the last earnings call. Ed will comment further on the reporting changes associated with our planned sale to NSN and our third quarter results in a few moments.
In the quarter, Mobile Devices increased smartphone shipments to 3.8 million units and achieved operating profitability on a non-GAAP basis. In Home, sales were up sequentially and operating margin was higher. In EMS, sales grew 9% year-over-year driven by strong demand in the Enterprise markets. Operating margin and cash generation were very strong as well. In Networks, financial performance also continued to be very strong, again, in the third quarter. Solid operating profitability, combined with continued balance sheet management resulted in $502 million of operating cash flow. As a result, total cash at the end of the quarter increased to $9 billion.
During the quarter, we made further progress in our plan to create two independent public companies, which included finalizing various company agreements and completing further updates to Motorola Mobility's Form 10 Registration Statement filed with the SEC. Separation of Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions remains targeted for some time in the first quarter of 2011. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide additional details on the financial results for the quarter. I'll then come back to review Motorola Solutions and then Sanjay will discuss Motorola Mobility. Ed?"

I'll begin today by outlining the changes we have made in our financial reporting. First, financial results related to the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by NSN are now classified as discontinued operations. As such, they are not included in the Motorola reported sales or in earnings from continuing operations. Second, the results of operations for previously disposed businesses, which were deemed to be immaterial at the time of the disposition, have now been reclassified from the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment as discontinued operations. These businesses include an Israel-based wireless network operator, the biometrics business and good technology.
The assets and liabilities of the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by NSN and the assets and liabilities of previously disposed businesses prior to the disposal are now reported assets and liabilities held for sale in the applicable reporting periods. Third, the iDen Infrastructure business and certain licensing activities formally related to the Networks business are now reported as part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. Finally, certain operating costs, which historically have been allocated to Networks are now allocated to EMS segment since the underlying activities will not be transferred to NSN. This is an understanding of these changes on a historical basis a revised presentation in the results of Motorola and EMS segment for 2007 to the first half of 2010 we recently filed in 8-K and can be found on our website. Previously reported segment results for Mobile Devices and Home are unchanged. With that, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter.
Motorola sales from continuing operations were $4.9 billion in the third quarter, up 13% from the third quarter of 2009. As Greg mentioned, inclusive of discontinued operations, third quarter sales would have been $5.8 million, up 6% from the third quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, third quarter total earnings were $0.05 per share. These results include $0.00 per share from continuing operations and $0.05 per share from discontinued operations, which I've described earlier. 
On a non-GAAP basis, total earnings were $0.16 per share, which exceeded our guidance of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. In addition to solid operating results in Mobile Devices, Home and EMS, our strong earnings performance reflected continued CDMA momentum and network favorable to other income and expense results and a lower tax rate.
Non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter totaled $0.12 per share, including piloted items, totaling a net expense of $0.08 per share. This is comprised of expenses associated with restructuring and separation and a non-cash income tax expense related to anticipated capital reductions and certain foreign operations, partially offset by income-related to an IP reserve and stock compensation and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share consistent with prior quarters. 
For continuing operations, non-GAAP earnings were $0.12 per share. This compares to $0.04 per share in the second quarter and $0.01 per share in the year ago quarter. Further details on non-GAAP earnings are included as part of today's press release and available on our website. All remaining financial references will exclude discontinued operations, highlighted items, stock compensation expense and intangible amortization.
Gross margin percentage in the quarter increased to 36.8% from 33.3% in the third quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by improvements in both Mobile Devices and Home. Sequentially, gross margin percentage was up slightly, reflecting margin percentage improvement in each business offset partially by a shift in business mix. Operating expenses in the quarter were flat sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. The increase was driven by investments in sales and marketing to support business growth and new product introductions. Total other income and expense was a lower net expense and anticipated due to lower net interest expense and favorable results associated with foreign currency translation and investments held in the Sigma fund.
With the exclusion of networks and other changes in the geographical mix of income anticipated for the year, we now expect a full year ongoing tax rate of 34% to 35%, down from our previous estimate of 36% to 37%. This change, along with the favorable tax adjustment, resulted an ongoing tax rate in the quarter of 28%. 
Moving now for the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $502 million, including a third consecutive quarter of improving cash flow results in Mobile Devices. Total inventory increased by $280 million sequentially, driven primarily by anticipated fourth quarter demand in Mobile Devices. Inventory turned 9x down, compared to 11 turns in the second quarter and flat with nine turns in the third quarter of last year.
Accounts receivable also increased in the quarter, reflecting a sequential sales growth. Days sales outstanding were 60 days compared to 61 days in the second quarter and 58 days in the year-ago quarter. Total cash at the end of the quarter was $9 billion compared to $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. Net cash at the end of the quarter was $5.6 billion compared to $4.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2009. 
Turning now to our outlook. We expect fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.16 per share. This guidance excludes a portion of the Networks business that is held for sale, stock-based compensation and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share and items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings release. 
With that, I'll pass the call to Greg to discuss Motorola Solutions."

In the EMS, third quarter sales were over $1.9 billion, up 9% compared to the year-ago quarter. Enterprise markets continued to perform well, evidenced again by double-digit sales growth in all four geographic regions. In the government market",874,"Thanks, Ed. In the EMS, third quarter sales were over $1.9 billion, up 9% compared to the year-ago quarter. Enterprise markets continued to perform well, evidenced again by double-digit sales growth in all four geographic regions. In the government market, sales were up slightly against the year-ago quarter. New orders, particularly in the Enterprise remain solid, resulting in an increase in total overall EMS backlog compared to the end of the second quarter. Operating margin was 16.5% compared to 15.9% in the second quarter and 16.9% in the third quarter of last year.
Third quarter sales in North America grew 5% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Enterprise markets, primarily retail. On the government side, sales were higher and orders included major public safety wins with the U.S. Marshals Service, Washington Metro Area Transportation Authority, Nashville-Davidson County Metropolitan Government in Tennessee and the State of Arkansas. Demand for the recently announced ES400 Enterprise Digital Assistant has been strong. The ES400 offers Enterprise grade durability and functionality for business critical applications, and it recently began shipping and will be available globally during the fourth quarter.
In the EMEA, total sales were up 13% in the quarter. Growth continue to be driven by Enterprise markets, including personal shopping and field Mobility Solutions for retail, manufacturing, transportation and logistics customers. Radio solutions sales were also higher due in part to continued analog to digital transition. 
In Asia, sales in the quarter were up 7% compared to a year ago. Enterprise markets and Public Safety continue to perform very well. And finally, yesterday, it was announced that we signed a three-year extension to our iDEN Infrastructure supply agreements with NII, a leading provider of mobile communications for business customers in Latin America. In the quarter, we expanded our mobile computing portfolio with the MC65, a compact, rugged Enterprise mobile computer with integrated GPS and data capture. The MC65 is aimed at improving productivity and task-oriented environments including Field Service, field sales, transportation and Public Safety. 
We also announced MOTOTRBO connect plus, a scalable two-way radio system designed to accommodate high-volume, wide-area communications for mobile work teams. We expanded our APX P25 mission-critical two-way radio series with additional mobiles and portables, including radios designed for extreme situations and single-band users and the first encrypted mission-critical Bluetooth earpiece, enabling secure communications when paired with our APX Portable radios.
Finally, we had the next-generation interoperability solution, which increases the effectiveness of first responders by connecting disparate radio systems and allowing them to operate as one. 
Regarding Public Safety broadband on our last call, we announced that we were awarded the first phase of a 700 megahertz LTE Public Safety network to serve multiple counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. This agreement represents the initial step in deploying a unified state-of-the-art private mission-critical broadband network. As Public Safety systems are expanded to include broadband data, they will need to inter-operate with carrier networks. To this end, we recently signed a significant partnership with Ericsson. In this arrangement, Ericsson will provide LTE-based station equipment to Motorola. We will configure it. We will harden it for Public Safety use, and we will provide the overall broadband network solution architecture for our customers.
With respect to the Networks business in July, we announced that NSN would purchase the majority of our wireless network assets, including CDMA, GSM, WiMAX and LTE. In this transaction, which is expected to close by early 2011, we will receive approximately $1.35 billion in value, including $1.2 billion from NSN and $150 million for retained accounts receivables. In the third quarter, the portion of the Networks business being acquired by NSN accounted for $871 million in sales and $177 million in GAAP earnings. The strong results were again driven primarily by the CDMA business in North America.
Before we move to our outlook for EMS and Networks, I want to provide some background on the EMS cost structure. As Ed mentioned earlier, there are costs associated with certain activities previously allocated to Networks which will not be part of the NSN transaction. These costs are now allocated to EMS. So as we head toward separation, we are identifying and taking the appropriate actions to better align our cost structure for the remaining businesses. These actions may include facility rationalization, discretionary spending reductions and where necessary, staff reductions. We do not expect these actions to impact our critical R&D priorities or our critical customer facing operations.
Regarding our outlook for EMS for the fourth quarter and taking into consideration the impact of our discontinued operations reporting, we expect sales and operating margin to be higher on a sequential basis, and we expect full year sales growth of 7% to 8%, with full year operating margin of approximately 16%. 
For the Networks business classified in discontinued operations, in the fourth quarter, we expect sequentially higher sales, including the higher WiMAX sales and lower CDMA sales. With the change in product mix, we expect operating margin to be lower, resulting in approximately $0.03 per share for discontinued operations. This is not incorporated in the guidance Ed provided earlier of $0.14 to $0.16 per share, which comprises only continuing operations. 
And with that, I'll now pass the call over to Sanjay to discuss Motorola Mobility."
99186,113456460,83159,"Motorola Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Greg, and good morning. Mobile Devices reached a major milestone in the third quarter. We were profitable for the first time in over three and a half years. Our sales surpassed $2 billion and were up 20% year-over-year. Total shipments were 9.1 mi",1454,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning. Mobile Devices reached a major milestone in the third quarter. We were profitable for the first time in over three and a half years. Our sales surpassed $2 billion and were up 20% year-over-year. Total shipments were 9.1 million units, including smartphone shipment of 3.8 million units. Overall, ASP increased to approximately $223 from $207 in the second quarter, driven by smartphones, which continue to account for over half of our total sales. 
In North America, smartphone sales remained strong, led by our family of DROID devices. Devices at other U.S. carriers continue to perform well also. In a recent JD Power survey of smartphone users, Motorola ranked number two in the U.S. in customer satisfaction, recognition of our focus and high-quality consumer experiences. 
Sales outside of North America grew 10% sequentially and accounted for 32% of total sales. Operating profit in the quarter of $3 million compares to a loss of $109 million in the second quarter. The sequential improvement was driven by a higher smartphone unit volume and improved overall gross margin percentage. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined also.
Since our last earnings call, we have added 12 devices to our smartphone portfolio, all of which will be in stores for the holiday season. This brings the number of smartphones we have introduced this year to 22. In North America, DROID X continues to sell extremely well. DROID 2, which features an improved keyboard and faster processor compared to the original DROID also sold well in the quarter. Earlier in the month, we announced DROID PRO, our first device optimized for both personal and business use. Usable in over 200 countries, it features a one gigahertz processor, candy bar form factor, QWERTY keyboard and Adobe Flash 10.1. To address corporate connectivity and security needs, we have added security features on top of Android OS. This makes our devices more secure and more manageable in using standard Enterprise tools and technologies. As a result, we expect DROID PRO to be very competitive with other devices in the market aimed at business users.
Finally at Verizon, we announced CITRUS, an entry-level pocketable device with an eco-friendly design for first-time smartphone users. At AT&T, we launched three more devices: BRAVO, FLIPSIDE and FLIPOUT. With a variety of screen sizes and form factors and affordable retail price points, these devices give consumers added choice in their smartphone experiences.
Another device that we believe will gain strong consumer acceptance is DEFY. Optimized for active lifestyle, DEFY is compact, water-resistant, scratch-resistant and dust-proof. It draws on our successes in designing and delivering rugged, durable Mobile Devices. 
In addition to T-Mobile, DEFY is also available in a number of markets outside of U.S. Outside North America, sales growth was driven by a 30% sequential growth in smartphone revenues. In China, our second-largest smartphone market we're one of the leading Android Smartphone suppliers. Unit shipments were up over 70% sequentially. We launched five new Smartphones, including three marketed under our well-known MING brand. MING has been a Motorola brand in China since 2006. It represents devices developed specifically for Chinese consumers that featured distinctive designs, including a signature transparent flip cover. These devices bring our total China Smartphone portfolio to 13%, all released in less than a year.
In Latin America, the Smartphone market is gaining traction as mid- and low-tier devices become available. Unit shipments in the quarter were up over 20% sequentially. Earlier this month, we announced SPICE, an affordable smartphone, which we'll launch initially in Brazil and then expand into other markets. This brings the number of smartphones we have introduced in the region to 10.
In Western Europe, we are making good progress. Sales increased sequentially across a broad range of devices, including the recently launched Milestone 2 and DEFY. The majority of our new devices feature enhanced MOTOBLUR capabilities. Improvements to MOTOBLUR provide consumers with increased control over their mobile experiences, device customization and device management. In addition, with over 3 million users, MOTOBLUR provides us with important feedback for our future product and experience development.
Finally, we added to our portfolio of Bluetooth companion devices that allow consumers to stay productive and hands-free. Device shipping in the fourth quarter feature advanced noise-cancellation technology and include the first device to give consumers the option to respond to text with their voice.
As we look ahead, we will continue to enhance and broaden our smartphone portfolio. With the belief that one size does not fit all, our smartphone focus will continue in three primary areas: First, high-performance smartphones as the leading edge of innovation that deliver the best experiences to consumers who enjoy everything that mobile Internet has to offer, including multimedia, gaming and social collaboration; second, devices with broad appeal that meet the browsing and social messaging needs of consumers who are interested in intuitive, easy-to-use, pocketable devices with affordable data plans; and third, devices that address the rapidly growing opportunity with business users. These consumers want to stay informed and connected in their work life and their personal life and make their own technology choices. 
Increasingly, CIO support giving employees a choice. If giving that choice, we believe a large number of business users will seriously consider an alternative to their current device brand. 
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter on a sequential basis, we expect unit shipments and total sales to be higher. The sequential increase in smartphone shipments will be driven largely by our mid-ranged devices. We expect operating earnings to be higher due to higher sales offset partially by an increase in sales and marketing expenses to support the large number of new product launches. For the year, smartphone shipments are now expected to hit the upper end of our 12 million to 14 million unit range. 
Launching over 20 Smartphone devices and achieving profitability have been major goals for us in the transition of this business. Attaining these milestones has been made possible by a tremendous amount of work by a dedicated team of people here at Motorola. These accomplishments are reflective of the innovation and determination of the Mobile Devices organization. 
Turning now to the results for the Home in the third quarter. Home sales were $912 million, up 3% sequentially. Sales of digital entertainment devices were higher and reflected an improved mix, including higher demand for Mocha enabled set-tops for whole Home digital networks. Sales of video and access infrastructure were up over 30% year-over-year and continue to account for over 25% of total Home sales.
Looking regionally, sales in North America were flat year-on-year. Sales outside of North America were higher and accounted for approximately 25% of total Home sales. We continue to improve profitability, with operating margin increasing to 8.4% from 5% in third quarter of last year. Improvement in the quarter was driven by a more favorable product mix and a reduction in operating costs. 
In Home, our R&D effort continues to be directed towards leveraging our video leadership to deliver solutions that support the trend towards more personalized content and services. This includes digital Home networks, 3D TV, interactive services and converged experiences. That said, with continued macro-environment challenges, we are also focused on prioritizing our current product portfolio and tightly managing the cost structure.
With respect to enhancing the portfolio, during the quarter, we launched the Motorola EDGE software solution. With these applications, operators can more easily manage broadband services in a multi-screen digital Home. They also help operators to reduce operating costs and accelerate revenue-producing services. We also announced a hosted switch to digital video solution. This solution will enable independent video operators to achieve bandwidth efficiencies previously available only to operators with on-site capabilities.
Finally, we supported Verizon with the launch of its multi-screen video service by providing our Medios software suite. This solution facilitates the preparation of content for distribution and enable subscriber to share video mix devices such as set-tops, personal computers and smartphones.
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect Home sales and operating earnings to be sequentially higher. For the full year, despite the top line decline, we continue to expect to deliver higher operating margin compared to 2009.
In closing, Motorola's business has performed very well in the quarter and have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. We also continue to focus on our preparations to create two public companies in the first quarter. Motorola Mobility will be well positioned to address the growing opportunity in Smartphones and converged experiences. And Motorola Solution will be poised to leverage its leadership position in mission-critical and business-critical communication solutions. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dean to start the Q&A."

But to address the substance of your question, we expect to continue a very meaningful relationship with Verizon. We think the DROID franchise is economically very valuable for Verizon, and they will continue to invest and foster the DROID franchise. And as you know, we are a meaningful participant in that franchise. We will also diversify our portfolio within United States with other operators. We are also focused on diversifying our portfolio outside of the United States. As we said, we have seen meaningful increase in our revenue in China, and we expect that we will focus in expanding our presence in China and Latin America, and to a certain extent, in Europe also. We have, as I look into 2011, we have very multiple design wins with a number of operators, both in the United States and elsewhere. And as we look further beyond just the smartphone category, I see opportunities for us in the converged category as we see convergence between computing and mobility.

You would see going forward in fourth quarter, we will have DEFY and Milestone 2 in particular in a number of countries with a number of operators in Europe. So we are making progress in Europe, even in fourth quarter of this year. In 2011, I think we will have opportunities to expand our presence. But the central question facing us is will we make a substantial investment to make a big re-entry into European market? And I frankly can't tell you the answer today. We always have to make the calculation of whether those dollars are better spent in the U.S., China, Latin America or Europe. We will make that determination as our relationship, continued improvement in our relationship happens in Europe. But second half 2011 is the earliest that I can anticipate making that decision, but we've not made that decision yet."

First of all, my comments with relation to seasonality where for industry seasonality, we have seen over the last few years between 7% and 10% seasonality, and we expect that quarter-on-quarter, from fourth quarter to first quarter, we will see a decline in smartphone sales. As I said earlier, there are some particular competitive situations developing in first quarter. And of course, we have large number of new product introductions, and execution and timing of those launches will be very important for us. But as I look more broadly at our portfolio in 2011, I feel extremely comfortable, extremely comfortable that we are well positioned. I won't guide you with specificity about some of the particular things that you talked about.

Can you talk about how you get there vis-à-vis your current main customer base? Obviously, the larger is AT&T, but how much more is China going to be in the mix?

But I think you're also -- in your calculus there, assuming that we would close Networks in fiscal 2010. And we have guided that, that may occur in early 2011. So that shouldn't be assumed in the calculation of the cash end of your forecast that you're calculating. And having said that, we obviously remain co-Motorola Solutions will be keeping the debt. We'll also have other obligations. We'll have to look at our net cash position as we exit Q4 and go in to next year. I think it's premature to speculate on how we ultimately make decisions with Motorola Solutions in the optimal allocation of capital. But we want to finish the year strong across all of the businesses, which Sanjay and I want to successfully separate the firm sometime in Q1 of 2011. And then in terms of future capital allocation plans and what we would do, we would update you accordingly at that point in time."

But I think we feel with the diversification, which is already happening and the increased focus on diversifying, combined with our opportunity that exist for us within the convergence of computing and mobility, I think that such competitive pressures as we may see in first quarter, we will be able to cope with that circumstance in a relatively good way. I would actually like to take this opportunity to say one more thing that I see what is happening in Home, and the convergence between ourselves and Home as being a very important factor.

We see many opportunities for content linkages between the set-top and the mobile device world, sharing content back and forth and are focused on being able to deliver solutions in 2011 that demonstrate that capability. Sanjay touched on the tablet space and our future participation in this space, and that creates another new great opportunity in the converged world. When you think about adding the screen in the Home and the ability to supplement your large viewing screen with a smaller viewing screen simultaneously around content. So collectively, we have energy today focused around expanding that capability that could be provided on the set-top, as well as in the mobile space to enable it. And finally, I just say on the convergence piece, as we look at what MOTOBLUR is doing today and we talked about the EDGE capability from the Home, linking those together and being able to enable us to manage and enhance those capabilities to the consumer and really bring this converged world such that the consumer gets their content on any of their device that they want creates some wonderful opportunities into the future.

On the other hand, I think you're right in characterizing Motorola as the leading, if not, one of the leading handset manufacturers here. I see no reason for us not to get to industry standard profitability and gross margin and profitability over the long period of time. And I see in my guidance, I've always said that this is going to be high single-digit, low double-digit kind of number is where we want to end up in terms of our operating earnings in the long term. But clearly, as I've said in a number of recent comments, I see that the job of transforming this organization is half done. We have some more work to do in terms of becoming a much more software-centric, experience-focused organization. But in one year, we have delivered 22 products. Our focus and execution, our focus and innovation and differentiation is far greater today. And I feel we've very well positioned, not just in the fundamental or transformation that we're making in the organization but the response we're getting to the portfolio in 2011 from our customers. So again, we can think that we have a good portfolio, until our customers accept our products and range our products, we don't have real basis to be optimistic. On the basis of that feedback, on the basis of ranging that we're seeing of our products not just in the United States but elsewhere, I feel pretty comfortable that we're making good progress. And more precisely, I feel that we should definitely get to industry level profitability."

First of all, what I call the performance tier or the high tier of smartphone market today carries the disproportionately high amount of gross margin with it. Because, as you know, off the price points that has been said, $199 and $99, and the lifetime ownership costs of these devices is such that you're biased towards buying a higher-tier in U.S. I actually continue to believe that we will do well, if not extremely well, in that tier. So I think in your question, you'll assume that the competitive pressure is there forced us to diversify in the middle. I don't think it's a matter of one or the other. I think that you will see us do both. You will see us focus very, very much in leading in the performance tier because the halo of performance tier is probably just as important in driving mid tier as anything else, and the performance in North America actually is just as important in driving outside U.S. smartphone sales as anything else. You will see our brand name being relevant in China and Latin America, and we will focus there as a matter of first step. But Europe, I think is a very important marketplace. And the dynamics there, particularly right now, potentially create an opportunity for us to capitalize on. So we will focus on those things. But I think we have not, by the way, guided you to improving OpEx as our sales increase. But I really believe that performance tier is important for us to succeed on as I think you imply in your comments. But the diversification with mid tier is also important because the base of smartphone is increasing and more feature phone consumers are coming to smartphone. And we have to win in both places."

On a year-over-year basis, overall sales, earnings and total cash are all higher. Additionally, we also continue to make excellent progress on our planned separation.
 Our reported sales were $4.9 billion, up nearly 13% over the same period a year ago. This excludes the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by Nokia Siemens Networks, which is classified as discontinued operations. If we were to include sales from discontinued operations, sales would have been $5.8 billion, up 6% over the year-ago quarter. This is the first top line growth quarter for Motorola since the fourth quarter of 2006, and was driven by growth in Mobile Devices, Home and Enterprise Mobility Solutions.
 Non-GAAP earnings, including both continuing and discontinued operations were $0.16 a share. This exceeded our guidance of $0.10 to $0.12 per share that we provided on the last earnings call. Ed will comment further on the reporting changes associated with our planned sale to NSN and our third quarter results in a few moments.
 In the quarter, Mobile Devices increased smartphone shipments to 3.8 million units and achieved operating profitability on a non-GAAP basis. In Home, sales were up sequentially and operating margin was higher. In EMS, sales grew 9% year-over-year driven by strong demand in the Enterprise markets. Operating margin and cash generation were very strong as well. In Networks, financial performance also continued to be very strong, again, in the third quarter. Solid operating profitability, combined with continued balance sheet management resulted in $502 million of operating cash flow. As a result, total cash at the end of the quarter increased to $9 billion.
 During the quarter, we made further progress in our plan to create two independent public companies, which included finalizing various company agreements and completing further updates to Motorola Mobility's Form 10 Registration Statement filed with the SEC. Separation of Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions remains targeted for some time in the first quarter of 2011.
 I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide additional details on the financial results for the quarter. I'll then come back to review Motorola Solutions and then Sanjay will discuss Motorola Mobility. Ed?

I'll begin today by outlining the changes we have made in our financial reporting.

I'll begin today by outlining the changes we have made in our financial reporting. First, financial results related to the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by NSN are now classified as discontinued operations. As such, they are not included in the Motorola reported sales or in earnings from continuing operations. Second, the results of operations for previously disposed businesses, which were deemed to be immaterial at the time of the disposition, have now been reclassified from the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment as discontinued operations. These businesses include an Israel-based wireless network operator, the biometrics business and good technology.
 The assets and liabilities of the portion of the Networks business to be acquired by NSN and the assets and liabilities of previously disposed businesses prior to the disposal are now reported assets and liabilities held for sale in the applicable reporting periods. Third, the iDen Infrastructure business and certain licensing activities formally related to the Networks business are now reported as part of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions segment. Finally, certain operating costs, which historically have been allocated to Networks are now allocated to EMS segment since the underlying activities will not be transferred to NSN. This is an understanding of these changes on a historical basis a revised presentation in the results of Motorola and EMS segment for 2007 to the first half of 2010 we recently filed in 8-K and can be found on our website. Previously reported segment results for Mobile Devices and Home are unchanged. With that, I'll turn to our financial results for the quarter.
 Motorola sales from continuing operations were $4.9 billion in the third quarter, up 13% from the third quarter of 2009. As Greg mentioned, inclusive of discontinued operations, third quarter sales would have been $5.8 million, up 6% from the third quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, third quarter total earnings were $0.05 per share. These results include $0.00 per share from continuing operations and $0.05 per share from discontinued operations, which I've described earlier.
 On a non-GAAP basis, total earnings were $0.16 per share, which exceeded our guidance of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. In addition to solid operating results in Mobile Devices, Home and EMS, our strong earnings performance reflected continued CDMA momentum and network favorable to other income and expense results and a lower tax rate.
 Non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter totaled $0.12 per share, including piloted items, totaling a net expense of $0.08 per share. This is comprised of expenses associated with restructuring and separation and a non-cash income tax expense related to anticipated capital reductions and certain foreign operations, partially offset by income-related to an IP reserve and stock compensation and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share consistent with prior quarters.
 For continuing operations, non-GAAP earnings were $0.12 per share. This compares to $0.04 per share in the second quarter and $0.01 per share in the year ago quarter. Further details on non-GAAP earnings are included as part of today's press release and available on our website. All remaining financial references will exclude discontinued operations, highlighted items, stock compensation expense and intangible amortization.
 Gross margin percentage in the quarter increased to 36.8% from 33.3% in the third quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by improvements in both Mobile Devices and Home. Sequentially, gross margin percentage was up slightly, reflecting margin percentage improvement in each business offset partially by a shift in business mix. Operating expenses in the quarter were flat sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. The increase was driven by investments in sales and marketing to support business growth and new product introductions. Total other income and expense was a lower net expense and anticipated due to lower net interest expense and favorable results associated with foreign currency translation and investments held in the Sigma fund.
 With the exclusion of networks and other changes in the geographical mix of income anticipated for the year, we now expect a full year ongoing tax rate of 34% to 35%, down from our previous estimate of 36% to 37%. This change, along with the favorable tax adjustment, resulted an ongoing tax rate in the quarter of 28%.
 Moving now for the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $502 million, including a third consecutive quarter of improving cash flow results in Mobile Devices. Total inventory increased by $280 million sequentially, driven primarily by anticipated fourth quarter demand in Mobile Devices. Inventory turned 9x down, compared to 11 turns in the second quarter and flat with nine turns in the third quarter of last year.
 Accounts receivable also increased in the quarter, reflecting a sequential sales growth. Days sales outstanding were 60 days compared to 61 days in the second quarter and 58 days in the year-ago quarter. Total cash at the end of the quarter was $9 billion compared to $8.3 billion at the end of the second quarter. Net cash at the end of the quarter was $5.6 billion compared to $4.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2009.
 Turning now to our outlook. We expect fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.16 per share. This guidance excludes a portion of the Networks business that is held for sale, stock-based compensation and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share and items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings release.
 With that, I'll pass the call to Greg to discuss Motorola Solutions.

In the EMS, third quarter sales were over $1.9  billion, up 9% compared to the year-ago quarter. Enterprise markets continued to perform well, evidenced again by double-digit sales growth in all four geographic regions. In the government mark",874," Thanks, Ed. In the EMS, third quarter sales were over $1.9  billion, up 9% compared to the year-ago quarter. Enterprise markets continued to perform well, evidenced again by double-digit sales growth in all four geographic regions. In the government market, sales were up slightly against the year-ago quarter. New orders, particularly in the Enterprise remain solid, resulting in an increase in total overall EMS backlog compared to the end of the second quarter. Operating margin was 16.5% compared to 15.9% in the second quarter and 16.9% in the third quarter of last year.
 Third quarter sales in North America grew 5% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Enterprise markets, primarily retail. On the government side, sales were higher and orders included major public safety wins with the U.S. Marshals Service, Washington Metro Area Transportation Authority, Nashville-Davidson County Metropolitan Government in Tennessee and the State of Arkansas. Demand for the recently announced ES400 Enterprise Digital Assistant has been strong. The ES400 offers Enterprise grade durability and functionality for business critical applications, and it recently began shipping and will be available globally during the fourth quarter.
 In the EMEA, total sales were up 13% in the quarter. Growth continue to be driven by Enterprise markets, including personal shopping and field Mobility Solutions for retail, manufacturing, transportation and logistics customers. Radio solutions sales were also higher due in part to continued analog to digital transition.
 In Asia, sales in the quarter were up 7% compared to a year ago. Enterprise markets and Public Safety continue to perform very well. And finally, yesterday, it was announced that we signed a three-year extension to our iDEN Infrastructure supply agreements with NII, a leading provider of mobile communications for business customers in Latin America. In the quarter, we expanded our mobile computing portfolio with the MC65, a compact, rugged Enterprise mobile computer with integrated GPS and data capture. The MC65 is aimed at improving productivity and task-oriented environments including Field Service, field sales, transportation and Public Safety.
 We also announced MOTOTRBO connect plus, a scalable two-way radio system designed to accommodate high-volume, wide-area communications for mobile work teams. We expanded our APX P25 mission-critical two-way radio series with additional mobiles and portables, including radios designed for extreme situations and single-band users and the first encrypted mission-critical Bluetooth earpiece, enabling secure communications when paired with our APX Portable radios.
 Finally, we had the next-generation interoperability solution, which increases the effectiveness of first responders by connecting disparate radio systems and allowing them to operate as one.
 Regarding Public Safety broadband on our last call, we announced that we were awarded the first phase of a 700 megahertz LTE Public Safety network to serve multiple counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. This agreement represents the initial step in deploying a unified state-of-the-art private mission-critical broadband network. As Public Safety systems are expanded to include broadband data, they will need to inter-operate with carrier networks. To this end, we recently signed a significant partnership with Ericsson. In this arrangement, Ericsson will provide LTE-based station equipment to Motorola. We will configure it. We will harden it for Public Safety use, and we will provide the overall broadband network solution architecture for our customers.
 With respect to the Networks business in July, we announced that NSN would purchase the majority of our wireless network assets, including CDMA, GSM, WiMAX and LTE. In this transaction, which is expected to close by early 2011, we will receive approximately $1.35 billion in value, including $1.2 billion from NSN and $150 million for retained accounts receivables. In the third quarter, the portion of the Networks business being acquired by NSN accounted for $871 million in sales and $177 million in GAAP earnings. The strong results were again driven primarily by the CDMA business in North America.
 Before we move to our outlook for EMS and Networks, I want to provide some background on the EMS cost structure. As Ed mentioned earlier, there are costs associated with certain activities previously allocated to Networks which will not be part of the NSN transaction. These costs are now allocated to EMS. So as we head toward separation, we are identifying and taking the appropriate actions to better align our cost structure for the remaining businesses. These actions may include facility rationalization, discretionary spending reductions and where necessary, staff reductions. We do not expect these actions to impact our critical R&D priorities or our critical customer facing operations.
 Regarding our outlook for EMS for the fourth quarter and taking into consideration the impact of our discontinued operations reporting, we expect sales and operating margin to be higher on a sequential basis, and we expect full year sales growth of 7% to 8%, with full year operating margin of approximately 16%.
 For the Networks business classified in discontinued operations, in the fourth quarter, we expect sequentially higher sales, including the higher WiMAX sales and lower CDMA sales. With the change in product mix, we expect operating margin to be lower, resulting in approximately $0.03 per share for discontinued operations. This is not incorporated in the guidance Ed provided earlier of $0.14 to $0.16 per share, which comprises only continuing operations.
 And with that, I'll now pass the call over to Sanjay to discuss Motorola Mobility.
"
99186,113456460,86292,"Motorola Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Executives"," Thanks, Greg, and good morning. Mobile Devices reached a major milestone in the third quarter. We were profitable for the first time in over three and a half years. Our sales surpassed $2 billion and were up 20% year-over-year. Total shipments were 9.1 m",1454," Thanks, Greg, and good morning. Mobile Devices reached a major milestone in the third quarter. We were profitable for the first time in over three and a half years. Our sales surpassed $2 billion and were up 20% year-over-year. Total shipments were 9.1 million units, including smartphone shipment of 3.8 million units. Overall, ASP increased to approximately $223 from $207 in the second quarter, driven by smartphones, which continue to account for over half of our total sales.
 In North America, smartphone sales remained strong, led by our family of DROID devices. Devices at other U.S. carriers continue to perform well also. In a recent JD Power survey of smartphone users, Motorola ranked number two in the U.S. in customer satisfaction, recognition of our focus and high-quality consumer experiences.
 Sales outside of North America grew 10% sequentially and accounted for 32% of total sales. Operating profit in the quarter of $3 million compares to a loss of $109 million in the second quarter. The sequential improvement was driven by a higher smartphone unit volume and improved overall gross margin percentage. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined also.
 Since our last earnings call, we have added 12 devices to our smartphone portfolio, all of which will be in stores for the holiday season. This brings the number of smartphones we have introduced this year to 22. In North America, DROID X continues to sell extremely well. DROID 2, which features an improved keyboard and faster processor compared to the original DROID also sold well in the quarter. Earlier in the month, we announced DROID PRO, our first device optimized for both personal and business use. Usable in over 200 countries, it features a one gigahertz processor, candy bar form factor, QWERTY keyboard and Adobe Flash 10.1. To address corporate connectivity and security needs, we have added security features on top of Android OS. This makes our devices more secure and more manageable in using standard Enterprise tools and technologies. As a result, we expect DROID PRO to be very competitive with other devices in the market aimed at business users.
 Finally at Verizon, we announced CITRUS, an entry-level pocketable device with an eco-friendly design for first-time smartphone users. At AT&T, we launched three more devices: BRAVO, FLIPSIDE and FLIPOUT. With a variety of screen sizes and form factors and affordable retail price points, these devices give consumers added choice in their smartphone experiences.
 Another device that we believe will gain strong consumer acceptance is DEFY. Optimized for active lifestyle, DEFY  is compact, water-resistant, scratch-resistant and dust-proof. It draws on our successes in designing and delivering rugged, durable Mobile Devices.
 In addition to T-Mobile, DEFY is also available in a number of markets outside of U.S. Outside North America, sales growth was driven by a 30% sequential growth in smartphone revenues. In China, our second-largest smartphone market we're one of the leading Android Smartphone suppliers. Unit shipments were up over 70% sequentially. We launched five new Smartphones, including three marketed under our well-known MING brand. MING has been a Motorola brand in China since 2006. It represents devices developed specifically for Chinese consumers that featured distinctive designs, including a signature transparent flip cover. This devices bring our total China Smartphone portfolio to 13%, all released in less than a year.
 In Latin America, the Smartphone market is gaining traction as mid- and low-tier devices become available. Unit shipments in the quarter were up over 20% sequentially. Earlier this month, we announced SPICE, an affordable smartphone, which we'll launch initially in Brazil and then expand into other markets. This brings the number of smartphones we have introduced in the region to 10.
 In Western Europe, we are making good progress. Sales increased sequentially across a broad range of devices, including the recently launched Milestone 2 and DEFY. The majority of our new devices feature enhanced MOTOBLUR capabilities. Improvements to MOTOBLUR provide consumers with increased control over their mobile experiences, device customization and device management. In addition, with over 3 million users, MOTOBLUR provides us with important feedback for our future product and experience development.
 Finally, we added to our portfolio of Bluetooth companion devices that allow consumers to stay productive and hands-free. Device shipping in the fourth quarter feature advanced noise-cancellation technology and include the first device to give consumers the option to respond to text with their voice.
 As we look ahead, we will continue to enhance and broaden our smartphone portfolio. With the belief that one size does not fit all, our smartphone focus will continue in three primary areas: First, high-performance smartphones as the leading edge of innovation that deliver the best experiences to consumers who enjoy everything that mobile Internet has to offer, including multimedia, gaming and social collaboration; second, devices with broad appeal that meet the browsing and social messaging needs of consumers who are interested in intuitive, easy-to-use, pocketable devices with affordable data plans; and third, devices that address the rapidly growing opportunity with business users. These consumers want to stay informed and connected in their work life and their personal life and make their own technology choices.
 Increasingly, CIO support giving employees a choice. If giving that choice, we believe a large number of business users will seriously consider an alternative to their current device brand.
 Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter on a sequential basis, we expect unit shipments and total sales to be higher. The sequential increase in smartphone shipments will be driven largely by our mid-ranged devices. We expect operating earnings to be higher due to higher sales offset partially by an increase in sales and marketing expenses to support the large number of new product launches. For the year, smartphone shipments are now expected to hit the upper end of our 12 million to 14 million unit range.
 Launching over 20 Smartphone devices and achieving profitability have been major goals for us in the transition of this business. Attaining these milestones has been made possible by a tremendous amount of work by a dedicated team of people here at Motorola. These accomplishments are reflective of the innovation and determination of the Mobile Devices organization.
 Turning now to the results for the Home in the third quarter. Home sales were $912 million, up 3% sequentially. Sales of digital entertainment devices were higher and reflected an improved mix, including higher demand for Mocha enabled set-tops for whole Home digital networks. Sales of video and access infrastructure were up over 30% year-over-year and continue to account for over 25% of total Home sales.
 Looking regionally, sales in North America were flat year-on-year. Sales outside of North America were higher and accounted for approximately 25% of total Home sales. We continue to improve profitability, with operating margin increasing to 8.4% from 5% in third quarter of last year. Improvement in the quarter was driven by a more favorable product mix and a reduction in operating costs.
 In Home, our R&D effort continues to be directed towards leveraging our video leadership to deliver solutions that support the trend towards more personalized content and services. This includes digital Home networks, 3D TV, interactive services and converged experiences. That said, with continued macro-environment challenges, we are also focused on prioritizing our current product portfolio and tightly managing the cost structure.
 With respect to enhancing the portfolio, during the quarter, we launched the Motorola EDGE software solution. With these applications, operators can more easily manage broadband services in a multi-screen digital Home. They also help operators to reduce operating costs and accelerate revenue-producing services. We also announced a hosted switch to digital video solution. This solution will enable independent video operators to achieve bandwidth efficiencies previously available only to operators with on-site capabilities.
 Finally, we supported Verizon with the launch of its multi-screen video service by providing our Medios software suite. This solution facilitates the preparation of content for distribution and enable subscriber to share video mix devices such as set-tops, personal computers and smartphones.
 Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect Home sales and operating earnings to be sequentially higher. For the full year, despite the top line decline, we continue to expect to deliver higher operating margin compared to 2009.
 In closing, Motorola's business has performed very well in the quarter and have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. We also continue to focus on our preparations to create two public companies in the first quarter. Motorola Mobility will be well positioned to address the growing opportunity in Smartphones and converged experiences. And Motorola Solution will be poised to leverage its leadership position in mission-critical and business-critical communication solutions.
 With that, I will turn the call back over to Dean to start the Q&A.

But to address the substance of your question, we expect to continue a very meaningful relationship with Verizon. We think the DROID franchise is economically very valuable for Verizon, and they will continue to invest and foster the DROID franchise. And as you know, we are a meaningful participant in that franchise. We will also diversify our portfolio within United States with other operators. We are also focused on diversifying our portfolio outside of the United States. As we said, we have seen meaningful increase in our revenue in China, and we expect that we will focus in expanding our presence in China and Latin America, and to a certain extent, in Europe also. We have, as I look into 2011, we have very multiple design wins with a number of operators, both in the United States and elsewhere. And as we look further beyond just the smartphone category, I see opportunities for us in the converged category as we see convergence between computing and mobility. So if you look at all of these factors, I feel that, clearly, in first quarter, there will be some seasonality and there will be competitive pressure as there is in fourth quarter. But we feel comfortable with our position in light of some of the factors that you mentioned.

Our relationship with Verizon continues to be very good, and the support that we expect from carriers continues to be very good. But my anticipation is that we will be flat to higher in our marketing spend in 2011 compared to 2010.

Obviously, it's a very important smartphone market, and if you want to be really successful outside of the U.S., you're going to need that market. How do you go about restarting a market where Motorola used to have a pretty strong position, but now is coming from a very low market share. What are the costs?

So we are making progress in Europe, even in fourth quarter of this year. In 2011, I think we will have opportunities to expand our presence. But the central question facing us is will we make a substantial investment to make a big re-entry into European market? And I frankly can't tell you the answer today. We always have to make the calculation of whether those dollars are better spent in the U.S., China, Latin America or Europe. We will make that determination as our relationship, continued improvement in our relationship happens in Europe.

As I said earlier, there are some particular competitive situations developing in first quarter. And of course, we have large number of new product introductions, and execution and timing of those launches will be very important for us.

Can you talk about how you get there vis-à-vis your current main customer base? Obviously, the larger is AT&T, but how much more is China going to be in the mix? I believe China right now is somewhere around 12%, 13% of your units. Where does that go in the fourth quarter to get you up almost 1.5 million to 2 million units from Q3? And if you can kind of, again, just talk about at least geographically, if not more specific as to how you get from the 3.7 million now into the 5 million more, where they are coming from so we could feel comfortable that you can actually get there without relying continually on, essentially Verizon and the same guys that you have them? And then, just for Greg, North America seem to have slowed in government to decelerate let's say about 5% year-over-year growth versus I believe it was north of 10% last quarter.

So we're developing LTE infrastructure for private networks and for private broadband within our Public Safety group.

But we will invest modestly to grow and support Enterprise sales also from the point of view of making sure we have a specific call support for CIOs that we have sales calling on Fortune 500. So we will have that. But remember, our strategy here is a very specific strategy in the first instance. The strategy is to deliver devices, which consumers like to use as a consumer device, but it has the Enterprise capability which allows the CIOs to accept it into enterprises. So our sales effort is to make sure that CIOs don't bar these devices or put it in an excepted list, but the sale is to the consumers. 80% of people in enterprises pay for their own device, and it is to that audience that we are selling primarily?

So that shouldn't be assumed in the calculation of the cash end of your forecast that you're calculating. And having said that, we obviously remain co-Motorola Solutions will be keeping the debt. We'll also have other obligations. We'll have to look at our net cash position as we exit Q4 and doing to next year. I think it's premature to speculate on how we ultimately make decisions with Motorola Solutions in the optimal allocation of capital. But we want to finish the year strong across all of the businesses, which Sanjay and I want to successfully separate the firm sometime in Q1 of 2011.

And you're right, it won't happen instantly. But I think we feel with the diversification, which is already happening and the increased focus on diversifying, combined with our opportunity that exist for us within the convergence of computing and mobility, I think that such competitive pressures as we may see in first quarter, we will be able to cope with that circumstance in a relatively good way. I would actually like to take this opportunity to say one more thing that I see what is happening in Home, and the convergence between ourselves and Home is being very important factor.

I think we now have been at this combined Mobile Device and Home for a little over eight months. It's very clear that some of the ideas that led to putting these two businesses together really are becoming much more positive. We see many opportunities for content linkages between the set-top and the mobile device world, sharing content back and forth and our focus on being able to deliver solutions in 2011 that demonstrate that capability. Sanjay touched on the tablet space and our future participation in this space, and that creates another new great opportunity in the converged world. When you think about adding the screen in the Home and the ability to supplement your large viewing screen with a smaller viewing screen simultaneously around content. So collectively, we have energy today focused around expanding that capability that could be provided on the set-top, as well as in the mobile space to enable it. And finally, I just say on the convergence piece, as we look at what MOTOBLUR is doing today and we talked about the EDGE capability from the Home, linking those together and being able to enable us to manage and enhance those capabilities to the consumer and really bring this converged world such that the consumer gets their content on any of their device that they want creates some wonderful opportunities into the future. So you'll start beginning to see in 2011 some converged experiences from us. And then as we move forward more, more opportunity to differentiate our products, both Home, Mobile in this converged world.

I think it's a very competitive good product in the marketplace. HTC continues to deliver good products in the marketplace. On the other hand, I think you're right in characterizing Motorola as the leading, if not, one of the leading handset manufacturers here. I see no reason for us not to get to industry standard profitability and gross margin and profitability over the long period of time. And I see in my guidance, I've always said that this is going to be high single-digit, low double-digit kind of number is where we want to end up in terms of our operating earnings in the long term. But clearly, as I've said in a number of recent comments, I see that the job of transforming this organization is half done. We have some more work to do in terms of becoming a much more software-centric, experience-focused organization. But in one year, we have delivered 22 products. Our focus and execution, our focus and innovation and differentiation is far greater today. And I feel we've very well positioned, not just in the fundamental or transformation that we're making in the organization but the response we're getting to the portfolio in 2011 from our customers. So again, we can -- things that we have a good portfolio. Until our customers accept our products and range our products, we don't have real basis to be optimistic. On the basis of that feedback, on the basis of ranging that we're seeing of our products not just in the United States but elsewhere, I feel pretty comfortable that we're making good progress. And more precisely, I feel that we should definitely get to industry level profitability.

That sounds like it's all changing coming up ergo, is focused on the mid-tier phones.

First of all, what I call the performance tier or the high tier of smartphone market today carries the disproportionately high amount of gross margin with it. Because, as you know, off the price points that has been said, $199 and $99, and the lifetime ownership costs of these devices is such that you're biased towards buying a higher-tier in U.S. I actually continue to believe that we will do well, if not extremely well, in that tier. So I think in your question, you'll assume that the competitive pressure is there forced us to diversify in the middle. I don't think it's a matter of one or the other. I think that you will see us do both. You will see us focus very, very much in leading in the performance tier because the halo of performance tier is probably just as important in driving mid tier as anything else, and the performance in North America actually is just as important in driving outside U.S. smartphone sales as anything else. You will see our brand name being relevant in China and Latin America, and we will focus there as a matter of first step. But Europe, I think is a very important marketplace. And the dynamics there, particularly right now, potentially create an opportunity for us to capitalize on. So we will focus on those things. But I think we have not, by the way, guided you to improving OpEx as our sales increase. But I really believe that performance tier is important for us to succeed on as I think you imply in your comments. But the diversification with mid tier is also important because the base of smartphone is increasing and more feature phone consumers are coming to smartphone. And we have to win in both places.

But could you just give us your view on why it’s different? Do you see the same things? Or any perspective on that would be great.

But again, I referenced the fact that in the third quarter we grew 1.5%. You can compare and contrast that to other providers and other things that some other folks talked about in terms of what they see.
 I think the second point in what we’re trying to impart on you this morning is that, yes, the Government markets are challenged, but we have city, county, state, US Federal, international, and that we have a pretty diversified mix of “Government”, it’s not all the same.
 The other thing I’d point out to you is this is a longer sales cycle business, it’s a long cycle implementation business. So if you look as a composite at Government, everybody is in a different buying cycle or implementation cycle of these respective systems. So one state might be 30% of the way through of grants they have received and they’re implementing a multiyear process, a multiyear system irrespective of some of the other exogenous factors around them.
 So I think that this business is a little different, the resiliency of our Solutions are different, and the criticality where these products and services sit in the food chain, security, statewide interoperability, and mission-critical public safety, it doesn’t mean they’re not totally immune, but they move higher up in the food chain of criticality which is why I think we’ve been able to grow at a reasonable level of consistency. And Fitzpatrick showed you that even in the core, this business even through Armageddon a few years ago and economic times has been a 6% compounded annual growth rate.
 In terms of distribution –

 So immediately, some of those radio products in Government segments are being sold to utilities or other kinds and users. But to answer your question directly, from a Federal Government perspective, our US Federal Government is about 8% of our business, so the overwhelming majority of the rest of that Government business, if you will, is primarily state and local – if you think of state and local being states and counties here.
 Internationally we also – well it’s not US Federal Government is part of that 8%, we feel nationwide networks as well. So, but again, to what you would call there as a local or Federal Government, so the overwhelming majority of the 65% is primarily to what you would classify is non-US Federal Government.

 There is a reason we’re investment grade, it’s important to our customer base for continuities and stability as they look to do business with the government provider. And so, overtime, as we generate more cash and as Fitzpatrick talked about moving more toward an optimal capital structure what does that mean.
 He referenced the fact that debt to EBITDA is closer to 3 at the moment. We’d like to get to 2 to 2.5. As we move towards that and make progress, we’ll give full consideration to returning capital to the shareholder including full consideration for some type of dividend at some point in time.

Again, though, I would say what I said before, generally what we’ve seen is even in downtimes we haven’t seen it down as far, and up times we haven’t seen up this far. I think public safety which is where we are primarily selling when we talk about Government is at a point that even through all the administrations in our current elections have said first responders in public safety is critical important. So I think it will somewhat continue in that pace.
 The other thing I would remind you is, it’s not and that’s why I’ve tried to go through a litany of grant programs that’s not just stimulus. I mean there was Byre grants, COPS Mill programs, interoperability, urban area initiatives, going out even before the President initiated more stimulus funds. So those programs will continue in some fashion. And all of those programs in many cases are multiyear projects.
 So in other words, something that has already been awarded if we talked about what’s been allocated to [inaudible] so the $100 million that’s been allocated to Los Angeles. That will stem for several years to go. So many of this when you talk about $8 billion worth of grants are already issued to really run projects that will stay in the next three or four years.
 So I think while it’s provided good tailwinds, it’s really hard to get – I don’t think it’s going away tomorrow, but it’s also hard to calculate our complete dependency, because what I’ve said earlier and what we’ve witnessed is, when there isn’t as much funds, it seems like our customer base still gets prioritized. And when there is extra funds you do other things within that customer segment that may or may not could directly benefit Motorola sales.

That’s an infrastructure base stations, interoperability platform, provisioning, control points.
 What we’re saying is as a San Francisco or an LA or a big public safety LTE network gets deployed which is a 100% Motorola if we win the business. As those customers, as those first responders leave the coverage area of that network and may have to roam on to a carrier network we would then package with the primary phase of the customer, an Ericsson eNodeB. Since we’re divesting of the networks business and we really didn’t have, well we didn’t have any, zero LTE awards for the US in our networks business, the opportunity cost is zero.
 Ericsson made sense because they are the number one installed base footprint in the US and internationally. To Delaney’s point as we talk to them which was for the last couple of years, we determined that they had a leading edge LTE position with a strong footprint and incumbency and they were a great partner to team up with, because they didn’t have the appetite or desire to lead in public safety. So we are not leaving anything on the table and instead we get a world-class partner that for industrial large DMA networks in the urban areas that have to roam, we will package and install eNodeB equipment to roam accordingly.

In our manufacturing, you saw our footprint and we have done a lot of work in optimizing our supply chain. The two issues that I’m sure you’re worried about is; number one, there is a discussion around shortage of supply, which is an industry-wide issue; and then are we going to be disadvantaged from a pricing perspective with suppliers given that a lot of volume came out of mobile devices.
 So let me start with the first one. Clearly, the industry supply issue has been challenging. It has not impacted our ability to achieve our financial forecast and guidance that Greg has given you every quarter. I will tell you that it’s top of the mind for me, and Rich Valin, our Chief Procurement Officer who is the room, we spend virtually every week. One of us is out with suppliers making sure that what we need to fulfill the needs of our customers is planned and we do a lot of more demand planning with them.
 So the supply issue I think is still going to be around for a couple of more quarters. We’ve seen significant improvements in Q3 and the trend here in Q4, but we’re not going to take our eye off the ball, and I’m going to spend more time with suppliers than I ever have in the past.
 From a purchasing perspective, the leverage issue about mobile devices and the volumes, how will that impact our ability to get proper pricing, we’ve done a lot of analysis of that as well. And we believe it’s not going to be material at all. So when we look, if you’re breaking into thirds, a third of the suppliers that we rely Motorola Solutions weren’t even suppliers and mobility. Another third we shared suppliers, but we were a dominant source for that. The other third – it’s pretty much indifferent and it’s not going to move the needle.
 I was in Electronica last week in Munich with Rich, specifically to keep me in with suppliers. And what I’m hearing from suppliers consistently is they like the Motorola Solutions organization because of our first of all hi-tech nature of our product lines, the fact that we’ve got good visibility and we’ve got intense leadership position, there is predictability, and a lot of these suppliers as you know they’re dealing with a lot of this to have a partner to be a supplier to a company like solutions with a little more predictability is a huge benefit.
 The last point I’ll make on supply chain is we have over the last year been very, very effective in an initiative of we manufacturing and we have significantly leaned out our factories, so that will produce the products faster, cheaper, our in-process inventory is dramatically down, our cost structure down, and I think it’s contributed to the fact that we were able to hold margins and that we have been very diligent on continuing to bring the supply chain.
 So I like where we’re at from a supply chain. I don’t see big downside on purchasing, I’m keeping a watchful eye on key suppliers. But the indications I have right now is that it won’t material affect Motorola Solutions.

 So P25 systems and TETRA had a slow start and when they became standards. As they worked through that process, funding got aligned, bid started to be issued. And then there was a ramp up and there continues to be a ramp up on P25. If you’re going to look geographically, in the early 2000s, you saw a lot of TETRA builds going on in Europe. Europe was very aggressive on doing countrywide deployments and you had that along with the countries that deployed TETRA, so there was a lot of activity within that.
 But they – as Mark mentioned in his presentation, a P25 network or a TETRA network is a multiyear deployment. So we’re not going to see some huge necessary spike there, because they take multi-years to deploy. Now we’re continuing to plug P25. There’s still lots of P25 opportunities here in North America as well as other parts around the world and the same with TETRA, as especially TETRA starts to be deployed in other verticals of beyond public safety.
 If we think about LTE, as I said, I think the window for standardization of the LTE piggy backing up for what’s happening in commercial that won’t take as long. I think in public safety there are still issues to be discussed and resolved relative to allocation of spectrum specifically for public safety on whether it will be auctioned or allocated directly to public safety, that also will align, how that transpires or line up funding. So that’s why when I was talking I think in ‘11, you’ll see more trial activities, and then in ‘12, ‘13, and beyond, you’ll start to see appreciable revenue on LTE broadband.

And I think LTE will have that same long tail if there wasn’t an embedded base of radio communications. So there wasn’t that immediate need to go do something, because you had something.
 So the adoption or the initial route I believe was slower in those cases than what we will see in LTE broadband, because this is the demand we talk about really needing real-time video for instance which you don’t have a pipe that can get that today on a crime scene or when you talk about public safety video. I think the initial route certainly in the large cities will be much quicker than we saw for like ASTRO or TETRA. And then they’ll have the town.

And as Greg mentioned, depending upon the rating agency that you’re talking about the adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA calculation may vary, but we’re in about 3 right now.
 So I talked about deleveraging in 2011, that’s a $30 million [ph] payment we will plan to do that. And I think at that point in time we will reassess where we are and if we’re in that we will have – that that will be a time when we would consider. But I think it’s all going to be based on getting into that sweet spot of 2 to 2.5 debt-to-EBITDA.
 A quick question would be that we have a lot of cash. We do have a lot of cash, but remember we’re also in international business and some of that cash is outside the US used in operations. I also mentioned that we have cash that’s outside of the US that all other things been equal, I’ll probably bring back today and I would be in a more flexible position arguably, but I’m not doing it part of it for tax planning purposes, right?
 So I talked about that 20% tax rate. I think that’s important, right? I think that’s an important differentiator now that we’re able to generate more cash flow, given our cash tax rate will be lower. So it will be a balance. So I think there is no fine line that I’d draw for you, it’s going to be a balance of all that. US, international cash is going to be getting the debt to EBITDA ratios where they need to be, all balanced with the bringing the right returns to shareholders including things like tax rate. So – and we’ll continue to update you as we go through here.

For Ed, can you give us a bit of timing on when you’ll expect networks to close? Can we assume it’s going to be after the separation that Greg mentioned in January?
 And also just following on from the comments on capital structure, is there anything which would prevent you longer term from gearing up the business or levering the business, is it something about the customer profile and what they expect to see in Motorola that you would have to maintain a large net cash balance?
 And one for Gene, we’ve seen the other half of Motorola get quite aggressive in ascertaining its IPR and patent portfolio. You mentioned there is 6,000 plus patents and 3,500 that are pending. Can you talk about whether there will be a material stream of income from IPR from Motorola Solutions and whether you’d equally get more aggressive and ascertaining you a patent portfolio versus competitor? Thanks.

I think from a rating agency perspective, the bigger gaining item for us right now is the debt to EBITDA.

We’ll do what we think is the right thing to do and strike the right balance there from a tax perspective versus US versus international cash. I think that’s the piece of it.
 Greg also talked about why is the rating agency is denoting us as solid investment grade important to us and to our customers. I think it is – we are a long cycle business, they expected to be here for the long run. Gene talked about as backwards compatible products for years and years, we’re also – we’re going to be there for the long haul, so I think that’s very important to our customers.
 The investment grade rating, you think if it as better financially repaying lower rates, you also think of it as our customers are seeing us as a stronger more stable business. But you also see it as your availability to credit is greater. A lot of the contracts that we have require performance bonds or letters of credit. And during the periods in ‘08, ‘09 when we got downgraded we were having to pose some cash to collateralize, it too got a point where it was kind of silly, we were a 15% to 16% operating earnings business, but we couldn’t get access to the performance bonds – couldn’t access it was harder to, and that’s not something that we ever want to be in that position again such that we don’t miss opportunities with the growth that we talked.

So it’s going to be things and across all the function HR, IT, finance, legal, all those costs that we’ve kind of consolidated and supported all of these businesses that we’re done in the aggregate, there wasn’t one specific team for each. Although we had our specialties, there was that – you were getting some economies of scale to having that.
 So it’s going to be in those spaces where we’re going to need to go after and we’ve already really identified what we need to do, it’s not a surprise. So we’ve identified, we’ve already started to take the actions that we need to take. We expect the actions to be completed in 2011. I’d say that to get to the numbers that I’ve talked about we’ve already modeled in when they were going to take place. So the 16% that we talked about for 2011 factors in the pace that we’re going to be going.
 One of the cost that that you can appreciate that doesn’t go away is pension cost, right? We’re – at the Solutions business we’re maintaining or supporting this entire pension plan where that pension plan was for all the employee including, well that’s the piece that you really can’t take away, right?

In fact, when you look at the split in Europe, Middle East and Africa, it is different than the 65/35, it’s roughly 50/50.

When you think about Europe in particular and in particular Western Europe, I would say spending is extremely tight now and it’s pressured. I mean there is a lot of pressure on the government spending and what’s going on.
 To the contrary, in the Middle East and Africa, I see them as very high growth rates particularly in the Middle East and particularly in governments are large MOI and MODs within those countries, so we still see that as a huge opportunity for us. So all-in-all, I think when you take those two in, growth rates are still pretty good for that region, but certainly your question you hold in on, the mix is a little different, Enterprise is a very strong business throughout. Even in Europe right now it’s still growing like we’re seeing in North America, retail and other things have really bounced back in Europe, and overall Government is still struggling a little.

Our market share position across the country is excellent. We serve all the public safety needs, most of the police department. Also in China, you’ve got lots of activity around metro line, virtually all of the metro lines is connecting all the cities now, almost all of them are using Motorola communication solutions.
 They just had a big expo in Shanghai. Virtually all of the communications equipment to run that expo was Motorolas, all of the trains – again the transit to get the people there run with our equipment. So I really like our position in China. We do quite well, we do it across multiple vertical. As far as the Chinese competitors come into other spaces, was it second part of your question. First of all, I take nobody for granted as you would expect.
 Typically what happens is they try to come in at the low end and work up and I’ve highlighted on especially mobile computing how we’re going to make some investments in the value tier or maybe that was – we did not serve their markets, we’ve kind of we’re at the higher end. On the professional and commercial radio with our platforming activities where we now have we anticipate our digital margins will be comparable to our analog margins.
 I think we’re well positioned from a tiering perspective and with the differentiation of clearly there is an aggravation and there can be a market disruptor. But I think overall market presence and our overall solutions and the fact that we can tier where required we’re able to compete very, very effectively.

That was also the basis for Vertex, a deal we did a couple of years ago, where we acquired 80% of them to have a fighter brand, if you will, an alternative brand of Motorola and have Vertex fill in some of the lower end and mid-tier portfolio where we didn’t have product, but we can attack pretty swiftly under a different brand. So we feel pretty well positioned there. Number two or number one again. Hendi [ph].

First of all, just want to re-attack one last time the Cisco question of what they’re seeing and what you’re not seeing. My guess is when they reported last week you went back to your customers and said what’s going on just want to reconfirm and make sure. If it is kind of relive those moments for us and as you come with the point that they’re on different projects than you are at the same customer set, do they come up with – as you come with perhaps that they are a different customers in those – in that same market that you’re in or are they just not – I mean something is happening to them, I’m just wondering if it is different customers that they’re selling into or are you seeing weakness in those same customers, but they’re just in a very, very isolated part of the market and you are at a much broader part of the market and therefore you could offset that with other customers. So some sense as to customers that would be interesting.
 Gross margins have been very steady at 50%, 51%. You’ve gone through several transitions, the analog transition to P25, TETRA it will be moved to LTE. Can you go over the gross margins of each one of those devices, you said the gross margins on the digital devices, Gene, are very similar to just the analog, I’d imagine right now the expenses are higher. Is there any difference though in the gross margin profile as we watch you move through several transitions of technology and what are the different – is there a gross margin difference between the Enterprise side and Government side. Just to more color you can give us in the different pieces of the business that – and after that 50%, 51% will be great.

We don’t necessarily Hendi sit here and when we think about analogs and digital or trunked radios to P25 or analog to TETRA or today’s environment to LTE, we don’t necessarily see a dislocation of gross margins based on the way we’re running the business and what we think we can manage in terms of supply chain efficiencies, procurements and cost of goods sold.
 In terms of Cisco and I know this is a good deal for you guys and you keep asking it many different ways, but I actually think that you’re better off asking them than us, because I can’t speak to what they’re seeing and obviously it rattled the markets. And I just think we’re a different business – by the way, that does not mean, right, we’re not looking at this through any rose-colored glasses or myopic, thinking we’re impenetrable and the world doesn’t react that we’re immune to the reactions of the world, but we’re looking at it.

The first is on the network sale R&D, you anticipate being that that’s going to be – you’ll be able to shield all taxes on that sale given the basis in those assets. And then the second question just goes back to sort of debt-to-EBITDA levels that you talked about. You had mentioned $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion of sales this year growing 4% that puts you at a little bit over $8 billion, 16% margin I think gives you to about 12.80 billion in EBITDA. And I think for the old EMS business in ‘09 was 150 so it’s about equal to your CapEx at 160. So you’re kind of it 14.50 of EBITDA, you’re at $2.9 billion of debt now. So aren’t you essentially at two times leverage? Am I doing something wrong in the calculation? Is it historical? Am I right in thinking CapEx and D&A are offsetting? Can you just help me sort of bridge all that?

But as you know the adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA includes other things including pension obligations, right? If you look at our balance sheet today, we do have a pension liability of approximately $1.9 billion. If they stay where they are today, interest rates at a lower levels that balance will grow a bit $500 million to $600 million. So as I talked to you about in the kind of the three range, high 2s to low 3 range, it incorporates that adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA level.
 So the interest rates aren’t helping us. The market hasn’t helped us a bit either with the asset levels. The good news is the asset levels have come back a bit, but the interest levels are still pretty low. So the pension obligation numbers are a bit higher than what we were. So I think that’s the piece of it and maybe you can come back to your first question again so I can remember what it was.

You aggregate all the video, you analyze the video, you identify the critically important, you dispatch over the mission critical voice that the core that I talked about. And as you dispatch first responders to some incident through our command and control and LTE systems, we can push the video to those first responders that are on the move before the fire fighter gets at a fire, or building if he sees the fire if its swat operation they know where the doors are that type of a thing.

 Integrated command and control, we’ll bring him into our customer briefing center, show him what we’re doing with our partnership with Microsoft, then they want us to do it. Interoperability, they want to tie two systems together. They want us to do it because they trust us as their partner. So we’re not looking at creating this new, new service offering. We want to take our domain expertise so deep and apply it in extending out from more of a product centric view to more of service say referred into advanced services from headcount perspective.

Hopefully if nothing else, you said well it’s well positioned, it’s great, you don’t really understand it but you have this monster market share and they really grow, and hopefully if nothing else you’ve seen that we play in attractive. We absolutely can grow the core and we absolutely can grow in North America and internationally.
 We have a balanced portfolio from a gross margin yield standpoint, we’ve afforded to Jim’s point some synergies in the way we’ve implemented the headcount, don’t want the cost structures certainly to go in the wrong direction. There is more cost efficiency as we think we can derive as we complete the separation and get after the 2% in the first half of 2011. And we’ve modeled 16% to 18%. We’ve talked about comparable 16% operating margins in ‘011 progressing up to 18% and I don’t see a cap on 18%.
