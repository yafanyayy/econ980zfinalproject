Good morning everyone and thank you for joining The Hartford’s fourth quarter earnings call. The fourth quarter represents returned profitability for The Hartford.

The fourth quarter represents returned profitability for The Hartford. As we reported last evening, net income for the quarter was $557 million or $1.19 per diluted share. Life and Property & Casualty both recorded net income. 
Fourth quarter net income resulted from strong core earnings and lower realized capital losses, due in part to the gain on Verisk IPO. Now the fourth quarter was the third consecutive quarter of improving core earnings. Strong execution form The Hartford team and a rebounded investment income with primary drivers.
In Property & Casualty solid underwriting income coupled with prior year reserve releases and very light cat losses, drove over 54% sequential improvement in core earnings. At these results demonstrated, our continued philosophy of discipline underwriting is fundamental to the success of P&C.
In Life, margin recovery in a favorable back unlocks push core earnings to nearly $400 million. Assuming normal market conditions, our Life operations are on track to generate more than $1 billion of core earnings in 2010. Now these results reinforce the observations I shared with you in the third quarter earnings call.
Our franchisee is stable with growing momentum. The Hartford has a strong capital foundation. We are decisively facing our challenges and our team is focused on delivering superior returns, through sustained profitable growth. We continued to see signs of stability across the company.
The P&C policy counts increased as retention improved and new business levels grew. The Life persistency has remained strong. In 2009 persistency was 87% in group benefits and 95% in retirement plans and we expect these trends to continue in 2010. We also saw indication in the fourth quarter that sales momentum is building.
Businesses, distributors and consumers continue to view The Hartford as a preferred option for their P&C insurance needs, which, along with solid execution and new products, resulted in strong fourth quarter new business levels, with small commercial and middle market recording year-over-year increases of 21% and 7%, respectively.
Now, though year-over-year sales and in Life were down in some businesses, there was momentum in Retirement Plans sales and mutual fund deposits. Retirement Plans’ quarterly sales set a record of $1.2 billion. Meanwhile, strong fund performance in wholesaling drove over $3 billion of deposits in Retail Mutual Funds; and this was the third consecutive quarter with deposits over $3 billion and represents a 22% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008.
We were also very pleased to be named one of Barron’s Top 10 Mutual Fund Families for 2009, in recognition of our outstanding fund performance. We expect our top tier performance to drive even higher deposit levels in 2010. The fourth quarter benefited from good execution by The Hartford team. The company completed the expense reduction initiatives announced in late 2008. In the last 12 months, we have reduced the total number of employee positions by 10%, or approximately 3,000.
We also consolidated our real estate footprint by about 15%. The benefit of these actions in 2009 is most clearly reflected in the margin recovery in many of our Life businesses. In Property & Casualty, we continued to expand distribution of our AARP product through independent agents. We now have the product in 20 states and will be in 41 states by the end of the year. The benefits of the AARP through agents program have been significant.
In those states, where the product is available, flows from the AARP program accounted for roughly 20% of agency new business premium. Small commercial is benefiting from the rollout of growing Spectrum, our new business owner policy. At the end of 2009, Growing Spectrum was in 30 states, and the product was driving meaningful growth in new business. We will roll out the product in an additional 13 states by the spring and will then be active in 80% of the target market.
In the fourth quarter, we’ve reduced our excess liquidity by about $2.2 billion. Most of that was put to work in investment-grade corporate bonds. You should expect a similar approach in the first quarter of 2010. We also continued to de-risk the investment portfolio. This is a security-by-security process, where we seek to maximize economic value while balancing the impacts on capital and yields.
In the fourth quarter, as spreads tightened in the riskier assets classes, we found more opportunities to sell securities at or above our estimate of fair value and these sales reduced the company’s aggregate real estate exposures. Now looking ahead, we expect the economy and the market to remain uncertain. Our outlook contemplates a slow gradual economic recovery.
However, there are indications that the impact of the economy on exposures may have bottomed in late 2009. Our midterm cancellations and the decline in policy endorsements have stabilized. If these trends hold, we believe exposure increases will provide a modest top line benefit in 2010.
In the Group Benefits industry, fully insured premium continues to fall from prior year levels, due in part to higher unemployment. Future growth in industry-wide premium will likely be correlated to improvements in unemployment and in this tough environment, we remain focused on pricing and underwriting discipline across all of our insurance businesses and we are taking rate where necessary to make our target returns.
In our wealth management businesses, we are optimistic that strong equity market performance and solid execution in the second half of 2009 will provide a positive lift to our mutual funds and retirement plan businesses in ‘10. The Hartford enters the year with a strong capital foundation. In 2009, surplus in the Property & Casualty operations increased by $1.4 billion to $7.4 billion and we ended the year capitalized well above levels historically associated with AA ratings.
On the Life side, the year end RBC ratio was estimated to be between 375% and 390%. Even after moving capital to the Life Company in the fourth quarter, we have significant holding company resources, with over $2 billion at year end. Now as you know, last night, we announced our investor event in New York in early April, and we as a team look forward to sharing with investors how we plan to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.
The investor event will also include a discussion of The Hartford’s capital strategy and a key element of this strategy is the eventual repayment of CPP. We recognize that the government’s preferred stock is not permanent capital, and we will repay it, but as I have said previously, we will be prudent in repaying CPP. 
In our view, prudence requires that we balance a number of factors, including the company’s capital resources, potential dilution to shareholders, the perceived future impact of CPP on our business and of course, the views of our regulators.
Finally, our CFO search is going well. I am very pleased with the process and the caliber of the candidates, and I am optimistic that we will announce a new CFO in the near term. As a note, Liz and her team have made definite progress in improving risk management, and I look forward to her assuming the Chief Risk Officer role full time.
So in summary, the fourth quarter of 2009 reflects good execution by The Hartford team and a return to profitability. We also saw growing sales momentum and improvements in the investment portfolio. The company has a strong capital foundation and we continue to position the company for the future and are optimistic about opportunities to deliver superior returns through sustained profitable growth and we look forward to discussing the future of The Hartford with investors in New York.
With that, I will turn the call over to Liz.

341546,84102753,49138,"Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2010",2010-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Liam.

Our Property & Casualty businesses continued to execute very well. P&C earnings for the fourth quarter were strong, as disciplined underwriting, light catastrophes and favorable reserve developments drove profitability. In the fourth quarter, core earnings were $378 million. This represents more than a 50% increase over the third quarter of 2009.
The fourth quarter benefited from prior year releases as reserves in a number of lines continued to develop favorably. Even with favorable development in 2009, our year end carried reserves are 3.8% higher than the actuarial indication, a level unchanged from year end 2008, this compares to an estimated industry level of 2.9%.
If you want more detail on the P&C reserve activity, you can find it in the 8-K we filed yesterday. The fourth quarter current accident year combined ratio, excluding tax, was a solid 92.6%. For the full year, that ratio was 91.7%, a very good result.
In general, loss costs remain within expectations, with the exception of personal auto frequency, which has risen faster than expected to more normal pre 2008 levels. Written premiums for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion, or 5% lower than in the prior year period. The recession continues to take its toll on commercial lines premium, as insurance exposures remain depressed.
However, strong new business growth and improving retention offset some of the economic top line pressure in the fourth quarter. Small commercial saw at 21% increase in new business on a year-over-year basis, as the rollout of our new business owners policy has been well-received by agents and customers alike.
In middle market, new business increased 7%, due to growth in both Property and Workers Compensation, growth driven in part by the strong performance of our technology practice group and the success of our Property Choice product enhancements.
Looking into 2010, we are cautiously optimistic about the opportunities for growth. A leveling off of the economic decline is likely to result in improved premium retention. In addition, we are focusing on expanding market share by cross-selling existing accounts, extending our new business owner products, expanding the AARP through agents program and capitalizing on our expertise in existing and new industry verticals.
As we seek to grow market share, we remain committed to underwriting discipline, developing and enhancing our product and service offerings and positioning the company to take advantage of the opportunities that will arise when the market and the economy turn.
Now let’s turn to our fourth quarter Life results on slide five. Margins have improved across many of the Life companies businesses. This is the result of lower expenses and rising account values in the equity sensitive businesses. With that backdrop, core earnings for the quarter were $385 million, including a $78 million DAC unlock benefit. The quarter also saw some noise from one-timers, with a $35 million favorable tax adjustment, partially offset by a $17 million restructuring charge.
In mutual funds, ROAs have recovered nicely, reaching almost 16 basis points in the fourth quarter. We have seen a rebound in scale benefits in the second half of 2009, and the fourth quarter included a favorable true-up in 2009 fee income, which added a bit less than two basis points to the ROA.
Turning to Group Benefits, we had another solid quarter, with core earnings of $79 million. In the fourth quarter, we observed some unfavorable disability resulting from higher new incurrals. We believe the higher loss ratio in the fourth quarter is a reflection of normal volatility, but we are monitoring this issue closely.
We continued to be disciplined in pricing. That discipline, shrinking payrolls and the carryover effects from last year’s challenges weighed on sales in the fourth quarter, as well as the key January 1 date. That said we anticipate a gradual sales recovery over the course of 2010. In summary, in the fourth quarter, we saw continued stabilization of sales and deposits, and improved margins, which contributed to strong core earnings in our Life operations.
I would now like to take a few minutes and review our fourth quarter investment results. Please turn to slide six. As the slide shows, the unrealized loss position continued to improve in the fourth quarter, spread tightening and de-risking actions drove the improvement.
In the fourth quarter, realized capital losses totaled $194 million pre-tax. The main driver was credit related impairments on structured, commercial and residential securities, as we saw moderate collateral deterioration in specific market areas and property types. In the fourth quarter, we also took advantage of spread tightening and opportunistically sold real estate related assets. These losses were offset by the gain we realized by exiting our position in the successful Verisk IPO.
Finally, we increased the mortgage loan reserve in the fourth quarter by $210 million. The mortgage reserve increase was concentrated in loan participations. About $100 million of the increase reflects our intent to sell a number of these loans in the first quarter of 2010, as part of our continued de-risking efforts. We expect these sales to reduce the carrying value of this asset class by an additional $150 million in the first quarter.
Now, please turn to slide seven for a review of The Hartford’s capital position. As Liam said, The Hartford enters 2010 with a strong capital foundation. Our Property & Casualty Company ended the year with $7.4 billion of statutory surplus, up $1.4 billion from the prior year. The primary contributor was statutory income. At this level, we are very well capitalized, approximately $1.8 billion above historical AA levels.
On the Life side, estimated U.S. stat surplus, including surplus held at captive reinsurance, ended the year at $7.3 billion. In the fourth quarter, the holding company moved a total of $1.8 billion to the Life operations to fund the capital requirements of the global VA business and investment related capital impacts.
Hartford Life and Accident, the parent U.S. writing company ended the year with stat surplus of $6 billion, which translates to an estimated risk based capital ratio between 375% and 390%. All in, taking into account Hartford Life and Accident as well as the captives, we finished the year with an estimated margin of about $1.1 billion in the Life U.S. operations.
The holding company ended 2009 with $2.2 billion of capital. This reflects the $1.8 billion of fourth quarter contributions to the Life Company, as well as the Allianz payment of $200 million and interest and dividend payments. Holding company capital remains very liquid, and we like the flexibility it affords us as we enter 2010.
In summary, The Hartford’s capital foundation is strong. Our P&C and Life companies have significant capital in excess of levels consistent with AA requirements, and we have over $2 billion of additional capital at the holding company.
Now please turn to slide eight for a look at our guidance. As we announced last evening, our core earnings per share guidance for 2010 is between $3.70 and $4 per share. There are a number of technical assumptions embedded in the guidance that we have listed on slide eight for your benefit. As you know, our guidance does not incorporate prior year reserve development in our ongoing P&C operations. We also do not include a DAC unlocks benefit or charge.
Another important assumption is the yield on partnerships and other alternative investments in 2010. Our guidance simply assumes a zero return from this asset class. We expect alternatives to perform much better than they did in 2009, but quarter-to-quarter returns may be volatile.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Rick, as we move to the Q-and-A session.

We are still getting state approvals and we are still getting up to run rate at key firms. There are a number of firms where there were some operational issues that we needed to work through, because the product is somewhat different. So I would say in the fourth quarter, the sales were largely from the previous product set.
We have seen improving sales numbers week-to-week throughout the period, and we anticipate that they’ll continue to build as we go through the year, but we do anticipate that the first quarter will be softer than fourth quarter levels as we make the transition to the new product. We are getting a positive response in the marketplace, and we think this product will work very well for our customers. So we expect sales to build throughout the year.
On retirement net flow, we did have some losses of some large plans in the second and third quarters of 2009, which was reflected in the net flow negatives that you saw there. As we came into year end, we had strong growth in sales momentum in year end, which will result in higher deposits in 2010 and we anticipate that sales momentum will stay in effect and will improve deposits throughout the year, which is what results in our positive net flow outlook for the year.

I didn’t get a chance to read through all of your comments from the 8-K on the reserves, but as I recall, in the third quarter, in the general liability area, there was some increase in paid claims or with late emerging exposures, maybe that’s what it was.
I’m wondering what you saw in the fourth quarter related to that, and in general what are you seeing on the casualty side. We just heard from one other company that had seen an increase in reported claims from the ‘07, ‘08 year. Just trying to get a sense of what you guys are seeing?

The common theme is that, guaranteed retirement income is still a big theme and we believe that that’s going to continue to be the case for as far as we can see with the demographic trends.
That said, people are solving that differently, and there are different appetites in the marketplace. The traditional heavy VA sellers from a broker standpoint, and a firm standpoint, still like the more expensive heavily guaranteed equity products; and I think that’s why certain firms are getting a very concentrated market share there. 
At the same time, there’s a significant demand building, we believe, for products that are less expensive, because the expense really is very high if you consider what the expected returns are on those portfolios and for a return for more simplicity.
So, the key themes that we’ve has as we’ve thought about the VA business, is for simplicity, better consumer value, without giving up the guaranteed income. We believe that will work overtime, but it may be a different group of sellers who do most of the volume there, so not by firm, but by broker. As you know, broker penetration in most firms is relatively low, like under 25%, doing VA on an active basis.
So we think there’s a lot of opportunity to reach out to brokers who’re doing other types of business and bring them in for the guaranteed income that we provide, but there is a bifurcation going on where a lot of firms, a lots of our peers, are pulling away from the more expensive, heavy equity market guarantees. A few are sticking with them, and so that’s concentrating the business of those that are still interested in the heavy equity market guarantees.

Again, I’ll make another point. There’s risk remaining in Japan, but as we’ve said before, we have more than ample capital over there, which doesn’t get counted in any of the margin discussions, to be able to withstand what we would call an equivalent kind of market decline that would be associated with a 700 S&P.
So we would have more than sufficient capital in Japan covering that business.

We’ve got about 60 wholesalers in the field that’s enough to easily cover the whole country, but we have access at all of our key distribution firms and frankly, I think we continue to have one of the best wholesaling forces in the industry in terms of talent, experience and the ability to carry the story. 
I was with them last week where we had our national sales meeting, and they were universally enthusiastic about the new product, which is probably my best indicator, that I think we will make this work.
It will take some time because it’s different, and I’ve been very clear about that, but we believe it offers tremendous consumer value and a differentiated story, which is good to have from a sales perspective in the marketplace and as we go through the year, we should see sales momentum build.

Then second is, as we think about the new VA product, how do we think about the return that product is priced for? I understand it’s sort of a hybrid fixed annuity, variable annuity. What sort of return level should be assumed? Is it more mid teens that we would expect on a traditional VA, or is it closer to 10% to 12%, that might be fixed annuities, or somewhere in between?

Before we get started, I want to welcome Chris Swift to his first Hartford Earnings Call. I'm pleased to have him on-board and appreciate his contributions to what the Company has accomplished in the past 60 days. I also want to thank those of you who joined us earlier this month for our investor presentation, either in person in New York or on the webcast. We appreciate the positive feedback, as well as the questions we've received and we're now focused on executing our strategy in achieving the financial targets we set, high single-digit core earnings growth and an 11% ROE by 2012. 
I'll provide some additional color on the strategy today and share some of our earlier progress. Obviously, success will not come in one quarter and instead, will be measured by the results we generate over the next few years. And as I've said, since my arrival, our goal is to deliver superior shareholder returns over time through a sustained profitable growth, and that is what we intend to do.
We made good progress in the first quarter. We continue to execute on our 2010 plans, strengthen the balance sheet with a successful capital raise and the TARP repayment and launched our new strategy. While there is more to do, frankly, we got a lot done. I want to thank The Hartford team for all their hard work and efforts. 
With net income of $319 million, the first quarter marked our second consecutive profitable quarter and as a company committed to driving sustained profitability, this is an important result. A strong equity market, our continued commitment to underwriting discipline, and improving credit markets, all contributed to our results.
Chris will go into more detail, but we did have a few one-time charges for the quarter, relating to the TARP repurchase, the settlement of a litigation matter and the impact of new federal healthcare legislation. Without these items, core earnings would have been over $1.30 per share. The first quarter also showed growing top line momentum across many of our business lines, including Mutual Funds, Retirement Plans and P&C commercial lines. Both Small Commercial and Middle Market continued to generate profitable new business growth in the first quarter. They also reported meaningful increases in policy retention. In fact, in Small Commercial, we added more new business policies and had the highest policy count retention in three years. 
In Wealth Management, net flows were positive and sales showed year-over-year gains in most of our ongoing businesses. Mutual fund sales were up 63% over the prior year and retirement plan deposits were up 15%. In individual life, we posted a year-over-year sales increase for the first time, since the second quarter of 2008. In consumer markets, the AARP through agent program continues to generate top line growth, accounting now for 20% of new business in the states where it's available. We're on track to have the AARP through agent offering in the 42 states in the second half of this year. For the rest of 2010, we anticipate a modestly improving economic environment, which should help to drive top line improvements in our more economically sensitive lines.
Finally, we were pleased to finish the quarter with book value per common share 61% higher than last March at $38.94. And more important is the fact that book value per share was essentially flat. We think, this is a good result, as rising prices on our fixed maturity holdings and the earnings power of our businesses offset the dilutive impacts of the capital raise.
We made significant progress strengthening the balance sheet this quarter. We had a very successful capital raise and were pleased by the reception we received from investors. We believe The Hartford now has the right capital structure for this environment and is positioned to move forward with a balance sheet that can handle any reasonable stress scenario.
As you know, we announced our go-forward plan earlier this month. The strategy leverages The Hartford's key strengths: a strong brand, a unique product breadth, enviable distribution and a large growing customer base across our organization. To ensure that we execute this plan and instill discipline and accountability for delivering results, Chris has established a team that will drive consistency, in terms of our changed processes and how we will measure progress and success. We are already well underway on work related to commercial markets, operations, IT and overall efficiency.
The Hartford's organization is shifting to the customer-focused structure. And teams are working together to call on customers, leverage best practices and importantly, win new business. As an example, within the last couple of weeks, our Commercial Markets business, a combination of Group Benefits and P&C commercial lines has had some early customer wins. Sales teams are beginning to join together, sharing information about relationships, sales practices and industry appetites. They are quickly uncovering new opportunities and we are encouraged by these early results. Brokers and agents have expressed support and enthusiasm, as this is the way many of them go to market. And they see the value of having a partner with a single point of accountability. 
Innovation is an important element of our strategy and earlier this week, we launched an important new product that combines, in a unique way, our expertise in workers' compensation, a traditional P&C discipline and group benefits, a traditional life discipline. With this innovative offering, which we call The Hartford Productivity Advantage, employers will be able to manage all types of employee leaves, workers' compensation, short-term and long-term disability and FMLA in one system. For an employer, this will make it easier for them to manage this complex process and will help them achieve efficiencies and improve productivity. This product gives us a distinct market advantage. This is something that a P&C-only or life-only company cannot easily match and it provides considerable advantages to time-and-money-strapped benefit managers. This is just the first of what we expect will be more one-of-a-kind value-added offerings that leverage our product breadth.
So in summary, the first quarter was a profitable and productive one for The Hartford. We executed our 2010 plan, strengthened the balance sheet and launched our go-forward strategy. We are moving forward to generate sustained profitable growth with strength, confidence, focus, and discipline.
The Hartford will celebrate its 200th anniversary on May 10. And over the next few weeks, you can expect to see the Hartford brand highly visible, as we celebrate our history, but more importantly, our future. Our employees and partners are excited to take this company into our third century. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris Swift, who will get into more detail on our financial results and outlook.

Good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you today. Let's begin on Slide 4. As we reported yesterday, net income for the first quarter was $319 million and core earnings were $545 million. On a per-share basis, we reported core earni",1749,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you today. Let's begin on Slide 4. As we reported yesterday, net income for the first quarter was $319 million and core earnings were $545 million. On a per-share basis, we reported core earnings of $0.14 and a net loss of $0.42. These numbers reflect the $440 million CPP repayment charge that was previously disclosed. Because the CPP charge runs through retained earnings, it reduces the computation of per-share amounts for net income in core earnings. The first quarter core earnings impact from this charge was $1.03 per share. First quarter results were generally in line with our expectations that reflect strong performance in most segments. The quarter also benefited from several items, including an $85 million DAC unlock, net prior-year reserve releases of $58 million and lower realized capital losses. 
As Liam mentioned, several one-time charges impacted first quarter results. In addition to the CPP charge, we accrued a litigation charge of $47 million or $0.11 per share. This relates to an agreement in principle that we reached earlier this month to resolve a 2005 class action related to our structured settlement business. The quarter also included a $19 million tax charge arising from the new federal healthcare bill, as we disclosed on April 1. In total, these one-time items amounted to roughly $1.18 per share in the quarter.
As Liam also mentioned, all-in book value per share was essentially flat in the quarter when compared to year-end 2009. As we said at our April 1 investor event, going forward, we will report diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI. This calculation has two benefits. First, it eliminates volatility from mark-to-mark changes in our investment portfolio. And second, it takes into account the preferred shares we issued in March, as well as the outstanding warrants. You could see in the slide that diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI, ended the first quarter at $39.85. 
Finally, core earnings ROE for the 12 months ended March 2010 was 10.6%. This includes the benefit of approximately $750 million of positive DAC unlocks over the past four quarters. This benefit was partially offset by the $440 million CPP charge in the first quarter. Excluding these two items, core earnings ROE was 9%.
Let's move to Slide 5. Before I begin, I want to update you on a few changes in our segment reporting. In our investor event in April, we announced that we would organize The Hartford around its customer segments. The process of reorganizing the company is underway and we tend to align our segment reporting with the new organization later this year, beginning with our third quarter results. That said, we did make two changes in our Life segment in the first quarter. The first change was to move the Mutual Fund business from the old Retail segment into a new segment called Retirement. The new Retirement segment includes Mutual Fund and Retirement Plans businesses. The first quarter investor supplement restates prior periods to reflect this change. The second change was to combine all mutual fund related assets and results within the Mutual Fund business. This change was made on a prospective basis only, beginning with the first quarter of 2010.
Previously, the mutual fund related assets and results were reported in several segments. As a result, it was impossible for investors to see the totality of our mutual fund complex. With almost $98 billion of assets under management, we believe it was important to clarify the size and scale of this operation. 
Now moving back to Slide 5. Let's discuss our operating performance for the quarter. Although we intend to formally change our reporting structure for our third quarter results, my comments in the slide are organized around our new customer-centric businesses. First, consumer markets. We continue to strike the right balance between growth and profitability. Written premiums were $941 million, essentially flat to last year. The current accident year combined ratio was 91.1%, excluding cat [catastrophe], which were in line with our expectations. We've been taking a number of actions to improve profitability in both auto and home. These steps include improving rate in both lines, while focusing new business on more profitable 40-plus preferred and near-preferred consumer segments. We are seeing the benefits of these actions, as 80% of the new business in the first quarter came from these more profitable segments. Additionally, premium retention improved to 87%, driven by 5% and 9% increases in auto and home, respectively. We are pleased with the growth opportunities in this business. Policies in force grew year-over-year in both auto and home, even as we raised rates. A significant contributor to that growth is our unique AARP relationship, which we continue to expand with our AARP-through-agents initiative.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for the discussion of the commercial markets results. Our Property and Casualty commercial lines continue to execute well in the quarter. Underwriting profitability was strong, with x cat accident year combined ratio of 92.8%. This ratio reflects strong performance in small commercial, middle market and specialty commercial operations, with lost costs remaining within expectation. Our renewal pricing was positive in middle market and small commercial, as we continue to take rate where appropriate. Written premiums for the first quarter were essentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2009. The weak economy continues to depress exposure levels, particularly for our larger policy holders. In middle market, a reduction in auto premiums lowered year-over-year growth by three percentage points. However, improving policy and premium retention and new business growth were enough to offset the impact of the weak economy in the quarter. Small Commercial business climbed 9% in the quarter and year-over-year policies in force grew 4%,  driven by the success of our growing Spectrum business owner's policy.
Also highlighted on Slide 6, is our Group Benefits business. Fully insured premiums for group insurance had been pressured by lower payrolls. The lower premium, along with the increase in morbidity and higher commissions in our loss-rated business, weighed down first quarter results. Quarter also reflected typical seasonality we expect, with respect to severity.
Now let's turn to the first quarter Wealth Management results on Slide 7. Our Wealth Management business showed increasing sales momentum in the first quarter. Mutual Fund business had another outstanding quarter with deposits totaling $4.4 billion, up 63% over first quarter of 2009 on a comparable basis. The significant growth was driven by a combination of strong fund performance and improving equity markets. Looking ahead, we have launched several initiatives to increase institutional mutual fund activity in the remainder of 2010.
In Retirement Plans, strong fourth quarter sales drove a 15% year-over-year increase in first quarter deposit to $2.6 billion. First quarter sales were also strong and we could end the year closer to the top end of our deposit guidance if payrolls rise and plan sponsors restart their matching programs. We also saw a top line improvement in individual life, with sales up 5% year-over-year. The growth was driven by traction in the independent producer channel, activity levels have been steadily rising and we are optimistic about sales growth potential from this new distribution opportunity. As expected, U.S. variable annuity sales for the first quarter were down from prior year at $454 million. 
Feedback on our Personal Retirement Manager product continues to be positive. However, the process of launching the product in all states and with all our key distribution partners is frankly, taking longer than we anticipated. In light of first quarter sales and the slower product launch, we have lowered our full year guidance for VA sales to range from $1.4 billion to $2.2 billion.
Finally, profitability in all our Wealth Management businesses in the first quarter was significantly higher than prior-year levels. Margins have increased due to strong equity market appreciation and the expense action the company completed in 2009. In addition, we have benefited from positive net flows in our Non-Annuity businesses.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a review of our investment results. We saw significant improvements in our investment portfolio in the first quarter. Slide 8 shows the extent to which unrealized losses declined, spread tightening was the primary driver for the improvement. This favorable trend has continued in April, as prices in the CMBS markets have continued to improve. First quarter impairments were $152 million, this is the lowest level The Hartford has seen since before the financial crisis. Primary source of the impairments was collateral deterioration in specific CMBS and CRE CDO security. We also recorded a mortgage loan valuation allowance of $112 million in the first quarter. In connection with our ongoing de-risking efforts, we have been selling mezzanine loans and BPs [ph] loan participation. During the quarter, we sold approximately $600 million of these loans.
We've also identified another $400 million of loans that we intend to sell over the next 90 to 180 days. Most of the valuation that we accrued in the first quarter is attributable to these loans. Once we complete the planned sales, the carrying value of the company's mezzanine and BPs [ph] loans will be less than $500 million, down over 70% since year-end 2008. These actions have meaningfully reduced the risk in our ongoing portfolio and Greg and his team are doing an outstanding job in this effort.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 for our updated guidance. As we announced last evening, our new core earnings guidance for 2010 is between $2.70 and $3 per share. The updated range takes into account our first quarter results, as well as a slightly weaker Group Benefits outlook for the remainder of the year. A number of assumptions embedded in the guidance are listed on Slide 9. I won't review them with you today, but they are key to understanding the guidance. Finally, you will see in our earnings release, that we updated guidance for deposits, net flows and ROA in our Mutual Fund business to reflect the reporting changes we made. 
Our first quarter results can be summarized as follows: Core earnings were generally in line with our expectation; top line momentum is building across many of our ongoing businesses; our investment portfolio benefited from favorable credit markets, a trend that we continue to see in April; and finally, we increased our full year core earnings guidance by $0.10 per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick, as we move into the Q&A session."

So we expected it to be the longest to see the downturn, and therefore, the upturn should occur during 2010, culminating in the first quarter of 2011, which when we get all of our national account sales. So the biggest clients that we have, which is about 60% of our business, are generally one-on-one clients for when the sales occur. And that's what you're seeing in the first quarter here. We do see positive trends developing now, although the market continues to be very competitive from a pricing standpoint. And there is somewhat less activity in the market as people are effectively defending their existing positions."

I would say, we're getting increased traction. We have reorganized that team to align better with the rest of our Mutual Fund business over the last six months. It used to be in our Institutional segment. We've aligned it with the Mutual Fund segment to give a better opportunity there.

We're going to run our Annuity business against those three principles that we've been consistent in communicating. We want it to be a lower-cost product for the customer. We want it to be a simpler product, and we want it to be focused on guaranteed income. So because it's different in concept, it is taking longer.

Before we get started, I want to welcome Chris Swift to his first Hartford Earnings Call. I'm pleased to have him on-board and appreciate his contributions to what the Company has accomplished in the past 60 days. I also want to thank those of you who joined us earlier this month for our investor presentation, either in person in New York or on the webcast. We appreciate the positive feedback, as well as the questions we've received and we're now focused on executing our strategy in achieving the financial targets we set, high single-digit core earnings growth and an 11% ROE by 2012. 
I'll provide some additional color on the strategy today and share some of our earlier progress. Obviously, success will not come in one quarter and instead, will be measured by the results we generate over the next few years. And as I've said, since my arrival, our goal is to deliver superior shareholder returns over time through a sustained profitable growth, and that is what we intend to do.
We made good progress in the first quarter. We continue to execute on our 2010 plans, strengthen the balance sheet with a successful capital raise and the TARP repayment and launched our new strategy. While there is more to do, frankly, we got a lot done. I want to thank The Hartford team for all their hard work and efforts. 
With net income of $319 million, the first quarter marked our second consecutive profitable quarter and as a company committed to driving sustained profitability, this is an important result. A strong equity market, our continued commitment to underwriting discipline, and improving credit markets, all contributed to our results.
Chris will go into more detail, but we did have a few one-time charges for the quarter, relating to the TARP repurchase, the settlement of a litigation matter and the impact of new federal healthcare legislation. Without these items, core earnings would have been over $1.30 per share. The first quarter also showed growing top line momentum across many of our business lines, including Mutual Funds, Retirement Plans and P&C commercial lines. Both Small Commercial and Middle Market continued to generate profitable new business growth in the first quarter. They also reported meaningful increases in policy retention. In fact, in Small Commercial, we added more new business policies and had the highest policy count retention in three years. 
In Wealth Management, net flows were positive and sales showed year-over-year gains in most of our ongoing businesses. Mutual fund sales were up 63% over the prior year and retirement plan deposits were up 15%. In individual life, we posted a year-over-year sales increase for the first time, since the second quarter of 2008. In consumer markets, the AARP through agent program continues to generate top line growth, accounting now for 20% of new business in the states where it's available. We're on track to have the AARP through agent offering in 42 states in the second half of this year. For the rest of 2010, we anticipate a modestly improving economic environment, which should help to drive top line improvements in our more economically sensitive lines.
Finally, we were pleased to finish the quarter with book value per common share 61% higher than last March at $38.94. More important is the fact that book value per share was essentially flat. We think this is a good result, as rising prices on our fixed maturity holdings and the earnings power of our businesses offset the dilutive impacts of the capital raise.
We made significant progress strengthening the balance sheet this quarter. We had a very successful capital raise and were pleased by the reception we received from investors. We believe The Hartford now has the right capital structure for this environment and is positioned to move forward with a balance sheet that can handle any reasonable stress scenario.
As you know, we announced our go-forward plan earlier this month. The strategy leverages The Hartford's key strengths: a strong brand, a unique product breadth, enviable distribution and a large growing customer base across our organization. To ensure that we execute this plan and instill discipline and accountability for delivering results, Chris has established a team that will drive consistency in terms of our changed processes and how we will measure progress and success. We are already well underway on work related to commercial markets, operations, IT and overall efficiency.
The Hartford's organization is shifting to the customer-focused structure. And teams are working together to call on customers, leverage best practices and importantly, win new business. As an example, within the last couple of weeks, our Commercial Markets business, a combination of Group Benefits and P&C commercial lines has had some early customer wins. Sales teams are beginning to join together, sharing information about relationships, sales practices and industry appetites. They are quickly uncovering new opportunities and we are encouraged by these early results. Brokers and agents have expressed support and enthusiasm, as this is the way many of them go to market. And they see the value of having a partner with a single point of accountability. 
Innovation is an important element of our strategy. And earlier this week, we launched an important new product that combines, in a unique way, our expertise in workers' compensation, a traditional P&C discipline and group benefits, a traditional life discipline. With this innovative offering, which we call The Hartford Productivity Advantage, employers will be able to manage all types of employee leaves, workers' compensation, short-term and long-term disability and FMLA in one system. For an employer, this will make it easier for them to manage this complex process and will help them achieve efficiencies and improve productivity. This product gives us a distinct market advantage. This is something that a P&C-only or life-only company cannot easily match and it provides considerable advantages to time- and-money-strapped benefit managers. This is just the first of what we expect will be more one-of-a-kind value-added offerings that leverage our product breadth.
So in summary, the first quarter was a profitable and productive one for The Hartford. We executed our 2010 plan, strengthened the balance sheet and launched our go-forward strategy. We are moving forward to generate sustained profitable growth with strength, confidence, focus and discipline.
The Hartford will celebrate its 200th anniversary on May 10. And over the next few weeks, you can expect to see the Hartford brand highly visible, as we celebrate our history, but more importantly, our future. Our employees and partners are excited to take this company into our third century. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris Swift, who will get into more detail on our financial results and outlook. Chris?"
341546,100072355,59978,"Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2010",2010-04-30,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you today. Let's begin on Slide 4. As we reported yesterday, net income for the first quarter was $319 million and core earnings were $545 million. On a per-share basis, we reported core ear",1751,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you today. 
Let's begin on Slide 4. As we reported yesterday, net income for the first quarter was $319 million and core earnings were $545 million. On a per-share basis, we reported core earnings of $0.14 and a net loss of $0.42. These numbers reflect the $440 million CPP repayment charge that was previously disclosed. Because the CPP charge runs through retained earnings, it reduces the computation of per-share amounts for net income and core earnings. The first quarter core earnings impact from this charge was $1.03 per share. First quarter results were generally in line with our expectations that reflect strong performance in most segments. The quarter also benefited from several items, including an $85 million DAC unlock, net prior-year reserve releases of $58 million and lower realized capital losses. 
As Liam mentioned, several one-time charges impacted first quarter results. In addition to the CPP charge, we accrued a litigation charge of $47 million or $0.11 per share. This relates to an agreement in principle that we reached earlier this month to resolve a 2005 class action related to our structured settlement business. The quarter also included a $19 million tax charge arising from the new federal healthcare bill, as we disclosed on April 1. In total, these one-time items amounted to roughly $1.18 per share in the quarter.
As Liam also mentioned, all-in book value per share was essentially flat in the quarter when compared to year-end 2009. As we said at our April 1 investor event, going forward, we will report diluted book value per share excluding AOCI. This calculation has two benefits. First, it eliminates volatility from mark-to-mark [mark-to-market] changes in our investment portfolio. And second, it takes into account the preferred shares we issued in March, as well as the outstanding warrants. You could see in the slide that diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI, ended the first quarter at $39.85. 
Finally, core earnings ROE for the 12 months ended March 2010 was 10.6%. This includes the benefit of approximately $750 million of positive DAC unlocks over the past four quarters. This benefit was partially offset by the $440 million CPP charge in the first quarter. Excluding these two items, core earnings ROE was 9%.
Let's move to Slide 5. Before I begin, I want to update you on a few changes in our segment reporting. In our investor event in April, we announced that we would organize The Hartford around its customer segments. The process of reorganizing the company is underway and we intend to align our segment reporting with the new organization later this year, beginning with our third quarter results. 
That said, we did make two changes in our Life segment in the first quarter. The first change was to move the Mutual Fund business from the old Retail segment into a new segment called Retirement. The new Retirement segment includes Mutual Fund and Retirement Plans businesses. The first quarter investor supplement restates prior periods to reflect this change. The second change was to combine all mutual fund related assets and results within the Mutual Fund business. This change was made on a prospective basis only, beginning with the first quarter of 2010.
Previously, the mutual fund related assets and results were reported in several segments. As a result, it was impossible for investors to see the totality of our mutual fund complex. With almost $98 billion of assets under management, we believe it was important to clarify the size and scale of this operation. 
Now moving back to Slide 5. Let's discuss our operating performance for the quarter. Although we intend to formally change our reporting structure for our third quarter results, my comments in the slide are organized around our new customer-centric businesses. 
First, consumer markets. We continue to strike the right balance between growth and profitability. Written premiums were $941 million, essentially flat to last year. The current year accident year combined ratio was 91.1%, excluding cats [catastrophe], which were in line with our expectations. We've been taking a number of actions to improve profitability in both auto and home. These steps include improving rate in both lines, while focusing new business on more profitable 40-plus preferred and near-preferred consumer segments. We are seeing the benefits of these actions, as 80% of the new business in the first quarter came from these more profitable segments. Additionally, premium retention improved to 87%, driven by 5% and 9% increases in auto and home, respectively. We are pleased with the growth opportunities in this business. Policies in force grew year-over-year in both auto and home, even as we raised rates. A significant contributor to that growth is our unique AARP relationship, which we continue to expand with our AARP-through-agents initiative.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for the discussion of the commercial markets results. Our Property and Casualty commercial lines continue to execute well in the quarter. Underwriting profitability was strong, with x cat accident year combined ratio of 92.8%. This ratio reflects strong performance in small commercial, middle market and specialty commercial operations, with lost costs remaining within expectation. Our renewal pricing was positive in middle market and small commercial, as we continue to take rate where appropriate. Written premiums for the first quarter were essentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2009. The weak economy continues to depress exposure levels, particularly for our larger policy holders. In middle market, a reduction in auto premiums lowered year-over-year growth by three percentage points. However, improving policy and premium retention and new business growth were enough to offset the impact of the weak economy in the quarter. Small Commercial business climbed 9% in the quarter and year-over-year policies in force grew 4%,  driven by the success of our growing Spectrum business owner's policy.
Also highlighted on Slide 6, is our Group Benefits business. Fully insured premiums for group insurance had been pressured by lower payrolls. The lower premium, along with the increase in morbidity and higher commissions in our loss-rated business, weighed down first quarter results. Quarter also reflected typical seasonality we expect, with respect to severity.
Now let's turn to the first quarter Wealth Management results on Slide 7. Our Wealth Management business showed increasing sales momentum in the first quarter. Mutual Fund business had another outstanding quarter with deposits totaling $4.4 billion, up 63% over first quarter of 2009 on a comparable basis. The significant growth was driven by a combination of strong fund performance and improving equity markets. Looking ahead, we have launched several initiatives to increase institutional mutual fund activity in the remainder of 2010.
In Retirement Plans, strong fourth quarter sales drove a 15% year-over-year increase in first quarter deposit to $2.6 billion. First quarter sales were also strong and we could end the year closer to the top end of our deposit guidance if payrolls rise and plan sponsors restart their matching programs. We also saw a top line improvement in individual life, with sales up 5% year-over-year. The growth was driven by traction in the independent producer channel, activity levels have been steadily rising and we are optimistic about sales growth potential from this new distribution opportunity. As expected, U.S. variable annuity sales for the first quarter were down from prior year at $454 million. 
Feedback on our Personal Retirement Manager product continues to be positive. However, the process of launching the product in all states and with all our key distribution partners is frankly, taking longer than we anticipated. In light of first quarter sales and the slower product launch, we have lowered our full year guidance for VA sales to range from $1.4 billion to $2.2 billion.
Finally, profitability in all our Wealth Management businesses in the first quarter was significantly higher than prior-year levels. Margins have increased due to strong equity market appreciation and the expense action the company completed in 2009. In addition, we have benefited from positive net flows in our Non-Annuity businesses.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a review of our investment results. We saw significant improvements in our investment portfolio in the first quarter. Slide 8 shows the extent to which unrealized losses declined, spread tightening was the primary driver for the improvement. This favorable trend has continued in April, as prices in the CMBS markets have continued to improve. First quarter impairments were $152 million, this is the lowest level The Hartford has seen since before the financial crisis. Primary source of the impairments was collateral deterioration in specific CMBS and CRE CDO security. We also recorded a mortgage loan valuation allowance of $112 million in the first quarter. In connection with our ongoing de-risking efforts, we have been selling mezzanine loans and BPs [ph] loan participation. During the quarter, we sold approximately $600 million of these loans.
We've also identified another $400 million of loans that we intend to sell over the next 90 to 180 days. Most of the valuation that we accrued in the first quarter is attributable to these loans. Once we complete the planned sales, the carrying value of the company's mezzanine and BPs [ph] loans will be less than $500 million, down over 70% since year-end 2008. These actions have meaningfully reduced the risk in our ongoing portfolio and Greg and his team are doing an outstanding job in this effort.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 for our updated guidance. As we announced last evening, our new core earnings guidance for 2010 is between $2.70 and $3 per share. The updated range takes into account our first quarter results, as well as a slightly weaker Group Benefits outlook for the remainder of the year. A number of assumptions embedded in the guidance are listed on Slide 9. I won't review them with you today, but they are key to understanding the guidance. Finally, you will see in our earnings release, that we updated guidance for deposits, net flows and ROA in our Mutual Fund business to reflect the reporting changes we made. 
Our first quarter results can be summarized as follows: Core earnings were generally in line with our expectation; top line momentum is building across many of our ongoing businesses; our investment portfolio benefited from favorable credit markets, a trend that we continue to see in April; and finally, we increased our full year core earnings guidance by $0.10 per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick, as we move into the Q&A session."

And then as we've said, we had got a couple of key states that are pending, and we're optimistic that those will get approved either in the second or early third quarters."

We took some opportunities to put some protection on there just to cover some tail risk. So I would say, generally, as we've thought about or if you've thought about the program in the past, it's relatively consistent with another year of protection on a macro equity basis."

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I want to welcome Dave Levinson. Last month, as you know, I asked Dave to lead Wealth Management and as we shared with you in April, we see exciting opportunities for this business.
The Hartford performed well in the second quarter. First, we reported good core results, with healthy top line momentum in many of our businesses. Second, we saw significant improvements in the investment portfolio. And third, we are well underway executing the go-forward plan we outlined in April.
As I said, The Hartford reported good overall results in the quarter. Given the economy, the volatile equity markets and as you already know, issues specific to the P&C and life industries, I was pleased that we navigated well through a bumpy quarter. We earned $76 million of net income compared to a net loss of $15 million in the second quarter of 2009. Core earnings were $92 million in the second quarter and included higher-than-expected catastrophes, a DAC unlock, an annual asbestos reserve charge, goodwill impairment and favorable prior-year reserve development in ongoing P&C.
When you account for these items, adjusted core earnings were about $0.92 per diluted share. We believe this figure demonstrates the underlying earnings power of the company. Chris will discuss how we get to that number in detail later in his remarks.
Book value per share was up 6% sequentially to $41.29. And with the market volatility we saw in May and June, I am pleased with the continued strength of our capital position. Revenues, excluding net realized capital gains and trading securities grew 3% year-over-year. We saw good top line momentum in many of our key businesses.
In P&C Small Commercial segment, written premium grew 3% over the prior year, reflecting positive renewal pricing and a 9% increase in new business policy count. In P&C Middle Market, price competition is intense, and we are balancing growth and profitability. So we were pleased that pricing on renewals was flat. And policy count retention increased 2% over the prior year. Chris will talk more about Group Benefits later in the call but results there were below our expectations. We see some near-term challenges in this business and are working hard to address them.
In Wealth Management, sales and deposits increased in many businesses. Retirement plan deposits increased 12% over the prior year. Mutual fund deposits were up 11%, and Life insurance sales grew 8%. Second, over the last year, we have seen significant improvements in the investment portfolio. In the second quarter, we had a 13% increase in net investment income, excluding trading securities, driven by strong partnership returns. Another positive sign was that net unrealized losses declined by more than 50% since March 31 to $1.5 billion. We are also seeing favorable trends on impairments, which declined again this quarter. Barring a severe economic or market reversal and given the actions we've taken today, we believe the worst is behind us on impairments. Over the next several quarters, we expect to see credit losses similar to those we've experienced in the first half of the year.
Given the recent interest in municipal bonds, I want to provide some background on our $12.5 billion portfolio. We feel good about this portfolio given its broad diversification and high average credit quality of AA-. We are heavily weighted towards general obligation and essential service revenue bonds that are supported by clearly defined and dedicated tax or revenue sources. We have also reduced exposure to municipalities in areas of particular economic stress. As Rick said, Greg is here for the Q&A session to answer questions you may have on the portfolio.
Finally, I want to provide an update on the company's strategy. We're making good progress executing on the plan we outlined in April and are seeing a number of encouraging signs. On July 1, we completed the transition to a new organizational structure. Leadership of the Commercial Markets and Wealth Management business unit is in place. We also have a number of very good candidates for the Consumer Markets role and expect to have that position filled in the early fall.
Now as I mentioned earlier, I'm pleased to have Dave Levinson lead Wealth Management. In his 15 years at The Hartford, he has a broad range of experience across Wealth Management, which along with his strategic vision and bias for action, are among the key reasons I selected him for this role. I have charged him with accelerating the profitable growth of Wealth Management, working within the strategy we announced in April. I can tell you that Dave is moving quickly and decisively to identify the best individual and collective opportunities for these businesses.
I've also asked Dave to review the Annuity business, including the performance of Personal Retirement Manager. The new product is now broadly available in the marketplace and the next few quarters will be critical in determining its ultimate success. As we said in April, annuities with an appropriate balance of risk and return are an important part of The Hartford's Wealth Management business. We are committed to the Annuities business and we continue to invest in product, distribution and marketing going forward. And finally, I'm excited about our unique potential to profitably grow in the Wealth Management business. 
In Commercial markets, we're optimistic about our go-to-market strategy. I'm pleased with the early results coming from the combination of our Group Benefits and Commercial P&C businesses. Together, the efforts of these two sales teams have already built a solid pipeline, with close to 1,000 new opportunities, a significant percentage of which we have already quoted. Our early joint efforts have generated several million dollars in sales to date. Juan and his team are optimistic about using this collaborative business model on the full year sales cycle in 2011.
And consistent with that, we're implementing additional sales tools to drive the sustained success across this organization, which include: Cross-train the P&C and GBD sales organizations on each other's products; launching new compensation, incentive and recognition plans to align individual and agency objectives with this strategy; new marketing materials that better articulate to our customers the value proposition of the combined Commercial Markets business; and we have established a set of metrics that will measure the success of our sales teams.
The Consumer Markets team is also executing on its strategy. In auto and homeowners insurance, our focus on the 40-plus age group is resulting in a higher percentage of preferred business. As an example, in the agency channel, preferred new auto and home business as a percentage of the total, has increased by more than 7% over the past six months. The team is also off to a fast start in creating new affinity relationships, as we are already in conversations with several large potential partners. This was important, since there is generally a long sales cycle for affinity relationships. We're optimistic about the potential for future top line growth from this strategy and the value for both us and our partners.
As we also discussed in our April investor meeting, we are committed to simplifying The Hartford and making the company more efficient. Our first important step was to bring together the company's service operations into one enterprise organization. This will allow us to share resources and best practices, further enhance customer service and drive efficiencies. Our ultimate objective is to give customers a one Hartford, one brand experience.
Now before I close, I want to comment briefly on the economy. We continue at The Hartford to anticipate a slow and choppy economic recovery. Recent GDP and payroll data has been consistent with this view. We believe the steps we have taken over the last several months and will take in the future months leave us well prepared to profitably grow.
To conclude, The Hartford reported good results in the second quarter, with healthy top line momentum in many of our businesses and an increase in book value. We saw significant improvements in the investment portfolio and we are well underway executing on our go-forward plan.
With the first half of 2010 complete, I am fully confident in the future of The Hartford and in our ability to meet the 2012 financial targets we laid out for you in April.
Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to talk about the quarter in more detail. Chris?"
341546,108916967,72465,"Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-05-2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Liam.

Second quarter results were very noisy. To help bett",2222,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. As Liam mentioned, net income for the second quarter was $76 million. Reported core earnings were $92 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Second quarter results were very noisy. To help better understand the company's core earnings strength, I'd like to discuss our calculation of adjusted core earnings, which we estimate at $460 million or $0.92 per diluted share. 
Our estimate of adjusted core earnings excludes five items: The DAC unlock; higher-than-budgeted catastrophe losses; a goodwill impairment; a second quarter asbestos reserve charge; and net positive prior-year development in P&C ongoing operations.
Let's spend a few moments looking at these items in greater detail. The DAC unlock charge to core earnings was $168 million or $0.34 per share, resulting from global equity market declines in the second quarter. To put this into perspective, since The Hartford began using reversion to the mean for our return assumptions, we've had positive DAC unlocks totaling about $750 million through the first quarter of 2010. These unlocks were primarily driven by the 47% rise in the S&P over that period of time. So with the markets down 12% in the second quarter, you can see that the DAC unlock charge was proportional to the market move. 
This was also an unusually high catastrophe quarter for The Hartford, with pre-tax losses of $229 million. On an after-tax basis, it was $0.18 higher per share than our budget. These losses were primarily driven by the severe hale and wind storms in the Midwest and are in line with others in the industry. While the second quarter was very active, potential fee management remains the strength of The Hartford. Although higher than budgeted, the losses we experienced were within the expected range of volatility for these types of events.
We also took a $110 million after-tax charge in the second quarter to increase asbestos reserves. This equates to about $0.22 per share. The charge follows the company's annual review of its asbestos exposures and was driven by increased severity in loss adjustment expenses, including litigation costs. These factors are generally consistent with the broader industry trend.
In contrast, reserves in our ongoing operations developed favorably during the quarter. In general, we saw positive reserve development across our liability line, primarily for accident years 2007 and prior. In total, net prior-year reserve releases in ongoing operations were $97 million after tax, a benefit of $0.19 per share. Even after these releases, our reserve position remains strong, with carried reserves higher than our actuarial indication and consistent with prior reserve positions at the end of 2008 and '09.
Finally, we wrote off most of the goodwill associated with Federal Trust Bank. This resulted in a $100 million impairment charge or about $0.20 per share. We acquired Federal Trust in the second quarter of 2009 in connection with the CPP investment. GAAP accounting calls for annual goodwill testing, which we performed for the first time in the second quarter. Backing up these five items, you get adjusted core earnings of $0.92 per diluted share. This is a good indication of the fundamental earnings power of the franchise.
Going back to Slide 4, we are pleased with all-in book value growth of 6% to $41.29 per share. Book value growth was driven by the decline in unrealized losses in the investment portfolio. Diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 3% during the quarter to $40.95. The increase was a result of second quarter net income and a lower Hartford share price, which reduced dilution from our outstanding warrants. 
Finally, the core earnings ROE for the 12 months ended June 2010 was 7.4%. Excluding the charge we recognized in connection with the CPP repayment in the first quarter, the core earnings ROE for the last four quarters was 9.7%.
Now, let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our second quarter results in Consumer Markets. We continue to position ourselves to generate growth and profitability in Personal Lines. The rate in underwriting actions we have taken to preserve margins continue to work their way through the book. For the second quarter, renewal price increases were 6% and 9% for auto and home, respectively. Written premium was off 1% from prior year. Policies in force were also down about 1%. This was expected as we transitioned to a more preferred book of business. 
Profitability in Personal Lines was impacted by elevated cat activity in the second quarter. Excluding cat, the current accident year combined ratio was a solid 93.2%. This is about three points higher than prior year. As a result, we expect to continue to take rate increases in auto and home going forward. 
Looking ahead, we are excited about the growth opportunities in Consumer Markets. Our premium retention is increasing as we take rate. And we are generating a higher concentration of preferred business. We expect written premium to improve in the second half of the year in response to increased marketing, and we are excited about the rollout of our universal auto product, which we plan to have in 36 states by the end of the year.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our Commercial Markets results. In P&C, commercial lines performed well in the second quarter, with top line drivers trending favorably and the profitability of the underlying business remaining strong. P&C commercial insurance reported a 93.7% current accident year combined ratio, excluding cats, a good result at this point in the cycle. Our Small Commercial franchise continues to outperform the market, with an 85.9% combined ratio on the same basis. Plus, Small Commercial written premium improved 3% in the quarter, driven by positive renewal pricing and new business policy count growth of 9%.
We are seeing continued stabilization in pricing in the smaller end of the Commercial Markets. Renewal pricing in the second quarter was plus 3% in Small Commercial. However, industry pressure on pricing is more evident in our Middle Market and Specialty businesses. We are utilizing our sophisticated modeling capabilities to carefully balance profitability and growth on a granular level. We continue to maintain pricing discipline as demonstrated by flat renewal pricing in Middle Market for the last three quarters. We are taking rate as necessary and turning away business that does not meet our targeted returns. 
On the top line, exposure reductions continue to impact our results. In Middle Market, auto premiums reduced written premiums by five points compared to the second quarter of 2009. That said, we are seeing signs that the decline in exposures is moderating. Endorsement activity is up and the rate of mid-term cancellations has declined. We expect these trends to continue.
Looking to the second half of 2010, we will continue to execute on initiatives to position ourselves for growth as the economy recovers by working to increase policy counts, driving to improve policy retention, and targeting areas of profitable new business growth, such as our industry verticals. 
In our Group Benefits business, second quarter results were below our expectations, with core earnings of $34 million. The industry is experiencing higher disability claims frequency and we saw similar trends in the second quarter. We have closely reviewed our disability claims experience and the increased frequency is not correlated to any industry or plan size. This suggests that the overall frequencies maybe returning to historical levels. In response, we are taking rate in our disability lines to ensure that we continue to generate targeted margins going forward. On the top line, sales increased 13% over prior year, with persistency topping 90%. Fully insured ongoing premiums in Group Benefits declined 2%, pressured by lower payrolls and the sales challenges that were unique to The Hartford over the past year.
Looking ahead, Group Benefits is a great business and fits well with our strategy for Commercial Markets. Some top line and bottom line challenges exist. And Ron and his team are closely reviewing all elements of this business.
Now let's turn to Wealth Management results on Slide 7. Once you exclude the effects of the DAC unlock in the second quarter, margins in Wealth Management businesses continued to recover from last year's level. The margin improvements are being driven by year-over-year equity market appreciation and positive net flows in the non-annuity businesses. For the U.S. annuities business, core earnings, ex the DAC unlock were $98 million in the second quarter. This is a 61% increase over prior year and was driven by higher average account values. In international annuities, core earnings, ex the DAC unlock, were $59 million, an 84% increase over prior year. This increase is the result of higher account values, as well as the significant expense reductions in our Japanese and UK operations. In mutual funds, deposits totaled $4.3 billion. This is an 11% increase over the second quarter of 2009 on a comparable basis, demonstrating the strength of our distribution platform. Core earnings were $22 million, up sharply from the year-ago quarter.
In retirement plans, second quarter deposits were $2 billion, up 12% over prior year. Core earnings in the second quarter, excluding the DAC unlock were $13 million, more than double from prior year. Our transition to one administration platform is on track for completion in the second quarter of 2011. This scalable platform will be key to expanding margins in this business. 
In our individual Life business, second quarter results were very strong. Core earnings, ex-DAC unlock, jumped to a record $55 million. We benefited from favorable mortality, as claims in large face in our policies were lower than the rolling four-quarter average. On the top line, life insurance sales were up 8% over prior year. We are expanding in the independent agent space. We've signed up more than 400 of the nation's largest independent life insurance producers, with an initiative that began earlier this year.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a review of our investment results. Once again, there was significant improvement in the investment portfolio in the quarter. As the slide shows, net unrealized losses continued to decline and as of June 30, were at their lowest levels since 2007. The main driver of the improvement was lower interest rates, which were partially offset by modest spread widening in a number of fixed maturity asset classes. 
Impairments also improved during the quarter. Total impairments, including OTTI and mortgage loan valuation allowances were $148 million. The primary source of these impairments was weaker collateral performance in certain commercial real estate securities. Net investment income, excluding trading securities, was $1.2 billion, 13% higher than prior year. Strong performance from partnerships and alternative investments drove the improvement, and generated a 20% annualized return this past quarter. This is a great result and we have been pleased by the recovery here. However, given the volatility of returns over the last couple of years in this asset class, we think it is prudent to stick with our guidance assumption of zero return at least for the balance of 2010. Longer term, we expect this asset class to yield 6% to 8% annually.
Finally, we continued to reposition the general account assets. Over the course of the second quarter, we reduced net commercial real estate exposures by almost $800 million. As we said in April, we are balancing yield, capital and fair value in determining whether to hold or sell individual securities. Our purchase activity favored higher quality corporate debt, as well as agency-backed MBS. In total, we purchased about $2.1 billion of corporate debt and slightly less than $1 billion of agency-backed MBS.
We like the progress we're making in the investment portfolio. The actions we have taken have improved the risk profile of the general account. And while liquidity remains higher than our long-term target, for now, we like the flexibility it affords us in this investment environment.
Now, let's turn to Slide 9 for our updated guidance. As we announced last evening, our core 2010 earnings guidance is $2.10 to $2.30 per share. At the midpoint, the guidance range implies core earnings of about $0.90 per share for each of the next two quarters, taking into account a slightly higher share count. The updated range reflects actual core earnings results for the first half of the year, equity market levels at the end of July, a modestly lower Group Benefits margin. Otherwise, there are no changes to the second half outlook.
As we said in April, our third quarter financial results will reflect the new organizational structure. We will provide the analyst investor community with recast historical financial information to update your models well in advance of the earnings call.
Our second quarter results can be summarized as follows: [ph] (49:13) Through a period of market volatility, with several items impacting earnings, the core franchise performed well and our capital position remained very strong, with statutory surplus essentially unchanged from year-end levels; investments continue to recover, with net unrealized losses declining 50% to $1.5 billion; we are balancing growth and profitability in a low interest rate environment today, while continuing to invest in our businesses for the future; and finally, we operationalized a new strategy focusing on customers, brand, growth and efficiency, with early signs of traction.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick as we move into the Q&A session."

Lastly, just to reiterate, we are committed to the Annuity business.

But in general, we feel from a de-risking standpoint, we feel largely through most of that portfolio positioning. In terms of CMBS, which was the second part of your question. In the second quarter, we sold about $600 million of CMBS holdings. Most of those were to take advantage of an improvement that we've seen in CMBS pricing overall. We sold those at a net slight unrealized gain for the quarter.

On lapses, as you know, we're in the middle of our review right now. I don't think we have a definitive view, if we're seeing a trend one way or the other at this point in time. So as we continue to close out the third quarter, we'll keep you posted as far as what we're seeing. But right now, we don't have any indications one way or the other."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I want to welcome Dave Levinson. Last month, as you know, I asked Dave to lead Wealth Management and as we shared with you in April, we see exciting opportunities for this business.
The Hartford performed well in the second quarter. First, we reported good core results, with healthy top line momentum in many of our businesses. Second, we saw significant improvements in the investment portfolio. And third, we are well underway executing the go-forward plan we outlined in April.
As I said, The Hartford reported good overall results in the quarter. Given the economy, the volatile equity markets and as you already know, issues specific to the P&C and life industries, I was pleased that we navigated well through a bumpy quarter. We earned $76 million of net income compared to a net loss of $15 million in the second quarter of 2009. Core earnings were $92 million in the second quarter and included higher-than-expected catastrophes, a DAC unlock, an annual asbestos reserve charge, goodwill impairment and favorable prior-year reserve development in ongoing P&C.
When you account for these items, adjusted core earnings were about $0.92 per diluted share. We believe this figure demonstrates the underlying earnings power of the company. Chris will discuss how we get to that number in detail later in his remarks.
Book value per share was up 6% sequentially to $41.29. And with the market volatility we saw in May and June, I am pleased with the continued strength of our capital position. Revenues, excluding net realized capital gains and trading securities, grew 3% year-over-year. And we saw good top line momentum in many of our key businesses.
In P&C Small Commercial segment, written premium grew 3% over the prior year, reflecting positive renewal pricing and a 9% increase in new business policy count. In P&C Middle Market, price competition is intense, and we are balancing growth and profitability. So we were pleased that pricing on renewals was flat. And policy count retention increased 2% over the prior year. Chris will talk more about Group Benefits later in the call but results there were below our expectations. We see some near-term challenges in this business and are working hard to address them.
In Wealth Management, sales and deposits increased in many businesses. Retirement plan deposits increased 12% over the prior year. Mutual fund deposits were up 11%, and Life insurance sales grew 8%. Second, over the last year, we have seen significant improvements in the investment portfolio. In the second quarter, we had a 13% increase in net investment income, excluding trading securities, driven by strong partnership returns. Another positive sign was that net unrealized losses declined by more than 50% since March 31 to $1.5 billion. We are also seeing favorable trends on impairments, which declined again this quarter. Barring a severe economic or market reversal and given the actions we've taken to date, we believe the worst is behind us on impairments. Over the next several quarters, we expect to see credit losses similar to those we've experienced in the first half of the year.
Given the recent interest in municipal bonds, I want to provide some background on our $12.5 billion portfolio. We feel good about this portfolio given its broad diversification and high average credit quality of AA-. We are heavily weighted toward general obligation and essential service revenue bonds that are supported by clearly defined and dedicated tax or revenue sources. We have also reduced exposure to municipalities in areas of particular economic stress. As Rick said, Greg is here for the Q&A session to answer questions you may have on the portfolio.
Finally, I want to provide an update on the company's strategy. We're making good progress executing on the plan we outlined in April and are seeing a number of encouraging signs. On July 1, we completed the transition to a new organizational structure. Leadership of the Commercial Markets and Wealth Management business unit is in place. We also have a number of very good candidates for the Consumer Markets role and expect to have that position filled in the early fall.
Now as I mentioned earlier, I'm pleased to have Dave Levinson lead Wealth Management. In his 15 years at The Hartford, he has a broad range of experience across Wealth Management, which along with his strategic vision and bias for action, are among the key reasons I selected him for this role. I have charged him with accelerating the profitable growth of Wealth Management, working within the strategy we announced in April. I can tell you that Dave is moving quickly and decisively to identify the best individual and collective opportunities for these businesses.
I've also asked Dave to review the Annuity business, including the performance of Personal Retirement Manager. The new product is now broadly available in the marketplace and the next few quarters will be critical in determining its ultimate success. As we said in April, annuities with an appropriate balance of risk and return are an important part of The Hartford's Wealth Management business. We are committed to the Annuities business and we continue to invest in product, distribution and marketing going forward. And finally, I'm excited about our unique potential to profitably grow in the Wealth Management business. 
In Commercial markets, we're optimistic about our go-to-market strategy. I'm pleased with the early results coming from the combination of our Group Benefits and Commercial P&C businesses. Together, the efforts of these two sales teams have already built a solid pipeline, with close to 1,000 new opportunities, a significant percentage of which we have already quoted. Our early joint efforts have generated several million dollars in sales to date. Juan and his team are optimistic about using this collaborative business model on the full year sales cycle in 2011.
And consistent with that, we're implementing additional sales tools to drive the sustained success across this organization, which include: Cross-train the P&C and GBD sales organizations on each other's products; launching new compensation, incentive and recognition plans to align individual and agency objectives with this strategy; new marketing materials that better articulate to our customers the value proposition of the combined Commercial Markets business; and we have established a set of metrics that will measure the success of our sales teams.
The Consumer Markets team is also executing on its strategy. In auto and homeowners insurance, our focus on the 40-plus age group is resulting in a higher percentage of preferred business. As an example, in the agency channel, preferred new auto and home business as a percentage of the total, has increased by more than 7% over the past six months. The team is also off to a fast start in creating new affinity relationships, as we are already in conversations with several large potential partners. This was important, since there is generally a long sales cycle for affinity relationships. We're optimistic about the potential for future top line growth from this strategy and the value for both us and our partners.
As we also discussed in our April investor meeting, we are committed to simplifying The Hartford and making the company more efficient. Our first important step was to bring together the company's service operations into one enterprise organization. This will allow us to share resources and best practices, further enhance customer service and drive efficiencies. Our ultimate objective is to give customers a one Hartford, one brand experience.
Now before I close, I want to comment briefly on the economy. We continue at The Hartford to anticipate a slow and choppy economic recovery. Recent GDP and payroll data has been consistent with this view. We believe the steps we have taken over the last several months and will take in the future months leave us well prepared to profitably grow.
To conclude, The Hartford reported good results in the second quarter, with healthy top line momentum in many of our businesses and an increase in book value. We saw significant improvements in the investment portfolio and we are well underway executing on our go-forward plan.
With the first half of 2010 complete, I am fully confident in the future of The Hartford and in our ability to meet the 2012 financial targets we laid out for you in April.
Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to talk about the quarter in more detail. Chris?"

Second quarter results were very noisy. To help bett",2223,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. As Liam mentioned, net income for the second quarter was $76 million. Reported core earnings were $92 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Second quarter results were very noisy. To help better understand the company's core earnings strength, I'd like to discuss our calculation of adjusted core earnings, which we estimate at $460 million or $0.92 per diluted share. 
Our estimate of adjusted core earnings excludes five items: The DAC unlock; higher-than-budgeted catastrophe losses; a goodwill impairment; a second quarter asbestos reserve charge; and net positive prior-year development in P&C ongoing operations.
Let's spend a few moments looking at these items in greater detail. The DAC unlock charge to core earnings was $168 million or $0.34 per share, resulting from global equity market declines in the second quarter. To put this into perspective, since The Hartford began using reversion to the mean for our return assumptions, we've had positive DAC unlocks totaling about $750 million through the first quarter of 2010. These unlocks were primarily driven by the 47% rise in the S&P over that period of time. So with the markets down 12% in the second quarter, you can see that the DAC unlock charge was proportional to the market move. 
This was also an unusually high catastrophe quarter for The Hartford, with pre-tax losses of $229 million. On an after-tax basis, it was $0.18 higher per share than our budget. These losses were primarily driven by the severe hale and wind storms in the Midwest and are in line with others in the industry. While the second quarter was very active, potential fee management remains the strength of The Hartford. Although higher than budgeted, the losses we experienced were within the expected range of volatility for these types of events.
We also took a $110 million after-tax charge in the second quarter to increase asbestos reserves. This equates to about $0.22 per share. The charge follows the company's annual review of its asbestos exposures and was driven by increased severity in loss adjustment expenses, including litigation costs. These factors are generally consistent with the broader industry trend.
In contrast, reserves in our ongoing operations developed favorably during the quarter. In general, we saw positive reserve development across our liability line, primarily for accident years 2007 and prior. In total, net prior-year reserve releases in ongoing operations were $97 million after tax, a benefit of $0.19 per share. Even after these releases, our reserve position remains strong, with carried reserves higher than our actuarial indication and consistent with prior reserve positions at the end of 2008 and '09.
Finally, we wrote off most of the goodwill associated with Federal Trust Bank. This resulted in a $100 million impairment charge or about $0.20 per share. We acquired Federal Trust in the second quarter of 2009 in connection with the CPP investment. GAAP accounting calls for annual goodwill testing, which we performed for the first time in the second quarter. Backing up these five items, you get adjusted core earnings of $0.92 per diluted share. This is a good indication of the fundamental earnings power of the franchise.
Going back to Slide 4, we are pleased with all-in book value growth of 6% to $41.29 per share. Book value growth was driven by the decline in unrealized losses in the investment portfolio. Diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 3% during the quarter to $40.95. The increase was a result of second quarter net income and a lower Hartford share price, which reduced dilution from our outstanding warrants. 
Finally, the core earnings ROE for the 12 months ended June 2010 was 7.4%. Excluding the charge we recognized in connection with the CPP repayment in the first quarter, the core earnings ROE for the last four quarters was 9.7%.
Now, let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our second quarter results in Consumer Markets. We continue to position ourselves to generate growth and profitability in Personal Lines. The rate in underwriting actions we have taken to preserve margins continue to work their way through the book. For the second quarter, renewal price increases were 6% and 9% for auto and home, respectively. Written premium was off 1% from prior year. Policies in force were also down about 1%. This was expected as we transitioned to a more preferred book of business. 
Profitability in Personal Lines was impacted by elevated cat activity in the second quarter. Excluding cat, the current accident year combined ratio was a solid 93.2%. This is about three points higher than prior year. As a result, we expect to continue to take rate increases in auto and home going forward. 
Looking ahead, we are excited about the growth opportunities in Consumer Markets. Our premium retention is increasing as we take rate. And we are generating a higher concentration of preferred business. We expect written premium to improve in the second half of the year in response to increased marketing, and we are excited about the rollout of our universal auto product, which we plan to have in 36 states by the end of the year.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our Commercial Markets results. In P&C, commercial lines performed well in the second quarter, with top line drivers trending favorably and the profitability of the underlying business remaining strong. P&C commercial insurance reported a 93.7% current accident year combined ratio, excluding cats, a good result at this point in the cycle. Our Small Commercial franchise continues to outperform the market, with an 85.9% combined ratio on the same basis. Plus, Small Commercial written premium improved 3% in the quarter, driven by positive renewal pricing and new business policy count growth of 9%.
We are seeing continued stabilization in pricing in the smaller end of the Commercial Markets. Renewal pricing in the second quarter was plus 3% in Small Commercial. However, industry pressure on pricing is more evident in our Middle Market and Specialty businesses. We are utilizing our sophisticated modeling capabilities to carefully balance profitability and growth on a granular level. We continue to maintain pricing discipline as demonstrated by flat renewal pricing in Middle Market for the last three quarters. We are taking rate as necessary and turning away business that does not meet our targeted returns. 
On the top line, exposure reductions continue to impact our results. In Middle Market, auto premiums reduced written premiums by five points compared to the second quarter of 2009. That said, we are seeing signs that the decline in exposures is moderating. Endorsement activity is up and the rate of mid-term cancellations has declined. We expect these trends to continue.
Looking to the second half of 2010, we will continue to execute on initiatives to position ourselves for growth as the economy recovers by working to increase policy counts, driving to improve policy retention, and targeting areas of profitable new business growth, such as our industry verticals. 
In our Group Benefits business, second quarter results were below our expectations, with core earnings of $34 million. The industry is experiencing higher disability claims frequency and we saw similar trends in the second quarter. We have closely reviewed our disability claims experience and the increased frequency is not correlated to any industry or plan size. This suggests that the overall frequencies maybe returning to historical levels. In response, we are taking rate in our disability lines to ensure that we continue to generate targeted margins going forward. On the top line, sales increased 13% over prior year, with persistency topping 90%. Fully insured ongoing premiums in Group Benefits declined 2%, pressured by lower payrolls and the sales challenges that were unique to The Hartford over the past year.
Looking ahead, Group Benefits is a great business and fits well with our strategy for Commercial Markets. Some top line and bottom line challenges exist. And Ron and his team are closely reviewing all elements of this business.
Now let's turn to Wealth Management results on Slide 7. Once you exclude the effects of the DAC unlock in the second quarter, margins in Wealth Management businesses continued to recover from last year's level. The margin improvements are being driven by year-over-year equity market appreciation and positive net flows in the non-annuity businesses. For the U.S. annuities business, core earnings, ex the DAC unlock were $98 million in the second quarter. This is a 61% increase over prior year and was driven by higher average account values. In international annuities, core earnings, ex the DAC unlock, were $59 million, an 84% increase over prior year. This increase is the result of higher account values, as well as the significant expense reductions in our Japanese and UK operations. In mutual funds, deposits totaled $4.3 billion. This is an 11% increase over the second quarter of 2009 on a comparable basis, demonstrating the strength of our distribution platform. Core earnings were $22 million, up sharply from the year-ago quarter.
In retirement plans, second quarter deposits were $2 billion, up 12% over prior year. Core earnings in the second quarter, excluding the DAC unlock were $13 million, more than double from prior year. Our transition to one administration platform is on track for completion in the second quarter of 2011. This scalable platform will be key to expanding margins in this business. 
In our individual Life business, second quarter results were very strong. Core earnings, ex-DAC unlock, jumped to a record $55 million. We benefited from favorable mortality, as claims in large face in our policies were lower than the rolling four-quarter average. On the top line, life insurance sales were up 8% over prior year. We are expanding in the independent agent space. We've signed up more than 400 of the nation's largest independent life insurance producers, with an initiative that began earlier this year.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a review of our investment results. Once again, there was significant improvement in the investment portfolio in the quarter. As the slide shows, net unrealized losses continued to decline and as of June 30, were at their lowest levels since 2007. The main driver of the improvement was lower interest rates, which were partially offset by modest spread widening in a number of fixed maturity asset classes. 
Impairments also improved during the quarter. Total impairments, including OTTI and mortgage loan valuation allowances were $148 million. The primary source of these impairments was weaker collateral performance in certain commercial real estate securities. Net investment income, excluding trading securities, was $1.2 billion, 13% higher than prior year. Strong performance from partnerships and alternative investments drove the improvement, and generated a 20% annualized return this past quarter. This is a great result and we have been pleased by the recovery here. However, given the volatility of returns over the last couple of years in this asset class, we think it is prudent to stick with our guidance assumption of zero return at least for the balance of 2010. Longer term, we expect this asset class to yield 6% to 8% annually.
Finally, we continued to reposition the general account assets. Over the course of the second quarter, we reduced net commercial real estate exposures by almost $800 million. As we said in April, we are balancing yield, capital and fair value in determining whether to hold or sell individual securities. Our purchase activity favored higher quality corporate debt, as well as agency-backed MBS. In total, we purchased about $2.1 billion of corporate debt and slightly less than $1 billion of agency-backed MBS.
We like the progress we're making in the investment portfolio. The actions we have taken have improved the risk profile of the general account. And while liquidity remains higher than our long-term target, for now, we like the flexibility it affords us in this investment environment.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 for our updated guidance. As we announced last evening, our core 2010 earnings guidance is $2.10 to $2.30 per share. At the midpoint, the guidance range implies core earnings of about $0.90 per share for each of the next two quarters, taking into account a slightly higher share count. The updated range reflects actual core earnings results for the first half of the year, equity market levels at the end of July and a modestly lower Group Benefits margin. Otherwise, there are no changes to the second half outlook.
As we said in April, our third quarter financial results will reflect the new organizational structure. We will provide the analyst investor community with recast historical financial information to update your models well in advance of the earnings call.
Our second quarter results can be summarized as follows: In [ph] (0:49:12.6) a period of market volatility, with several items impacting earnings, the core franchise performed well and our capital position remained very strong, with statutory surplus essentially unchanged from year-end levels; investments continued to recover, with net unrealized losses declining 50% to $1.5 billion; we are balancing growth and profitability in a low interest rate environment today, while continuing to invest in our businesses for the future; and finally, we operationalized the new strategy focusing on customers, brand, growth and efficiency, with early signs of traction.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick as we move into the Q&A session."

On the first part on portfolio repositioning. I think overall, we feel very comfortable and largely through a lot of our portfolio positioning from a de-risking standpoint, we're encouraged by a lot of the transactions that we've done in the first half of this year. Balancing the things that Chris had mentioned, which are fair value, capital and future net investment income. We'll continue to re-underwrite our portfolio, come up with fair values, look at market values relative to those fair values and then, again balance capital and income and continuing to look at trade opportunities. But in general, we feel from a de-risking standpoint, we feel largely through most of that portfolio positioning. In terms of CMBS, which was the second part of your question. In the second quarter, we sold about $600 million of CMBS holdings. Most of those were to take advantage of an improvement that we've seen in CMBS pricing overall. We sold those at a net slight unrealized gain for the quarter. And again, it's really taking into consideration those things that I had mentioned before, in balancing, those fair values, capital and future net investment income. And we'll continue to look at our CMBS portfolio and other parts of our portfolio to take those things into consideration."

Before we begin, I want to take a moment to remember JR Riley of The Hartford's Investor Relations team. As you probably heard, JR passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago. I know many of you interacted with him on a regular basis. He was a valued and respected member of our team and a friend, and his untimely passing was truly tragic. We miss him. And his family remains in our thoughts and prayers.
In the third quarter, we delivered strong financial results based on solid execution, receiving a lift from rising equity markets and light catastrophe losses. I am confident that we are on the path to delivering more predictable and consistent performance, as well as achieving the targets we set out in April. Core earnings were up 8% from last year at $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. Net income was $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. The investment portfolio improved significantly in the quarter. Chris will provide details but by almost any metric, the portfolio was substantially stronger than it was a year ago. While some of the improvement is due to lower interest rates and spread tightening, it also reflects the significant actions that Greg McGreevey and his team have taken to appropriately derisk the portfolio. 
Investment improvements helped drive book value per share to $45.80 on September 30, up 21% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Our statutory surplus position increased about $700 million. During the quarter, we also put on additional equity and currency hedge protection to mitigate surplus volatility. We managed The Hartford surplus volatility with a combination of reinsurance and hedging programs and by holding appropriate amount of surplus capital. Over time, we will continue to reduce our exposure to changes in the capital markets in a prudent fashion, balancing economics and risk just as we've done in derisking the investment portfolio. 
So in summary, the third quarter performance was very good and is a testament to The Hartford's strong focus on execution. We are making good progress implementing the strategy we outlined in April. We said then that this is a strategy of evolution, not revolution. And that consistent strong execution, quarter after quarter and year after year is key to our success. We've completed the reorganization into a customer-focused structure and this quarter, as you know, began reporting financial results reflecting this new segmentation. Leadership within the businesses is in place and the teams are moving ahead. Andy Pincus is running the Commercial Markets business, where we have good momentum. Andy is a talented and strong leader with deep knowledge of the insurance industry and has been an integral part of the P&C leadership team for the last five years. We are considering internal and external candidates for the Head of Commercial Markets and expect to name a permanent leader in early 2011. 
Commercial Markets delivered good results this quarter, despite some headwinds in Group Benefits. Written premiums in P&C Commercial lines were up 4% over the prior year, led by growth in Small Commercial and Specialty Casualty. Policies-in-force in our standard commercial lines were also up 4%. Underwriting profitability in commercial Property & Casualty improved over the prior year. Excluding caps in prior year development, P&C Commercial posted a combined ratio of 92.2%, about a full point better than the prior period quarter. This reflects The Hartford's commitment to underwriting discipline, as well as benign loss cost trends. I'm very pleased with these results, particularly given the competitive nature of the commercial P&C market. Similar to many of our peers, we are working hard to retain existing profitable business. At the same time, we are pursuing new business where we feel good about the underwriting risks and we recognize this is a balance. Our goal is to increase submission flow in the areas where we want to grow, especially where The Hartford has a unique product offering or underwriting expertise to offer its customers. With small businesses as an example, we continue to have a competitive advantage and are writing new, profitable business that we like. We've also had success with our industry specific programs and are expanding this effort in areas such as technology and healthcare, we have already developed market specific expertise in products that differentiate us from the competition. Our new outpatient healthcare offering is performing very well, contributing to more than $16 million in new healthcare business year-to-date in the Midsized Customers segment. And most recently, we've launched a renewable energy practice. Excellence in sales execution also makes a difference in this environment. Our sales regions are working to develop new opportunities, maximize existing relationships, manage individual sales performance and reduce the variability of process and output. In short, in this environment, we will not sacrifice profitability for growth. 
In Group Benefits, we continue to experience elevated claims incidents and lower terminations in our disability lines during the third quarter. The GBD management team is very focused on taking corrective measures to improve the business results, including taking rate as appropriate. Along with members of the Commercial Markets team, I was at the CIAB conference in Colorado Springs last month, meeting with many of the company's largest agents and brokers. Their response to The Hartford and the changes we are making was positive. They are generally supportive of our new strategy, particularly around the combination of Group Benefits with our commercial Property & Casualty business. This model is consistent with the growing trend of agencies to provide value-added solutions as opposed to a product-centric approach. We launched our new sales approach in support of the combined P&C commercial and GBD strategy in August. Since that time, we have quoted over 200 accounts and built a pipeline of nearly 200 additional qualified opportunities. And to date, in just those few months, we've written over $30 million of joint customer, that being commercial P&C and Group Benefits business. In Consumer Markets, in August, we named Andy Napoli to lead the business. Andy has broad industry operational experience, as well as a background in Personal Lines and affinity relationships. He is making good progress to date in sharpening the businesses focus on the levers that will drive profitable growth. Selling the AARP product to agents, deepening our relationship with AARP, focusing on specific customer segments and developing new affinity programs. We have hired the Kessler Group, a firm with an excellent track record of developing the type of affinity relationships we are looking for. We're focused on this opportunity and are having conversations with potential new partners.
Under Dave Levenson's leadership, Wealth Management is now organized to focus on four key areas: global annuities, mutual funds, retirement plans and life insurance. In U.S. annuities, Personal Retirement Manager, which we launched last fall, was designed to offer consumers a simpler, lower cost annuity alternative. But in an environment of equity market volatility and low interest rates, customers have sought out richer equity guarantees. As a result, sales of the product have not met expectations. As we said on the second quarter call, Dave and his team are evaluating the annuity strategy. While this work is still underway, I can say our goal is to develop a rational sweep of annuity products, including Personal Retirement Manager, to meet the demands of a range of distributors and customers, with acceptable risk and profitability parameters for The Hartford. The $5 billion target we have articulated is a proportional guide to how we're thinking about The Hartford's desired level of market participation over the long term. But we will not take unacceptable risk to achieve it. 
In other Wealth Management businesses, we are making good headway. We reported a 13% year-over-year increase in retirement plan deposits and Individual Life sales were up 14% over the prior year, with sales in the independent channel up 45%. In mutual funds, we plan to launch global fixed income funds in 2011. This will compliment our existing equity and domestic fixed-income offerings and respond to customer trends. When we communicated our strategy in April, we talked about our intent to improve efficiency at The Hartford. We're making good progress on that front. We have significant opportunities to simplify the company and its processes, making The Hartford easier to do business with and more efficient as a result. As an early example, we have combined service operations throughout the company into one enterprise operations structure. We also announced in mid-October that Jim Ackerley joined us to lead an enterprise-wide effort to simplify our business processes and help us become a more efficient company. I have known Jim for many years and he is widely recognized in financial services for his success in project management, process improvement and enhancing efficiency. 
Finally, I want to comment on the economic environment and its impact on The Hartford. As we have said for the last few quarters, we expect a slow and choppy economic recovery. While there are some signs of improvement, broad economic factors continue to impact our business, including tepid job growth and cautious spending by consumers and businesses alike. Similarly, we also do not expect near term relief from the current low interest rate environment. However, we do think rates will rise over time, particularly given expanding government balance sheets around the world. We continue to target a long-term 13% to 15% ROE when we put business on the books. But in this environment of low interest rates and intense competition, achieving these returns is challenging. That is why we're working so hard on many fronts. We are paying close attention to rate adequacy. In businesses such as Consumer Markets and Group Benefits, we're taking rate and we're letting business go when we need to. We are focusing on market segments where we have sustainable competitive advantages, and we continue to drive for outstanding sales execution and better efficiency. 
I want to thank all of my Hartford teammates for their outstanding performance this quarter. Their commitment to the company and to executing in the marketplace everyday is unmatched. I appreciate all they're doing to move The Hartford forward.
So to summarize, we delivered strong results in the third quarter. We are making very good progress executing on our strategy and we are confident that we are on a path toward delivering on the 2012 to targets we established. Our goal is to execute quarter after quarter and year after year, delivering consistent operating results and effectively managing the company's risks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris for a deeper dive on this quarter's results. Chris?"

Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. The Hartford generated very strong third quarter results, with net income of $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. Core earnings were $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. These result",2759,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. The Hartford generated very strong third quarter results, with net income of $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. Core earnings were $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. These results were driven by the five following items: First, solid performance in most of our operating businesses; second, the DAC unlock benefit; third, favorable prior year development in our Property & Casualty businesses; fourth, positive returns on our alternative investments; and fifth, favorable caps. All-in book value at the end of September stood at $45.80, up 11% from the end of June and 21% over prior year. Diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 2% during the quarter to $41.72.
Now, let's move to Slide 5 to discuss two new financial metrics that we are using internally to track progress against our strategic plan. They are adjusted core earnings and the expense efficiency ratio. Adjusted core earnings excludes significant one-time items, as well as the volatile items like prior year reserve development and DAC unlock. Making these adjustments will provide a clearer picture of the underlying profitability trend of our business. It will also serve as a baseline from which we will measure core earnings growth in future years. We've also quantified the efficiency ratio. As you will recall, at our April Investor Day, we set a goal of reducing our efficiency ratio of 200 basis points by the end of 2012. Now, let's discuss the numbers.
Adjusted core earnings for the third quarter were $485 million or $0.98 per diluted share. This excludes two items. First, the DAC unlock and second, Property & Casualty prior year reserve development. The DAC unlock benefit's core earnings was $166 million. The majority of this benefit was driven by global equity market appreciation. About $15 million of this benefit reflected our annual review of assumptions used in calculating DAC and other similar balance sheet items. The most significant assumption changes were a decrease in withdrawal levels in the U.S., an increase in future annuitization levels in Japan. We also continued to benefit from positive reserve development in the third quarter, both in our P&C Commercial lines and Consumer Markets. In total, net prior year reserve releases were $99 million after tax. We continue to reserve appropriately and our reserves remain strong. Some of the positive reserve development was offset by an increase to environmental reserves. The after-tax impact was about $40 million. 
Slide 5 also includes a reconciliation of adjusted core earnings for the third quarter, as well as year-to-date. Adjusted core earnings ROE over the last four quarters is 8.9%. This measure reflects adjusted core earnings and also excludes a $440 million write-off relating to the repayment of CPP in the first quarter. We've also quantified our efficiency ratio and included details about the calculation of the ratio in the appendix. The numerator is the expense number and represents all controllable expenses. The denominator includes all revenues other than trading security and realized capital gains and losses. Year to date, the ratio has improved more than 100 basis points. This reflects the significant expense actions the company took over the course of 2009. We are also benefiting from expense discipline and higher revenues in 2010. 
Looking ahead to 2011, we expect the efficiency ratio to increase modestly. This will be driven by investments we are making to execute on our overall strategy, including growth and efficiency initiatives. This should leave us well-positioned to deliver the full 200 basis point run rate improvement by the end of 2012. Much of the future expense saves will come from process improvements across the organization. Our intent is to make our systems work better for customers and employees and to become a simpler and more efficient organization. We will continue to report on this efficiency ratio, along with progress and actions in this area in the quarters ahead.
Now, let's move to a discussion of third quarter business results, beginning with Commercial Markets on Slide 6. The P&C Commercial lines performed very well in the third quarter, with year-over-year improvements in written premium and underwriting profitability. P&C Commercial reported a 92.2% current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat, almost one point better than the third quarter of 2009. These continued solid underwriting results were driven by our rigorous underwriting and pricing process, coupled with favorable severity from the lower inflationary pressures like wage, and material cost. On the top line, written premiums turned positive with 4% growth over prior year. Some of this reflects an easy comparison against last year's third quarter, when large auto premium adjustments reduced premiums. On the other hand, some of the written premium growth reflects sustainable trends. Renewal pricing remains positive, plus 1% in standard commercial line, a good result in this competitive marketplace. In addition, there was a slight improvement in exposure base during the quarter, suggesting that the decline in exposures has flattened out.
In Group Benefits, sales continued to be soft due to the weak economic environment and the competitive marketplace. Margins remain pressured by disability experience. We continued to experience elevated claims incidence and lower terminations in our disability lines in the third quarter. We have closely reviewed our disability claims experience and the increased frequency continues to be widespread and not specific to any industry or plan size. We are responding appropriately to these higher loss costs. For 2011, we are increasing disability rates, taking into account the elevated claims experience, as well as the lower interest rate environment. As always, we determine rates on a case-by-case basis. We are committed to maintaining our underwriting discipline. We expect to remain competitive in these key markets. 
In summary, it was a good quarter for Commercial Markets segments. The P&C Commercial lines reported written premium and combined ratio improvement. In Group Benefits, we're making progress on necessary actions to address pressures on profitability.
Now, let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our Consumer Market results. In Consumer Markets, we are implementing our strategy to increase profitability and position ourselves to drive growth. We continue to take meaningful rate increases. Renewal written price increases for auto and home were 8% and 11%, respectively in the third quarter. Written premium declined 3% from prior year. This was driven by two factors: Pricing and underwriting actions and our decision to shift our focus to a preferred market segment. Premium retention is relatively flat as pricing increases offset an expected reduction in policy retention. Profitability in the third quarter was lifted by light cat activity. Excluding cat, the current accident year combined ratio was 93.3%, more than 1% better than prior year. Going forward, we are looking to increase our AARP penetration and to sharpen our agency focus. We expect new business premium to begin to grow again in 2011 in response to targeted marketing and new product launches. In agency, we are steadily increasing our focus on the 40-plus age group. More than 80% of agency new business flow in the quarter came from this demographic. We will report this metric going forward and you should expect it to steadily climb. We plan to have our universal auto product in 39 states by the end of the first quarter of 2011. This will further improve our ability to increase penetration across all of our targeted segments. 
In summary, the fundamentals in this business are headed in the right direction. We are taking rate and underwriting actions were appropriate, our combined ratio is improving and we are focusing our efforts on target markets.
Now, let's turn to the Wealth Management results on Slide 8. Excluding the effects of DAC unlock, profitability in Wealth Management continued to improve, with core earnings up 10% over prior year. Margin expansion is being driven by equity market appreciation and positive net flows outside of annuities. Core earnings, ex the DAC unlock for the combined annuity segment, was $146 million in the third quarter, an 8% increase over prior year. Rising account values have more than offset net outflows to generate earnings growth. In our Life Insurance business, third quarter results were again strong. Ex the DAC unlocks, core earnings were $57 million. Mortality was a bit unfavorable in the quarter, but within an expected level of volatility. Individual Life sales were up 14% over prior year. We are making excellent progress with our monarch program, our initiative to increase our penetration with some of the largest independent Life producers in the country. We believe momentum here is building, with a record sales month in September and we are excited about growth in the fourth quarter and into 2011. 
In mutual funds, deposits totaled $3.1 billion. Retail mutual fund deposits were off 19% from prior year. The decline in deposits is consistent with generally weak industry flows into equity funds. In contrast, industry flows into fixed income funds remains at historic highs. We are working to grow AUM in this environment, with a more robust fixed income product offering in 2011. Also, we announced two weeks ago the planned sale of our Canadian mutual fund business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This is a non-core operation, with under $2 billion of AUM. As we've said, we will regularly review our portfolio of businesses to ensure that we are focused on the right mix to drive our strategy. Our Retirement Plans business posted solid third quarter. Core earnings, excluding the DAC unlock, were $10 million, up 25% over prior year. Deposits were $2 billion, up 13% over prior year. To summarize third quarter results in Wealth Management, we saw a good flows in non-annuity businesses, margin improvement driven by account value growth and strong sales and profitability in Life Insurance.
Now, let's turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of capital and risk management. We've received a lot of valuable feedback from investors since the second quarter call, indicating they want more clarity about changes in our statutory surplus. We've heard you and we thank you for your input. As a result, we're providing expanded information this quarter. We continue to believe we have sufficient capital for any reasonable stress scenario. Slide 9 presents a roll forward of third quarter changes in step surplus and our Property & Casualty and U.S. Life Entity. In aggregate, surplus improved about $700 million in the third quarter to $15.2 billion. Working across the slide, VA-related surplus impacts totaled $400 million. I will discuss that in more detail in the next slide. Our Property & Casualty operations generated $300 million of surplus in the quarter. Credit related impacts provided the benefit. Impairments were more than offset by price improvements in several mark to market fixed income portfolio. Dividends from the P&C companies were about $200 million, consistent with our stated plan. In our Life Statutory entities, excluding the impact of the VA business, surplus declined about $100 million. This was caused by reserve increases related to our fixed annuity due to the low interest rate environment.
Now, let's move to Slide 10 to examine the VA surplus impacts in greater detail. VA related statutory income, excluding changes in reserves and hedge assets was about $300 million in the quarter. The two largest drivers of VA related surplus movements are typically changes in statutory liability and hedge assets. In the third quarter, these two essentially neutralized to one another. With the rising equity markets, statutory VA liabilities declined about $700 million. Conversely, our hedge assets declined in value about $800 million. There are two key drivers for this result. First, while the U.S. equity market recovered much of its second quarter decline, the yen continued to strengthen against the dollar. Second, we increased hedging levels for both global equity protection and yen-dollar protection. That extra equity protection lowered surplus in the quarter due to rising equity markets. Looking ahead to future quarters, you generally should not expect the changes in hedge assets to so closely offset the change in liability. As we've said, our first risk management priority is to manage tail risk. So although we have taken steps to mitigate surplus volatility, you should still expect to see point-to-point volatility in the future. 
Bottom line, we feel good about our capital position. We articulated a prudent capital philosophy in March. Our goal is to be prepared for any reasonable stress scenario. Since that time, the fixed income market has steadily recovered but other Capital Market variables have been more volatile. The significant recovery in bond prices combined with our derisking efforts have meaningfully reduced The Hartford's credit risk. In connection with our March capital raise, we analyzed our investment portfolio under a severe stress scenario that included a double dip recession and additional declines in commercial and residential real estate prices. In total, we anticipated about $2.8 billion of credit-related impacts over 2010 and 2011.
Now, when we analyze our portfolio as of the end of September under the same scenario, the impact has declined to about $1.4 billion over 2010 and 2011. On the other hand, the yen and interest rates remained at stress levels, which partially off the improvements in credit. As we've said, we continue to feel very confident in our capital position. However, given continued market and economic uncertainty, it is premature to change our capital management philosophy.
Now, let's turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of interest rates. A number of you have asked us about the low interest rate environment. As you know, lower reinvestment rates will reduce net investment income. We can offset this by lowering crediting rates on our spread based liability, but this is only a partial offset because many of those liabilities are at their contractual minimums already. We typically use the forward interest rate curve in our planning process. As a result, our plan to incorporate today's views of future rate level. However, if interest rates were to stay at their current levels through the end of 2012, we estimate that the incremental core earnings impact will be about $30 million in 2011 and $100 million in 2012. 
Finally, a sustained low interest rate environment over a two-year period should not have a significant impact on DAC or goodwill, which are generally not sensitive to rates in the near term. So bottom line, the interest rate environment is a manageable headwind for The Hartford from an earnings perspective. At the same time, it is a critical factor in our thinking about pricing and returns on new business going forward.
Now, let's turn to Slide 12 for a brief review of our investment results. Declining interest rates and some spread tightening drove significant improvements in the investment portfolio in the quarter. We flipped to a net unrealized gain position at the end of September as the value of our fixed-income holdings increased. Impairments and mortgage loan valuation allowances continued to trend downwards. Total impairments, including OTTI and mortgage loan valuation allowances were $122 million. The primary source of these impairments was weaker collateral performance on a handful of structured commercial real estate securities. Also, included in the $122 million number are $44 million of impairments related to securities we intend to sell given the recent improvements in valuation. Net investment income, excluding trading securities, was $1.1 billion, 3% higher than prior year. Improved partnerships returns more than offset the effect of lower reinvestment on our fixed income portfolio.
Now, let's turn to Slide 13 for our updated 2010 guidance. As we announced last evening, we are increasing our full year core earnings guidance to between $2.60 to $2.70 per share. This range incorporates actual third quarter results, as well as the impact of unseasonably high catastrophe losses in Consumer Markets and P&C Commercial in October. This was driven by severe storm activity in the Southwest United States. We had planned to guide the fourth quarter core earnings of little over $0.90 per diluted share. But in light of October's estimated cat losses, we had lowered our outlook by about $0.09 a share. Therefore, we expect a little over $0.80 per share in the fourth quarter, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Looking ahead, we will share our 2011 outlooks with you early next year. This ends my prepared remarks, which were a little longer than usual. We wanted to provide additional details and insights on capital and interest rates. I hope you found it helpful. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick, as we move into the Q&A session."

I think your question was on interest rates and surplus volatility. I would say again, if you look at our WB program, we do have some interest rate protection, let's say about at the 50% level. When you translate that into the statutory world VA CARVM, you don't have that significant volatility. So from an interest rate side, there isn't that much volatility on the VA CARVM. It does consume a little capital -- lower interest rate environment. So we just model different benefits and things and along those lines more from a valuation side, but not a hedging side. So hopefully that's clear."

One, the $200 million positive impact of credit related impacts, I just was hoping you could give us a little bit more detail there and I guess, I was under the impression that mark-to-market is not reflected on a statutory basis. So I assume is this equity positions or a trading account that's driving that? And then the second question also on the same slide, the $100 million reduction for Life third quarter statutory earnings, I think Chris you mentioned that was largely related to the fixed annuity business. Could you give us a sense for what the assumption impacts were there or how to think about that? Does that reset those reserves to current interest rate environment or is there more to take if we remain low?"

And then on the statutory earnings, the negative, I would point out during the quarter, the headwinds that we faced, you alluded to one. We did record, call it increase in reserves, in the annuity line, about $300 million due to the low interest rate environment, coupled then with some assumption changes that we put in for others that, that maybe cost us nearly $200 million. So with that, we still then were able to obviously grow statutory surplus during the quarter. So as we fast-forward to year end and during our year end cash flow affecting Q3 Phase I final judgment, actually we feel pretty good that there's not going to be any other headwinds or charges that we face at year end related to those particular items."

Before we begin, I want to take a moment to remember JR Riley of The Hartford's Investor Relations team. As you probably heard, JR passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago. I know many of you interacted with him on a regular basis. He was a valued and respected member of our team and a friend, and his untimely passing was truly tragic. We miss him. And his family remains in our thoughts and prayers.
In the third quarter, we delivered strong financial results based on solid execution, receiving a lift from rising equity markets and light catastrophe losses. I am confident that we are on the path to delivering more predictable and consistent performance, as well as achieving the targets we set out in April. Core earnings were up 8% from last year at $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. Net income was $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. The investment portfolio improved significantly in the quarter. Chris will provide details but by almost any metric, the portfolio was substantially stronger than it was a year ago. While some of the improvement is due to lower interest rates and spread tightening, it also reflects the significant actions that Greg McGreevey and his team have taken to appropriately derisk the portfolio. 
Investment improvements helped drive book value per share to $45.80 on September 30, up 21% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Our statutory surplus position increased about $700 million. During the quarter, we also put on additional equity and currency hedge protection to mitigate surplus volatility. We managed The Hartford surplus volatility with a combination of reinsurance and hedging programs and by holding appropriate amount of surplus capital. Over time, we will continue to reduce our exposure to changes in the capital markets in a prudent fashion, balancing economics and risk just as we've done in derisking the investment portfolio. 
So in summary, the third quarter performance was very good and is a testament to The Hartford's strong focus on execution. We are making good progress implementing the strategy we outlined in April. We said then that this is a strategy of evolution, not revolution. And that consistent strong execution, quarter after quarter and year after year is key to our success. We've completed the reorganization into a customer-focused structure and this quarter, as you know, began reporting financial results reflecting this new segmentation. Leadership within the businesses is in place and the teams are moving ahead. Andy Pincus is running the Commercial Markets business, where we have good momentum. Andy is a talented and strong leader with deep knowledge of the insurance industry and has been an integral part of the P&C leadership team for the last five years. We are considering internal and external candidates for the Head of Commercial Markets and expect to name a permanent leader in early 2011. 
Commercial Markets delivered good results this quarter, despite some headwinds in Group Benefits. Written premiums in P&C Commercial lines were up 4% over the prior year, led by growth in Small Commercial and Specialty Casualty. Policies-in-force in our standard commercial lines were also up 4%. Underwriting profitability in commercial Property & Casualty improved over the prior year. Excluding caps in prior year development, P&C Commercial posted a combined ratio of 92.2%, about a full point better than the prior period quarter. This reflects The Hartford's commitment to underwriting discipline, as well as benign loss cost trends. I'm very pleased with these results, particularly given the competitive nature of the commercial P&C market. Similar to many of our peers, we are working hard to retain existing profitable business. At the same time, we are pursuing new business where we feel good about the underwriting risks and we recognize this is a balance. Our goal is to increase submission flow in the areas where we want to grow, especially where The Hartford has a unique product offering or underwriting expertise to offer its customers. With small businesses as an example, we continue to have a competitive advantage and are writing new, profitable business that we like. We've also had success with our industry specific programs and are expanding this effort in areas such as technology and healthcare, we have already developed market specific expertise in products that differentiate us from the competition. Our new outpatient healthcare offering is performing very well, contributing to more than $16 million in new healthcare business year-to-date in the Midsized Customers segment. And most recently, we've launched a renewable energy practice. Excellence in sales execution also makes a difference in this environment. Our sales regions are working to develop new opportunities, maximize existing relationships, manage individual sales performance and reduce the variability of process and output. In short, in this environment, we will not sacrifice profitability for growth. 
In Group Benefits, we continue to experience elevated claims incidents and lower terminations in our disability lines during the third quarter. The GBD management team is very focused on taking corrective measures to improve the business results, including taking rate as appropriate. Along with members of the Commercial Markets team, I was at the CIAB conference in Colorado Springs last month, meeting with many of the company's largest agents and brokers. Their response to The Hartford and the changes we are making was positive. They are generally supportive of our new strategy, particularly around the combination of Group Benefits with our commercial Property & Casualty business. This model is consistent with the growing trend of agencies to provide value-added solutions as opposed to a product-centric approach. We launched our new sales approach in support of the combined P&C commercial and GBD strategy in August. Since that time, we have quoted over 200 accounts and built a pipeline of nearly 200 additional qualified opportunities. And to date, in just those few months, we've written over $30 million of joint customer, that being commercial P&C and Group Benefits business. In Consumer Markets, in August, we named Andy Napoli to lead the business. Andy has broad industry operational experience, as well as a background in Personal Lines and affinity relationships. He is making good progress to date in sharpening the businesses focus on the levers that will drive profitable growth. Selling the AARP product to agents, deepening our relationship with AARP, focusing on specific customer segments and developing new affinity programs. We have hired the Kessler Group, a firm with an excellent track record of developing the type of affinity relationships we are looking for. We're focused on this opportunity and are having conversations with potential new partners.
Under Dave Levenson's leadership, Wealth Management is now organized to focus on four key areas: global annuities, mutual funds, retirement plans and life insurance. In U.S. annuities, Personal Retirement Manager, which we launched last fall, was designed to offer consumers a simpler, lower cost annuity alternative. But in an environment of equity market volatility and low interest rates, customers have sought out richer equity guarantees. As a result, sales of the product have not met expectations. As we said on the second quarter call, Dave and his team are evaluating the annuity strategy. While this work is still underway, I can say our goal is to develop a rational sweep of annuity products, including Personal Retirement Manager, to meet the demands of a range of distributors and customers, with acceptable risk and profitability parameters for The Hartford. The $5 billion target we have articulated is a proportional guide to how we're thinking about The Hartford's desired level of market participation over the long term. But we will not take unacceptable risk to achieve it. 
In other Wealth Management businesses, we are making good headway. We reported a 13% year-over-year increase in retirement plan deposits and Individual Life sales were up 14% over the prior year, with sales in the independent channel up 45%. In mutual funds, we plan to launch global fixed income funds in 2011. This will compliment our existing equity and domestic fixed-income offerings and respond to customer trends. When we communicated our strategy in April, we talked about our intent to improve efficiency at The Hartford. We're making good progress on that front. We have significant opportunities to simplify the company and its processes, making The Hartford easier to do business with and more efficient as a result. As an early example, we have combined service operations throughout the company into one enterprise operations structure. We also announced in mid-October that Jim Ackerley joined us to lead an enterprise-wide effort to simplify our business processes and help us become a more efficient company. I have known Jim for many years and he is widely recognized in financial services for his success in project management, process improvement and enhancing efficiency. 
Finally, I want to comment on the economic environment and its impact on The Hartford. As we have said for the last few quarters, we expect a slow and choppy economic recovery. While there are some signs of improvement, broad economic factors continue to impact our business, including tepid job growth and cautious spending by consumers and businesses alike. Similarly, we also do not expect near term relief from the current low interest rate environment. However, we do think rates will rise over time, particularly given expanding government balance sheets around the world. We continue to target a long-term 13% to 15% ROE when we put business on the books. But in this environment of low interest rates and intense competition, achieving these returns is challenging. That is why we're working so hard on many fronts. We are paying close attention to rate adequacy. In businesses such as Consumer Markets and Group Benefits, we're taking rate and we're letting business go when we need to. We are focusing on market segments where we have sustainable competitive advantages, and we continue to drive for outstanding sales execution and better efficiency. 
I want to thank all of my Hartford teammates for their outstanding performance this quarter. Their commitment to the company and to executing in the marketplace everyday is unmatched. I appreciate all they're doing to move The Hartford forward.
So to summarize, we delivered strong results in the third quarter. We are making very good progress executing on our strategy and we are confident that we are on a path toward delivering on the 2012 to targets we established. Our goal is to execute quarter after quarter and year after year, delivering consistent operating results and effectively managing the company's risks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris for a deeper dive on this quarter's results. Chris?

Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. The Hartford generated very strong third quarter results, with net income of $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. Core earnings were $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. These result",2759,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. The Hartford generated very strong third quarter results, with net income of $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. Core earnings were $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. These results were driven by the five following items: First, solid performance in most of our operating businesses; second, the DAC unlock benefit; third, favorable prior year development in our Property & Casualty businesses; fourth, positive returns on our alternative investments; and fifth, favorable caps. All-in book value at the end of September stood at $45.80, up 11% from the end of June and 21% over prior year. Diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 2% during the quarter to $41.72.
Now, let's move to Slide 5 to discuss two new financial metrics that we are using internally to track progress against our strategic plan. They are adjusted core earnings and the expense efficiency ratio. Adjusted core earnings excludes significant one-time items, as well as the volatile items like prior year reserve development and DAC unlock. Making these adjustments will provide a clearer picture of the underlying profitability trend of our business. It will also serve as a baseline from which we will measure core earnings growth in future years. We've also quantified the efficiency ratio. As you will recall, at our April Investor Day, we set a goal of reducing our efficiency ratio of 200 basis points by the end of 2012. Now, let's discuss the numbers.
Adjusted core earnings for the third quarter were $485 million or $0.98 per diluted share. This excludes two items. First, the DAC unlock and second, Property & Casualty prior year reserve development. The DAC unlock benefit's core earnings was $166 million. The majority of this benefit was driven by global equity market appreciation. About $15 million of this benefit reflected our annual review of assumptions used in calculating DAC and other similar balance sheet items. The most significant assumption changes were a decrease in withdrawal levels in the U.S., an increase in future annuitization levels in Japan. We also continued to benefit from positive reserve development in the third quarter, both in our P&C Commercial lines and Consumer Markets. In total, net prior year reserve releases were $99 million after tax. We continue to reserve appropriately and our reserves remain strong. Some of the positive reserve development was offset by an increase to environmental reserves. The after-tax impact was about $40 million. 
Slide 5 also includes a reconciliation of adjusted core earnings for the third quarter, as well as year-to-date. Adjusted core earnings ROE over the last four quarters is 8.9%. This measure reflects adjusted core earnings and also excludes a $440 million write-off relating to the repayment of CPP in the first quarter. We've also quantified our efficiency ratio and included details about the calculation of the ratio in the appendix. The numerator is the expense number and represents all controllable expenses. The denominator includes all revenues other than trading security and realized capital gains and losses. Year to date, the ratio has improved more than 100 basis points. This reflects the significant expense actions the company took over the course of 2009. We are also benefiting from expense discipline and higher revenues in 2010. 
Looking ahead to 2011, we expect the efficiency ratio to increase modestly. This will be driven by investments we are making to execute on our overall strategy, including growth and efficiency initiatives. This should leave us well-positioned to deliver the full 200 basis point run rate improvement by the end of 2012. Much of the future expense saves will come from process improvements across the organization. Our intent is to make our systems work better for customers and employees and to become a simpler and more efficient organization. We will continue to report on this efficiency ratio, along with progress and actions in this area in the quarters ahead.
Now, let's move to a discussion of third quarter business results, beginning with Commercial Markets on Slide 6. The P&C Commercial lines performed very well in the third quarter, with year-over-year improvements in written premium and underwriting profitability. P&C Commercial reported a 92.2% current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat, almost one point better than the third quarter of 2009. These continued solid underwriting results were driven by our rigorous underwriting and pricing process, coupled with favorable severity from the lower inflationary pressures like wage, and material cost. On the top line, written premiums turned positive with 4% growth over prior year. Some of this reflects an easy comparison against last year's third quarter, when large auto premium adjustments reduced premiums. On the other hand, some of the written premium growth reflects sustainable trends. Renewal pricing remains positive, plus 1% in standard commercial line, a good result in this competitive marketplace. In addition, there was a slight improvement in exposure base during the quarter, suggesting that the decline in exposures has flattened out.
In Group Benefits, sales continued to be soft due to the weak economic environment and the competitive marketplace. Margins remain pressured by disability experience. We continued to experience elevated claims incidence and lower terminations in our disability lines in the third quarter. We have closely reviewed our disability claims experience and the increased frequency continues to be widespread and not specific to any industry or plan size. We are responding appropriately to these higher loss costs. For 2011, we are increasing disability rates, taking into account the elevated claims experience, as well as the lower interest rate environment. As always, we determine rates on a case-by-case basis. We are committed to maintaining our underwriting discipline. We expect to remain competitive in these key markets. 
In summary, it was a good quarter for Commercial Markets segments. The P&C Commercial lines reported written premium and combined ratio improvement. In Group Benefits, we're making progress on necessary actions to address pressures on profitability.
Now, let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our Consumer Market results. In Consumer Markets, we are implementing our strategy to increase profitability and position ourselves to drive growth. We continue to take meaningful rate increases. Renewal written price increases for auto and home were 8% and 11%, respectively in the third quarter. Written premium declined 3% from prior year. This was driven by two factors: Pricing and underwriting actions and our decision to shift our focus to a preferred market segment. Premium retention is relatively flat as pricing increases offset an expected reduction in policy retention. Profitability in the third quarter was lifted by light cat activity. Excluding cat, the current accident year combined ratio was 93.3%, more than 1% better than prior year. Going forward, we are looking to increase our AARP penetration and to sharpen our agency focus. We expect new business premium to begin to grow again in 2011 in response to targeted marketing and new product launches. In agency, we are steadily increasing our focus on the 40-plus age group. More than 80% of agency new business flow in the quarter came from this demographic. We will report this metric going forward and you should expect it to steadily climb. We plan to have our universal auto product in 39 states by the end of the first quarter of 2011. This will further improve our ability to increase penetration across all of our targeted segments. 
In summary, the fundamentals in this business are headed in the right direction. We are taking rate and underwriting actions were appropriate, our combined ratio is improving and we are focusing our efforts on target markets.
Now, let's turn to the Wealth Management results on Slide 8. Excluding the effects of DAC unlock, profitability in Wealth Management continued to improve, with core earnings up 10% over prior year. Margin expansion is being driven by equity market appreciation and positive net flows outside of annuities. Core earnings, ex the DAC unlock for the combined annuity segment, was $146 million in the third quarter, an 8% increase over prior year. Rising account values have more than offset net outflows to generate earnings growth. In our Life Insurance business, third quarter results were again strong. Ex the DAC unlocks, core earnings were $57 million. Mortality was a bit unfavorable in the quarter, but within an expected level of volatility. Individual Life sales were up 14% over prior year. We are making excellent progress with our monarch program, our initiative to increase our penetration with some of the largest independent Life producers in the country. We believe momentum here is building, with a record sales month in September and we are excited about growth in the fourth quarter and into 2011. 
In mutual funds, deposits totaled $3.1 billion. Retail mutual fund deposits were off 19% from prior year. The decline in deposits is consistent with generally weak industry flows into equity funds. In contrast, industry flows into fixed income funds remains at historic highs. We are working to grow AUM in this environment, with a more robust fixed income product offering in 2011. Also, we announced two weeks ago the planned sale of our Canadian mutual fund business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This is a non-core operation, with under $2 billion of AUM. As we've said, we will regularly review our portfolio of businesses to ensure that we are focused on the right mix to drive our strategy. Our Retirement Plans business posted solid third quarter. Core earnings, excluding the DAC unlock, were $10 million, up 25% over prior year. Deposits were $2 billion, up 13% over prior year. To summarize third quarter results in Wealth Management, we saw a good flows in non-annuity businesses, margin improvement driven by account value growth and strong sales and profitability in Life Insurance.
Now, let's turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of capital and risk management. We've received a lot of valuable feedback from investors since the second quarter call, indicating they want more clarity about changes in our statutory surplus. We've heard you and we thank you for your input. As a result, we're providing expanded information this quarter. We continue to believe we have sufficient capital for any reasonable stress scenario. Slide 9 presents a roll forward of third quarter changes in step surplus and our Property & Casualty and U.S. Life Entity. In aggregate, surplus improved about $700 million in the third quarter to $15.2 billion. Working across the slide, VA-related surplus impacts totaled $400 million. I will discuss that in more detail in the next slide. Our Property & Casualty operations generated $300 million of surplus in the quarter. Credit related impacts provided the benefit. Impairments were more than offset by price improvements in several mark to market fixed income portfolio. Dividends from the P&C companies were about $200 million, consistent with our stated plan. In our Life Statutory entities, excluding the impact of the VA business, surplus declined about $100 million. This was caused by reserve increases related to our fixed annuity due to the low interest rate environment.
Now, let's move to Slide 10 to examine the VA surplus impacts in greater detail. VA related statutory income, excluding changes in reserves and hedge assets was about $300 million in the quarter. The two largest drivers of VA related surplus movements are typically changes in statutory liability and hedge assets. In the third quarter, these two essentially neutralized to one another. With the rising equity markets, statutory VA liabilities declined about $700 million. Conversely, our hedge assets declined in value about $800 million. There are two key drivers for this result. First, while the U.S. equity market recovered much of its second quarter decline, the yen continued to strengthen against the dollar. Second, we increased hedging levels for both global equity protection and yen-dollar protection. That extra equity protection lowered surplus in the quarter due to rising equity markets. Looking ahead to future quarters, you generally should not expect the changes in hedge assets to so closely offset the change in liability. As we've said, our first risk management priority is to manage tail risk. So although we have taken steps to mitigate surplus volatility, you should still expect to see point-to-point volatility in the future. 
Bottom line, we feel good about our capital position. We articulated a prudent capital philosophy in March. Our goal is to be prepared for any reasonable stress scenario. Since that time, the fixed income market has steadily recovered but other Capital Market variables have been more volatile. The significant recovery in bond prices combined with our derisking efforts have meaningfully reduced The Hartford's credit risk. In connection with our March capital raise, we analyzed our investment portfolio under a severe stress scenario that included a double dip recession and additional declines in commercial and residential real estate prices. In total, we anticipated about $2.8 billion of credit-related impacts over 2010 and 2011.
Now, when we analyze our portfolio as of the end of September under the same scenario, the impact has declined to about $1.4 billion over 2010 and 2011. On the other hand, the yen and interest rates remained at stress levels, which partially off the improvements in credit. As we've said, we continue to feel very confident in our capital position. However, given continued market and economic uncertainty, it is premature to change our capital management philosophy.
Now, let's turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of interest rates. A number of you have asked us about the low interest rate environment. As you know, lower reinvestment rates will reduce net investment income. We can offset this by lowering crediting rates on our spread based liability, but this is only a partial offset because many of those liabilities are at their contractual minimums already. We typically use the forward interest rate curve in our planning process. As a result, our plan to incorporate today's views of future rate level. However, if interest rates were to stay at their current levels through the end of 2012, we estimate that the incremental core earnings impact will be about $30 million in 2011 and $100 million in 2012. 
Finally, a sustained low interest rate environment over a two-year period should not have a significant impact on DAC or goodwill, which are generally not sensitive to rates in the near term. So bottom line, the interest rate environment is a manageable headwind for The Hartford from an earnings perspective. At the same time, it is a critical factor in our thinking about pricing and returns on new business going forward.
Now, let's turn to Slide 12 for a brief review of our investment results. Declining interest rates and some spread tightening drove significant improvements in the investment portfolio in the quarter. We flipped to a net unrealized gain position at the end of September as the value of our fixed-income holdings increased. Impairments and mortgage loan valuation allowances continued to trend downwards. Total impairments, including OTTI and mortgage loan valuation allowances were $122 million. The primary source of these impairments was weaker collateral performance on a handful of structured commercial real estate securities. Also, included in the $122 million number are $44 million of impairments related to securities we intend to sell given the recent improvements in valuation. Net investment income, excluding trading securities, was $1.1 billion, 3% higher than prior year. Improved partnerships returns more than offset the effect of lower reinvestment on our fixed income portfolio.
Now, let's turn to Slide 13 for our updated 2010 guidance. As we announced last evening, we are increasing our full year core earnings guidance to between $2.60 to $2.70 per share. This range incorporates actual third quarter results, as well as the impact of unseasonably high catastrophe losses in Consumer Markets and P&C Commercial in October. This was driven by severe storm activity in the Southwest United States. We had planned to guide the fourth quarter core earnings of little over $0.90 per diluted share. But in light of October's estimated cat losses, we had lowered our outlook by about $0.09 a share. Therefore, we expect a little over $0.80 per share in the fourth quarter, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Looking ahead, we will share our 2011 outlooks with you early next year. This ends my prepared remarks, which were a little longer than usual. We wanted to provide additional details and insights on capital and interest rates. I hope you found it helpful. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick, as we move into the Q&A session.

Before we begin, I want to take a moment to remember JR Riley of The Hartford's Investor Relations team. As you probably heard, JR passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago. I know many of you interacted with him on a regular basis. He was a valued and respected member of our team and a friend, and his untimely passing was truly tragic. We miss him. And his family remains in our thoughts and prayers.
In the third quarter, we delivered strong financial results based on solid execution, receiving a lift from rising equity markets and light catastrophe losses. I am confident that we are on the path to delivering more predictable and consistent performance, as well as achieving the targets we set out in April. Core earnings were up 8% from last year at $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. Net income was $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. The investment portfolio improved significantly in the quarter. Chris will provide details but by almost any metric, the portfolio was substantially stronger than it was a year ago. While some of the improvement is due to lower interest rates and spread tightening, it also reflects the significant actions that Greg McGreevey and his team have taken to appropriately derisk the portfolio. 
Investment improvements helped drive book value per share to $45.80 on September 30, up 21% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Our statutory surplus position increased about $700 million. During the quarter, we also put on additional equity and currency hedge protection to mitigate surplus volatility. We managed The Hartford surplus volatility with a combination of reinsurance and hedging programs and by holding appropriate amounts of surplus capital. Over time, we will continue to reduce our exposure to changes in the capital markets in a prudent fashion, balancing economics and risk just as we've done in derisking the investment portfolio. 
So in summary, the third quarter performance was very good and is a testament to The Hartford's strong focus on execution. We are making good progress implementing the strategy we outlined in April. We said then that this is a strategy of evolution, not revolution. And that consistent strong execution, quarter after quarter and year after year is key to our success. We've completed the reorganization into a customer-focused structure and this quarter, as you know, began reporting financial results reflecting this new segmentation. Leadership within the businesses is in place and the teams are moving ahead. Andy Pinkes is running the Commercial Markets business, where we have good momentum. Andy is a talented and strong leader with deep knowledge of the insurance industry and has been an integral part of the P&C leadership team for the last five years. We are considering internal and external candidates for the Head of Commercial Markets and expect to name a permanent leader in early 2011. 
Commercial Markets delivered good results this quarter, despite some headwinds in Group Benefits. Written premiums in P&C Commercial lines were up 4% over the prior year, led by growth in Small Commercial and Specialty Casualty. Policies-in-force in our standard commercial lines were also up 4%. Underwriting profitability in commercial Property & Casualty improved over the prior year. Excluding caps in prior year development, P&C Commercial posted a combined ratio of 92.2%, about a full point better than the prior period quarter. This reflects The Hartford's commitment to underwriting discipline, as well as benign loss cost trends. I'm very pleased with these results, particularly given the competitive nature of the commercial P&C market. Similar to many of our peers, we are working hard to retain existing profitable business. At the same time, we are pursuing new business where we feel good about the underwriting risks and we recognize this is a balance. Our goal is to increase submission flow in the areas where we want to grow, especially where The Hartford has a unique product offering or underwriting expertise to offer its customers. With small businesses as an example, we continue to have a competitive advantage and are writing new, profitable business that we like. We've also had success with our industry specific programs and are expanding this effort. In areas such as technology and healthcare, we have already developed market specific expertise in products that differentiate us from the competition. Our new outpatient healthcare offering is performing very well, contributing to more than $16 million in new healthcare business year-to-date in the Midsized Customers segment. And most recently, we've launched a renewable energy practice. Excellence in sales execution also makes a difference in this environment. Our sales regions are working to develop new opportunities, maximize existing relationships, manage individual sales performance and reduce the variability of process and output. In short, in this environment, we will not sacrifice profitability for growth. 
In Group Benefits, we continue to experience elevated claims incidence and lower terminations in our disability lines during the third quarter. The GBD management team is very focused on taking corrective measures to improve the business results, including taking rate as appropriate. Along with members of the Commercial Markets team, I was at the CIAB conference in Colorado Springs last month, meeting with many of the company's largest agents and brokers. Their response to The Hartford and the changes we are making was positive. They are generally supportive of our new strategy, particularly around the combination of Group Benefits with our commercial Property & Casualty business. This model is consistent with the growing trend of agencies to provide value-added solutions as opposed to a product-centric approach. We launched our new sales approach in support of the combined P&C commercial and GBD strategy in August. Since that time, we have quoted over 200 accounts and built a pipeline of nearly 200 additional qualified opportunities. And to date, in just those few months, we've written over $30 million of joint customer, that being commercial P&C and Group Benefits business. In Consumer Markets, in August, we named Andy Napoli to lead the business. Andy has broad industry operational experience, as well as a background in Personal Lines and affinity of relationships. He is making good progress to date in sharpening the businesses focus on the levers that will drive profitable growth. Selling the AARP product to agents, deepening our relationship with AARP, focusing on specific customer segments and developing new affinity programs. We have hired the Kessler Group, a firm with an excellent track record of developing the type of affinity relationships we are looking for. We're focused on this opportunity and are having conversations with potential new partners.
Under Dave Levenson's leadership, Wealth Management is now organized to focus on four key areas: global annuities, mutual funds, retirement plans and life insurance. In U.S. annuities, Personal Retirement Manager, which we launched last fall, was designed to offer consumers a simpler, lower cost annuity alternative. But in an environment of equity market volatility and low interest rates, customers have sought out richer equity guarantees. As a result, sales of the product have not met expectations. As we said on the second quarter call, Dave and his team are evaluating the annuity strategy. While this work is still underway, I can say our goal is to develop a rational sweep of annuity products, including Personal Retirement Manager, to meet the demands of a range of distributors and customers, with acceptable risk and profitability parameters for The Hartford. The $5 billion target we have articulated is a proportional guide to how we're thinking about The Hartford's desired level of market participation over the long term. But we will not take unacceptable risks to achieve it. 
In other Wealth Management businesses, we are making good headway. We reported a 13% year-over-year increase in retirement plan deposits and Individual Life sales were up 14% over the prior year, with sales in the independent channel up 45%. In mutual funds, we plan to launch global fixed income funds in 2011. This will compliment our existing equity and domestic fixed-income offerings and respond to customer trends. When we communicated our strategy in April, we talked about our intent to improve efficiency at The Hartford. We're making good progress on that front. We have significant opportunities to simplify the company and its processes, making The Hartford easier to do business with and more efficient as a result. As an early example, we have combined service operations throughout the company into one enterprise operations structure. We also announced in mid-October that Jim Eckerle joined us to lead an enterprise-wide effort to simplify our business processes and help us become a more efficient company. I have known Jim for many years and he is widely recognized in financial services for his success in project management, process improvement and enhancing efficiency. 
Finally, I want to comment on the economic environment and its impact on The Hartford. As we have said for the last few quarters, we expect a slow and choppy economic recovery. While there are some signs of improvement, broad economic factors continue to impact our business, including tepid job growth and cautious spending by consumers and businesses alike. Similarly, we also do not expect near term relief from the current low interest rate environment. However, we do think rates will rise over time, particularly given expanding government balance sheets around the world. We continue to target a long-term 13% to 15% ROE when we put business on the books. But in this environment of low interest rates and intense competition, achieving these returns is challenging. That is why we're working so hard on many fronts. We are paying close attention to rate adequacy. In businesses such as Consumer Markets and Group Benefits, we're taking rate and we're letting business go when we need to. We are focusing on market segments where we have sustainable competitive advantages, and we continue to drive for outstanding sales execution and better efficiency. 
I want to thank all of my Hartford teammates for their outstanding performance this quarter. Their commitment to the company and to executing in the marketplace everyday is unmatched. I appreciate all they're doing to move The Hartford forward.
So to summarize, we delivered strong results in the third quarter. We are making very good progress executing on our strategy and we are confident that we are on a path toward delivering on the 2012 targets we established. Our goal is to execute quarter after quarter and year after year, delivering consistent operating results and effectively managing the company's risks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris for a deeper dive on this quarter's results. Chris?"

Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. The Hartford generated very strong third quarter results, with net income of $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. Core earnings were $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. These result",2756,"Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. The Hartford generated very strong third quarter results, with net income of $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. Core earnings were $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. These results were driven by the five following items: First, solid performance in most of our operating businesses; second, the DAC unlock benefit; third, favorable prior year development in our Property & Casualty businesses; fourth, positive returns on our alternative investments; and fifth, favorable caps. All-in book value at the end of September stood at $45.80, up 11% from the end of June and 21% over prior year. Diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 2% during the quarter to $41.72.
Now, let's move to Slide 5 to discuss two new financial metrics that we are using internally to track progress against our strategic plan. They are adjusted core earnings and the expense efficiency ratio. Adjusted core earnings excludes significant one-time items, as well as the volatile items like prior year reserve development and DAC unlock. Making these adjustments will provide a clearer picture of the underlying profitability trend of our business. It will also serve as a baseline from which we will measure core earnings growth in future years. We've also quantified the efficiency ratio. As you will recall, at our April Investor Day, we set a goal of reducing our efficiency ratio 200 basis points by the end of 2012. Now, let's discuss the numbers.
Adjusted core earnings for the third quarter were $485 million or $0.98 per diluted share. This excludes two items. First, the DAC unlock and second, Property & Casualty prior year reserve development. The DAC unlock benefit's core earnings was $166 million. The majority of this benefit was driven by global equity market appreciation. About $15 million of this benefit reflected our annual review of assumptions used in calculating DAC and other similar balance sheet items. The most significant assumption changes were a decrease in withdrawal levels in the U.S., an increase in future annuitization levels in Japan. We also continued to benefit from positive reserve development in the third quarter, both in our P&C Commercial lines and Consumer Markets. In total, net prior year reserve releases were $99 million after tax. We continue to reserve appropriately and our reserves remain strong. Some of the positive reserve development was offset by an increase to environmental reserves. The after-tax impact was about $40 million. 
Slide 5 also includes a reconciliation of adjusted core earnings for the third quarter, as well as year-to-date. Adjusted core earnings ROE over the last four quarters is 8.9%. This measure reflects adjusted core earnings and also excludes a $440 million write-off relating to the repayment of CPP in the first quarter. We've also quantified our efficiency ratio and included details about the calculation of the ratio in the appendix. The numerator is the expense number and represents all controllable expenses. The denominator includes all revenues other than trading security and realized capital gains and losses. Year to date, the ratio has improved more than 100 basis points. This reflects the significant expense actions the company took over the course of 2009. We are also benefiting from expense discipline and higher revenues in 2010. 
Looking ahead to 2011, we expect the efficiency ratio to increase modestly. This will be driven by investments we are making to execute on our overall strategy, including growth and efficiency initiatives. This should leave us well-positioned to deliver the full 200 basis point run rate improvement by the end of 2012. Much of the future expense saves will come from process improvements across the organization. Our intent is to make our systems work better for customers and employees and to become a simpler and more efficient organization. We will continue to report on this efficiency ratio, along with progress and actions in this area in the quarters ahead.
Now, let's move to a discussion of third quarter business results, beginning with Commercial Markets on Slide 6. The P&C Commercial lines performed very well in the third quarter, with year-over-year improvements in written premium and underwriting profitability. P&C Commercial reported a 92.2% current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat, almost one point better than the third quarter of 2009. These continued solid underwriting results were driven by our rigorous underwriting and pricing process, coupled with favorable severity from the lower inflationary pressures like wage, and material cost. On the top line, written premiums turned positive with 4% growth over prior year. Some of this reflects an easy comparison against last year's third quarter, when large auto premium adjustments reduced premiums. On the other hand, some of the written premium growth reflects sustainable trends. Renewal pricing remains positive, plus 1% in standard commercial line, a good result in this competitive marketplace. In addition, there was a slight improvement in exposure base during the quarter, suggesting that the decline in exposures has flattened out.
In Group Benefits, sales continue to be soft due to the weak economic environment and the competitive marketplace. Margins remain pressured by disability experience. We continued to experience elevated claims incidence and lower terminations in our disability lines in the third quarter. We have closely reviewed our disability claims experience and the increased frequency continues to be widespread and not specific to any industry or plan size. We are responding appropriately to these higher loss costs. For 2011, we are increasing disability rates, taking into account the elevated claims experience, as well as the lower interest rate environment. As always, we determine rates on a case-by-case basis. We are committed to maintaining our underwriting discipline. We expect to remain competitive in these key markets. 
In summary, it was a good quarter for Commercial Markets segments. The P&C Commercial lines reported written premium and combined ratio improvements. In Group Benefits, we're making progress on necessary actions to address pressures on profitability.
Now, let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our Consumer Market results. In Consumer Markets, we are implementing our strategy to increase profitability and position ourselves to drive growth. We continue to take meaningful rate increases. Renewal written price increases for auto and home were 8% and 11%, respectively in the third quarter. Written premium declined 3% from prior year. This was driven by two factors: Pricing and underwriting actions and our decision to shift our focus to a preferred market segment. Premium retention is relatively flat as pricing increases offset an expected reduction in policy retention. Profitability in the third quarter was lifted by light cat activity. Excluding cat, the current accident year combined ratio was 93.3%, more than 1% better than prior year. Going forward, we are looking to increase our AARP penetration and to sharpen our agency focus. We expect new business premiums to begin to grow again in 2011 in response to targeted marketing and new product launches. In agency, we are steadily increasing our focus on the 40-plus age group. More than 80% of agency new business flow in the quarter came from this demographic. We will report this metric going forward and you should expect it to steadily climb. We plan to have our universal auto product in 39 states by the end of the first quarter of 2011. This will further improve our ability to increase penetration across all of our targeted segments. 
In summary, the fundamentals in this business are headed in the right direction. We are taking rate and underwriting actions where appropriate, our combined ratio is improving and we are focusing our efforts on target markets.
Now, let's turn to the Wealth Management results on Slide 8. Excluding the effects of DAC unlock, profitability in Wealth Management continued to improve, with core earnings up 10% over prior year. Margin expansion is being driven by equity market appreciation and positive net flows outside of annuities. Core earnings, ex the DAC unlock for the combined annuity segment, was $146 million in the third quarter, an 8% increase over prior year. Rising account values have more than offset net outflows to generate earnings growth. In our Life Insurance business, third quarter results were again strong. Ex the DAC unlocks, core earnings were $57 million. Mortality was a bit unfavorable in the quarter, but within an expected level of volatility. Individual Life sales were up 14% over prior year. We are making excellent progress with our monarch program, our initiative to increase our penetration with some of the largest independent Life producers in the country. We believe momentum here is building, with a record sales month in September and we are excited about growth in the fourth quarter and into 2011. 
In mutual funds, deposits totaled $3.1 billion. Retail mutual fund deposits were off 19% from prior year. The decline in deposits is consistent with generally weak industry flows into equity funds. In contrast, industry flows into fixed income funds remains at historic highs. We are working to grow AUM in this environment, with a more robust fixed income product offering in 2011. Also, we announced two weeks ago the planned sale of our Canadian mutual fund business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This is a non-core operation, with under $2 billion of AUM. As we've said, we will regularly review our portfolio of businesses to ensure that we are focused on the right mix to drive our strategy. Our Retirement Plans business posted solid third quarter. Core earnings, excluding the DAC unlock, were $10 million, up 25% over prior year. Deposits were $2 billion, up 13% over prior year. To summarize third quarter results in Wealth Management, we saw a good flows in non-annuity businesses, margin improvement driven by account value growth and strong sales and profitability in Life Insurance.
Now, let's turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of capital and risk management. We've received a lot of valuable feedback from investors since the second quarter call, indicating they want more clarity about changes in our statutory surplus. We've heard you and we thank you for your input. As a result, we're providing expanded information this quarter. We continue to believe we have sufficient capital for any reasonable stress scenario. Slide 9 presents a roll forward of third quarter changes in stat surplus and our Property & Casualty and U.S. Life Entity. In aggregate, surplus improved about $700 million in the third quarter to $15.2 billion. Working across the slide, VA-related surplus impacts totaled $400 million. I will discuss that in more detail in the next slide. Our Property & Casualty operations generated $300 million of surplus in the quarter. Credit related impacts provided a benefit. Impairments were more than offset by price improvements in several mark to market fixed income portfolio. Dividends from the P&C companies were about $200 million, consistent with our stated plan. In our Life Statutory entities, excluding the impact of the VA business, surplus declined about $100 million. This was caused by reserve increases related to our fixed annuity due to the low interest rate environment.
Now, let's move to Slide 10 to examine the VA surplus impacts in greater detail. VA related statutory income, excluding changes in reserves and hedge assets was about $300 million in the quarter. The two largest drivers of VA related surplus movements are typically changes in statutory liabilities and hedge assets. In the third quarter, these two essentially neutralized one another. With the rising equity markets, statutory VA liabilities declined about $700 million. Conversely, our hedge assets declined in value about $800 million. There are two key drivers for this result. First, while the U.S. equity market recovered much of its second quarter decline, the yen continued to strengthen against the dollar. Second, we increased hedging levels for both global equity protection and yen-dollar protection. That extra equity protection lowered surplus in the quarter due to rising equity markets. Looking ahead to future quarters, you generally should not expect the changes in hedge assets to so closely offset the change in liability. As we've said, our first risk management priority is to manage tail risk. So although we have taken steps to mitigate surplus volatility, you should still expect to see point-to-point volatility in the future. 
Bottom line, we feel good about our capital position. We articulated a prudent capital philosophy in March. Our goal is to be prepared for any reasonable stress scenario. Since that time, the fixed income market has steadily recovered but other Capital Market variables have been more volatile. The significant recovery in bond prices combined with our derisking efforts have meaningfully reduced The Hartford's credit risk. In connection with our March capital raise, we analyzed our investment portfolio under a severe stress scenario that included a double dip recession and additional declines in commercial and residential real estate prices. In total, we anticipated about $2.8 billion of credit-related impacts over 2010 and 2011.
Now, when we analyze our portfolio as of the end of September under the same scenario, the impact has declined to about $1.4 billion over 2010 and 2011. On the other hand, the yen and interest rates remained at stress levels, which partially offset the improvements in credit. As we've said, we continue to feel very confident in our capital position. However, given continued market and economic uncertainty, it is premature to change our capital management philosophy.
Now, let's turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of interest rates. A number of you have asked us about the low interest rate environment. As you know, lower reinvestment rates will reduce net investment income. We can offset this by lowering crediting rates on our spread based liability, but this is only a partial offset because many of those liabilities are at their contractual minimums already. We typically use the forward interest rate curve in our planning process. As a result, our plans 
incorporate today's views of future rate level. However, if interest rates were to stay at their current levels through the end of 2012, we estimate that the incremental core earnings impact will be about $30 million in 2011 and $100 million in 2012. 
Finally, a sustained low interest rate environment over a two-year period should not have a significant impact on DAC or goodwill, which are generally not sensitive to rates in the near term. So bottom line, the interest rate environment is a manageable headwind for The Hartford from an earnings perspective. At the same time, it is a critical factor in our thinking about pricing and returns on new business going forward.
Now, let's turn to Slide 12 for a brief review of our investment results. Declining interest rates and some spread tightening drove significant improvements in the investment portfolio in the quarter. We flipped to a net unrealized gain position at the end of September as the value of our fixed-income holdings increased. Impairments and mortgage loan valuation allowances continued to trend downwards. Total impairments, including OTTI and mortgage loan valuation allowances were $122 million. The primary source of these impairments was weaker collateral performance on a handful of structured commercial real estate securities. Also, included in the $122 million number are $44 million of impairments related to securities we intend to sell given the recent improvements in valuation. Net investment income, excluding trading securities, was $1.1 billion, 3% higher than prior year. Improved partnerships returns more than offset the effect of lower reinvestment on our fixed income portfolio.
Now, let's turn to Slide 13 for our updated 2010 guidance. As we announced last evening, we are increasing our full year core earnings guidance to between $2.60 to $2.70 per share. This range incorporates actual third quarter results, as well as the impact of unseasonably high catastrophe losses in Consumer Markets and P&C Commercial in October. This was driven by severe storm activity in the Southwest United States. We had planned to guide the fourth quarter core earnings of little over $0.90 per diluted share. But in light of October's estimated cat losses, we had lowered our outlook by about $0.09 a share. Therefore, we expect a little over $0.80 per share in the fourth quarter, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Looking ahead, we will share our 2011 outlooks with you early next year. This ends my prepared remarks, which were a little longer than usual. We wanted to provide additional details and insights on capital and interest rates. I hope you found it helpful. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick, as we move into the Q&A session."

When you translate that into the statutory world VA CARVM, you don't have that significant volatility. So from an interest rate side, there isn't that much volatility on the VA CARVM. It does consume a little capital -- in this lower interest rate environment. When you just model different benefits and things and along those lines more from a valuation side, but not a hedging side. So hopefully that's clear. Andy?"

We did record, call it an increase in reserves, in the annuity line, about $300 million due to the low interest rate environment, coupled then with some assumption changes that we put in for others that, that maybe cost us nearly $200 million. So with that, we still then were able to obviously grow statutory surplus during the quarter. So as we fast-forward to year end and doing our year end cash flow testing Q3 Phase I final judgment, actually we feel pretty good that there's not going to be any other headwinds or charges that we face at year end related to those particular items."

Before we begin, I want to take a moment to remember JR Riley of The Hartford's Investor Relations team. As you probably heard, JR passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago. I know many of you interacted with him on a regular basis. He was a valued and respected member of our team and a friend, and his untimely passing was truly tragic. We miss him. And his family remains in our thoughts and prayers.
 In the third quarter, we delivered strong financial results based on solid execution, receiving a lift from rising equity markets and light catastrophe losses. I am confident that we are on the path to delivering more predictable and consistent performance, as well as achieving the targets we set out in April. Core earnings were up 8% from last year at $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. Net income was $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. The investment portfolio improved significantly in the quarter. Chris will provide details but by almost any metric, the portfolio was substantially stronger than it was a year ago. While some of the improvement is due to lower interest rates and spread tightening, it also reflects the significant actions that Greg McGreevey and his team have taken to appropriately derisk the portfolio.
 Investment improvements helped drive book value per share to $45.80 on September 30, up 21% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Our statutory surplus position increased about $700 million. During the quarter, we also put on additional equity and currency hedge protection to mitigate surplus volatility. We managed The Hartford surplus volatility with a combination of reinsurance and hedging programs and by holding appropriate amount of surplus capital. Over time, we will continue to reduce our exposure to changes in the capital markets in a prudent fashion, balancing economics and risk just as we've done in derisking the investment portfolio.
 So in summary, the third quarter performance was very good and is a testament to The Hartford's strong focus on execution. We are making good progress implementing the strategy we outlined in April. We said then that this is a strategy of evolution, not revolution. And that consistent strong execution, quarter after quarter and year after year is key to our success. We've completed the reorganization into a customer-focused structure and this quarter, as you know, began reporting financial results reflecting this new segmentation. Leadership within the businesses is in place and the teams are moving ahead. Andy Pincus is running the Commercial Markets business, where we have good momentum. Andy is a talented and strong leader with deep knowledge of the insurance industry and has been an integral part of the P&C leadership team for the last five years. We are considering internal and external candidates for the Head of Commercial Markets and expect to name a permanent leader in early 2011.
 Commercial Markets delivered good results this quarter, despite some headwinds in Group Benefits. Written premiums in P&C Commercial lines were up 4% over the prior year, led by growth in Small Commercial and Specialty Casualty. Policies-in-force in our standard commercial lines were also up 4%. Underwriting profitability in commercial Property & Casualty improved over the prior year. Excluding caps in prior year development, P&C Commercial posted a combined ratio of 92.2%, about a full point better than the prior period quarter. This reflects The Hartford's commitment to underwriting discipline, as well as benign loss cost trends. I'm very pleased with these results, particularly given the competitive nature of the commercial P&C market. Similar to many of our peers, we are working hard to retain existing profitable business. At the same time, we are pursuing new business where we feel good about the underwriting risks and we recognize this is a balance. Our goal is to increase submission flow in the areas where we want to grow, especially where The Hartford has a unique product offering or underwriting expertise to offer its customers. With small businesses as an example, we continue to have a competitive advantage and are writing new, profitable business that we like. We've also had success with our industry specific programs and are expanding this effort in areas such as technology and healthcare, we have already developed market specific expertise in products that differentiate us from the competition. Our new outpatient healthcare offering is performing very well, contributing to more than $16 million in new healthcare business year-to-date in the Midsized Customers segment. And most recently, we've launched a renewable energy practice. Excellence in sales execution also makes a difference in this environment. Our sales regions are working to develop new opportunities, maximize existing relationships, manage individual sales performance and reduce the variability of process and output. In short, in this environment, we will not sacrifice profitability for growth.
 In Group Benefits, we continue to experience elevated claims incidents and lower terminations in our disability lines during the third quarter. The GBD management team is very focused on taking corrective measures to improve the business results, including taking rate as appropriate. Along with members of the Commercial Markets team, I was at the CIAB conference in Colorado Springs last month, meeting with many of the company's largest agents and brokers. Their response to The Hartford and the changes we are making was positive. They are generally supportive of our new strategy, particularly around the combination of Group Benefits with our commercial Property & Casualty business. This model is consistent with the growing trend of agencies to provide value-added solutions as opposed to a product-centric approach. We launched our new sales approach in support of the combined P&C commercial and GBD strategy in August. Since that time, we have quoted over 200 accounts and built a pipeline of nearly 200 additional qualified opportunities. And to date, in just those few months, we've written over $30 million of joint customer, that being commercial P&C and Group Benefits business. In Consumer Markets, in August, we named Andy Napoli to lead the business. Andy has broad industry operational experience, as well as a background in Personal Lines and affinity relationships. He is making good progress to date in sharpening the businesses focus on the levers that will drive profitable growth. Selling the AARP product to agents, deepening our relationship with AARP, focusing on specific customer segments and developing new affinity programs. We have hired the Kessler Group, a firm with an excellent track record of developing the type of affinity relationships we are looking for. We're focused on this opportunity and are having conversations with potential new partners.
 Under Dave Levenson's leadership, Wealth Management is now organized to focus on four key areas: global annuities, mutual funds, retirement plans and life insurance. In U.S. annuities, Personal Retirement Manager, which we launched last fall, was designed to offer consumers a simpler, lower cost annuity alternative. But in an environment of equity market volatility and low interest rates, customers have sought out richer equity guarantees. As a result, sales of the product have not met expectations. As we said on the second quarter call, Dave and his team are evaluating the annuity strategy. While this work is still underway, I can say our goal is to develop a rational sweep of annuity products, including Personal Retirement Manager, to meet the demands of a range of distributors and customers, with acceptable risk and profitability parameters for The Hartford. The $5 billion target we have articulated is a proportional guide to how we're thinking about The Hartford's desired level of market participation over the long term. But we will not take unacceptable risk to achieve it.
 In other Wealth Management businesses, we are making good headway. We reported a 13% year-over-year increase in retirement plan deposits and Individual Life sales were up 14% over the prior year, with sales in the independent channel up 45%. In mutual funds, we plan to launch global fixed income funds in 2011. This will compliment our existing equity and domestic fixed-income offerings and respond to customer trends. When we communicated our strategy in April, we talked about our intent to improve efficiency at The Hartford. We're making good progress on that front. We have significant opportunities to simplify the company and its processes, making The Hartford easier to do business with and more efficient as a result. As an early example, we have combined service operations throughout the company into one enterprise operations structure. We also announced in mid-October that Jim Ackerley joined us to lead an enterprise-wide effort to simplify our business processes and help us become a more efficient company. I have known Jim for many years and he is widely recognized in financial services for his success in project management, process improvement and enhancing efficiency.
 Finally, I want to comment on the economic environment and its impact on The Hartford. As we have said for the last few quarters, we expect a slow and choppy economic recovery. While there are some signs of improvement, broad economic factors continue to impact our business, including tepid job growth and cautious spending by consumers and businesses alike. Similarly, we also do not expect near term relief from the current low interest rate environment. However, we do think rates will rise over time, particularly given expanding government balance sheets around the world. We continue to target a long-term 13% to 15% ROE when we put business on the books. But in this environment of low interest rates and intense competition, achieving these returns is challenging. That is why we're working so hard on many fronts. We are paying close attention to rate adequacy. In businesses such as Consumer Markets and Group Benefits, we're taking rate and we're letting business go when we need to. We are focusing on market segments where we have sustainable competitive advantages, and we continue to drive for outstanding sales execution and better efficiency.
 I want to thank all of my Hartford teammates for their outstanding performance this quarter. Their commitment to the company and to executing in the marketplace everyday is unmatched. I appreciate all they're doing to move The Hartford forward.
 So to summarize, we delivered strong results in the third quarter. We are making very good progress executing on our strategy and we are confident that we are on a path toward delivering on the 2012 to targets we established. Our goal is to execute quarter after quarter and year after year, delivering consistent operating results and effectively managing the company's risks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris for a deeper dive on this quarter's results. Chris?

Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. The Hartford generated very strong third quarter results, with net income of $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. Core earnings were $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. These resul",2759," Thank you, Liam. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 4. The Hartford generated very strong third quarter results, with net income of $666 million or $1.34 per diluted share. Core earnings were $710 million or $1.43 per diluted share. These results were driven by the five following items: First, solid performance in most of our operating businesses; second, the DAC unlock benefit; third, favorable prior year development in our Property & Casualty businesses; fourth, positive returns on our alternative investments; and fifth, favorable caps. All-in book value at the end of September stood at $45.80, up 11% from the end of June and 21% over prior year. Diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 2% during the quarter to $41.72.
 Now, let's move to Slide 5 to discuss two new financial metrics that we are using internally to track progress against our strategic plan. They are adjusted core earnings and the expense efficiency ratio. Adjusted core earnings excludes significant one-time items, as well as the volatile items like prior year reserve development and DAC unlock. Making these adjustments will provide a clearer picture of the underlying profitability trend of our business. It will also serve as a baseline from which we will measure core earnings growth in future years. We've also quantified the efficiency ratio. As you will recall, at our April Investor Day, we set a goal of reducing our efficiency ratio of 200 basis points by the end of 2012. Now, let's discuss the numbers.
 Adjusted core earnings for the third quarter were $485 million or $0.98 per diluted share. This excludes two items. First, the DAC unlock and second, Property & Casualty prior year reserve development. The DAC unlock benefit's core earnings was $166 million. The majority of this benefit was driven by global equity market appreciation. About $15 million of this benefit reflected our annual review of assumptions used in calculating DAC and other similar balance sheet items. The most significant assumption changes were a decrease in withdrawal levels in the U.S., an increase in future annuitization levels in Japan. We also continued to benefit from positive reserve development in the third quarter, both in our P&C Commercial lines and Consumer Markets. In total, net prior year reserve releases were $99 million after tax. We continue to reserve appropriately and our reserves remain strong. Some of the positive reserve development was offset by an increase to environmental reserves. The after-tax impact was about $40 million.
 Slide 5 also includes a reconciliation of adjusted core earnings for the third quarter, as well as year-to-date. Adjusted core earnings ROE over the last four quarters is 8.9%. This measure reflects adjusted core earnings and also excludes a $440 million write-off relating to the repayment of CPP in the first quarter. We've also quantified our efficiency ratio and included details about the calculation of the ratio in the appendix. The numerator is the expense number and represents all controllable expenses. The denominator includes all revenues other than trading security and realized capital gains and losses. Year to date, the ratio has improved more than 100 basis points. This reflects the significant expense actions the company took over the course of 2009. We are also benefiting from expense discipline and higher revenues in 2010.
 Looking ahead to 2011, we expect the efficiency ratio to increase modestly. This will be driven by investments we are making to execute on our overall strategy, including growth and efficiency initiatives. This should leave us well-positioned to deliver the full 200 basis point run rate improvement by the end of 2012. Much of the future expense saves will come from process improvements across the organization. Our intent is to make our systems work better for customers and employees and to become a simpler and more efficient organization. We will continue to report on this efficiency ratio, along with progress and actions in this area in the quarters ahead.
 Now, let's move to a discussion of third quarter business results, beginning with Commercial Markets on Slide 6. The P&C Commercial lines performed very well in the third quarter, with year-over-year improvements in written premium and underwriting profitability. P&C Commercial reported a 92.2% current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat, almost one point better than the third quarter of 2009. These continued solid underwriting results were driven by our rigorous underwriting and pricing process, coupled with favorable severity from the lower inflationary pressures like wage, and material cost. On the top line, written premiums turned positive with 4% growth over prior year. Some of this reflects an easy comparison against last year's third quarter, when large auto premium adjustments reduced premiums. On the other hand, some of the written premium growth reflects sustainable trends. Renewal pricing remains positive, plus 1% in standard commercial line, a good result in this competitive marketplace. In addition, there was a slight improvement in exposure base during the quarter, suggesting that the decline in exposures has flattened out.
 In Group Benefits, sales continued to be soft due to the weak economic environment and the competitive marketplace. Margins remain pressured by disability experience. We continued to experience elevated claims incidence and lower terminations in our disability lines in the third quarter. We have closely reviewed our disability claims experience and the increased frequency continues to be widespread and not specific to any industry or plan size. We are responding appropriately to these higher loss costs. For 2011, we are increasing disability rates, taking into account the elevated claims experience, as well as the lower interest rate environment. As always, we determine rates on a case-by-case basis. We are committed to maintaining our underwriting discipline. We expect to remain competitive in these key markets.
 In summary, it was a good quarter for Commercial Markets segments. The P&C Commercial lines reported written premium and combined ratio improvement. In Group Benefits, we're making progress on necessary actions to address pressures on profitability.
 Now, let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of our Consumer Market results. In Consumer Markets, we are implementing our strategy to increase profitability and position ourselves to drive growth. We continue to take meaningful rate increases. Renewal written price increases for auto and home were 8% and 11%, respectively in the third quarter. Written premium declined 3% from prior year. This was driven by two factors: Pricing and underwriting actions and our decision to shift our focus to a preferred market segment. Premium retention is relatively flat as pricing increases offset an expected reduction in policy retention. Profitability in the third quarter was lifted by light cat activity. Excluding cat, the current accident year combined ratio was 93.3%, more than 1% better than prior year. Going forward, we are looking to increase our AARP penetration and to sharpen our agency focus. We expect new business premium to begin to grow again in 2011 in response to targeted marketing and new product launches. In agency, we are steadily increasing our focus on the 40-plus age group. More than 80% of agency new business flow in the quarter came from this demographic. We will report this metric going forward and you should expect it to steadily climb. We plan to have our universal auto product in 39 states by the end of the first quarter of 2011. This will further improve our ability to increase penetration across all of our targeted segments.
 In summary, the fundamentals in this business are headed in the right direction. We are taking rate and underwriting actions were appropriate, our combined ratio is improving and we are focusing our efforts on target markets.
 Now, let's turn to the Wealth Management results on Slide 8. Excluding the effects of DAC unlock, profitability in Wealth Management continued to improve, with core earnings up 10% over prior year. Margin expansion is being driven by equity market appreciation and positive net flows outside of annuities. Core earnings, ex the DAC unlock for the combined annuity segment, was $146 million in the third quarter, an 8% increase over prior year. Rising account values have more than offset net outflows to generate earnings growth. In our Life Insurance business, third quarter results were again strong. Ex the DAC unlocks, core earnings were $57 million. Mortality was a bit unfavorable in the quarter, but within an expected level of volatility. Individual Life sales were up 14% over prior year. We are making excellent progress with our monarch program, our initiative to increase our penetration with some of the largest independent Life producers in the country. We believe momentum here is building, with a record sales month in September and we are excited about growth in the fourth quarter and into 2011.
 In mutual funds, deposits totaled $3.1 billion. Retail mutual fund deposits were off 19% from prior year. The decline in deposits is consistent with generally weak industry flows into equity funds. In contrast, industry flows into fixed income funds remains at historic highs. We are working to grow AUM in this environment, with a more robust fixed income product offering in 2011. Also, we announced two weeks ago the planned sale of our Canadian mutual fund business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. This is a non-core operation, with under $2 billion of AUM. As we've said, we will regularly review our portfolio of businesses to ensure that we are focused on the right mix to drive our strategy. Our Retirement Plans business posted solid third quarter. Core earnings, excluding the DAC unlock, were $10 million, up 25% over prior year. Deposits were $2 billion, up 13% over prior year. To summarize third quarter results in Wealth Management, we saw a good flows in non-annuity businesses, margin improvement driven by account value growth and strong sales and profitability in Life Insurance.
 Now, let's turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of capital and risk management. We've received a lot of valuable feedback from investors since the second quarter call, indicating they want more clarity about changes in our statutory surplus. We've heard you and we thank you for your input. As a result, we're providing expanded information this quarter. We continue to believe we have sufficient capital for any reasonable stress scenario. Slide 9 presents a roll forward of third quarter changes in step surplus and our Property & Casualty and U.S. Life Entity. In aggregate, surplus improved about $700 million in the third quarter to $15.2 billion. Working across the slide, VA-related surplus impacts totaled $400 million. I will discuss that in more detail in the next slide. Our Property & Casualty operations generated $300 million of surplus in the quarter. Credit related impacts provided the benefit. Impairments were more than offset by price improvements in several mark to market fixed income portfolio. Dividends from the P&C companies were about $200 million, consistent with our stated plan. In our Life Statutory entities, excluding the impact of the VA business, surplus declined about $100 million. This was caused by reserve increases related to our fixed annuity due to the low interest rate environment.
 Now, let's move to Slide 10 to examine the VA surplus impacts in greater detail. VA related statutory income, excluding changes in reserves and hedge assets was about $300 million in the quarter. The two largest drivers of VA related surplus movements are typically changes in statutory liability and hedge assets. In the third quarter, these two essentially neutralized to one another. With the rising equity markets, statutory VA liabilities declined about $700 million. Conversely, our hedge assets declined in value about $800 million. There are two key drivers for this result. First, while the U.S. equity market recovered much of its second quarter decline, the yen continued to strengthen against the dollar. Second, we increased hedging levels for both global equity protection and yen-dollar protection. That extra equity protection lowered surplus in the quarter due to rising equity markets. Looking ahead to future quarters, you generally should not expect the changes in hedge assets to so closely offset the change in liability. As we've said, our first risk management priority is to manage tail risk. So although we have taken steps to mitigate surplus volatility, you should still expect to see point-to-point volatility in the future.
 Bottom line, we feel good about our capital position. We articulated a prudent capital philosophy in March. Our goal is to be prepared for any reasonable stress scenario. Since that time, the fixed income market has steadily recovered but other Capital Market variables have been more volatile. The significant recovery in bond prices combined with our derisking efforts have meaningfully reduced The Hartford's credit risk. In connection with our March capital raise, we analyzed our investment portfolio under a severe stress scenario that included a double dip recession and additional declines in commercial and residential real estate prices. In total, we anticipated about $2.8 billion of credit-related impacts over 2010 and 2011.
 Now, when we analyze our portfolio as of the end of September under the same scenario, the impact has declined to about $1.4 billion over 2010 and 2011. On the other hand, the yen and interest rates remained at stress levels, which partially off the improvements in credit. As we've said, we continue to feel very confident in our capital position. However, given continued market and economic uncertainty, it is premature to change our capital management philosophy.
 Now, let's turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of interest rates. A number of you have asked us about the low interest rate environment. As you know, lower reinvestment rates will reduce net investment income. We can offset this by lowering crediting rates on our spread based liability, but this is only a partial offset because many of those liabilities are at their contractual minimums already. We typically use the forward interest rate curve in our planning process. As a result, our plan to incorporate today's views of future rate level. However, if interest rates were to stay at their current levels through the end of 2012, we estimate that the incremental core earnings impact will be about $30 million in 2011 and $100 million in 2012.
 Finally, a sustained low interest rate environment over a two-year period should not have a significant impact on DAC or goodwill, which are generally not sensitive to rates in the near term. So bottom line, the interest rate environment is a manageable headwind for The Hartford from an earnings perspective. At the same time, it is a critical factor in our thinking about pricing and returns on new business going forward.
 Now, let's turn to Slide 12 for a brief review of our investment results. Declining interest rates and some spread tightening drove significant improvements in the investment portfolio in the quarter. We flipped to a net unrealized gain position at the end of September as the value of our fixed-income holdings increased. Impairments and mortgage loan valuation allowances continued to trend downwards. Total impairments, including OTTI and mortgage loan valuation allowances were $122 million. The primary source of these impairments was weaker collateral performance on a handful of structured commercial real estate securities. Also, included in the $122 million number are $44 million of impairments related to securities we intend to sell given the recent improvements in valuation. Net investment income, excluding trading securities, was $1.1 billion, 3% higher than prior year. Improved partnerships returns more than offset the effect of lower reinvestment on our fixed income portfolio.
 Now, let's turn to Slide 13 for our updated 2010 guidance. As we announced last evening, we are increasing our full year core earnings guidance to between $2.60 to $2.70 per share. This range incorporates actual third quarter results, as well as the impact of unseasonably high catastrophe losses in Consumer Markets and P&C Commercial in October. This was driven by severe storm activity in the Southwest United States. We had planned to guide the fourth quarter core earnings of little over $0.90 per diluted share. But in light of October's estimated cat losses, we had lowered our outlook by about $0.09 a share. Therefore, we expect a little over $0.80 per share in the fourth quarter, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Looking ahead, we will share our 2011 outlooks with you early next year. This ends my prepared remarks, which were a little longer than usual. We wanted to provide additional details and insights on capital and interest rates. I hope you found it helpful. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick, as we move into the Q&A session.

On the auto side, our plus eight is high, but not unexpected given the profitability actions we're taking in our agency channel. As far as what's happening at the agency level, we have introduced pretty strict underwriting guidelines that are driving that mixed shift that Liam referenced and Chris in their remarks. We're pushing our new business mix 40 plus is what we call it, accounts for 80% of that new business flow. As that continues to propagate itself within the renewal book, I think we'll be in a much better place going forward.

The second question is around the variable annuity comments that you made earlier. Liam, it sounds like you want to get back to that $5 billion target. Do you have some moving benefit products that you might launch pretty soon that could get you back into the game that might bring you in the near tern toward a $5 billion annualized rate? And then just lastly real quickly, what do you estimate to be your access of redeployable capital number at this stage in the game?

So in terms of the time, I'd say as you referenced a large portion of our book has three-year rate guarantees. And so we are going into the market with price based on our reaction to higher incidence and lower terminations and interest rate. And so it's going to take some time, probably the number of years to work completely through. But we're still working very diligently on the higher incidence and lowered termination piece, so we are taking actions there with regard to price. But we're also keenly focused from a claim perspective on making sure that our execution is absolutely good as it can be. And so we will continue to be very focused there. Obviously, with the goal of improving that ratio.

We did record, call it increase in reserves, in the annuity line, about $300 million due to the low interest rate environment, coupled then with some assumption changes that we put in for others that, that maybe cost us nearly $200 million. So with that, we still then were able to obviously grow statutory surplus during the quarter. So as we fast-forward to year end and during our year end cash flow affecting Q3 Phase I final judgment, actually we feel pretty good that there's not going to be any other headwinds or charges that we face at year end related to those particular items.
