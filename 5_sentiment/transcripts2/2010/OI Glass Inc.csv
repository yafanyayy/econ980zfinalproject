Despite the global recession, we reported adjusted earnings of $2.93 per share, one of our best results since O-I returned as a public company in 1991. We generated $372 million of free cash flow for the year, which rivals our record cash generation in 2008. At the same time, we invested over $400 million of capital, including projects to streamline and improve the productivity of our asset base. Unprecedented market conditions throughout the year led to a 10% reduction in shipments from 2008. Faced with this challenge, we remain steadfast in our strategy to temporarily curtail production to match supply with lower demand.
In fact, we reduced our inventories by 11% from the prior year as we focused on maintaining a lean working capital structure during uncertain times. This strong working capital management was the key driver of our free cash flow generation. Although the year presented many challenges, we successfully advanced our strategic priorities, improved price and mix significantly, thereby exceeding the modest cost inflation. In 2009, we achieved more than $120 million in savings from our strategic footprint initiative and we improved our already strong financial position by reducing net debt and extending bond maturity. I am proud of how O-I faced the most difficult market we have seen in generations and the strong results we achieved despite these challenges.
Likewise, we ended the year on a positive note as our fourth quarter 2009 results of $0.49 per share exceeded prior year earnings. Strong operating performance offset higher non-operational costs. As with the full year, we benefitted from improved price and mix and savings from our footprint initiative. The gradual year-over-year improvements in volume, comparisons we've noted throughout the year continued in the fourth quarter as shipments were down only modestly from 2008 levels. While temporary production curtailments continued due to lower demand, we also reduced inventories significantly from third quarter levels.
As expected, non-operational costs increased from the prior year, driven by higher year-over-year pension expense, a higher effect of tax rate during the quarter and continued currency charges in Venezuela. Given our strong cash flow generation in 2009, we applied cash to reduce debt and accelerated 2010 non-U.S. pension contributions. As is customary for O-I, the fourth quarter was the peak capital spending period for the year.
Looking to 2010, we expect that price and mix should more than offset continued modest cost inflation. Given the fixed and variable cost bases of our operations, we have significant operating leverage due to changes in production levels. As the market recovers and stronger volumes drive higher utilization of our operations, this leverage will benefit future earnings. While non-operational costs will increase primarily due to higher pension expense, future earnings will continue to benefit from footprint initiative savings. Overall, we believe O-I is well-positioned to drive profitable growth and advance our strategic priorities in 2010.
Now I will review our performance by region on chart three. We have provided segment operating profit for each of our four regions. Full year profits are shown on the left and fourth quarter results are on the right. I will share a few high level comments about annual regional trends, but concentrate on the fourth quarter to provide more timely market color. In 2009 we successfully maintained profit margin percentages in the mid-teens even with net sales and profits declining by more than 10%. Europe bore the brunt of temporary production curtailments to balance supply with lower demand, which accounted for most of the difference between 2009 and 2008 segment profits.
At the same time, the region generated more than half of our working capital improvements in 2009 and significant footprint savings. North America's operating profits improved more than 50% compared to 2008. The region successfully passed through significant prior year cost inflation, resulting in strong price improvements in 2009. Of our four regions, North America achieved the greatest benefit from the strategic footprint initiative during the year. South America faced the highest cost inflation environment and met this challenge with strong price actions.
While contending with the largest year-over-year volume decline in all of our regions, South America's margins still exceeded 20%, which is the highest in our portfolio. Asia-Pacific made the strongest come back during the second half of 2009 after its results during the first half were impacted by economic issues and higher costs. Overall, conditions improved throughout the year. Year-over-year volume comparisons improved each quarter and our earnings during the second half of 2009 exceeded the same period in 2008.
Now turning to the fourth quarter, our European operating profits clearly rebounded from the prior year. As you may recall, fourth quarter 2008 profits were under significant pressure due to the global recession. Since then, our European results have benefitted from improved price and mix and footprint savings. Foreign exchange translation was also a tail wind in the fourth quarter. European shipments were down from the prior year and now generally reflect underlying consumer consumption patterns.
In North America, our performance was consistent throughout the year. Profits benefitted from improved price and mix, as well as our footprint initiative. Profits increased despite shipments being down modestly from the prior year. During the quarter, we successfully renegotiated many North American customer contracts which took effect in 2010. As a result, we have significantly repaired our margins on those businesses. We will also see greater margin stability due to the more rapid pass through of volatile cost components like energy.
Furthermore, we maintained relationships with all our customers throughout this process. However, shipment levels will likely decline in order to achieve our objectives. In response to this lower volume, yesterday we announced the permanent closure of two of our highest cost plans in North America, plus one additional firm. As it will take several months to complete these closures, we will incur additional temporary production curtailments in the first half of 2010. Once these changes are complete, operating profits will improve, starting in the second half of 2010. These are difficult decisions to make, especially since these operations and our employees there have been part of the O-I family for so many years. As is our practice, we are offering assistance programs to impacted employees at the closed plants.
In the fourth quarter, South American profits were 10% higher than the third quarter, but modestly down from 2008. The region continued to benefit from significant year-over-year price improvements, which more than offset high cost inflation in South America. Earlier this year, shipments were down sharply due to customers temporarily extending the useful life of returnable and refillable bottles, a common recessionary trend. Demand in all end use categories has improved over the past few months, prompting higher returnable bottle sales.
Overall, our fourth quarter shipments were essentially flat with the prior year and this reflects quite an improvement from earlier in 2009. We made solid progress as we extended our footprint initiative to South America where we shut down two furnaces and relocated multiple machine lines. We continued to remit cash from Venezuela to avoid additional exposure to the bolivars which impacted regional profit-margins by nearly 4 percentage points. Ed will discuss currency developments in Venezuela in a few minutes.
In Asia-Pacific, results benefitted from improved price and mix, while input costs remained stable. Export wine sales from both Australia and New Zealand were quite strong. We continued to see sales recovery in China, albeit at lower margins compared to the regional average. Finally, a stronger Australian dollar also provided considerable benefits to regional results. Overall we are very pleased with the progress each of our regions made in this challenging marketplace and we are confident that our strategies will continue to drive improved financial performance over the long-term. I will now turn the call back over to Ed.

32583,78966674,47366,"Owens-Illinois, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","O-I Glass, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Al. Let us begin with our reconciliation or segment sales operating profit and EPS. First, we will start with our fourth quarter year-over-year sales reconciliation on chart number four. Segment sales increased approximately $1.7 billion in the fo",2000,"Thanks, Al. Let us begin with our reconciliation or segment sales operating profit and EPS. First, we will start with our fourth quarter year-over-year sales reconciliation on chart number four. Segment sales increased approximately $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 to almost $1.9 billion. Sales benefitted $76 million or more than 4% from the improved price and mix that Al just discussed. Glass shipments in tons were down 5%, impacting revenues by $102 million. This volume decline was the smallest for the year, reflecting the improving trend in year-over-year volume comparisons.
Finally, sales benefitted from the weaker U.S. dollar. This was the first quarter in 2009 when currency translation was favorable on our top line. Moving over to segment operating profit, fourth quarter profit was $196 million, up from $157 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. As we expected, operating profits benefitted from improved price and mix, favorable currency translation, and lower operating expenses while lower shipments, additional temporary production curtailments and greater maintenance expense resulted in higher manufacturing and delivery costs.
On an EPS basis, our adjusted net income was $0.49 per share in the quarter, up from $0.45 in the prior year. The benefit of the operating items just discussed was $0.22 but they were partially offset by non-operational items that impacted earnings by $0.18. The two most significant items were the higher year-over-year tax rate that reduced quarterly EPS by $0.8 and remittance of cash from Venezuelan at the parallel rate which cost another $0.6 which is included in the other line.
Chart five illustrates the full year reconciliation for segment sales operating profit and adjusted earnings. Sales declined in 2009, primarily due to lower shipments, as a result of weaker market conditions, customer destocking in the first half of the year, and our price over volume strategy. Although the U.S dollar was weaker compared to other currencies in the fourth quarter, it was much stronger earlier in the year and overall, for the full year, currency translation was unfavorable compared to 2008. Finally, improved price and mix benefitted both revenue and operating profits.
Moving over to segment operating profit, though down from the prior year, we still achieved a segment operating profit of nearly $1 billion in 2009. We have very pleased with this achievement, given that year-over-year profits were reduced by more than half a billion dollars due to lower sales and significant temporary production curtailments. But these dramatic head wins were mostly offset by our pricing, cost management, and footprint initiatives. On an EPS basis, our adjusted earnings were $2.93 per share for full year 2009, down from a record $3.80 in 2008.
In addition to the EPS impact from the operating factors just discussed, non-operating costs were higher and reduced year-over-year EPS by $0.25. These costs were driven by higher pension expense, a higher effective tax rate and a $0.12 charge for exchange losses on our Venezuelan cash remittances. As Al said earlier, our operations performed well in 2009 and we finished the year with fourth quarter earnings exceeding prior year results.
Now chart six illustrates our year-over-year free cash flow reconciliation. We generated $372 million of free cash flow in 2009, compared to $396 million in the prior year. As discussed, 2009 operating profits were down from the year before. Depreciation expense declined as our footprint initiative reduced our asset-base and as a result of foreign currency translation. Working capital was a major source of cash and represented a year-over-year swing of $302 million. This favorable result came from inventory and trade receivable management which was a constant focus throughout the year.
Asbestos spending was down $20 million from 2008 and I will review asbestos in more detail shortly. CapEx was approximately $66 million higher than 2008. Payments for restructuring and severance were also higher by $19 million. We have used our strong balance sheet and cash flow to make these necessary investments to streamline and optimize our operations for the benefit of the company's long-term profitability. Other operating cash flow items are outlined in the footnote at the bottom of the chart.
Let's move to chart number seven for more detail on our balance sheet and free cash flow. Total debt on December 31, was $3.6 billion and cash was $812 million. During 2009, net debt came down more than $150 million. We also maintained a strong debt to EBITDA ratio at 2.2 to 1. This was at year-end. Our global revolving credit facility remained undrawn, giving us additional capacity of approximately $760 million. Capital investments totaled $428 million in 2009. As usual, the fourth quarter was our peak capital spending period for the year. We concentrated on a number of maintenance projects that we had deferred earlier in 2009 until our cash flow outlook was more certain. Likewise, the majority of our restructuring payments were made in the fourth quarter and primarily related to several furnace closures announced earlier in the year.
Now as Al mentioned, we've put some of our available cash to work in the fourth quarter. We repaid $63 million of debt, primarily a portion of our Australian term notes, due in 2011. We also accelerated our 2010 expected pension contribution which helped reduce our unfunded, non-U.S. pension liability. Keep in mind, our strategic cash priorities remain unchanged which include organic growth opportunity such as footprint optimization, along with strategic acquisitions. However, we will continue to be opportunistic in our approach and we may put cash to work for other uses like debt reduction, as we did in the fourth quarter.
I will now review the situation in Venezuela. In mid-2009, we recognized that economic conditions were negatively impacting the official Venezuelan currency exchange process. To mitigate further exposure to the bolivars, we began remitting cash generated in Venezuela through the parallel currency exchange market. As a result, we incurred an exchange loss of $0.12 in the second half of 2009. As you read in our press release we translated our year end Venezuelan balance sheet at the parallel exchange rate of 6 bolivars to the dollar from the official fixed rate of 2.15. This revaluation resulted in a $179 million reduction of total shareholder equity.
Just three weeks ago, the Venezuelan government devalued the Bolivar, establishing an official three-tiered exchange rate system which now includes the parallel market rate. Furthermore Venezuela is now officially deemed a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. Therefore, going forward, we will translate Venezuelan Bolivar denominated financial results at the parallel rate instead of the historic official rate. With this change, we no longer expect to incur further exchange losses on Venezuelan cash remittances.
Having remitted cash at the parallel rate in the second half of 2009, the incremental head win of devaluation will impact 2010 earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 per share, principally recognized in the first half of the year, assuming no further change in exchange rates. O-I has successfully operated in Venezuela for more than 50 years and this is not the first time we faced strong inflation and currency issue. We are committed to our Venezuelan operation and we remain optimistic about our business opportunities in that country.
On chart eight we've provided an asbestos update. First, nothing has changed in the basic fact pattern. We exited the business in 1958. That was 52 years ago. As you can see on the left, we had 6,000 new cases filed in 2009 and the total number of pending cases dropped to 7,000 which is the lowest number of pendings since 1980. On the right you see our cash payment history and our total recorded asbestos liability. Our 2009 payments were $190 million, a 10% drop compared to 2008 payments.
During the fourth quarter, we conducted our annual review of our asbestos activity to adjust our future liability. As a result, the company recorded a noncash charge of $180 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. This charge compares to $250 million in 2008. The lower 2009 asbestos charge reflected in part, the significantly lower level of pending asbestos related lawsuits at this year-end, at the year just ended. Overall, asbestos remains a limited and declining risk for the company.
On chart nine, we present our business outlook for both the first quarter and the full year 2010. We've provided the usual directional guidance on the key business drivers for earnings and cash flow. Plus, we expanded information for the full year 2010 to include earnings sensitivity for price, volume, and temporary production curtailments and estimated ranges for cost inflation, footprint savings and non-operational costs. And finally, our thoughts on several other items impacting free cash flow. Of course, as with any estimates, they are subject to change throughout the year.
Starting with our key business factors, price and mix, we expect margins will benefit from improved price and mix, both in the first quarter and for full year 2010, led by our North American region. However, total company 2010 price realization will be more modest than what we achieved in 2009 as last year benefitted from the recovery of significant 2008 cost inflation.
Sales volume. Shipments in North America are expected to be down in the first quarter, compared to 2009. However, rest of the world shipments should improve modestly without the repeat of 2009 destocking. Looking at the full year, even with lower North American volumes following contract negotiations, we expect total global shipments should improve in 2010 on a year-over-year basis as the global market continues to recover.
Temporary curtailments. Given our new business mix, additional down time will be required in North America during the first half of 2010 until we complete the permanent capacity closure. By the second half of 2010, down time should be significantly reduced as market recovers and as our North American restructuring will be mostly complete.
Cost inflation. We expect inflation will remain modest throughout 2010 and approximate $50 million to $80 million.
Footprint savings. These initiatives will generate continued savings ranging between $50 million and $80 million in 2010.
Non-operational costs. Two factors will drive higher costs in 2010. First, corporate and retained costs will retain approximately $50 million from 2009, mostly due to additional pension expense which should be incurred evenly throughout the year. Also, net interest expense is expected to increase by $20 million to $40 million due to higher debt levels and expected higher interest rates. Finally we expect our effective tax rate will remain the same at approximately 27%.
While the effects have been integrated into the outlook I have provided, I want to highlight the earnings impact of the North American contract renegotiation and developments in Venezuela. For the full year 2010, we expect to maintain our North American operating profits achieved in 2009. While long-term profits will start to improve in the second half of 2010, once capacity has been realigned. As I previously mentioned, the developments in Venezuela could negatively impact 2010 earnings by an incremental $0.10 to $0.15 per share and this impact will principally be felt in the first half of the year.
Regarding other 2010 items, capital expenditures should be approximately $475 million. Keep in mind that maintenance level capital is typically around $350 million. The additional investments, primarily relate to the completion of our new furnace in New Zealand and to the North American realignment activity. Further, we expect restructuring payments of approximately $100 million, mostly related to the realignment of our North American asset base. 
2010 pension payment should only approximate $15 million since we prefunded required international pension contribution at the end of 2009. Finally, as market conditions recover, higher sales will require a greater investment in working capital. Overall, we are very encouraged by our prospects in this new year, especially after how we managed so well through a difficult 2009. The company has been doing all the right things to create long-term value and we look forward to building on this progress. Now I will return the call back to Al.

So that generally requires a little bit more planning of the supply chain. But certainly also contract negotiations played a role in our decision with regards to the overall volume that was going to be needed and I believe what really we've seen in the second half of last year is that some of our customers became fairly reluctant to be optimistic with regard to what the future of that was going to be and of course that ultimately led to some of the discussions, the decisions that we had to make with regards to the planned closures as well. It's really projected demand. That also had quite an influence on our decision.

So that's a direct tie to what we have done to take cost out of the system, also had required some investments to get to that possibility and to that point. The third issue is that we are still going to grow in markets where we have very strong underlying growth patterns and a strong position and we have been making investments in Peru and New Zealand for new facilities. And then, another aspect that we are spending some capital on is we are creating greater flexibility in our operations and bringing new technology into our operations to basically be able to serve a variety of industries and markets from one facility rather than have a facility dedicated only to one use like beer or one facility dedicated to wine, which creates in the supply chain then a lot of freight cost and other transactional costs that we want to avoid. So the flexibility of our facilities will require some capital that going to give us better profitability down the line.

I believe that of course, the heightened level of discussion and visibility concerning BPA is certainly raising people's attention and perhaps influencing some of their decisions. But we see other factors as well. Other factors are for instance sustainability issues with regards to carbon footprint. 
There are issues with regard to refillable containers obviously in a time of economic stress, offering a cheaper alternative than one way packaging and I think companies are also looking at glass again as differentiation. If everything is being sold as plastic then eventually glass again becomes a differentiator. So there are a variety of aspects to deal with this, but I would say overall, to give you a flavor, we certainly have seen a heightened level of discussion and willingness of customers to consider glass or to have more serious discussions about glass as an alternative packaging.

In the second quarter, we saw a number of encouraging developments, including accelerated growth in emerging markets, improved regional mix, and a number of strategic activities that will benefit future earnings and cash flow. We did, however, also faced challenges in the quarter, such as weaker demand in Eastern Europe, sluggish beer consumption in the developed markets, and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency.
Adjusted earnings were $0.90 per share in the second quarter, down from last year. Excluding the impact of currency changes, O-I's second quarter earnings were $0.98 per share, up slightly from the prior year. This reflected solid underlying operating performance.
Price and product mix added more than 1% to sales, which is consistent with the improvement we saw in the first quarter. The benefit of higher prices more than offset (inaudible) cost inflation.
Globally, shipments were down slightly from the prior year. North America's volumes were lowered primarily due to the impact of e-contracts that were renegotiated late last year and went into effect in 2010. Excluding this impact, our global shipments were actually up 1.7% from last year, pointing to a modest overall economic improvement.
As the global recession abates, the rate of recovery has varied widely. For example, shipments were up at the mid-teens in South America, while volumes were up more than 10% at Eastern Europe during the second quarter. And I'll comment further on regional trends in a few minutes.
The impact of overall lower shipments on our earnings was offset by a favorable regional mix from a rapidly growing higher margin business in South America. As planned, we completed the final capacity adjustments under the strategic footprint initiative that we launched in 2007. Going forward, we will keep our asset base aligned with market demands.
We generated positive - excuse me, positive free cash flow despite the fact that higher seasonal demand typically results in the use of cash in the second quarter. And we successfully implemented several of our strategic plans in the second quarter. We expanded our preference in fast-growing emerging markets through the acquisition of a plant in China and through our new Southeast Asia joint venture operating in Malaysia and Vietnam.
In another move, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of company stock and refinanced our highest cost debt to improve our capital structure.
Moving to the third quarter, we will continue to manage prices to reflect input costs and demand trend. Volumes will likely be consistent with prior years as strong growth in emerging markets offset the impact of sluggish beer demand in North America and Europe. Earnings will benefit from improved capacity utilization and our footprint initiative. Yet, currency trends will likely remain a headwind for O-I in the second half of this year.
Now, let's review our operating performance on chart three. This chart shows segment operating profit and margins for the company as well as for each of our four regions. Overall, segment operating profit was $287 million, down from the second quarter of 2009; while profit margins improved to almost 17% of sales.
We have also included the second quarter of 2010 profits adjusted to reflect prior year currency's rate for easier year-over-year comparisons and to highlight the underlying operating performance of the company. Adjusted for currency, operating profit was $305 million, a modest increase from the prior year. Operationally, higher prices and favorable mix more than offset the impact of lower volumes.
Looking at regional performance, operating profit was up in both South America and Asia Pacific led by strong growth in emerging markets. Profits trended down in Europe and North America where the economic recovery proceeded at a slower pace.
I will briefly review the trends in each region beginning with Europe. Operating profit was $104 million, down $17 million from the prior year. As shown, profit adjusted for currency was down about $7 million. Total shipments in Europe increased marginally from the prior year. Strong export demand for wine and spirits was offset by lower Eastern European shipments that we attributed to economic challenges in this area.
At the same time, domestic consumption in Western Europe was essentially flat with the prior year. European domestic beer volumes remained weak, likely due to continued high unemployment levels, particularly in young adults who greatly impact beer consumption. As we expected, selling prices and input costs were down from the prior year. And earnings benefited from higher capacity utilization.
Looking at North America, operating profit was $88 million, down $15 million from last year. As mentioned, we renegotiated key customer agreements in late 2009 that went into effect in January. We raised our prices to repair our margins, but this resulted in lower shipments. Although our North American volumes declined more than 10% from the second quarter of 2009, the benefit of higher prices more than offset the impact of lower volumes. We attributed our volume declines to the renegotiated contracts as well as the continued weak domestic beer consumption.
Overall, US beer consumption was down 3%, largely due to high unemployment, similar to what we're seeing in Europe. This underscores our need to deliver innovative products to the market and focus our growth on the most promising end use category. We did this in the second quarter with our new Vortex bottle, which features grooves inside the bottle neck. Miller Light has successfully launched the Vortex bottle, which is designed to differentiate the customer brand on the shelf. Our presence remained very strong among craft beer customers as well, which is now the fastest growing beer category in the United States.
While overall beer demand was weak, wine and spirits were up more than 10% on a year-over-year basis. So clearly, demand trends varied widely by end use category.
We incurred additional costs in North America due to our final footprint realignment efforts. These included incremental production curtailments and startup costs as we relocated business from closed plants. As expected, these actions drove an unfavorable year-over-year earnings comparison in the region. Four realignment efforts are now basically complete and will result in improved earnings starting in the second half of this year.
Our South American operating profit was $64 million, up from $57 million last year, and margins improved to 26%. Profit was up despite a $16 million headwind due to the Venezuelan currency devaluation. Adjusted for currency, profit was $77 million. Our South American team demonstrated outstanding performance by driving growth, improving productivity, and expanding margins in the first half of 2010. We are seeing a broad-based improvement in volumes across South America. Overall, shipments in the region were up in the mid-teens from the prior year, and the growth rate accelerated from the first quarter.
Importantly, we grew the business in all major end use categories. Certain markets, including Brazil, grew at more than 20% over the prior year. Shipment levels in Venezuela remained on par with the prior year, which is quite an accomplishment given the very difficult business climate in that country. To help offset cost inflation, our South American region, successfully raised prices. Earnings also benefited from higher capacity utilization as very strong demand in the region drove higher operating rates and production levels.
The integration of our new plant in Rosario, Argentina is proceeding well. In fact, our team has raised productivity there by more than 10% in the first two months of operations. We are more than doubling capacity at Rosario to target the profitable wine market in Argentina. This expansion will be complete in the third quarter. And with the market recovery in Peru, we expect to begin production at our second furnace in Lurin, Peru in the third quarter as well.
Our Asia Pacific region reported operating profit of $31 million, up from $11 million last year with margins of nearly 14%. While currency contributed $4 million, higher prices and increased production levels drove the region's earnings to improve. Total shipments across Asia Pacific were up modestly from the prior year. While the strong Australian dollar negatively impacted wine exports in that country, total shipments in China grew by more than 20%. Like South America, growth in China is broad-based with double-digit increases nearly all end use categories. These trends underscore the importance of our expansion in this fast-growing region.
The recently announced joint venture and acquisition helps expand our footprint in China as well as in Malaysia and Vietnam, which are all experiencing strong growth. Additionally, we expect to begin production at our new furnace in New Zealand by early fourth quarter.
Higher prices in the region continued to more than offset cost inflation. Earnings benefited from higher production levels and lower freight costs, reflecting less maintenance and project-related downtime in the second quarter of 2010, compared to the prior year. As you can see, the base of the economic recovery in the second quarter varied widely by region and across key end use categories.
Overall, we do see a gradual economic improvement in our business, albeit, at a slower rate than we expected early in the year. We remain confident that volumes will recover across our operations, but at a pace that will vary by region. And this pace will be largely influenced by future beer demand patterns in Europe and North America. We're pleased with the progress each of the region have achieved during the quarter implementing our strategies to drive improved financial performance.
And I will now turn the call over to Ed.

Let's begin with our reconciliations for sales, operating profit, and EPS on chart four. Segment sales decreased from approximately $1.8 billion in 2009 to $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Improved price and mix added 1.3% to sales",1707,"Thanks, Al. Let's begin with our reconciliations for sales, operating profit, and EPS on chart four. Segment sales decreased from approximately $1.8 billion in 2009 to $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Improved price and mix added 1.3% to sales or $23 million. As we saw last quarter, costs as we provisioned in our North American customer contracts resulted in the small impact on sales and had a negligible effect on operating profit.
Moving to sales volume on the following line, glass shipments in tons were 1.8% below the prior year on a global basis, reducing sales by $28 million. Finally, the stronger US dollar reduced our top line by $81 million in the second quarter. Most of this impact was due to a weaker euro and the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation.
Moving over to segment operating profit, the second quarter was $287 million, down $5 million from the $292 million reported in 2009. Operating profit benefited from higher price and product mix. There was no impact on operating profit from changes in sales volume. This was because of the strong growth of high margin business in South America, which fully offset the unfavorable earnings effect from lower volumes in other regions.
Manufacturing and delivery costs increased $6 million. Cost inflation was $18 million, which was fully offset by incremental footprint savings. Therefore, the $6 million increase related to higher other manufacturing costs, either in our North American operations, where they've incurred expenses related to the movement of some production as a result of our footprint realignment. And the entire cost exceeded the overall improved capacity utilization across the company. Operating expenses were up moderately by $5 million.
Finally, currency translation reduced operating profit by $17 million in the second quarter. Nearly all of this impact related to the translation of our Venezuelan results at a less favorable rate than last year given the devaluation of the bolivar earlier this year. The bolivar to US dollar exchange rate was 5.3 bolivar to the USD at June 30, 2010. This is the rate established by a new government control system that replaced the private parallel exchange market.
Moving to Europe, a weaker euro impacted earnings by $9 million compared to last year, while other currencies around the world remained strong and mostly offset this effect.
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.90 per share in the quarter, down $0.04 from the prior year. Lower EPS reflected a net effect of improved price and mix, unfavorable currency translation, and higher non-operational costs. Let me review those. Higher year-over-year net interest expense was principally due to a higher debt balance carried through the quarter.
I'll discuss the balance sheet further in a minute. Retained corporate costs on a net basis were lower compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to the favorable impact of currency derivatives that we used to mitigate our exposure on certain balance sheet items. Taxes reduced earnings by $0.04 on a year-over-year basis as our second quarter rate of approximately 25% was higher than the prior year rate of 22%. Also, we had a $0.02 benefit in the quarter from the repurchase of $6 million of alive stock in the first half of this year.
One comment on GAAP EPS, as expected, we incurred approximately $8 million of note one [ph] charges in the second quarter related to restructuring actions announced in late 2009.
Chart five illustrates our year-over-year free cash flow reconciliation. For the first half of the year, we used $62 million of cash, compared to $59 million source of cash in the same period last year. The reconciliation clearly shows two big items driving this additional use of cash. Working capital was a $45 million greater use of cash in the first half. Keep in mind that the significant inventory reductions we took in 2009 did not repeat at the same level in the first half of this year.
Next, capital expenditures were $112 million higher in the first half of 2010 than last year. In 2009, we shifted capital spending from the first three quarters during the worse of the economic downturn and moved them into the fourth quarter when business conditions started to improve. This year, our capital spending will be more balanced across each quarter.
Let's move to chart six for more detail on our balance sheet and the issuing of our recent exchangeable senior notes. On June 30, 2010, cash was $682 million and total debt was $3.5 billion. Net debt decreased by $128 million from the first quarter, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation on our euro-based debt. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2 times at June 30th. And it's remained consistent over the past year.
Second quarter capital expenditures totaled $140 million, which was up significantly from the $78 million last year, reflecting the year-over-year timing differences I previously mentioned. Restructuring payments this quarter were consistent with the same period as last year, but they will increase in the second half as we make the final cash payments related to the last closures under footprint program.
As we outlined in our March investor day, we intend to use our healthy balance sheet to execute on our growth strategy. At the same time, we expect to maintain a strong financial flexibility by retaining a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio between two and three times. We work to support both of these objectives in the second quarter. We took advantage of a favorable window on the convertible debt market to help realign our capital structure and further improve our balance sheet.
O-I issued in May $690 million of 3% exchangeable senior notes due on 2015. We secured an exchange price of more than $47 per share, which will make 40% premium over the market price of our stock at the time of the transaction. The 3% interest rate is well below the market rates for standard debt offerings. So we will avoid significant cash interest payments over the life of these notes. And then, with the proceeds, we called and repaid O-I's highest cost debt of $450 million 8.15 senior notes that were due in 2013. And in addition to lower future cash payments, this refinancing will extend debt maturities and help maintain our target net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
Proceeds also funded our two M&A transactions year-to-date and provided additional capital with future strategic activity. We also repurchased approximately 6 million shares of O-I stock. These repurchases reduced the potential impact of share dilution from our exchangeable note offering as illustrated in the lower corner of the chart.
Now, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation on chart seven. Over the past several years, our earning power has significantly increased as we addressed the fundamentals of our business. But much of our free cash flow was absorbed by associated restructuring costs. While restructuring cash payments will continue until the end of this year, major restructuring activity is now finished, and our operations are in good shape.
Our priority has shifted from repairing the fundamentals to growing our business, specifically growth in profitable emerging markets, primarily in South America and Asia Pacific. We believe investment in growth is the best use of capital to drive attractive returns for our shareholders. Our investment in M&A in growth capital during the first half of this year reflected this focus on growth.
We understand the value of a balanced capital allocation strategy, which we demonstrated by also refinancing our highest cost debt and repurchasing company stocks. On the rate, you see O-I's return on invested capital for past four years as well as the trailing 12-month calculation at end of the second quarter. We have nearly doubled our ROIC since 2006. And it now clearly exceeds our cost of capital. While our priorities have shifted to growing our business, we are committed to maintaining a return that exceeds our cost of capital.
Turning to chart eight, you see our business outlook for the balance of 2010. In addition to third quarter trends, we've included an update on our full year outlook given the dynamic nature of our marketplace. We have provided the usual directional guidance on key business drivers affecting earnings and cash flow. All trends are on year-over-year basis, comparing expected third quarter and full year 2010 performance with the same period in 2009.
Let's review each of these factors. Price and mix, we expect prices will be consistent with prior year levels in the third quarter of 2010, reflecting the net effect of the input cost trends earlier in the year and current demand patterns. Overall for the year, we expect prices to be up slightly, compared to last year. </TAG>
Sales volume, global glass shipment will likely be flat for the third quarter. However, excluded the impact of renegotiated contracts in North America, our global volumes are expected to be up in both the third quarter and full year across regions.
Cost inflation, we expect third quarter cost inflation will likely increase moderately as compared to second quarter levels. However, we expect cost inflation to remain modest in 2010. And we anticipate total inflation will be at the mid-point of our full year estimate of $50 million to $80 million.
Footprint savings, we expect incremental savings in the third quarter. And full year benefits should be at the high end of our $50 million to $80 million savings estimate. Several other factors will affect the manufacturing and delivery costs, such as capacity utilization levels and expenses related to higher capital spending. The net impact of these two trends will likely lead to flat other manufacturing and delivery costs in the third quarter. For the year, the benefit of higher capitalization will lead to favorable other manufacturing cost comparisons.
Non-operating costs, we expect full year corporate costs will be up $30 million to $40 million from prior the year, primarily due to higher pension expense. 2010 net interest expense will be up $20 million to $30 million as higher debt levels fund strategic activity. Finally, at current exchange rates, currency will likely be a headwind in the second half of the year.
Now, I'll turn it back to Al on chart nine.

We've used our flexibility to creatively managed and even prosper during the recession. And we will continue to adapt to an ever-changing marketplace as less demand gradually improves. Importantly, we will be flexible in all facets of our business, including our capital allocation to ensure that we are maximizing shareholder value. We demonstrated this in the past quarter with our Southeast Asia joint venture and our debt refinancing deal.

And then totally, we're debating whether we should go more to a unit sales comparison as we are putting more emphasis on this going forward. But you can imagine, if you take out 30% of volume - of weight out of a wine bottle, eventually that's going to be reflected in your overall tonnage sales.
And I think we may need to do some work to make sure to give you greater visibility on those aspects. Because as we are pushing this more and more and on a much broader range into a variety of uses, whether it's food, whether it's beer, whether it's returnable containers, I think all of that will eventually clearly have an effect on the overall volume, whereas unit sales may in fact even increase during that period of time. So that I think is something we've got to keep in mind as we go forward. But I don't have anything readily available that has imbedded sufficiently enough to give you indication at this point.

I think if you really look at it on a global basis, our beer sales are about 40% of our total volume. And we have said several times that what we're seeing, especially in Europe and in North America, is really influenced by the fairly high rate of unemployment in young consumers at this point in time. And I think you have heard that in the conference call by the breweries as well.
I've also talked to you in the past about a shift in venue of how sales are conducted. The North America is moving away from restaurants and bars to retail. But we looked a little bit deeper into that aspect as well. And it is also quite obvious that there is also, in the retail sector, some considerable shift taking place, which we believe is temporary because of the economic situation. But still, I think it has a considerable impact. Because if you really look in the retail sales, about two-thirds of the beer retail in the United States take places in (inaudible).
And the premium beer sales and retail (inaudible) have been down by 7%. We have a much higher proportion in premium beer than we have in value beer. And I think all of those are things that are really clearly driven by available amount of money at this point in time by the consumers. And for us, that certainly has been a development that we have not seen in the past to this extent. But still, from all the evaluations and analyses we've got at this point in time, I don't think that this is really something that we'll have permanently attached to it. I think it's really a reflection of the economic situation.

Having said that, the last two years, using the, if you will, annualized 2010 results as a proxy, returns have actually been coming down again. So realizing you don’t want to go too far with capacity realignment to then prevent you from having flexibility in the future, why might there not be room for further footprint realignment, and for that matter, CapEx reduction in light of what’s been happening with return, and frankly, what’s been happening with volume and the stock this year.

With regard to adjusting our capacity, I have mentioned in my earlier comments the start of a facility in Peru, the expansion of capacity in Rosario, the increase of capacity in New Zealand, which is going to start at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We have made acquisitions of additional capacity and additional footprint. I think all of those are clearly indicative that we are confident that there is growth in this business on a global basis, and that we have to be prepared for that growth.
When we did our footprint realignment, we did this at the height of the demand cycle, and the capacities that we took out at that point in time dealt with an underlying structural issue that we could correct. I believe that’s done. I think we have established the cost structure and a capacity structure that’s appropriate for the demand projections that we see.
They may not perhaps be appropriate for the next months or the months thereafter but they clearly are appropriate for what we see happening in the market in the medium to long-term. And should we - and you know we reveal every year a significant amount of furnace rebuild. So if we eventually come to a point where we see an opportunity to take out assets that are not productive or that can be replaced by other underutilized assets, we will certainly do so. But I don’t think that we are going to see any of the more concentrated correction and efforts of our asset-base that we’ve done in the past couple of years.

They also didn’t have a steep decline even though, on our sales, we saw a fairly steep decline last year. But that was because of peculiarity of the market being a refillable bottom market. And so, people can easily make decisions as to whether they’re going to replace the float or not. And that’s merely has moved away. Demand is fairly strong.
You've heard me talk about several markets in Latin America being up more than 20% in volume. All of that, of course, is helping significantly. Also you will recall that at the end of last year, we did some considerable restructuring and realignment of our capacities, which of course is helping also the cost base and the cost-structure in the region significantly and giving us operational cost improvements which are reflected in the margin.
But I think the one that’s last seen under the third issue that is happening in Latin America, we are basically moving forward with a process to be much more aligned with the marketplace. With the consumer, with the customer to understand what some of the real market needs and market drivers are to get companies to consider glass really as the preferred packaging material. And we’re seeing some very good wins in that area.
And it’s particularly important to us because that would ultimately be a model that we can also apply and use in other markets to become a much more marketing-driven and marketing-oriented company.
All of those three factors, I think, are really leading to the fairly solid numbers that we have reported in the second quarter.

Now, from a margin stand point, I think it is quite clear. We have said in the past that the Chinese margins tend to be at the lower end. So that is not necessarily going to really shift the importance from Australia and New Zealand still as a significant profit contributor.
But I believe, looking into the future, certainly the volume increases that we expect out of China will also help us overall in our cost structure as well in the increase of margins in the long term.

If you really look at the large volume component, it's still growing at double-digit rates across the board. And that is fairly impressive. Especially when you look at the overall demand in China, it really means you have to constantly add new capacity to keep up with the demand. And we were seeing some of that in the 2004 to 2008 range when a lot of new entrants were coming into the market and building these facilities.
But it's also becoming apparent that China is going through a consolidation phase in the customer base as well. And so, I believe companies that are able to have a more holistic approach to the market and cross regional approach within China to the market, they will do very well in this environment.

But still, on a cost comparison base, labor is still much more affordable than we would find in the North American or European markets. And overall, of course, the cost base as well as their overall design of facilities gives us some insight that we can possibly use in other regions of the world as well to get a more attractive profile with regards to capital needs for expansions and for replacement alternative.

And that's going to be a continuing issue for us, either through the upside or through the downside as almost 75% to 80% of our volume is going to be in currencies outside of the US dollar region.
And I believe that that, however, is not going to impact our strategy because we typically also then manufacture in those regions. So the benefit of that currency in the cost structure also accrues to us. But it's, of course, in the conversion then of the sale as well as in the conversion of the profits into US dollars where we will see some variations depending on what's happening in exchange rate.

Before I discuss the results of the third quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes on the recent developments with our operations in Venezuela. On Monday, President Hugo Chavez announced his intents to expropriate O-I’s facilities in Venezuela. Subsequently, a formal decree was issued by the Venezuelan government.
First, I want to personally thank all our employees in Venezuela for their continued dedication to O-I during these difficult and uncertain times. Glass making is a highly specialized and complex industry, and plants require a great deal of expertise to run safely and effectively.
We have been in constant contact with our facility managers to ensure a safe operating environment for all of our employees, and we continue to operate the facilities to ensure we service our customers whose products meet the food and beverage needs of the Venezuelan people.
This is a very fluid situation with many uncertainties. Clearly, we are very disappointed with these developments after successfully operating in Venezuela for over 50 years.
We are working diligently to protect the interests of our employees, customers and shareholders, and we will provide timely updates as we gain a better understanding of the situation and can articulate our next steps. Ed will review a few of the financial matters associated with this situation shortly.
Now, turning to third quarter results, earnings were $0.90 per share in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of currency translation, O-I earned $0.94 per share. So, on a currency neutral basis, earnings were basically in line with prior year results.
Business conditions in the third quarter were consistent with those in the first half of 2010. Strong growth continued in the emerging markets, especially in South America and we capitalized on strategic opportunities to expand on those attractive regions.
Glass demand by the brewers remained sluggish in the mature markets, but we saw a positive growth in the beer across the emerging markets as well as in food, wine, and spirit and juice categories on a worldwide basis.
Globally, our shipments were down 2.4% from the prior year. Those mainly reflected lower volumes resulting from contract renegotiations that went into effect in 2010. If you adjust for the impact of those contracts, shipments were up 1% from last year which is more indicative of consumer demand trends.
Like last quarter, a favorable regional sales mix in our fast growing and profitable South American operations mostly offset the earnings impact of lower global shipments. While cost inflation was negligible in the first half of 2010, we did incur a higher input costs in the third quarter.
In addition, manufacturing costs in the quarter increased due to the start-up of two new furnaces in South America and the completion of our realignment activities in North America. These activities impacted third quarter results, but the operational improvements will of course benefit future earnings.
Free cash flow in the quarter was $75 million, which reflects seasonal working capital trends in our industry. We made additional progress on the execution of our strategic priorities this quarter.
We further expanded our presence in South America through our acquisition of CIV, the leading glassmaker in Northern Brazil. This acquisition added three plants in one of Brazil’s fastest growing regions.
Yesterday, we also announced the acquisition of a single plant operation near Guangdong, China and this is consistent with our strategy to grow in one of the world’s largest consumer markets.
We successfully completed a Eurobond offering in the quarter to help ensure that we maintain the financial flexibility we need to pursue additional strategic activities.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect prices will remain stable. We anticipate demand in most end used categories to improve over the prior year with the likely exception of shipments to beer customers in mature markets. We expect to see increased sales in South America, as a result of our new production capacity and recent acquisitions.
Overall, operating rates should be higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. Although, it’s too early to tell for sure, it is likely that the recent developments in Venezuela will negatively impact results in the fourth quarter.
Now, let’s review our operating performance on chart three. Here we show segment operating profit and margins for the company as well as for each of our four regions.
Overall segment operating profit was $299 million and margins exceeded 17% of sale. Adjusted to reflect prior year currency exchange rates segment profit was $308 million, so on the like-for-like basis, quarterly earnings declined $9 million from last year reflecting lower sales volume and additional cost inflation.
Now, let’s review regional trends beginning with Europe. Operating profit was $113 million in the third quarter, on a like-for-like basis profit was $123 million, down $5 million from the prior year. Consistent with the outlook provided during our last earnings call, third quarter selling prices were down modestly from 2009.
Total third quarter European shipments increased slightly from the prior year. Shipments were nearly up 5% across most of Western Europe, which represented more than 80% of our European volumes.
Well, glass demand for the beer segment remained sluggish. We saw a strong demand in other end-use categories. However, the Netherlands, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were down double digits due to lower food and beer shipments. In particular, Eastern Europe continued to struggle with challenging market conditions following the European financial crisis.
Given slightly higher overall shipments and the very low inventory level entering the quarter, capacity utilization in the third quarter increased from the prior year. Year-to-date temporary curtailments in Europe represented about 5% of total capacity, down significantly from the prior year.
In North America, our operating profit was $71 million in the quarter, down $12 million from last year. North American shipments were down more than 10% from the third quarter of 2009, continuing the trends that we have seen all year.
Higher margins, however, again mostly offset the impact of lower sales volumes. Lower shipments in the region were attributable to the renegotiation of several key customer contracts at the end of 2009, as well as a continued weak U.S. beer consumption, which was down 1% to 2% in the third quarter. However, trends have slightly improved in recent months compared to earlier this year.
Glass shipment trends have gradually improved in recent month, as well as consumption of premium brands has picked up relative to sub-premium brands, and we also saw a continued improvement in other end-use categories such as food and wine.
We completed our footprint realignment efforts in North America during the third quarter and realigned our business mix with our remaining manufacturing network.
As a result, we incurred additional costs during the third quarter that accounted for most of the shortfall in regional earnings over 2009 level. But this restructured footprint should drive improved earnings going forward. We continue to expect that our full year 2010 North American profits will meet or exceed prior year results.
Despite the recent developments in Venezuela, we remained very encouraged about the future of South America. In fact, our South American region continues to be our top performer with operating profits of $77 million in the third quarter as margins improved to 26%.
On a currency neutral basis, profits were $79 million up $15 million from the prior year. Strong shipments continued across all end-use markets, especially beer driven by new product introductions. In fact, volume was up around 20% in South America, excluding Venezuela which was flat over the prior year.
To meet growing demand in the region, we began production at our nearly constructed furnaces in Argentina and in Peru. These assets are already operating at best-in-class production levels.
Strong growth also led to higher production and capacity utilization rates in South America. Our acquisition of CIV in the third quarter will further boost production. And Ed will review more details on that acquisition in a minute.
Our Asia-Pacific region reported third quarter operating profit of $38 million. On a like-for-like basis, profits were $35 million, down from $42 million last year. While higher prices essentially offset cost inflation this quarter, volumes were down mid single-digits from last year.
Like Europe, Asia-Pac volume trends vary by country. Starting in Australia, glass volumes were down, the strong Australian dollar which is now at parity with U.S. dollar created a cost disadvantage for Australian wine exports.
In addition, some of our beer business traded hands as a competitor added glass capacity earlier this year. We have one new business, but it will take several months for O-I to backfill the lost volume.
In China, our shipments were boost by the July acquisition of our new plant in Sichuan. Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of a majority interest in an additional plant near Guangdong, China for $29 million.
This acquisition complements O-I’s existing operations in Guangdong, China’s fourth large glass market as a province, and we are pushing the upper limit of capacity in our manufacturing systems in China which underscores the needs for further acquisitions and investments in the future to keep up with the growth in this market.
We are pleased with the progress at our new joint venture in Malaysia and Vietnam after only two full months productivity rates have increased by about 15 percentage points. While continuing to integrate O-I’s extensive knowledge of global manufacturing processes we see additional opportunities to increase the profitability of this joint venture.
Finally, we began production at our new furnace in New Zeeland in October. We look forward to updating you on our progress for these strategic activities in more detail in late coming quarters.
Globally, market conditions remained consistent with the first half of 2010. Glass demand for beer in mature markets remained down likely due to persistent unemployment across key demographics for beer customers. Emerging market growth was strong, and most end-use categories in the mature markets have been growing as those economies gradually recover.
I’ll discuss our demand trends in greater detail on chart four. With our year-to-date shipments down 1.3% I heard some concern that glass is facing structural market challenges.
Now, let me provide you some details why I do not believe that that is the case. We have illustrated our year-to-date demand growth by key end-use categories on this chart.
As you can see, O-I’s glass shipments for spirits and wine, as well as beer in emerging markets improved between 5% and 13% from last year, while food was up about 2% or rather our glass shipments for beer in the developed markets were down more than 11% from last year. As a result of this sizable decline, our total shipments were down slightly from last year in total.
So, the significant decline in glass volume for beer mostly reflected our price over volume strategy over the past few years and not any large scale industry shift away from beer and glass bottles. As we raised prices to repair our margins in recent years, we knew we would surrender some volume, and that is now fully reflected in our 2010 shipment trends.
This trade-off has clearly improved our financial performance since we initiated this strategy several years ago. The orange bar on the chart demonstrate our volumes, excluding the impact of these pricing actions, limited to beer customers in the U.S., Europe and Australia.
Adjusted for pricing action effects, our shipments to beer customers were down 3.3% in the mature markets, which was generally in line with beer consumption trends. For example, consumption has declined so far this year by about 3% in Western Europe, 2% in the United States, and 1% in Australia.
While beer glass volumes are down, we have been working with a number of our multinational customers in other end-use categories to earn new business and we’re encouraged by these developments.
Therefore, excluding the impact of our pricing actions, O-I’s global shipments were up 1.8% year-to-date, and this growth rate is a bit lower than we expected earlier this year and it just shows that like many others, we have not been great at predicting the immediate future in this economic environment. However, I see no structural issues in the glass business. In fact, our business trends are generally favorable across most regions and end-uses.
Now, I will turn the call back over to Ed.

Now, I will discuss Venezuela along with our business outlook at the end of my prepared remarks. Let me begin with our financial review with the reconciliations for sales, operating profit and EPS on chart five.Segment sales decreased $135 mi",1626,"Thanks Al. Now, I will discuss Venezuela along with our business outlook at the end of my prepared remarks. Let me begin with our financial review with the reconciliations for sales, operating profit and EPS on chart five.
Segment sales decreased $135 million to $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2010. As expected, price and product mix were essentially flat with the prior year. As we’ve seen all year, cost pass-through provisions in our North American customer contracts resulted in a small impact on sales and had a negligible effect on operating profit.
Moving to sales volume on the following line, glass shipments in tons were 2.4% below the prior year on a global basis, reducing sales by $40 million. These sales figures include the benefit of recent acquisitions, which added approximately 1% to our volumes.
Finally, the stronger U.S. dollar reduced our top line by $90 million in the third quarter. This impact was due to a weaker euro and the Venezuela bolivar devaluation, partially offset by stronger currencies in other countries. While the euro was rallied in recent months, it was still weaker than the U.S. dollar compared to the average of the third quarter 2009.
Moving over to segment operating profit, the third quarter was $299 million, down $18 million from the same period in 2009. Since price and product mix were flat, they had no year-over-year impact on operating profit. Lower sales volumes only slightly impacted operating profit due to improved regional mix given strong growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs increased $21 million.
We incurred cost inflation of $26 million and the startup costs penalties that Al mentioned. These were partially offset by incremental footprint savings and higher operating rates. Results benefited $15 million from other operating items as we reduced discretionary spending and benefited from a few one-time items.
Finally, currency translation reduced operating profit by $9 million in the third quarter, mostly due to a weaker euro. Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.90 per share in the quarter, down $0.05 from the prior year. As we just discussed, operating profit was down $0.07 from last year. However, earnings did benefit from favorable non-operating items.
Our effective tax rate was lower than last year, reflecting our current regional earnings mix. Also EPS benefited from a lower share count after repurchasing 6 million shares in the first half of the year.
Corporate costs were up from last year due to higher non-cash pension expense. This was partially offset by cost reduction efforts. Likewise, we’ve reduced management incentive compensation expense to reflect current financial results.
One comment on GAAP EPS. We incurred approximately $9 million of Note 1 charges in the third quarter, related to one-time cost and purchase price accounting associated with our recent acquisitions. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $75 million. As a result, the company is free cash flow positive year-to-date.
Chart six illustrates our year-over-year reconciliation. The decline in free cash flow generation is mostly attributed to working capital and CapEx. Working capital was a $143 million greater use of cash in the first nine months of 2010. The difference is due to the significant inventory reductions we took last year that did not repeat at the same level in 2010.
Next, capital expenditures were $198 million higher through September 2010. This difference was largely due to timing as 2009 CapEx was mostly deferred until the fourth quarter, and 2010 spending has been more evenly distributed across the year. Importantly, the fourth quarter 2009 spending spike will not repeat in 2010.
Let’s move to chart seven for more detail on our balance sheet and several strategic initiatives that we completed in the third quarter. On September 30, 2010, cash was $700 million which included about $40 million in Venezuela.
Total debt at the end of the quarter was $4.3 billion. Net debt was $3.6 billion, which increased by $826 million from the second quarter, primarily to fund acquisitions.
Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.8 times at September 30, higher than our second quarter ratio of 2.2 times, again reflecting our acquisitions in the third quarter. But the ratio was still within our target leverage range between two and three times.
Third quarter restructuring payments were higher than the second quarter, reflecting the advancement of our North American realignment project. Capital expenditures totaled $155 million in the quarter, which was similar to our second quarter level.
Our 2010 capital expenditures approximate $500 million. We have pulled back on some projects in the fourth quarter, but the weaker U.S. dollar and incremental capital on new acquisitions are offsetting this lower activity.
As illustrated on the right, most of our CapEx this year is for maintenance project and it’s within our 80% to 85% range of depreciation. The remaining capital is focused on our North American restructuring program and growth initiatives. The growth investments are concentrated in South America and Asia Pacific to keep up with increased demand. Overall, we believe our capital expenditures are prudent and in line with our profitable growth strategies.
Also on the right, you can see our two largest strategic activities completed in the third quarter. The first is our acquisition of CIV in northeast Brazil. Brazil represents the largest economy in glass container market in South America, so it is key for O-I.
We already have a robust business and experienced management team in the southern region of the company. The CIV acquisition will provide a strong complement to our current franchise in Brazil, and will allow us to serve many existing and new customers for expanding their operations in the Northeast.
CIV’s three facilities will increase O-I’s capacity in Brazil by 50%. O-I’s total purchase price for CIV was $603 million, which included approximately $140 million for future tax benefits. The purchase price reflects a 5.8 times EBITDA multiple based on 2011 forecasted EBITDA of $80 million.
We expect that the CIV acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in 2011, and the return on investment of this business is well above O-I’s cost of capital.
The second strategic initiative was in early September. We issued €500 million of 10 year senior notes at an interest rate of 6.75%. We are pleased that these bonds have been the most favorably priced offering in the European high yield markets so far this year.
In addition to an attractive coupon rate and a tax-efficient structure, greater euro denominated interest expense is a natural currency hedge for our European properties. The proceeds of the euro bonds will enable further strategic and profitable growth.
Turning to chart eight; you see our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2010, we have provided the usual directional guidance on the key business drivers affecting earnings and cash flow. All trends are on a year-over-year basis comparing expected fourth quarter 2010 performance with the same period in 2009.
As Al mentioned, the development in Venezuela will likely negatively impact our fourth quarter results. However, the situation is very fluid, so our outlook does not include any potential impact from Venezuela.
Now let me review each of the factors. Price and product mix, similar to the third quarter, we expect prices in the fourth quarter to be flat with prior year levels. Sales volume, clearly, we have struggled to identify the turning point with beer demand in mature markets.
Beer consumption remains sluggish and has not improved significantly, despite promotional efforts by our customers. Hence, we anticipate fourth quarter glass demand for beer in the U.S. and Europe will remain down from the prior year. However, we expect continued year-over-year growth in all other end-use categories.
The net effect of these two trends is difficult to project. Depending on their relative movement, we can foresee fourth quarter sales volumes being 2% above or below prior year levels.
Manufacturing and delivery, higher capacity utilization should result in lower manufacturing and delivery costs compared to last year. Footprint savings should mostly offset cost inflation that is expected to be comparable to third quarter levels.
Non-operating costs, corporate costs will be higher than the fourth quarter of last year, mostly reflecting additional pension expense which we’ve seen every quarter in 2010. Also, net interest expense will increase approximately $15 million on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter due to higher debt to fund acquisitions.
Furthermore, we are taking steps to curtail our spending plans given lower than anticipated volumes in 2010. We have evaluated corporate expense, restructuring payments and working capital investments. We expect to reduce spending in these categories by $20 to $30 million from our original expectations.
Let me wrap up with a discussion on Venezuela. As I mentioned, the financial implications of expropriation remain unclear. Given this lack of clarity, I will provide some information about our Venezuelan operations to give you a sense of their scope relative to O-I in total. First, we’ve been operating in Venezuela for over 50 years serving the country’s food and beverage industry.
I’d like to take the opportunity to thank the more than 1,000 employees at the two plants for all their hard work and dedication during these difficult times. O-I has a 75% ownership interest in our Venezuelan operations with the remaining ownership held by a minority partner. Year-to-date, Venezuela accounted for approximately 3% of O-I global sales volume. The country represented just under 5% of segment operating profits and adjusted net earnings.
Finally, O-I’s net assets in Venezuela approximated 4% of O-I’s total net assets as of September 30. We intend to provide regular and timely updates on this situation as information becomes available.
Now, I’ll turn it back to Al for chart nine.

Let me close with some comments on the financial targets that we introduced at our Investor Day in March of this year. Chart nine highlights our net sales and segment operating profit margin goals for 2012.
If you recall, we indicated our sales will grow between $9 billion and $9.5 billion and our global segment operating profit margins will expand to 16% to 18% by the end of this three-year period, and we continue to expect that this growth will be achieved equally through a recovering market place and mergers and acquisitions.
Now, that we are almost a third of the way into this three-year period, we can say that we are pleased with our M&A progress. Through the third quarter, we have made three high quality acquisitions and more importantly our M&A pipeline remains full as we work to close more deals in the upcoming quarters.
On the other hand, the rate of our overall market recovery has been inconsistent, robust in South America and China, but slower than anticipated in the mature markets. That said, we remain optimistic that a recovering marketplace in both Europe and North America should favorably impact the premium end-use segments that we serve. It is just going to take more time than we had originally expected, but it’s still likely to be achieved within our original three-year horizon.
As the developments in Venezuela over the past few days show, events can change rapidly, but based on today’s perspective, we remain confident that we are on the trajectory to reach our three year target. Furthermore, O-I’s strategic priorities remain unchanged to support those objectives.
Now, I will ask the operator to open the line for your questions. Thank you.

We think that clearly and already in the course of this year as well, our ability and pricing was really tracking with what was happening in inflation, and in the beginning of the year of course, we were still seeing some benefits of the deflation that was happening in the course of last year.
But as we went through the third quarter, in particular, we saw that the impact of the U.S. dollar which at that point in time was higher than the previous year was impacting the price of brand fruit, which is quoted in U.S. dollars and the conversion to euros, and it was causing inflationary pressure.
I think we also are looking at what’s going to happen in the supply and demand situation with regard to soda ash, which of course is a considerable cost driver. I think everybody in the industry are seeing the same pressures and therefore I believe we will see a continued approach to the marketplace that is reflective of making sure that we pass-through cost inflation appropriately to maintain our margins.

There is not a big consolidated operator at this point in time and place. I think the largest manufacturer may perhaps just be one or two percentage points from our market share as far as consolidated share is concerned.
So, it’s going to be quite a number of acquisitions to eventually get to the targets that we have set ourselves. You also know that within China, we have talked about four or five regions that we want to be focusing on because that’s really where the demand and the emerging middle class is concentrated, so it makes a lot of sense to not try to be present in all geographic regions of China.

I think the fact that our pipeline is full as indicative, of course, that people are looking at their role and their position in the marketplace and are coming to some conclusions that are different than they may have reached a year or two years ago. So, clearly, some companies are a bit stressed at this point in time, but that very often is not really due to market conditions as much more due to financing structures that they have elected over the past. So, that I think really explains a little bit that the pipeline is rather full at this point in time.
With regard to the seller expectations that of course is always the part of the discussion that takes the longest, because even though they have reached the conclusion that they possibly want to sell because they have understood that market conditions are changing or their own financial strength has changed. But they are still, of course, trying to tie the value to where the business was three years ago, and that is candidly where we have talk in downfall. Our position when we look at acquisitions really as how quickly can we influence the operations and generate additional efficiencies which is a significant part of the transaction value that we are willing to consider.
The other part is, is it just the consolidation game or is it a consolidation and growth game which, of course, creates a different dynamic for the business. That, of course, would also flow into the valuation that we’re going to do and then you see huge differences from region-to-region and the overall profit developed it’s quite obvious that what we did in brazil is a very highly profit generating and growing organization, say would typically be willing to put a higher value to that than in other markets where it’s just a consolidation game and where the only benefit you could get would be efficiencies.

Number one, in United States, of course, a significant portion of the volatility with regard to inflation in raw materials has been taken out to the new contract stipulation, so you see pass-through provisions. So, that is really not going to create pressure points, but it’s going to create some variability from quarter-to-quarter with regard to price evolution. In the other parts of the world what you’re seeing largely is also geographic mix. As we’re growing much faster in Latin America where prices tend to be higher than for instance in some of the other regions in Eastern Europe that of course, is going to influence the average price as well.
So, I would say you really get a true picture and a valid picture of our pricing if you put the pricing in relation to the inflation that we’re discussing. I think that really is where you get a complete picture of the potential impact of pricing. Just looking at pricing by itself may be misleading.

Now, the brewers are diminishing the differentiation in pricing between value brands and premium brands to push demand back up into the premium sectors, because that apparently is a more attractive sector for them. That was also reflected in the price increases that the brewers put in place in August and in September of this year.
But what we are hearing as well is that there is now a trend where the consumers are buying more premium brands rather than value brands. We are seeing some shift there. Clearly, throughout this entire period of economic hardship, we have seen a bifurcation of the market between the lets say, age groups up to 35 and 35 and beyond and you see that reflected in microbrewers doing extremely well. You see that reflected in wine doing very well. We see that reflected in spirits doing reasonably well.
So, I think you really have a bifurcation also of some of the demand at this point in time. So, it really requires us to look at it very individualistically as to what’s happening. But, at least the comments that I am hearing is that the brewers felt confident enough in the demand cycle, that the demand wouldn’t drop off further to raise prices, and I think that’s a pretty good sign going forward.

Before I discuss the results of the third quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes on the recent development with our operations in Venezuela. On Monday, President Hugo Chavez announced his intent to expropriate O-I's",2060,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning. Before I discuss the results of the third quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes on the recent development with our operations in Venezuela. On Monday, President Hugo Chavez announced his intent to expropriate O-I's facilities in Venezuela. Subsequently, a formal decree was issued by the Venezuelan government. 
First, I want to personally thank all our employees in Venezuela for their continued dedication to O-I during these difficult and uncertain times. Glassmaking is a highly specialized and complex industry, and plants require a great deal of expertise to run safely and effectively. We have been in constant contact with our facility managers to ensure a safe operating environments for all of our employees, and we continue to operate facilities to ensure we service our customers with products to meet the food and beverage needs of the Venezuelan people. 
This is a very fluid situation with many uncertainties. Clearly, we are very disappointed with these developments after successfully operating in Venezuela for over 50 years. We are working diligently to protect the interests of our employees, customers and shareholders, and we will provide timely updates as we gain a better understanding of the situation and can articulate our next steps. Ed will review a few of the financial matters associated with this situation shortly. 
Now turning to third quarter results. Earnings were $0.90 per share in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of currency translation, O-I earned $0.94 per share, so on a currency-neutral basis, earnings were basically in line with prior year results. 
Business conditions in the third quarter were consistent with those in the first half of 2010. Strong growth continued in the emerging markets, especially in South America, and we capitalized on strategic opportunities to expand in those attractive regions. 
Glass demand by the brewers remained sluggish in the mature markets while we saw positive growth in beer across the emerging markets, as well as in food, wine and spirit end-use categories on a worldwide basis. Globally, our shipments were down 2.4% from the prior year. This mainly reflect that lower volumes resulting from contract renegotiations that went into effect in 2010. If you adjust for the impact of those contracts, shipments were up 1% from last year which is more indicative of consumer demand trend. 
Like last quarter, a favorable regional sales mix in our fast-growing and profitable South American operations mostly offset the earnings impact of lower global shipments. 
While cost inflation was negligible in the first half of 2010, we did incur higher input costs in the third quarter. In addition, manufacturing costs in the quarter increased due to the startup of 2 new furnaces in South America and the completion of a realignment activity in North America. These activities impacted third quarter results, but the operational improvements will, of course, benefit future earnings. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $75 million, which reflect seasonal working capital trends in our industry. We made additional progress on the execution of our strategic priorities this quarter. We further expanded our presence in South America through our acquisition of CIV, the leading glassmaker in northern Brazil. This acquisition added 3 plants in one of Brazil's fastest growing regions. 
Yesterday, we also announced the acquisition of a single-plant operation near Guangzhou, China, and this is consistent with our strategy to grow in one of the world's largest consumer markets. 
We successfully completed a euro bond offering in the quarter to help ensure that we maintain the financial flexibility we need to pursue additional strategic activities. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect prices will remain stable. We anticipate demand in most end-use categories to improve over the prior year, with the likely exception of shipments to beer customers in mature markets. We expect to see increased sales in South America as a result of renewed production capacity and recent acquisitions. 
Overall, operating rates should be higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. Although it's too early to tell for sure, it is likely that the recent developments in Venezuela will negatively impact results in the fourth quarter. 
Now let's review our operating performance on Chart 3. Here, we show segment operating profit and margins for the company, as well as for each of our 4 regions. Overall, segment operating profit was $299 million and margins exceeded 17% of sales. Adjusted to reflect prior year currency exchange rate, segment profit was $308 million so on a like-for-like basis, quarterly earnings declined $9 million from last year, reflecting lower sales volume and additional cost inflation. 
Now let's review regional trends beginning with Europe. Operating profit was $113 million in the third quarter. On a like-for-like basis, profit was $123 million, down $5 million from the prior year. Consistent with the outlook provided during our last earnings call, third quarter selling prices were down modestly from 2009. 
Total third quarter European shipments increased slightly from the prior year. Shipments were nearly up 5% across most of Western Europe, which represented more than 80% of our European volumes. While glass demand for the beer segment remains sluggish, we saw strong demand in other end-use categories. However, the Netherlands, Hungary and the Czech Republic were down double digits due to lower food and beer shipments. In particular, Eastern Europe continued to struggle with challenging market conditions following the European financial crisis. 
Given slightly higher overall shipments and the very low inventory level entering the quarter, capacity utilization in the third quarter increased over prior year. Year-to-date temporary curtailments in Europe represented about 5% of total capacity, down significantly from the prior year. 
In North America, our operating profit was $71 million in the quarter, down $12 million from last year. North American shipments were down more than 10% from third quarter of 2009, continuing the trend that we have seen all year. Higher margins, however, again mostly offset the impact of lower sales volume. 
Lower shipments in the region were attributable to the renegotiation of several key customer contracts at the end of 2009, as well as a continued weak U.S. beer consumption, which was down 1% to 2% in the third quarter. However, trends have slightly improved in recent months compared to earlier this year. Glass shipment trends have gradually improved in recent months, as well as consumption of premium brands has picked up relative to sub-premium brands, and we also saw continued improvement in other end-use categories such as food and wine. 
We completed our footprint realignment efforts in North America during the third quarter and realigned our business mix with our remaining manufacturing network. As a result, we incurred additional costs during the third quarter that accounted for most of the shortfall in regional earnings over 2009 levels but this restructured footprint should drive improved earnings going forward, and we continue to expect that our full year 2010 North American profits will meet or exceed prior year results. 
Despite the recent developments in Venezuela, we remain very encouraged about the future of South America. In fact, our South American region continues to be our top performer with operating profit of $77 million in the third quarter as margins improved to 26%. 
On a currency-neutral basis, profits were $79 million, up $15 million from the prior year. Strong shipments continued across all end-use markets, especially beer, driven by new product introductions. In fact, volume was up around 20% in South America, excluding Venezuela, which was flat with the prior year. 
To meet growing demand in the region, we began production at our newly construct furnaces in Argentina and in Peru. These assets are already operating at best-in-class production levels. Strong growth also led to higher production and capacity utilization rates in South America. Our acquisition of CIV in the third quarter will further boost production, and Ed will review more details on that acquisition in a moment. 
Our Asia Pacific region reported third quarter operating profit of $38 million. On a like-for-like basis, profits were $35 million, down from $42 million last year. While higher prices essentially offset cost inflation this quarter, volumes were down mid-single-digits from last year. Like Europe, Asia Pac volume trends vary by country. 
Now starting in Australia, glass volumes were down. The strong Australian dollar, which is now at parity with the U.S. dollar, created a cost disadvantage for Australian wine exports. In addition, some of our beer business traded hands as a competitor added glass capacity earlier this year. We have one new business but it will take several months for O-I to backfill the lost volume. 
In China, our shipments were boost by the July acquisition of our new plant in Sichuan. Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of a majority interest in an additional plant near Guangzhou, China for $29 million. This acquisition complements O-I's existing operations in Guangdong, China's fourth largest glass market as a province, and we are pushing the upper limit of capacity in our manufacturing systems in China, which underscores the need for further acquisitions of investments in the future to keep up with the growth in this market. 
We are pleased with the progress at our new joint venture in Malaysia, and Vietnam. After only 2 full months, productivity rates have increased by about 15 percentage points. By continuing to integrate O-I's extensive knowledge of global manufacturing processes, we see additional opportunities to increase the profitability of this joint venture.  
And finally, we began production at our new furnace in New Zealand in October. We look forward to updating you on our progress with these strategic activities in more detail in the coming quarters. 
Globally, market conditions remained consistent with the first half of 2010. Glass demand for beer in the mature markets remain down, likely due to persistent unemployment across key demographics for beer customers. Emerging market growth was strong, and most end-use categories in the mature markets have been growing as those economies gradually recover.  And I'll discuss our demand trends in greater detail on Chart 4. 
With our year-to-date shipments down 1.3%, I've heard some concern that glass is facing structural market challenges. Now let me provide you some details why I do not believe that, that is the case. We have illustrated our year-to-date demand growth by key end-use categories on this chart.  And as you can see, O-I's glass shipments for spirits and wine, as well as beer in emerging markets, improved between 5% and 13% from last year, while food was up about 2%. However, our glass shipments for beer in the developed markets were down more than 11% from last year. As a result of this sizable decline, our total shipments were down slightly from last year in total. So the significant decline in glass volume for beer, mostly reflected our price over volume strategy over the past few years and not any large-scale industry shift away from beer and glass volume. 
As we raised prices to repair margins in recent years, we knew we would surrender some volume, and that is now fully reflected in our 2010 shipment trend. This trade-off has clearly improved our financial performance since we initiated this strategy several years ago. 
The orange bar on the chart illustrate our volumes excluding the impact of these pricing actions limited to beer customers in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Adjusted for pricing action effects, our shipments to beer customers were down 3.3% in the mature markets, which was generally in line with beer consumption trends. For example, consumption has declined so far this year by about 3% in Western Europe, 2% in the United States and 1% in Australia. 
While beer glass volumes are down, we have been working with a number of our multinational customers and other end-use categories to earn new business and we are encouraged by these developments. Therefore, excluding the impact of our pricing actions, O-I's global shipments were up 1.8% year-to-date, and this growth rate is a bit lower than we expected earlier this year, and it just shows that like many others, we have not been great at predicting the immediate future in this economic environment. However, I see no structural issues in the glass business. In fact, our business trends are generally favorable across most regions and end users.  And now I will turn the call back over to Ed."

Now I will discuss Venezuela along with our business outlook at the end of my prepared remarks. Let me begin with our financial review with the reconciliation for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 5. Segment sales decreased $135 milli",1623,"Thanks, Al. Now I will discuss Venezuela along with our business outlook at the end of my prepared remarks. Let me begin with our financial review with the reconciliation for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 5. 
Segment sales decreased $135 million to $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2010. As expected, price and product mix were essentially flat with prior year. As we've seen all year, cost pass-through provisions in our North American customer contracts resulted in a small impact on sales and had a negligible effect on operating profit. 
Moving to sales volume on the following line, glass shipments in tonnes were 2.4% below the prior year on a global basis, reducing sales by $40 million. These sales figures include the benefit of recent acquisitions, which added approximately 1% to our volumes. 
Finally, the stronger U.S. dollar reduced our top line by $90 million in the third quarter. This impact was due to a weaker euro and the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation, partially offset by stronger currencies in other countries. While the euro has rallied in recent months, it was still weaker than the U.S. dollar compared to the average of the third quarter 2009. 
Moving over to segment operating profit. The third quarter was $299 million, down $18 million from the same period in 2009. Since price and product mix were flat, they had no year-over-year impact on operating profit. Lower sales volumes only slightly impacted operating profit due to improved regional mix, given strong growth of higher margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs increased $21 million. We incurred cost inflation of $26 million and the startup costs penalties that Al mentioned. These were partially offset by incremental footprint savings and higher operating rate. Results benefited $15 million from other operating items as we reduced discretionary spending and benefited from a few one-time items. Finally, currency translation reduced operating profit by $9 million in the third quarter, mostly due to a weaker euro. 
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.90 per share in the quarter, down $0.05 from the prior year. As we just discussed, operating profit was down $0.07 from last year. However, earnings did benefit from favorable nonoperating items. Our effective tax rate was lower than last year, reflecting our current regional earnings mix. Also, EPS benefited from a lower share count after repurchasing 6 million shares in the first half of the year.
Corporate costs were up from last year due to higher noncash pension expense. This was partially offset by cost reduction efforts. Likewise, we reduced management incentive compensation expense to reflect current financial results. 
One comment on GAAP EPS. We incurred approximately $9 million of Note 1 charges in the third quarter, related to one-time costs and purchase price accounting associated with our recent acquisitions. 
Free cash flow in the third quarter was $75 million. As a result, the company had free cash flow positive year-to-date. Chart 6 illustrates our year-over-year reconciliation. The decline in free cash flow generation is mostly attributed to working capital and CapEx. Working capital was $843 million greater use of cash in the first 9 months of 2010. The difference is due to the significant inventory reductions we took last year that did not repeat at the same level in 2010. 
Next, capital expenditures were $198 million higher through September 2010. This difference was largely due to timing as 2009 CapEx was mostly deferred until the fourth quarter, and 2010 spending has been more evenly distributed across the year. Importantly, the fourth quarter 2009 spending spike will not repeat in 2010. 
Let's move to Chart 7 for more detail on our balance sheet and several strategic initiatives that we completed in the third quarter. On September 30, 2010, cash was $700 million, which was about $40 million, which included about $40 million in Venezuela. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $4.3 billion. Net debt was $3.6 billion, which increased by $826 million from the second quarter, primarily to fund acquisitions. 
Our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.8x at September 30, higher than our second quarter ratio of 2.2x, again reflecting our acquisitions in the third quarter but the ratio was still within our target leverage range between 2x and 3x. 
Third quarter restructuring payments were higher than the second quarter, reflecting the advancement of our North American realignment project. Capital expenditures totaled $155 million in the quarter, which was similar to our second quarter level. 
Our 2010 capital expenditures will approximate $500 million. We have pulled back on some projects in the fourth quarter, but the weaker U.S. dollar and incremental capital on new acquisitions all offsetting this lower activity. As illustrated on the right, most of our CapEx this year is for maintenance projects, and it's within our 80% to 85% range of depreciation. The remaining capital is focused on our North American restructuring program and growth initiatives. The growth investments are concentrated in South America and Asia Pacific to keep up with increased demand. Overall, we believe our capital expenditures are prudent and in line with our profitable growth strategies. 
Also on the right, you can see our 2 largest strategic activities completed in the third quarter. The first is our acquisition of CIV in Northeast Brazil. Brazil represents the largest economy and glass container market in South America so it is key for O-I. We already have a robust business and experienced management team in the southern region of the company. The CIV acquisition will provide a strong complement to our current franchise in Brazil and will allow us to serve many existing and new customers who are expanding their operations in the northeast. 
CIV's 3 facilities will increase O-I's capacity in Brazil by 50%. O-I's total purchase price for CIV was $603 million, which included approximately $140 million for future tax benefits. The purchase price reflects a 5.8x EBITDA multiple, based on 2011 forecasted EBITDA of $80 million. We expect that the CIV acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in 2011, and the return on investment of this business is well above O-I's cost of capital. 
The second strategic initiative was in early September. We issued EUR 500 million of 10-year senior notes at an interest rate of 6.75%. We are pleased that these bonds have been the most favorably priced offering in the European high yield market so far this year. In addition to an attractive coupon rate and a tax-efficient structure, greater euro-denominated interest expense is a natural currency hedge for our European profits. The proceeds of the euro bonds will enable further strategic and profitable growth. 
Turning to Chart 8. You see our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2010. We have provided the usual directional guidance on the key business drivers affecting earnings and cash flow. All trends are on a year-over-year basis comparing expected fourth quarter 2010 performance with the same period in 2009. As Al mentioned, the developments in Venezuela will likely negatively impact our fourth quarter results. However, the situation is very fluid so our outlook does not include any potential impact from Venezuela. 
Now let me review each of the factors. Price and product mix. Similar to the third quarter, we expect prices in the fourth quarter to be flat with prior year levels. 
Sales volume. Clearly, we have struggled to identify the turning point with beer demand in mature markets. Beer consumption remains sluggish and has not improved significantly despite promotional efforts by our customers. Hence, we anticipate fourth quarter glass demand for beer in the U.S. and Europe will remain down from the prior year. However, we expect continued year-over-year growth in all other end-use categories. The net effect of these 2 trends is difficult to project. Depending on their relative movement, we can perceive fourth quarter sales volumes being 2% above or below prior year levels. 
Manufacturing and delivery. Higher capacity utilization should result in lower manufacturing and delivery costs compared to last year. Footprint savings should mostly offset cost inflation that is expected to be comparable to third quarter levels. 
Now on operating costs. Corporate costs will be higher than the fourth quarter of last year, mostly reflecting additional pension expense which we've seen every quarter in 2010. Also, net interest expense will increase approximately $15 million on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter due to higher debt to fund acquisitions. 
Furthermore, we are taking steps to curtail our spending plans, given lower-than-anticipated volumes in 2010. We have evaluated corporate expense, restructuring payments and working capital investments. We expect to reduce spending in these categories by $20 million to $30 million from our original expectations. 
Let me wrap up the discussion on Venezuela. As I mentioned, the financial implications of expropriation remain unclear. Given this lack of clarity, I will provide some information about our Venezuelan operations to give you a sense of their scope relative to O-I in total. 
First, we've been operating in Venezuela for over 50 years, serving the country's food and beverage industry. I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the more than 1,000 employees at the 2 plants for all their hard work and dedication during these difficult times. O-I has a 75% ownership interest in our Venezuelan operations, with the remaining ownership held by a minority partner. Year-to-date, Venezuela accounted for approximately 3% of O-I global sales volume. The country represented just under 5% of segment operating profits and adjusted net earnings. 
Finally, O-I's net assets in Venezuela approximated 4% of O-I's total net assets as of September 30. We intend to provide regular and timely updates on the situation as information becomes available. 
Now I'll turn it back to Al for Chart 9."

Chart 9 highlights our net sales and segment operating margin goals for 2012. 
If you recall, we indicated our sales will grow between $9 billion and $9.5 billion, and our global segment operating profit margins will expand to 16% to 18% by the end of this 3-year period. And we continue to expect that this growth will be achieved equally through a recovering marketplace and mergers and acquisitions. 
Now that we are almost 1/3 of the way into this 3-year period, we can say that we are pleased with our M&A properties. Through the third quarter, we have made 3 high-quality acquisitions, and more importantly, our M&A pipeline remains full as we work to close more deals in the upcoming quarters. 
On the other hand, the rate of our overall market recovery has been inconsistent, robust in South America and China but slower-than-anticipated in the mature markets. That said, we remain optimistic that a recovering marketplace in both Europe and North America should favorably impact the premium end-use segments that we serve. It is just going to take more time than we had originally expected but it's still likely to be achieved within our original 3-year horizon. 
As the developments in Venezuela over the past few days show, events can change rapidly, but based on today's perspective, we remain confident that we are on the trajectory to reach our 3-year targets.  And furthermore, O-I's strategic priorities remain unchanged to support those objectives.  
And now, I will ask the operator to open the lines for your questions. Thank you."

We think that clearly and already in the course of this year as well, our ability and pricing was really tracking with what was happening in inflation. And in the beginning of the year, of course, we were still seeing some benefits of the deflation that was happening in the course of last year. But as we went through the third quarter in particular, we saw that the impact of the U.S. dollar, which at that point in time was higher than the previous year or was impacting the price of rent crude which is quoted in U.S. dollars and the conversion to euros, and it was causing inflationary pressure. I think we also are looking at what's going to happen in the supply and demand situation with regard to soda ash, which of course, is a considerable cost here. And I think everybody in the industry is seeing the same pressures, and therefore, I believe we will see a continued approach to the marketplace that is reflective of making sure that we pass through cost inflation appropriately to maintain our margins."

I believe that if I really look at my operating rates across the world, we are, at this point in time, at a level where we can still, through temporary steps, adjust our capacity to the demand levels more appropriately. I believe as well that we need to have some flex to the upside if demand picks up because the worst thing we could do is shut down a furnace permanently and then half year from now need one. You can imagine that, that does not lead to a very good return on investment.

It is quite obvious given the distributed capacities that exist in China that any progress in acquisitions will be these onesies and twosies that we have to go through. There is not a big consolidated operator at this point in time and place. I think the largest manufacturer and may perhaps just be 1 or 2 percentage points of our market share as far as consolidated share is concerned. So it's going to be quite a number of acquisitions to eventually get to the targets that we have set ourselves.  And you also know that within China, we have talked about 4 or 5 regions that we want to be focusing on because that's really where the demand and the emerging middle class is concentrated so it makes a lot of sense to not try to be present in all geographic regions in China."

I think the fact that our pipeline is full is indicative, of course, that people are looking at their role and their position in the marketplace and are coming to some conclusions that are different than they may have reached a year or 2 years ago. So clearly, some companies are a bit stressed at this point in time, but that very often is not really due to market conditions, it's much more due to financing structures that they have elected over the past. So that I think really explains a little bit that the pipeline is rather full at this point in time. With regard to the seller expectations, that, of course, is always the part of the discussion that takes the longest because even though they have reached a conclusion that they couldn't possibly want to sell because they have understood that market conditions are changing or their own financial strength has changed, but they're still, of course, trying to tie the value to where the business was 3 years ago, and that is generally where we have to talk them down from. Our position when we look at acquisitions really is how quickly can we influence the operations and generate additional efficiencies, which is a significant part of the transaction value that we are willing to consider. The other part is, is it just a consolidation game or is it a considered end growth game, which of course, creates a different dynamic for the business, and that, of course, would also flow into the valuation that we're going to do.  And then you see huge differences from region to region on the overall profitability. It's quite obvious that what we did in Brazil is a very highly profit generating and growing organization so you would typically be willing to put a higher value to that than in other markets where it's just a consolidation game and we're the only benefit you could get would be efficiencies."

Number one in the United States, of course, a significant portion of the volatility with regard to inflation and raw materials has been taken out to the new contract stipulations so you see pass-through provisions. And so that is really not going to create pressure points but it's going to create some variability from quarter-to-quarter with regard to price evolution. In the other parts of the world, what you're seeing largely is also is geographic mix. As we're growing much faster in Latin America, where prices tend to be higher than, for instance, in some of the other regions in Eastern Europe, that, of course, is going to influence the average price as well. So I would say you really get a true picture and a balanced picture of our pricing if you put the pricing in relation to the inflation that we're discussing. I think that really is where you get a complete picture of the potential impact of pricing, just looking at pricing by itself maybe misleading."

And I think there have been quite a significant series of articles and analyses been done about the beer industry, which in the United States, still is 50%, 60% of the volume.  And what you are seeing and what we're hearing from the brewers is basically that, first of all, we saw clearly at the end of last year, the beginning of this year, a significant shift to value brands. Now, the brewers are diminishing the differentiation in pricing between value brands and premium brands to push demand back up into the premium sector because that apparently is a more attractive sector for them. And that was also reflected in the price increases that the brewers put in place in August and in September of this year. But what we're hearing as well is that there is now a trend where the consumers are buying more premium rather than value brands. We're seeing some shift there.  And clearly, throughout this entire period of economic hardship, you've seen the bifurcation of the market between the, let's say, age group sub-35 and 35 and beyond, and you see that reflected in micro-brewers doing extremely well. You see that reflected in wine doing very well, you see that reflected in spirits doing reasonably well. So I think you really have a bifurcation also of some of the demand at this point in time. So it really requires us to look at a very individualistically as to what's happening. But at least the comments that I'm hearing is that the brewers felt confident enough in the demand cycle, that the demand wouldn't drop off further to raise prices.  And I think that's a pretty good sign going forward."

And when we came into this year, we said that the beginning of this year, that we would expect the absolute profitability of North America to be equal to the profitability that we have achieved in the previous year despite the impending volume impact that we were going to see from the pricing. So I think for us, overall, this really means that the strategy that we have put in place is working, and the benefits that we're going to see in the fourth quarter in the United States again are mainly coming from what we did last year compared to this year with regard to volume and utilization and manufacturing and operations where we had a very high degree of unabsorbed fixed costs last year which we will not see this year."

Before I discuss the results of the third quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes on the recent development with our operations in Venezuela. On Monday, President Hugo Chavez announced his intent to expropriate O-I's",2071,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning. Before I discuss the results of the third quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes on the recent development with our operations in Venezuela. On Monday, President Hugo Chavez announced his intent to expropriate O-I's facilities in Venezuela. Subsequently, a formal decree was issued by the Venezuelan government. 
First, I want to personally thank all our employees in Venezuela for their continued dedication to O-I during these difficult and uncertain times. Glassmaking is a highly specialized and complex industry, and plants require a great deal of expertise to run safely and effectively. We have been in constant contact with our facility managers to ensure a safe operating environment for all of our employees, and we continue to operate the facilities to ensure we service our customers with products that meet the food and beverage needs of the Venezuelan people. 
This is a very fluid situation with many uncertainties. Clearly, we are very disappointed with these developments after successfully operating in Venezuela for over 50 years. We are working diligently to protect the interests of our employees, customers and shareholders, and we will provide timely updates as we gain a better understanding of the situation and can articulate our next steps. Ed will review a few of the financial matters associated with this situation shortly. 
Now turning to third quarter results. Earnings were $0.90 per share in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of currency translation, O-I earned $0.94 per share. So on a currency-neutral basis, earnings were basically in line with prior year results. 
Business conditions in the third quarter were consistent with those in the first half of 2010. Strong growth continued in the emerging markets, especially in South America, and we capitalized on strategic opportunities to expand in those attractive regions. 
Glass demand by the brewers remained sluggish in the mature markets, while we saw positive growth in beer across the emerging markets, as well as in food, wine and spirit end-use categories on a worldwide basis. Globally, our shipments were down 2.4% from the prior year. This mainly reflect that lower volumes resulting from contract renegotiations that went into effect in 2010. If you adjust for the impact of those contracts, shipments were up 1% from last year, which is more indicative of consumer demand trend. 
Like last quarter, a favorable regional sales mix in our fast-growing and profitable South American operations mostly offset the earnings impact of lower global shipments. 
While cost inflation was negligible in the first half of 2010, we did incur higher input costs in the third quarter. In addition, manufacturing costs in the quarter increased due to the startup of 2 new furnaces in South America and the completion of our realignment activities in North America. These activities impacted third quarter results, but the operational improvements will, of course, benefit future earnings. 
Free cash flow in the quarter were $75 million, which reflect seasonal working capital trends in our industry. We made additional progress on the execution of our strategic priorities this quarter. We further expanded our presence in South America through our acquisition of CIV, the leading glassmaker in Northern Brazil. This acquisition added 3 plants in one of Brazil's fastest-growing regions. 
Yesterday, we also announced the acquisition of a single-plant operation near Guangzhou, China, and this is consistent with our strategy to grow in one of the world's largest consumer markets. 
We successfully completed a euro bond offering in the quarter to help ensure that we maintain the financial flexibility we need to pursue additional strategic activities. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect prices will remain stable. We anticipate demand in most end-use categories to improve over the prior year, with the likely exception of shipments to beer customers in mature markets. We expect to see increased sales in South America as a result of renewed production capacity and recent acquisitions. 
Overall, operating rates should be higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. Although it's too early to tell for sure, it is likely that the recent developments in Venezuela will negatively the impact results in the fourth quarter. 
Now let's review our operating performance on Chart 3. Here, we show segment operating profit and margins for the company, as well as for each of our 4 regions. Overall, segment operating profit was $299 million and margins exceeded 17% of sales. Adjusted to reflect prior-year currency exchange rates, segment profit was $308 million. So on a like-for-like basis, quarterly earnings declined $9 million from last year, reflecting lower sales volume and additional cost inflation. 
Now let's review regional trends beginning with Europe. Operating profit was $113 million in the third quarter. On a like-for-like basis, profit was $123 million, down $5 million from the prior year. Consistent with the outlook provided during our last earnings call, third quarter selling prices were down modestly from 2009. 
Total third quarter European shipments increased slightly from the prior year. Shipments were nearly up 5% across most of Western Europe, which represented more than 80% of our European volumes. While glass demand for the Beer segment remains sluggish, we saw strong demand in other end-use categories. However, the Netherlands, Hungary and the Czech Republic were down double digits due to lower food and beer shipments. In particular, Eastern Europe continued to struggle with challenging market conditions following the European financial crisis. 
Given slightly higher overall shipments and the very low inventory level entering the quarter, capacity utilization in the third quarter increased from the prior year. Year-to-date, temporary curtailments in Europe represented about 5% of total capacity, down significantly from the prior year. 
In North America, our operating profit was $71 million in the quarter, down $12 million from last year. North American shipments were down more than 10% from the third quarter of 2009, continuing the trend that we have seen all year. Higher margins, however, again mostly offset the impact of lower sales volumes. 
Lower shipments in the region were attributable to the renegotiation of several key customer contracts at the end of 2009, as well as a continued weak U.S. beer consumption, which was down 1% to 2% in the third quarter. However, trends have slightly improved in recent months compared to earlier this year. Glass shipment trends have gradually improved in recent months, as well as consumption of premium brands has picked up relative to sub-premium brands, and we also saw a continued improvement in other end-use categories such as food and wine. 
We completed our footprint realignment efforts in North America during the third quarter and realigned our business mix with our remaining manufacturing network. As a result, we incurred additional costs during the third quarter that accounted for most of the shortfall in regional earnings over 2009 levels but this restructured footprint should drive improved earnings going forward, and we continue to expect that our full year 2010 North American profits will meet or exceed prior year results. 
Despite the recent developments in Venezuela, we remain very encouraged about the future of South America. In fact, our South American region continues to be our top performer with operating profit of $77 million in the third quarter as margins improved to 26%. 
On a currency-neutral basis, profits were $79 million, up $15 million from the prior year. Strong shipments continued across all end-use markets, especially beer, driven by new product introductions. In fact, volume was up around 20% in South America, excluding Venezuela, which was flat with the prior year. 
To meet growing demand in the region, we began production at our newly construct furnaces in Argentina and in Peru. These assets are already operating at best-in-class production levels. Strong growth also led to a higher production and capacity utilization rates in South America. Our acquisition of CIV in the third quarter will further boost production, and Ed will review more details on that acquisition in a minute. 
Our Asia Pacific region reported third quarter operating profit of $38 million. On a like-for-like basis, profits were $35 million, down from $42 million last year. While higher prices essentially offset cost inflation this quarter, volumes were down mid-single digits from last year. Like Europe, Asia Pac volume trends vary by country. 
Now starting in Australia, glass volumes were down. The strong Australian dollar, which is now at parity with the U.S. dollar, created a cost disadvantage for Australian wine exports. In addition, some of our beer business traded hands, as a competitor added glass capacity earlier this year. We have won new business, but it will take several months for O-I to backfill the lost volume. 
In China, our shipments were boost by the July acquisition of our new plant in Sichuan. Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of a majority interest in an additional plant near Guangzhou, China for $29 million. This acquisition complements O-I's existing operations in Guangdong, China's fourth largest glass market as a province, and we are pushing the upper limit of capacity in our manufacturing systems in China, which underscores the need for further acquisitions of investments in the future to keep up with the growth in this market. 
We are pleased with the progress at our new joint venture in Malaysia and Vietnam. After only 2 full months, productivity rates have increased by about 15 percentage points. By continuing to integrate O-I's extensive knowledge of global manufacturing processes, we see additional opportunities to increase the profitability of this joint venture.  
And finally, we began production at our new furnace in New Zealand in October. We learned -- we look forward to updating you on our progress with these strategic activities in more detail in the coming quarters. 
Globally, market conditions remained consistent with the first half of 2010. Glass demand for beer in the mature markets remain down, likely due to persistent unemployment across key demographics for beer customers. Emerging market growth was strong, and most end-use categories in the mature markets have been growing, as those economies gradually recover.  And I'll discuss our demand trends in greater detail on Chart 4. 
With our year-to-date shipments down 1.3%, I have heard some concern that glass is facing structural market challenges. Now let me provide you some details why I do not believe that, that is the case. We have illustrated our year-to-date demand growth by key end-use categories on this chart.  And as you can see, O-I's glass shipments for spirits and wine, as well as beer in the emerging markets, improved between 5% and 13% from last year, while food was up about 2%. However, our glass shipments for beer in the developed markets were down more than 11% from last year. As a result of this sizable decline, our total shipments were down slightly from last year in total. So the significant decline in glass volume for beer mostly reflected our price over volume strategy over the past few years and not any large-scale industry shift away from beer and glass bottles. 
As we raise prices to repair our margins in recent years, we knew we would surrender some volume, and that is now fully reflected in our 2010 shipment trends. This trade-off has clearly improved our financial performance since we initiated this strategy several years ago. 
The orange bar on the chart illustrate our volumes, excluding the impact of these pricing actions, limited to beer customers in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Adjusted for pricing action effects, our shipments to beer customers were down 3.3% in the mature markets, which was generally in line with beer consumption trends. For example, consumption has declined so far this year by about 3% in Western Europe, 2% in the United States and 1% in Australia. 
While beer glass volumes are down, we have been working with a number of our multinational customers and other end-use categories to earn new business, and we are encouraged by these developments. Therefore, excluding the impact of our pricing actions, O-I's global shipments were up 1.8% year-to-date, and this growth rate is a bit lower than we expected earlier this year, and it just shows that like many others, we have not been great at predicting the immediate future in this economic environment. However, I see no structural issues in the glass business. In fact, our business trends are generally favorable across most regions and end users.  And now, I will turn the call back over to Ed."

Now I will discuss Venezuela along with our business outlook at the end of my prepared remarks. Let me begin with our financial review with the reconciliation for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 5. Segment sales decreased $135 milli",1625,"Thanks, Al. Now I will discuss Venezuela along with our business outlook at the end of my prepared remarks. Let me begin with our financial review with the reconciliation for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 5. 
Segment sales decreased $135 million to $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2010. As expected, price and product mix were essentially flat with the prior year. As we've seen all year, cost pass-through provisions in our North American customer contracts resulted in a small impact on sales and had a negligible effect on operating profit. 
Moving to sales volume on the following line, glass shipments in tonnes were 2.4% below the prior year on a global basis, reducing sales by $40 million. These sales figures include the benefit of recent acquisitions, which added approximately 1% to our volumes. 
Finally, the stronger U.S. dollar reduced our top line by $90 million in the third quarter. This impact was due to a weaker euro and the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation, partially offset by stronger currencies in other countries. While the euro has rallied in recent months, it was still weaker than the U.S. dollar compared to the average of the third quarter 2009. 
Moving over to segment operating profit. The third quarter was $299 million, down $18 million from the same period in 2009. Since price and product mix were flat, they had no year-over-year impact on operating profit. Lower sales volumes only slightly impacted operating profit due to improved regional mix, given strong growth of higher-margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs increased to $21 million. We incurred cost inflation of $26 million and the startup costs penalties that Al mentioned. These were partially offset by incremental footprint savings and higher operating rate. Results benefited $15 million from other operating items, as we reduced discretionary spending and benefited from a few onetime items. Finally, currency translation reduced operating profit by $9 million in the third quarter, mostly due to a weaker euro. 
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.90 per share in the quarter, down $0.05 from the prior year. As we just discussed, operating profit was down $0.07 from last year. However, earnings did benefit from favorable nonoperating items. Our effective tax rate was lower than last year, reflecting our current regional earnings mix. Also, EPS benefited from a lower share count after repurchasing 6 million shares in the first half of the year.
Corporate costs were up from last year due to higher noncash pension expense. This was partially offset by cost reduction efforts. Likewise, we reduced management incentive compensation expense to reflect current financial results. 
One comment on GAAP EPS. We incurred approximately $9 million of Note 1 charges in the third quarter, related to onetime costs and purchase price accounting associated with our recent acquisitions. 
Free cash flow in the third quarter was $75 million. As a result, the company was free cash flow positive year-to-date. Chart 6 illustrates our year-over-year reconciliation. The decline in free cash flow generation is mostly attributed to working capital and CapEx. Working capital was $843 million greater use of cash in the first 9 months of 2010. The difference is due to the significant inventory reductions we took last year that did not repeat at the same level in 2010. 
Next, capital expenditures were $198 million higher through September 2010. This difference was largely due to timing, as 2009 CapEx was mostly deferred until the fourth quarter, and 2010 spending has been more evenly distributed across the year. Importantly, the fourth quarter 2009 spending spike will not repeat in 2010. 
Let's move to Chart 7 for more detail on our balance sheet and several strategic initiatives that we completed in the third quarter. On September 30, 2010, cash was $700 million, which was about $40 million, which included about $40 million in Venezuela. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $4.3 billion. Net debt was $3.6 billion, which increased by $826 million from the second quarter, primarily to fund acquisitions. 
Our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.8x at September 30, higher than our second quarter ratio of 2.2x, again reflecting our acquisitions in the third quarter. But the ratio was still within our target leverage range between 2x and 3x. 
Third quarter restructuring payments were higher than the second quarter, reflecting the advancement of our North American realignment project. Capital expenditures totaled $155 million in the quarter, which was similar to our second quarter level. 
Our 2010 capital expenditures will approximate $500 million. We have pulled back on some projects in the fourth quarter, but the weaker U.S. dollar and incremental capital on new acquisitions were offsetting this lower activity. As illustrated on the right, most of our CapEx this year is for maintenance projects, and it's within our 80% to 85% range of depreciation. The remaining capital is focused on our North American restructuring program and growth initiatives. The growth investments are concentrated in South America and Asia Pacific to keep up with increased demand. Overall, we believe our capital expenditures are prudent and in line with our profitable growth strategies. 
Also on the right, you can see our 2 largest strategic activities completed in the third quarter. The first is our acquisition of CIV in Northeast Brazil. Brazil represents the largest economy and glass container market in South America, so it is key for O-I. We already have a robust business and experienced management team in the southern region of the company. The CIV acquisition will provide a strong complement to our current franchise in Brazil and will allow us to serve many existing and new customers, who are expanding their operations in the northeast. 
CIV's 3 facilities will increase O-I's capacity in Brazil by 50%. O-I's total purchase price for CIV was $603 million, which included approximately $140 million for future tax benefits. The purchase price reflects a 5.8x EBITDA multiple based on 2011 forecasted EBITDA of $80 million. We expect that the CIV acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in 2011, and the return on investment of this business is well above O-I's cost of capital. 
The second strategic initiative was in early September. We issued EUR 500 million of 10-year senior notes at an interest rate of 6 3/4%. We are pleased that these bonds have been the most favorably priced offering in the European high-yield market, so far, this year. In addition to an attractive coupon rate and a tax-efficient structure, greater euro-denominated interest expense is a natural currency hedge for our European profits. The proceeds of the euro bonds will enable further strategic and profitable growth. 
Turning to Chart 8. You'll see our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2010. We have provided the usual directional guidance on the key business drivers affecting earnings and cash flow. All trends are on a year-over-year basis comparing expected fourth quarter 2010 performance with the same period in 2009. As Al mentioned, the developments in Venezuela will likely negatively impact our fourth quarter results. However, the situation is very fluid, so our outlook does not include any potential impact from Venezuela. 
Now let me review each of the factors. Price and product mix. Similar to the third quarter, we expect prices in the fourth quarter to be flat with prior year levels. 
Sales volume. Clearly, we have struggled to identify the turning point with beer demand in mature markets. Beer consumption remains sluggish and has not improved significantly despite promotional efforts by our customers. Hence, we anticipate fourth quarter glass demand for beer in the U.S. and Europe will remain down from the prior year. However, we expect continued year-over-year growth in all other end-use categories. The net effect of these 2 trends is difficult to project. Depending on their relative movement, we can perceive fourth quarter sales volumes being 2% above or below prior year levels. 
Manufacturing and delivery. Higher capacity utilization should result in lower manufacturing and delivery costs compared to last year. Footprint savings should mostly offset cost inflation that is expected to be comparable to third quarter levels. 
Now on operating costs. Corporate costs will be higher than the fourth quarter of last year, mostly reflecting additional pension expense which we've seen every quarter in 2010. Also, net interest expense will increase approximately $15 million on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter due to higher debt to fund acquisitions. 
Furthermore, we are taking steps to curtail our spending plans, given lower-than-anticipated volumes in 2010. We have evaluated corporate expense, restructuring payments and working capital investments. We expect to reduce spending in these categories by $20 million to $30 million from our original expectations. 
Let me wrap up with a discussion on Venezuela. As I mentioned, the financial implications of expropriation remain unclear. Given this lack of clarity, I will provide some information about our Venezuelan operations to give you a sense of their scope relative to O-I in total. 
First, we've been operating in Venezuela for over 50 years, serving the country's food and beverage industry. I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the more than 1,000 employees at the 2 plants for all their hard work and dedication during these difficult times. O-I has a 75% ownership interest in our Venezuelan operations, with the remaining ownership held by a minority partner. Year-to-date, Venezuela accounted for approximately 3% of O-I global sales volume. The country represented just under 5% of segment operating profits and adjusted net earnings. 
Finally, O-I's net assets in Venezuela approximated 4% of O-I's total net assets as of September 30. We intend to provide regular and timely updates on this situation as information becomes available. 
Now I'll turn it back to Al for Chart 9."

Let me close with some comments on the financial targets that we introduced at our Investor Day in March of this year. Chart 9 highlights our net sales and segment operating profit margin goals for 2012. 
If you'll recall, we indicated our sales will grow between $9 billion and $9.5 billion, and our global segment operating profit margins will expand to 16% to 18% by the end of this 3-year period. And we continue to expect that this growth will be achieved equally through a recovering marketplace and mergers and acquisitions. 
Now that we are almost a third of the way into this 3-year period, we can say that we are pleased with our M&A properties. Through the third quarter, we have made 3 high-quality acquisitions, and more importantly, our M&A pipeline remains full, as we work to close more deals in the upcoming quarters. 
On the other hand, the rate of our overall market recovery has been inconsistent, robust in South America and China, but slower-than-anticipated in the mature markets. That said, we remain optimistic that a recovering marketplace in both Europe and North America should favorably impact the premium end-use segments that we serve. It is just going to take more time than we had originally expected, but it's still likely to be achieved within our original 3-year horizon. 
As the developments in Venezuela over the past few days show, events can change rapidly. But based on today's perspective, we remain confident that we are on the trajectory to reach our 3-year targets.  And furthermore, O-I's strategic priorities remain unchanged to support those objectives.
And now, I will ask the operator to open the lines for your questions. Thank you."

But as we went through the third quarter, in particular, we saw that the impact of the U.S. dollar, which at that point in time was higher than the previous year or was impacting the price of Brent crude, which is quoted in U.S. dollars and the conversion to euros, and it was causing inflationary pressure. I think we also are looking at what's going to happen in the supply and demand situation with regard to soda ash, which of course, is a considerable cost line here. And I think everybody in the industry is seeing the same pressures, and therefore, I believe we will see a continued approach to the marketplace that is reflective of making sure that we pass through cost inflation appropriately to maintain our margins."

In terms of productivity itself, obviously, in run rates, we've been -- North America is at the low end of the range in the 80%, 85% range.

I think the fact that our pipeline is full is indicative, of course, that people are looking at their role and their position in the marketplace and are coming to some conclusions that are different than they may have reached a year or 2 years ago. So clearly, some companies are a bit stressed at this point in time, but that very often is not really due to market conditions, it's much more due to financing structures that they have elected over the past. So that I think really explains a little bit that the pipeline is rather full at this point in time. With regard to the seller expectations, that, of course, is always the part of the discussion that takes the longest, because even though they have reached a conclusion that they couldn't possibly want to sell because they have understood that market conditions are changing or their own financial strength has changed. But they're still, of course, trying to tie the value to where the business was 3 years ago, and that is generally where we have to talk them down from. Our position when we look at acquisitions really is how quickly can we influence the operations and generate additional efficiencies, which is a significant part of the transaction value that we are willing to consider. The other part is, is it just a consolidation game or is it a considered end growth game, which of course, creates a different dynamic for the business, and that, of course, would also flow into the valuation that we're going to do.  And then you'll see huge differences from region to region on the overall profitability. It's quite obvious that what we did in Brazil is very highly profit-generating and growing organization so you would typically be willing to put a higher value to that than in other markets, where it's just a consolidation game and where the only benefit you could get would be efficiencies."

In the other parts of the world, what you're seeing largely is also geographic mix. As we're growing much faster in Latin America, where prices tend to be higher than, for instance, in some of the other regions in Eastern Europe, that, of course, is going to influence the average price as well. So I would say you really get a true picture and a balanced picture of our pricing if you put the pricing in relation to the inflation that we're discussing.

And I think there have been quite a significant series of articles and analyses has been done about the beer industry, which in the United States still is 50%, 60% of the volume.  And what you are seeing and what we're hearing from the brewers is basically that, first of all, we saw clearly at the end of last year, the beginning of this year, a significant shift to value brands. Now the brewers are diminishing the differentiation in pricing between value brands and premium brands to push demand back up into the premium sector, because that apparently is a more attractive sector for them. And that was also reflected in the price increases that the brewers put in place in August and in September of this year. But what we're hearing as well is that there is now a trend where the consumers are buying more premium brands rather than value brands. We're seeing some shift there.  And clearly, throughout this entire period of economic hardship, we've seen a bifurcation of the market between the, let's say, age groups sub-35 and 35 and beyond, and you'll see that reflected in micro-brewers doing extremely well. You'll see that reflected in wine doing very well, you-will see that reflected in spirits doing reasonably well. So I think you really have a bifurcation also of some of the demand at this point in time. So it really requires us to look at it very individualistically as to what's happening. But at least the comments that I'm hearing is that the brewers felt confident enough in the demand cycle, that the demand wouldn't drop off further to raise prices.

And when we came into this year, we said that the beginning of this year, that we would expect the absolute profitability of North America to be equal to the profitability that we have achieved in the previous year, despite the impending volume impact that we were going to see from the pricing. So I think for us, overall, this really means that the strategy that we have put in place is working, and the benefits that we're going to see in the fourth quarter in the United States again are mainly coming from what we did last year compared to this year with regard to volume and utilization and manufacturing and operations, where we had a very high degree of unabsorbed fixed costs last year which we will not see this year."

Before I discuss the results of the third quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes on the recent development with our operations in Venezuela. On Monday, President Hugo Chavez announced his intent to expropriate O-I's",2070,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning. Before I discuss the results of the third quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes on the recent development with our operations in Venezuela. On Monday, President Hugo Chavez announced his intent to expropriate O-I's facilities in Venezuela. Subsequently, a formal decree was issued by the Venezuelan government. 
First, I want to personally thank all our employees in Venezuela for their continued dedication to O-I during these difficult and uncertain times. Glassmaking is a highly specialized and complex industry, and plants require a great deal of expertise to run safely and effectively. We have been in constant contact with our facility managers to ensure a safe operating environment for all of our employees, and we continue to operate the facilities to ensure we service our customers with products that meet the food and beverage needs of the Venezuelan people. 
This is a very fluid situation with many uncertainties. Clearly, we are very disappointed with these developments after successfully operating in Venezuela for over 50 years. We are working diligently to protect the interests of our employees, customers and shareholders, and we will provide timely updates as we gain a better understanding of the situation and can articulate our next steps. Ed will review a few of the financial matters associated with this situation shortly. 
Now turning to third quarter results. Earnings were $0.90 per share in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of currency translation, O-I earned $0.94 per share. So on a currency-neutral basis, earnings were basically in line with prior year results. 
Business conditions in the third quarter were consistent with those in the first half of 2010. Strong growth continued in the emerging markets, especially in South America, and we capitalized on strategic opportunities to expand in those attractive regions. 
Glass demand by the brewers remained sluggish in the mature markets, while we saw positive growth in beer across the emerging markets, as well as in food, wine and spirit end-use categories on a worldwide basis. Globally, our shipments were down 2.4% from the prior year. This mainly reflect that lower volumes resulting from contract renegotiations that went into effect in 2010. If you adjust for the impact of those contracts, shipments were up 1% from last year, which is more indicative of consumer demand trend. 
Like last quarter, a favorable regional sales mix in our fast-growing and profitable South American operations mostly offset the earnings impact of lower global shipments. 
While cost inflation was negligible in the first half of 2010, we did incur higher input costs in the third quarter. In addition, manufacturing costs in the quarter increased due to the startup of 2 new furnaces in South America and the completion of our realignment activities in North America. These activities impacted third quarter results, but the operational improvements will, of course, benefit future earnings. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $75 million, which reflect seasonal working capital trends in our industry. We made additional progress on the execution of our strategic priorities this quarter. We further expanded our presence in South America through our acquisition of CIV, the leading glassmaker in Northern Brazil. This acquisition added 3 plants in one of Brazil's fastest-growing regions. 
Yesterday, we also announced the acquisition of a single-plant operation near Guangzhou, China, and this is consistent with our strategy to grow in one of the world's largest consumer markets. 
We successfully completed a euro bond offering in the quarter to help ensure that we maintain the financial flexibility we need to pursue additional strategic activities. 
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect prices will remain stable. We anticipate demand in most end-use categories to improve over the prior year, with the likely exception of shipments to beer customers in mature markets. We expect to see increased sales in South America as a result of renewed production capacity and recent acquisitions. 
Overall, operating rates should be higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. Although it's too early to tell for sure, it is likely that the recent developments in Venezuela will negatively impact results in the fourth quarter. 
Now let's review our operating performance on Chart 3. Here, we show segment operating profit and margins for the company, as well as for each of our 4 regions. Overall, segment operating profit was $299 million and margins exceeded 17% of sales. Adjusted to reflect prior-year currency exchange rates, segment profit was $308 million. So on a like-for-like basis, quarterly earnings declined $9 million from last year, reflecting lower sales volume and additional cost inflation. 
Now let's review regional trends beginning with Europe. Operating profit was $113 million in the third quarter. On a like-for-like basis, profit was $123 million, down $5 million from the prior year. Consistent with the outlook provided during our last earnings call, third quarter selling prices were down modestly from 2009. 
Total third quarter European shipments increased slightly from the prior year. Shipments were nearly up 5% across most of Western Europe, which represented more than 80% of our European volumes. While glass demand for the Beer segment remains sluggish, we saw strong demand in other end-use categories. However, the Netherlands, Hungary and the Czech Republic were down double digits due to lower food and beer shipments. In particular, Eastern Europe continued to struggle with challenging market conditions following the European financial crisis. 
Given slightly higher overall shipments and the very low inventory level entering the quarter, capacity utilization in the third quarter increased from the prior year. Year-to-date, temporary curtailments in Europe represented about 5% of total capacity, down significantly from the prior year. 
In North America, our operating profit was $71 million in the quarter, down $12 million from last year. North American shipments were down more than 10% from the third quarter of 2009, continuing the trend that we have seen all year. Higher margins, however, again mostly offset the impact of lower sales volumes. 
Lower shipments in the region were attributable to the renegotiation of several key customer contracts at the end of 2009, as well as a continued weak U.S. beer consumption, which was down 1% to 2% in the third quarter. However, trends have slightly improved in recent months compared to earlier this year. Glass shipment trends have gradually improved in recent months, as well as consumption of premium brands has picked up relative to sub-premium brands, and we also saw a continued improvement in other end-use categories such as food and wine. 
We completed our footprint realignment efforts in North America during the third quarter and realigned our business mix with our remaining manufacturing network. As a result, we incurred additional costs during the third quarter that accounted for most of the shortfall in regional earnings over 2009 levels but this restructured footprint should drive improved earnings going forward, and we continue to expect that our full year 2010 North American profits will meet or exceed prior year results. 
Despite the recent developments in Venezuela, we remain very encouraged about the future of South America. In fact, our South American region continues to be our top performer with operating profit of $77 million in the third quarter as margins improved to 26%. 
On a currency-neutral basis, profits were $79 million, up $15 million from the prior year. Strong shipments continued across all end-use markets, especially beer, driven by new product introductions. In fact, volume was up around 20% in South America, excluding Venezuela, which was flat with the prior year. 
To meet growing demand in the region, we began production at our newly constructed furnaces in Argentina and in Peru. These assets are already operating at best-in-class production levels. Strong growth also led to a higher production and capacity utilization rates in South America. Our acquisition of CIV in the third quarter will further boost production, and Ed will review more details on that acquisition in a minute. 
Our Asia Pacific region reported third quarter operating profit of $38 million. On a like-for-like basis, profits were $35 million, down from $42 million last year. While higher prices essentially offset cost inflation this quarter, volumes were down mid-single digits from last year. Like Europe, Asia Pac volume trends vary by country. 
Now starting in Australia, glass volumes were down. The strong Australian dollar, which is now at parity with the U.S. dollar, created a cost disadvantage for Australian wine exports. In addition, some of our beer business traded hands, as a competitor added glass capacity earlier this year. We have won new business, but it will take several months for O-I to backfill the lost volume. 
In China, our shipments were boost by the July acquisition of our new plant in Sichuan. Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of a majority interest in an additional plant near Guangzhou, China for $29 million. This acquisition complements O-I's existing operations in Guangdong, China's fourth largest glass market as a province, and we are pushing the upper limit of capacity in our manufacturing systems in China, which underscores the need for further acquisitions of investments in the future to keep up with the growth in this market. 
We are pleased with the progress at our new joint venture in Malaysia and Vietnam. After only 2 full months, productivity rates have increased by about 15 percentage points. By continuing to integrate O-I's extensive knowledge of global manufacturing processes, we see additional opportunities to increase the profitability of this joint venture.  
And finally, we began production at our new furnace in New Zealand in October. We learned -- we look forward to updating you on our progress with these strategic activities in more detail in the coming quarters. 
Globally, market conditions remained consistent with the first half of 2010. Glass demand for beer in the mature markets remained down, likely due to persistent unemployment across key demographics for beer customers. Emerging market growth was strong, and most end-use categories in the mature markets have been growing, as those economies gradually recover. And I'll discuss our demand trends in greater detail on Chart 4. 
With our year-to-date shipments down 1.3%, I have heard some concern that glass is facing structural market challenges. Now let me provide you some details why I do not believe that, that is the case. We have illustrated our year-to-date demand growth by key end-use categories on this chart.  And as you can see, O-I's glass shipments for spirits and wine, as well as beer in the emerging markets, improved between 5% and 13% from last year, while food was up about 2%. However, our glass shipments for beer in the developed markets were down more than 11% from last year. As a result of this sizable decline, our total shipments were down slightly from last year in total. So the significant decline in glass volume for beer mostly reflected our price over volume strategy over the past few years and not any large-scale industry shift away from beer and glass bottles. 
As we raise prices to repair our margins in recent years, we knew we would surrender some volume, and that is now fully reflected in our 2010 shipment trends. This trade-off has clearly improved our financial performance since we initiated this strategy several years ago. 
The orange bar on the chart illustrate our volumes, excluding the impact of these pricing actions, limited to beer customers in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Adjusted for pricing action effects, our shipments to beer customers were down 3.3% in the mature markets, which was generally in line with beer consumption trends. For example, consumption has declined so far this year by about 3% in Western Europe, 2% in the United States and 1% in Australia. 
While beer glass volumes are down, we have been working with a number of our multinational customers and other end-use categories to earn new business, and we are encouraged by these developments. Therefore, excluding the impact of our pricing actions, O-I's global shipments were up 1.8% year-to-date, and this growth rate is a bit lower than we expected earlier this year, and it just shows that like many others, we have not been great at predicting the immediate future in this economic environment. However, I see no structural issues in the glass business. In fact, our business trends are generally favorable across most regions and end users. And now, I will turn the call back over to Ed."

Now I will discuss Venezuela along with our business outlook at the end of my prepared remarks. Let me begin with our financial review with the reconciliation for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 5. Segment sales decreased $135 milli",1626,"Thanks, Al. Now I will discuss Venezuela along with our business outlook at the end of my prepared remarks. Let me begin with our financial review with the reconciliation for sales, operating profit and EPS on Chart 5. 
Segment sales decreased $135 million to $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2010. As expected, price and product mix were essentially flat with the prior year. As we've seen all year, cost pass-through provisions in our North American customer contracts resulted in a small impact on sales and had a negligible effect on operating profit. 
Moving to sales volume on the following line, glass shipments in tonnes were 2.4% below the prior year on a global basis, reducing sales by $40 million. These sales figures include the benefit of recent acquisitions, which added approximately 1% to our volumes. 
Finally, the stronger U.S. dollar reduced our top line by $90 million in the third quarter. This impact was due to a weaker euro and the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation, partially offset by stronger currencies in other countries. While the euro has rallied in recent months, it was still weaker than the U.S. dollar compared to the average of the third quarter 2009. 
Moving over to segment operating profit. The third quarter was $299 million, down $18 million from the same period in 2009. Since price and product mix were flat, they had no year-over-year impact on operating profit. Lower sales volumes only slightly impacted operating profit due to improved regional mix, given strong growth of higher-margin business in South America. Manufacturing and delivery costs increased $21 million. We incurred cost inflation of $26 million and the startup costs penalties that Al mentioned. These were partially offset by incremental footprint savings and higher operating rate. Results benefited $15 million from other operating items, as we reduced discretionary spending and benefited from a few onetime items. Finally, currency translation reduced operating profit by $9 million in the third quarter, mostly due to a weaker euro. 
Finishing with the EPS reconciliation, our adjusted net income was $0.90 per share in the quarter, down $0.05 from the prior year. As we just discussed, operating profit was down $0.07 from last year. However, earnings did benefit from favorable nonoperating items. Our effective tax rate was lower than last year, reflecting our current regional earnings mix. Also, EPS benefited from a lower share count after repurchasing 6 million shares in the first half of the year.
Corporate costs were up from last year due to higher noncash pension expense. This was partially offset by cost reduction efforts. Likewise, we reduced management incentive compensation expense to reflect current financial results. 
One comment on GAAP EPS. We incurred approximately $9 million of Note 1 charges in the third quarter, related to onetime costs and purchase price accounting associated with our recent acquisitions. 
Free cash flow in the third quarter was $75 million. As a result, the company is free cash flow positive year-to-date. Chart 6 illustrates our year-over-year reconciliation. The decline in free cash flow generation is mostly attributed to working capital and CapEx. Working capital was a $143 million greater use of cash in the first 9 months of 2010. The difference is due to the significant inventory reductions we took last year that did not repeat at the same level in 2010. 
Next, capital expenditures were $198 million higher through September 2010. This difference was largely due to timing, as 2009 CapEx was mostly deferred until the fourth quarter, and 2010 spending has been more evenly distributed across the year. Importantly, the fourth quarter 2009 spending spike will not repeat in 2010. 
Let's move to Chart 7 for more detail on our balance sheet and several strategic initiatives that we completed in the third quarter. On September 30, 2010, cash was $700 million, which was about $40 million -- which included about $40 million in Venezuela. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $4.3 billion. Net debt was $3.6 billion, which increased by $826 million from the second quarter, primarily to fund acquisitions. 
Our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.8x at September 30, higher than our second quarter ratio of 2.2x, again reflecting our acquisitions in the third quarter. But the ratio was still within our target leverage range between 2x and 3x. 
Third quarter restructuring payments were higher than the second quarter, reflecting the advancement of our North American realignment project. Capital expenditures totaled $155 million in the quarter, which was similar to our second quarter level. 
Our 2010 capital expenditures will approximate $500 million. We have pulled back on some projects in the fourth quarter, but the weaker U.S. dollar and incremental capital on new acquisitions are offsetting this lower activity. As illustrated on the right, most of our CapEx this year is for maintenance projects, and it's within our 80% to 85% range of depreciation. The remaining capital is focused on our North American restructuring program and growth initiatives. The growth investments are concentrated in South America and Asia Pacific to keep up with increased demand. Overall, we believe our capital expenditures are prudent and in line with our profitable growth strategies. 
Also on the right, you can see our 2 largest strategic activities completed in the third quarter. The first is our acquisition of CIV in Northeast Brazil. Brazil represents the largest economy and glass container market in South America, so it is key for O-I. We already have a robust business and experienced management team in the southern region of the company. The CIV acquisition will provide a strong complement to our current franchise in Brazil and will allow us to serve many existing and new customers, who are expanding their operations in the northeast. 
CIV's 3 facilities will increase O-I's capacity in Brazil by 50%. O-I's total purchase price for CIV was $603 million, which included approximately $140 million for future tax benefits. The purchase price reflects a 5.8x EBITDA multiple based on 2011 forecasted EBITDA of $80 million. We expect that the CIV acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in 2011, and the return on investment of this business is well above O-I's cost of capital. 
The second strategic initiative was in early September. We issued EUR 500 million of 10-year senior notes at an interest rate of 6 3/4%. We are pleased that these bonds have been the most favorably priced offering in the European high-yield market, so far, this year. In addition to an attractive coupon rate and a tax-efficient structure, greater euro-denominated interest expense is a natural currency hedge for our European profits. The proceeds of the euro bonds will enable further strategic and profitable growth. 
Turning to Chart 8. You see our business outlook for the fourth quarter of 2010. We have provided the usual directional guidance on the key business drivers affecting earnings and cash flow. All trends are on a year-over-year basis comparing expected fourth quarter 2010 performance with the same period in 2009. As Al mentioned, the developments in Venezuela will likely negatively impact our fourth quarter results. However, the situation is very fluid, so our outlook does not include any potential impact from Venezuela. 
Now let me review each of the factors. Price and product mix. Similar to the third quarter, we expect prices in the fourth quarter to be flat with prior year levels. 
Sales volume. Clearly, we have struggled to identify the turning point with beer demand in mature markets. Beer consumption remains sluggish and has not improved significantly despite promotional efforts by our customers. Hence, we anticipate fourth quarter glass demand for beer in the U.S. and Europe will remain down from the prior year. However, we expect continued year-over-year growth in all other end-use categories. The net effect of these 2 trends is difficult to project. Depending on their relative movement, we can perceive fourth quarter sales volumes being 2% above or below prior year levels. 
Manufacturing and delivery. Higher capacity utilization should result in lower manufacturing and delivery costs compared to last year. Footprint savings should mostly offset cost inflation that is expected to be comparable to third quarter levels. 
Now on operating costs. Corporate costs will be higher than the fourth quarter of last year, mostly reflecting additional pension expense which we've seen every quarter in 2010. Also, net interest expense will increase approximately $15 million on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter due to higher debt to fund acquisitions. 
Furthermore, we are taking steps to curtail our spending plans, given lower-than-anticipated volumes in 2010. We have evaluated corporate expense, restructuring payments and working capital investments. We expect to reduce spending in these categories by $20 million to $30 million from our original expectations. 
Let me wrap up with a discussion on Venezuela. As I mentioned, the financial implications of expropriation remain unclear. Given this lack of clarity, I will provide some information about our Venezuelan operations to give you a sense of their scope relative to O-I in total. 
First, we've been operating in Venezuela for over 50 years, serving the country's food and beverage industry. I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the more than 1,000 employees at the 2 plants for all their hard work and dedication during these difficult times. O-I has a 75% ownership interest in our Venezuelan operations, with the remaining ownership held by a minority partner. Year-to-date, Venezuela accounted for approximately 3% of O-I global sales volume. The country represented just under 5% of segment operating profits and adjusted net earnings. 
Finally, O-I's net assets in Venezuela approximated 4% of O-I's total net assets as of September 30. We intend to provide regular and timely updates on this situation as information becomes available. 
Now I'll turn it back to Al for Chart 9."

Let me close with some comments on the financial targets that we introduced at our Investor Day in March of this year. Chart 9 highlights our net sales and segment operating profit margin goals for 2012. 
If you'll recall, we indicated our sales will grow between $9 billion and $9.5 billion, and our global segment operating profit margins will expand to 16% to 18% by the end of this 3-year period. And we continue to expect that this growth will be achieved equally through a recovering marketplace and mergers and acquisitions. 
Now that we are almost a third of the way into this 3-year period, we can say that we are pleased with our M&A progress. Through the third quarter, we have made 3 high-quality acquisitions, and more importantly, our M&A pipeline remains full, as we work to close more deals in the upcoming quarters. 
On the other hand, the rate of our overall market recovery has been inconsistent, robust in South America and China, but slower-than-anticipated in the mature markets. That said, we remain optimistic that a recovering marketplace in both Europe and North America should favorably impact the premium end-use segments that we serve. It is just going to take more time than we had originally expected, but it's still likely to be achieved within our original 3-year horizon. 
As the developments in Venezuela over the past few days show, events can change rapidly. But based on today's perspective, we remain confident that we are on the trajectory to reach our 3-year targets. And furthermore, O-I's strategic priorities remain unchanged to support those objectives.
And now, I will ask the operator to open the lines for your questions."

And in the beginning of the year, of course, we were still seeing some benefits of the deflation that was happening in the course of last year. But as we went through the third quarter, in particular, we saw that the impact of the U.S. dollar, which at that point in time was higher than the previous year or was impacting the price of Brent crude, which is quoted in U.S. dollars and the conversion to euros, and it was causing inflationary pressure. I think we also are looking at what's going to happen in the supply and demand situation with regard to soda ash, which of course, is a considerable cost line here. And I think everybody in the industry is seeing the same pressures, and therefore, I believe we will see a continued approach to the marketplace that is reflective of making sure that we pass through cost inflation appropriately to maintain our margins."

I believe as well that we need to have some flex to the upside, if demand picks up, because the worst thing we could do is shut down a furnace permanently, and then a half year from now need one. You can imagine that, that does not lead to a very good return on investment. So I think we have taken the steps that are necessary for the infrastructure to be appropriately designed for the demands that we're seeing at this point in time, and we have sufficient flex to the upside to really be able to partake in some of these growth without immediate demand or a significant demand on capital."

There is not a big consolidated operator at this point in time and place. I think the largest manufacturer may perhaps just be 1 or 2 percentage points from our market share as far as consolidated share is concerned. So it's going to be quite a number of acquisitions to eventually get to the targets that we have set ourselves.

I think the fact that our pipeline is full is indicative, of course, that people are looking at their role and their position in the marketplace and are coming to some conclusions that are different than they may have reached a year or 2 years ago. So clearly, some companies are a bit stressed at this point in time, but that very often is not really due to market conditions, it's much more due to financing structures that they have elected over the past. So that I think really explains a little bit that the pipeline is rather full at this point in time. With regard to the seller expectations, that, of course, is always the part of the discussion that takes the longest, because even though they have reached a conclusion that they couldn't possibly want to sell because they have understood that market conditions are changing or their own financial strength has changed. But they're still, of course, trying to tie the value to where the business was 3 years ago, and that is generally where we have to talk them down from. Our position when we look at acquisitions really is how quickly can we influence the operations and generate additional efficiencies, which is a significant part of the transaction value that we are willing to consider. The other part is, is it just a consolidation game or is it a consolidation end growth game, which of course, creates a different dynamic for the business, and that, of course, would also flow into the valuation that we're going to do. And then you'll see huge differences from region to region on the overall profitability. It's quite obvious that what we did in Brazil is very highly profit-generating and growing organization so you would typically be willing to put a higher value to that than in other markets, where it's just a consolidation game and where the only benefit you could get would be efficiencies."

In the other parts of the world, what you're seeing largely is also geographic mix. As we're growing much faster in Latin America, where prices tend to be higher than, for instance, in some of the other regions in Eastern Europe, that, of course, is going to influence the average price as well. So I would say you really get a true picture and a balanced picture of our pricing if you put the pricing in relation to the inflation that we're discussing.

And I think there have been quite a significant series of articles and analyses been done about the beer industry, which in the United States still is 50%, 60% of the volume. And what you are seeing and what we're hearing from the brewers is basically that, first of all, we saw clearly at the end of last year, the beginning of this year, a significant shift to value brands. Now the brewers are diminishing the differentiation in pricing between value brands and premium brands to push demand back up into the premium sector, because that apparently is a more attractive sector for them. And that was also reflected in the price increases that the brewers put in place in August and in September of this year. But what we're hearing as well is that there is now a trend where the consumers are buying more premium brands rather than value brands. We're seeing some shift there. And clearly, throughout this entire period of economic hardship, we've seen a bifurcation of the market between the, let's say, age groups up to 35 and 35 and beyond, and you see that reflected in micro-brewers doing extremely well. You see that reflected in wine doing very well, you see that reflected in spirits doing reasonably well. So I think you really have a bifurcation also of some of the demand at this point in time. So it really requires us to look at it very individualistically as to what's happening. But at least the comments that I'm hearing is that the brewers felt confident enough in the demand cycle, that the demand wouldn't drop off further to raise prices. And I think that's a pretty good sign going forward."

And when we came into this year, we said that the beginning of this year, that we would expect the absolute profitability of North America to be equal to the profitability that we have achieved in the previous year, despite the impending volume impact that we were going to see from the pricing. So I think for us, overall, this really means that the strategy that we have put in place is working, and the benefits that we're going to see in the fourth quarter in the United States again are mainly coming from what we did last year compared to this year with regard to volume and utilization and manufacturing and operations, where we had a very high degree of unabsorbed fixed costs last year which we will not see this year."
