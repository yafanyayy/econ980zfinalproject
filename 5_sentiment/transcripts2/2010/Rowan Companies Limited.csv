I'm going to make a few brief comments and then turn it over to Mark Keller who will discuss the rig markets. And then turn it over to Bill Wells for more financial detail before opening the call for Q&A.We reported today that our fourth 2009 earnings were $61 million or $0.52 per share of clean earnings, beating consensus estimates by $0.02. For the full year, we earned $367.5 million or $3.24 a share. Rowan organization executed at a very high level in 2009, despite the sharpest downturn worldwide drilling activities since the early 80s. We have the best safety record in the company's history, significantly reduced operating expenses, put delivery of our latest new build jack-up the Ralph Coffman ahead of schedule and below budget, took advantage of idle time on several of our older rigs to make some upgrades and life enhancements.As Mark will relate in more detail, during the last few months, we've seen improving activity and tendering in virtually every jack-up market with Middle East, North Sea and Gulf of Mexico regions, being the most significant for our fleet. Continue to see good demand for higher specification jack-ups during the last quarter, and so far in 2010. We've added some very attractive backlog on our Super Gorillas. We put the Coffman to work for McMoRan and contracted with them to the Rowan-Louisiana, as well as our first DXO [ph] when it comes out of the shipyard.On that note, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate McMoRan and their partners on their very exciting discovery with the Davy Jones well drilled by the Rowan-Mississippi. This well and the wells this group will be drilling to delineate and develop their ultra-deep shelf gas opportunities are excellent examples of the move we're seeing across jack-up market toward more demand in drilling, requiring higher specification drilling equipment which of course, plays to our strengths. We're seeing it in tenders for harsh environment wells in the North Sea along where each [ph]  horizontal drilling in Qatar in high-pressure high-temperature wells in several markets. Industry jack-up utilization currently stands at 75%, which has been increasing but it is still below the level necessary in any single market to allow rig rates to move higher. However, it's important to understand that many of those idle jack-ups are not competitive with our higher specification rigs, which compete in markets where supply and demand are in better balance, and which are all currently contracted. Also while there are approximately 60 new build jack-ups on order for delivery in the next two to three years, many analysts expect that about half of those will go to uncompetitive markets or not be built. It should improve the markets' ability to absorb the additional competitive units.I think an interesting analog demonstrating the ability to increase utilization in day rates of high-end rigs in an otherwise oversupplied market, is what's going on in the land-rig market. Despite the active land rig count being nearly 1,000 rigs below where it peaked to 2008, we put several over our land rigs back to work over the past few months, and leading-edge day rates have increased by over 50% for our lightning class rigs. Clearly, this is because clients are selecting more capable equipment that can drill and move faster, rather than just focusing on just value [ph]. And we believe the same basic dynamic is underway as operators look for jack-ups back to work.With regard to our Manufacturing businesses, we've seen a recovery in demand in the Mining segment, where we build and sell the industry's largest front loaders and have leading market share. We've also seen increased interest from several markets outside the U.S. for new land drilling equipment. It's too early to point to a cyclical upturn for drilling equipment, but it's certainly feels like we've come off bottom in that segment of our business.We hired, Tom Burke as CEO for LeTourneau in December and are making important progress in improving our manufacturing efficiencies, and enhancing the competitive design advantages in LTI's product line. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark who will give you more detail on the drilling market."

Our offshore fleet of 23 jack-ups is currently contracted at 78% utilization, with an average day rate of approximately $186,000. We are encouraged by the increased tender activity over the past few months, and the term contracts we've secured recently. 15 of our 23 rigs are located in international markets, nine in the Middle East, two in the North Sea, one in West Africa, one in Eastern Canada, one in Mexico and one in Egypt. Our remaining eight jack-ups are located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Continuing our efforts to further diversify our fleet internationally, we're establishing a marketing office in Kuala Lumpur to cover the South East Asia, India and Australian markets.These areas in Malaysia and Vietnam in particular, will demand higher spec, HP HT jack-ups, and Rowan is preparing to take advantage of those opportunities. As I mentioned, the recent tender activity has been strong, and we're currently seeing demand for approximately 40 jack-ups in regions such as the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Eastern Canada, Central and South America, the North Sea, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, India, Southeast Asia. We anticipate at least 20 additional tenders inbound over the next couple of months. We remain optimistic, while acknowledging the significant amount of contract expirations for 2010, as well as the uncontracted new builds entering the market.According to the ODS-Petrodata, there are currently 459 jack-ups worldwide, demand is 343 rigs with utilization at 75%. It appears that the bottom of the cycle is behind us as worldwide utilization has been on a slow but steady increase from 71% in August of 2009. Fortunately for Rowan, utilization of day rates for premium jack-ups are stronger. 300-foot independent leg cantilever and above are currently contracted at 82% utilization with high-spec rigs contracted at 93%. We believe that the industry has experienced a hydrating of the fleet, as operators worldwide are demanding more stringent drilling requirements. Rowan maintains one of the youngest and most technologically-advanced fleets in the world, and we are poised to greatly benefit from this market shift. I will now address our areas of operations. Let's begin with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Supplying in the region is 80 jack-ups, while demand is 39 rigs for a utilization of 49%. We have eight jack-ups domestically, with the contracted utilization of 88% and an average day rate of approximately $145,000.  As Matt noted, we are thrilled to be a part of McMoRan's ultra-deep gas discovery on Davy Jones, and we are pleased to announced that we have contracted two additional jack-ups with them, bringing the total to four. In addition to the Rowan-Mississippi and the Ralph Coffman already working for McMoRan, Rowan-Louisiana will drill the Buoham [ph] prospect, beginning next month for approximately 180 days in the mid-50s. Our new build EXL # 1 will also commence operations for McMoRan upon its delivery from the shipyard in early May 2010, in the mid-70s.We previously recorded that the EXL 1 was committed in the low-160s beginning in August 2010, acknowledging the growing importance of the McMoRan relationship we have since agreed to reduce that day rate to the low-140s effective in early August, as a part of a multi-well package related to the projects mentioned above. We're optimistic that the Davy Jones discovery will lead to a significant increase in deep drilling on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico shelf in the years to come.Now turning to the North Sea. Supply is 36 jack-ups, while demand is 32 rigs. And contracted utilization is 89%. Rowan currently has two super-drilling fast jack-ups operating in the area. And the Gorilla VII, we're mobilizing to the region of components completion of the Cabinda Gulf contract in West Africa. As recently announced, the Gorilla VII is contracted to Apache U.K. for approximately 18 months of work in the low-180s. The Gorilla V continues its contract with TOTAL, and we recently signed an extension with TOTAL to keep the rig busy through May 2011. The Gorilla VI remains on location in Norway with BG until July 2010. At which point, it is anticipated to mobilize back to the U.K. sector to drill an additional well for BG U.K. in the low-200s.Even though the standard jack-up market in the North Sea remains soft, the high-spec market is one of the most active in terms of tenders, and we are aggressively pursuing multiple projects. Despite several highly capably units stacked in the region, our Super Gorillas continues to secure attractive term contracts at above-average day rates.Moving onto the Middle East. The supply in this region is 118 jack-ups, while demand is currently at 93 rigs, and contracted utilization is 79%. Rowan has nine jack-ups in the Middle East. Five of our units are contracted, and the remaining four are currently completing life enhancement modifications and upgrades in the shipyard. As previously announced, Rowan to Rowan-California has received an LOI from Wintershall for a three-well project beginning in May 2010, in the mid-70s, which we currently consider a leading-edge day rate in the region for that class of jack-up. Although all available jack-ups are being tendered worldwide, we are confident that we will secure additional contracts in the Middle East in the near future. Like the North Sea, the Middle East had seen a significant increase in tender activity over the last 90 days, leaving multiple requirements from Saudi Arabia. To briefly summarize the remainder of our fleet, the Gorilla III is in Eastern Canada, and commence operations within Canada in late fourth quarter 2009, in the mid-280s. And it's expected to complete its drilling project in September 2010. The J.P. Bussell continues its contract with Shell in Egypt in the low-180s through May 2011. As mentioned, the Gorilla VII will complete operations with Cabinda Gulf in West Africa during the second quarter of this year, and will mobilize to the North Sea for Apache U.K. And finally, the Gorilla IV continues operations with PEMEX, and is contracted through July 2011. As the industry is well aware, we have anticipated additional tenders from PEMEX for more than six months. All indications are that they will tender for five jack-ups in the first round of tenders. However, we have yet to receive a firm tender date.And finally, I will cover our Onshore division. We have a marketed fleet of 29 land rigs located in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alaska. Currently, 79% of our fleet is contracted at an average day rate of approximately $20,000. 87% of our contracted fleet is operating in the U.S. shale and gas plays, including the Haynesville and Deep Bossier. We target these areas due to the operating requirements for 2004's power high-spec rigs that can drill these challenging wells. The land-rig market continues to gain momentum, and we anticipate that our marketed fleet will be 100% utilized beginning sometime early this summer. This concludes our market overview, I will now turn the call over to Bill Wells."

Starting with our drilling operations. Our fourth quarter 2009 revenues were $255 million, down by 34% from the prior year, and by 1% from last quarter. With both decreases resulting from reduced Gulf of Mexico",1550,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our drilling operations. Our fourth quarter 2009 revenues were $255 million, down by 34% from the prior year, and by 1% from last quarter. With both decreases resulting from reduced Gulf of Mexico and Middle East drilling activity between periods, partially offset by our recent startups in Egypt, Mexico and Norway. In the fourth quarter, we experienced unplanned downtime related to equipment repairs and inspections on Gorilla's III, VI and VII, which collectively reduced drilling revenues by almost $20 million during the period. Our full year 2009 drilling revenues exceeded $1.2 billion, a 16% decrease from 2008, as lower average utilization more than offset the impact of net fleet additions between periods.As of February 16, the date of our most recent fleet status update, our backlog of drilling contracts totaled approximately $1.3 billion. We expected about 70% of that amount will be realized as revenue during the remainder of 2010. 25% will occur in 2011, and the balance in 2012 and beyond.  Our fourth quarter drilling expenses of $122 million were 17% below the prior year, virtually unchanged from last quarter and well below our previous guidance, despite the startup in drilling operations in Egypt and Norway, and a full-quarter of activity in Mexico. The year-over-year reduction was primarily in labor and related personnel costs through optimization of accrued levels on active rigs and manning reductions on idle rigs. In addition, several shipyard upgrade projects absorbed certain personal-related costs, and defrayed maintenance expenses for many of our idle rigs.Despite fleet additions and 6% more available rig days in 2009, our full year drilling expenses were 17% or more than $100 million below 2008 levels, due largely to the factors mentioned previously. We will add two full rigs years to our offshore fleet 2010, and expect to reactivate certain U.S. land rigs during the year, which will collectively result in an estimated 21% increase in operating days over 2009. Thus, we expect an activity-led increase in drilling expenses in 2010 of 13% to approximately $595 million for the year. That number assumes a nominal increase in insurance costs in 2010. It's too early to know what coverage we'll end up buying upon our April 1, renewal or what that coverage will cost. We will provide an update on our next quarterly call to the extent that our actual experience differs material from that estimate.We expect that our first quarter 2010 drilling expenses to be in the range of $137 million to $140 million. The sequential increase is due to the reactivation of certain rigs, the conclusion of most rig-upgrade projects, the startup of the Ralph Coffman and a full quarter of activity for Gorilla VI in Norway. Turning to our manufacturing operations. Our fourth quarter revenues has totaled $231 million, including $86 million of arm's-length sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $145 million, an increase of 7% over the last quarter, but down by 36% from the prior year. Our Drilling Products and Systems segment contributed $184 million or 80% of total revenues, including sales to our Drilling division.  External revenues were $98 million and featured $51 million from rig projects, $18 million from power systems and components, and another $13 million from drilling equipment.Our mining, forestry and steel products revenues totaled $47 million, including $13 million from shipments of mining and forestry equipment and $9 million from steel plate. Margins are heavily impacted by sales mix, with aftermarket margins typically higher than those for original equipment. Earlier in 2009, our overall manufacturing margins were adversely impacted by loss as realized on certain land-rig projects, which had also contributed a larger share of revenues. Our performance improved in the fourth quarter when land rig and kit revenues totaled $22 million and provided a high-teens gross margin, as compared to $36 million and no margin in the third quarter.We shipped two of our largest and most profitable mining loaders, the L-2350 during the fourth quarter, bringing the total to three units for the full year. Our combined aftermarket parts and service revenues, specifically averaged low- to mid-40s gross margins, were $31 million during the fourth quarter compared to $30 million in the third quarter, and a record $126 million for the full year. Our overall operating margin was 17% of manufacturing revenues during the fourth quarter, down from 25% in the prior year but up from 13% last quarter, with the sequential increase due primarily to more favorable sales mix and better results on land-rig projects.At year-end 2009, our manufacturing backlog totaled $675 million, which was down by about 14% during the fourth quarter. The external backlog of $413 million, included $217 million related to offshore-rig projects, $71 million related to land-rig projects, $67 million of mining and forestry equipment and $29 million of drilling equipment, with the remainder primarily parts and other components. Our estimated backlog at risk totaled $15 million, or less than 4% of our external backlog at December 31.We booked approximately $118 million of new orders in the fourth quarter, or 82% of external revenues during the period, with mining equipment contributing 1/2 of the total. We currently expect to ship 21 mining loaders in 2010, up from 14 machines shipped in 2009 with a likely mix increasing our average gross margins on mining equipment in the low-20s in 2009 to the mid-20s in 2010. Almost all of our external manufacturing backlog, at year-end 2009, should be realized as revenues in 2010. And we expect another record year in the aftermarket. In 2009, our manufacturing operations generated $5 million of external revenues, and an average 14% of operating margin. For 2010, we expected revenues will be flat to slightly up when compared to 2009. And with a more favorable sales mix, our overall average margin should increase to the upper teens.Carrying value of our investment in Pittsburgh Mississippi shipyard and related inventories, totaled approximately $60 million at year-end 2009. We currently have no further plans for rig construction there following the delivery of the Joe Douglas in 2011. Absent additional orders or sufficient prospects for future work, the activities at the facility would be significantly reduced at that time, in which case, we would incur additional costs, such as employee severance among other charges. Closing our significantly reducing activity levels at the facility could result in cash charges ranging from $5 million to $6 million, and non-cash charges ranging from $7 million to $10 million.Our fourth quarter depreciation expense totaled approximately $45 million, which slightly exceeded our previous guidance and was up 2% from last quarter, and 16% over last year, primarily due to rig fleet additions in late 2008 and 2009. For the full year, depreciation totaled $171 million, up by 21% over last year. Our latest estimate for 2010 depreciation is in the range of $185 million to $188 million, including approximately $46 million to $47 million in the first quarter. Our fourth quarter SG&A expenses totaled $29 million, unchanged from last year, but up by 22% over last quarter and $2 million more than our previous guidance, due primarily to incremental incentive compensation costs, hired professional fees related to tax planning and additional bad debt provisions. For the full year, SG&A totaled $103 million, down by 11% from last year, due to headcount reductions in our manufacturing operations and other cost-cutting initiatives. Geographic expansion of our drilling operations is requiring more sales and administrative support, and we currently expect an increase in 2010 SG&A expenses to a range of $113 million to $115 million for the year, including approximately $27 million to $28 million for the first quarter.Following our July debt offering, interest expense net of interest capitalized was $4.1 million during the fourth quarter and just over $8 million for the year. Assuming no new borrowings, our 2010 interest expense should be in the range of $50 million to $51 million, about 1/2 of which should be capitalized. As noted in our press release, our 2009 results were aided by favorable tax adjustment that filed from a recent third-party tax case. Applying the rulings in that case, yield an estimated $25 million net tax benefit and a five percentage point reduction in our effective tax rate in 2009 to a level below 27%. Looking ahead, we currently expect an annual rate of approximately 30% in 2010. Property and equipment additions totaled $183 million in the fourth quarter, which included $16 million for our second and third 240C jack-ups, $84 million to our four EXL jack-ups and $69 million for our existing fleet including contractually required upgrades.At year-end 2009, we had approximately $500 million remaining to be spent under our newbuild program over the next three years, 2/3 of which is expected to occur in 2010. Our 2010 capital budget has been set at approximately $501 million and includes $106 million towards the Joe Douglas, $231 million for the EXL jack-ups and $119 million for existing rigs, including contractually required upgrades. The remaining $45 million includes the cost of drill pipe, needed improvements to our manufacturing facilities inshore basis and other enhancements. We currently intend to fully fund our capital program through existing cash or operating cash flows. That concludes our prepared remarks. With Diego's assistance, we will now open it up to questions."

If it's a longer-term contract, obviously, I think the rates would go up. If an operator needs a 350 rig or we would add leg back on those 116s and use the full capability, I could see the day rates going up. We have actually tendered those rigs at higher levels than we've been awarded jobs in the Middle East currently. So there are a lot of tenders out right now, Judd, that I think in the, probably the next 30 to 45, 60 days, you're going to get a lot of data points that when jobs are awarded. The market went for a long time before there were any new fixtures, so our contractors could really get a fix on what the market was really doing. And there were some odd numbers in the Middle East, 54 in TOTAL, and some of those, those were the first rates that came out and the rest of them are priced options in their regions. So it gives you kind of a distorted view. But I think that the 116s will certainly hold at their level, and probably, move up some in the Middle East. That's what I'm seeing right now, because of what we stated earlier, Judd, that people are definitely high-grading their fleets. And that's why we took our rigs into the yard and we did some upgrades on them. Our standard 116s were even getting maxed out in Qatar with Maersk. And they're way ahead of a lot of the standard commodity rigs that are working in that area. So finally, we think that there's a good opportunity to put them to work. We have a great reputation and our operations group do a great job. So we're optimistic about putting the work into a little bit higher rate than where [indiscernible] ."

First, let me express condolences from all of us at Rowan to the families and co-workers of the crew members lost and injured in the Horizon incident. While offshore drilling has one of the strongest safety cultures and records of any industry, this incident is a stark reminder of the immense forces we deal with in our daily activity. Safety of our people and protection of the environment are two of the highest priorities for Rowan. We get very strong support from our customers in our efforts to achieve injury- and incident-free operation.
Turning to offshore drilling, we had a strong first quarter, operationally. Revenues were helped by our best uptime percentage in several quarters, and we managed our costs well during the quarter. We continue to be pleased by the level of interest we're seeing for our high-spec jack-ups in several markets around the world. Utilization in that category of jack-ups was [ph] 2 million pounds for greater hook load, was at 93% for the industry, but 100% for Rowan. We've also seen utilization for the 350-foot-or-greater premium jack-ups reached 90% supporting our belief that tenders are consistently requiring higher-level capabilities.
Some of that utilization has come at the expense of the rigs in the 300-foot category where utilization is currently 79%. This high grading of equipment by our customers along with new capacity coming into the premium into the market has kept day rates for the 350-foot jack-ups from moving significantly higher. As noted in our last call, we delivered our second 240C jack-up at Ralph Coffman at the end of last year. And that rig had a great start-up in the first quarter working for McMoRan.
This past weekend, we christened our first new EXL high-spec jack-up, which will also soon begin drilling for McMoRan. That rig was on time and on budget as are the remaining four high-spec jack-ups we have under construction. 
Our Land division continues to see good demand, and we believe we will shortly sign contracts on three of our four remaining uncontracted market land rig. Our manufacturing company, LeTourneau Technologies, had a mixed quarter. Margins were in line with expectations, but revenues were negatively impacted by delays in the shipments of both the land rig package and a loader that were expected in the first quarter but will now occur in the second quarter.
Also after a rigorous review of both the condition and rate of consumption of our substantial inventory, we determined that a reduction in the carrying value of inventory was appropriate. Bill will give you more details on that in his comments, but I would note that as the non-cash charge, it does not reduce our optimism about the future for Letourneau.
And finally, I'd like to say that despite some recent headlines following a couple of press interviews I gave, there has been no material change in the strategy we've been discussing with you over the past year nor in our thoughts on timing. We continue to be strategically focused on growing the offshore drilling side of our business. We'll consider the possible separation of the manufacturing and land drilling operations when market conditions for those businesses are such that we feel we can get good value for our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a review of the [indiscernible]market."

Our offshore fleet of 24 jack-ups is currently contracted at 79% utilization with an average day rate of approximately $171,000. 15 of our 24 rigs are located in international markets: nine in the Middle East, two in the North Sea, one in We",1008,"Thanks, Matt. Our offshore fleet of 24 jack-ups is currently contracted at 79% utilization with an average day rate of approximately $171,000. 15 of our 24 rigs are located in international markets: nine in the Middle East, two in the North Sea, one in West Africa, one in Eastern Canada, one in Mexico and one in Egypt. The remaining nine jack-ups are located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico including the EXL #1 delivered this weekend. As I mentioned in the last call, we have established a marketing presence in Kuala Lumpur. We’re positioning the company to take advantage of the higher spec HPHT requirements in the Southeast Asia region.
Tender and inquiry activity has improved in 2010, and we are currently seeing open demand for more than 40 jack-ups in regions such as the U.S., Gulf of Mexico, Central and South America, Mexico, the North Sea, the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia.
While we are encouraged by the increased demand, we do not anticipate a significant increase in day rates until some of these tenders have been awarded and more of the excess capacity has been absorbed. The market has remained relatively steady since our last earnings call in March. According to ODS-Petrodata, there are currently 460 jack-ups worldwide. Demand is 350 rigs with utilization at 76%, the highest it's been since May 2009.
As Matt mentioned, utilization for 350 independent-leg cantilever jack-ups and greater is at 90%. For this class of rig, day rate fixtures over the last six months are averaging 122,000 per day, approximately 38,500 per day higher than the 300-foot independent-leg cantilevers currently in the market.
63% of Rowan's jack-ups are in the 350-foot-or-greater classification, and we will continue to benefit from the high grading of the worldwide fleet that the industry is currently experiencing.
I will now address our areas of operation. Let's begin with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Supplying the region is 81 jack-ups while demand is 42 rigs for a utilization of 52%. This is the first time the U.S. Gulf has been above 50% since March of 2009. We have nine jack-ups in the region with a contracted utilization of 89% and an average day rate of approximately $129,000 [indiscernible]. The EXL #1 will begin operations in mid May, and we are pleased to expand our relationship with McMoRan and their partners by adding another jack-up to their deep-gas drilling program.
The Davy Jones discovery has potential to trigger a resurgence of activity on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico shipment. While geographic diversity is still an important part of our overall strategy, we remain focused on meeting the domestic deep-gas demands with our high-spec fleet of [ph] jack-ups.
Regarding the remainder of our domestic fleet, we’re in constant communication with operators working through the issues of the upcoming hurricane season to maximize utilization of our commodity rigs in the region. With respect to the Horizon incident, all of our rigs are located west of the oil spill, and we do not expect our operations to be affected by the clean-up efforts.
To briefly mention Mexico, we have received PEMEX extenders for five independent lake cantilever jack-ups, three 300-footers, one 350 and one 250. All tenders but the 250 are required to be less than 10 years of age or have undergone major modifications during that same time period. We believe this puts Rowan’s gem fleet [ph] in a strong competitive position in this bidding process. We are actively participating and hopeful to mobilize additional rigs into the region to join the Gorilla IV currently working for PEMEX.
Moving on to the North Sea. Supply is 37 jack-ups, while demand is 32 rigs and contracted utilization is 86%. Despite the softness in the region for standard jack-ups the marketed utilization for 350 independent-leg cantilever jack-ups or greater is 100%. Rowan currently has two Super Gorilla class jack-ups operating in the area and as previously reported the Gorilla VII will mobilize into the region on its completion of Cabinda Gulf contract in West Africa to commence operations for Apache U.K. All three jack-ups are contracted through second quarter 2011. Rowan is actively tendering for additional prospect projects in the North Sea.
Now turning to the Middle East. The supply in this region is 119 jack-ups, while demand is currently at 90 rigs and contracted utilization is 76%. 16 of the available units for 300-foot independent-leg cantilever is greater, resulting in strong competition for outstanding tenders. Rowan has nine jack-ups in the Middle East. Five units are currently contracted at an average day rate of $143,000 and the Rowan-California will commence operation for Wintershall later this quarter.
Saudi Aramco currently has outstanding tenders for two gas rigs and two workover rigs. Rowan is being considered for all projects and we are encouraged about the opportunity to continue our relationship with Saudi Aramco. The remainder of our fleet is relatively unchanged since our last call. The Gorilla III is in Eastern Canada on contract within Canada, the J.P. Bussell continues its contract with Shell in Egypt and the Gorilla IV continues operation with PEMEX. The Gorilla VII contract in the Cabinda Gulf has been extended in West Africa for additional well at $315,000 per day.
The well is expected to last approximately 85 days before the unit mobilizes to the North Sea for Apache U.K. in late summer. And finally, I'll mention our Onshore division. We have a marketed fleet of 30 land rigs located in Texas and Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alaska. Currently 87% of our fleet is contracted at an average day rate of approximately $20,000. 88% of our contracted fleet is operating in the U.S. shale and gas plays, including the Haynesville and Deep Bossier. Rowan currently has the deepest average well depth of approximately 16,000 feet, proving that our customers recognize that our fleet of high spec land rigs is designed to meet the operational challenges presented by deeper or more difficult wells.
This concludes our market overview. I will now turn the call over to Bill Wells."
300794,100860164,59392,"Rowan Companies Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-04-2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As noted in our press release our results for $0.56 per share, after an inventory charge of $42 million or $0.25 per share related to non-conforming and slow-moving items in Letourneau's Drilling Products and S",1380,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As noted in our press release our results for $0.56 per share, after an inventory charge of $42 million or $0.25 per share related to non-conforming and slow-moving items in Letourneau's Drilling Products and Systems segment. During the past two months LTI's new management team performed a thorough bottom-up assessment of the Houston-based inventory of drilling components and parts. As a result we determined that a significant number of items have experienced some level of deterioration, such as they are out-of-tolerance with original specifications or no longer conform to minimum quality standards. Full provision has been made to the cost of items that cannot be efficiently reworked, and we have taken steps to avoid any further physical deterioration.
In addition, notwithstanding increased quotation activity for land rig packages, we have thus far in 2010 continued to work off existing drilling products backlog. The quantity and age of slow-moving inventory items has continued to grow in 2010, a trend that we currently expect will continue for the foreseeable future. Thus, we have recorded an additional provision to reflect reduced recoverable value of slow-moving inventory. While this provision reflects our best estimate at this time, it does not in most cases provide a 100% reserve against the slow-moving items. The total charge was almost 15% of LTI's drilling equipment inventories and was spread across all major product line. 
Turning to our drilling operations, our first quarter 2010 revenues were $331 million, down by 13% in the prior year, but up by 30% in last quarter, both changes driven primarily by fleet utilization. The addition of the Ralph Coffman in early January of this year contributed to the sequential increase.
The first quarter also benefited from above market rates temporarily obtained by two of our Gulf of Mexico slot rigs as part of a contract work out on a third rig. As this above market arrangement will be fully concluded by mid-May, these two rigs will experience a reduction in revenues during the second quarter. However, we expect that this impact will likely be substantially offset by the aggregate affects of the Ralph Coffman, delivery of our first EXL class rig and increased land rig activity.
As of April 21, the date of our most recent fleet status update, our backlog of drilling contracts totaled approximately $1.2 billion. We expect that approximately 63% of that amount will be realized as revenue during the remainder of 2010, 31% will occur in 2011 and the balance in 2012 or beyond. Our first quarter drilling expenses of $137 million were 6% below the prior year, 12% above last quarter and that the low end of our previous guidance. Year-over-year reduction was primarily in maintenance and reimbursable costs, whereas the sequential increase resulted from the reactivation of certain rigs, the conclusion of most rig upgrade projects, the startup of the Ralph Coffman and a full quarter of activity for Gorilla VI in Norway.
We expect that our second quarter 2010 drilling expenses will be in the range of $145 million to $150 million with a sequential quarter increase due to the expected reactivation of certain rigs and the startup of the EXL #1. We’re holding off our full year 2010 estimate of drilling expenses at approximately $595 million, with the year-over-year increase due largely to the factors mentioned previously.
Turning to our Manufacturing operations, our first quarter revenues totaled $147 million, including $46 million of arms length sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $101 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year and 30% from last quarter. The Drilling Products and Systems segment contributed $96 million or 65% of total revenues, including sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $50 million and featured 23 million from offshore rig projects, and $15 million from land rigs and $4 million from drilling equipment.
Our Mining, Forestry and Steel products revenues totaled $51 million, including $15 million from shipments of mining equipment and $10 million from steel plate. We shipped three mining loaders during the first quarter, including one each of our large L-2350 and L-1850 units. We've seen an increase in quotations in bookings and have a total of 16 units in our March 31 backlog. We expect to ship 21 units in 2010, up from 14 units in 2009.
Our combined aftermarket parts and service revenues were $30 million during the first quarter, down by 12% from the prior year, but unchanged from last quarter. Our average operating margin was 17% of Manufacturing revenues during the first quarter, down from 21% the prior year, but unchanged from last quarter. At March 31 our external manufacturing backlog of $392 million, included $185 million related to offshore rig projects, $63 million related to land rig projects, $65 million of mining equipment, $28 million of drilling equipment, with the remainder primarily parts and other components.
We booked approximately $79 million of new orders in the first quarter or 78% of external revenues during the period over of one-half of which was mining products. Our estimated backlog-at-risk remained at $15 million or less than 4% of our external backlog at March 31, 2010.
We expect that approximately 90% of our external manufacturing backlog at March 31 will be realized as revenues in 2010. We indicated earlier this year that we expected 2010 external revenues to be flat to slightly up, when compared to 2009, and that average operating margins would increase to the upper teens.  We continue to believe that these results are obtainable.
As previously mentioned, we have no further plans for reconstruction at our Vicksburg, Mississippi shipyard following delivery of the Joe Douglas in 2011. Absent additional orders or sufficient prospects for future work, the activities at the facility will be significantly reduced at that time, in which case we would incur additional costs, such as employee severance among other charges.
Closing our significantly risking activity levels at the facility could result in cash charges ranging from $5 million to $6 million and non-cash charges ranging from $7 million $10 million. The carrying value of our investment in the facility and related inventories totaled approximately $51 million at March 31.
Our first quarter depreciation expense totaled $46 million, which tracked our previous guidance and was up by 12% over last year and by 2% over last quarter, primarily due to the rig fleet additions. Our latest estimate for 2010 depreciation is in the range of $185 million to $188 million, including approximately $46 million to $47 million in the second quarter.
Our first quarter SG&A expenses totaled $26 million up by 5% from last year, but down by 12% from last quarter and below our previous guidance, primarily due to fluctuations in incentive compensation costs and professional fees related to tax planning. Our latest estimate for 2010 costs is in the range of $116 million to $118 million for the year, including approximately $30 million to $31 million in the second quarter.
Interest expense net of interest capitalized was $5.7 million during the quarter, assuming no new borrowings our 2010 interest expense should be in the range of $51 million to $52 million, about one-half of which would be capitalized. Our first quarter and expected full year effective tax rate is approximately 31%.
Property and equipment additions totaled $103 million in the first quarter, which included $18 million for a third 240C jack-up, $61 million for the four EXL rigs and $18 million for existing fleet, including contractually required upgrades. At March 31, we had approximately $425 million remaining to be spent under our newbuild program over the next three years, 62% of which is expected to recur in 2010, followed by 31% to 2011 and the balance in 2012.
Our [audio gap] 2010 capital expenditures are projected at approximately $408 million, including $82 million towards the Joe Douglas, $180 million for the EXL jack-ups and $105 million for existing rigs, including contractually required upgrades. The remaining $41 million includes the cost of drill pipe, needed improvements to our manufacturing facilities and shore basins, and other enhancements. We currently intend to fully fund our capital program through existing cash or operating cash flows.
That concludes our prepared remarks. With Everett’s assistance we will now open it up for questions."

We've got a long history of safe operations as does the whole industry. It’s been by various counts somewhere around 40,000 wells drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the first spill in my memory of any consequence and very unusual circumstances. There's been a lot of uncertainty, but. So we are just refocusing our people on all of our policies and practices. We feel like everybody's going to be pretty well set because they've handled it before. Now I do expect that they’ll be additional regulatory oversight for maybe -- even additional testing procedures or something like that, that could follow along. I’ve read some accounts to that effect. But I don't really see -- certainly, it's going to, well, in my opinion, I shouldn’t say, certainly. I expect that it will slow down if not stop them from opening up any additional areas to drilling. But for Rowan that’s not of much consequence because we believe that the areas that have been opened are the areas that have the best opportunities for our high-spec jack-ups. So we don't really think that sort of opportunity extends to the Eastern Gulf anyway. So from our perspective, we're not really expecting much more. We think the primary outcome will be more regulatory attention there."

First, let me express condolences from all of us at Rowan to the families and co-workers of the crew members lost and injured in the Horizon incident. While offshore drilling has one of the strongest safety cultures and records of any industry, this incident is a stark reminder of the immense forces we deal with in our daily activity. Safety of our people and protection of the environment are two of the highest priorities for Rowan. We get very strong support from our customers in our efforts to achieve injury- and incident-free operation.
Turning to offshore drilling, we had a strong first quarter, operationally. Revenues were helped by our best uptime percentage in several quarters, and we managed our costs well during the quarter. We continue to be pleased by the level of interest we're seeing for our high-spec jack-ups in several markets around the world. Utilization in that category of jack-ups of 2 million pounds for greater hook load was at 93% for the industry, but 100% for Rowan. We've also seen utilization for the 350-foot-or-greater premium jack-ups reach 90%, supporting our belief that tenders are consistently requiring higher-level capabilities.
Some of that utilization has come at the expense of the rigs in the 300-foot category where utilization is currently 79%. This high grading of equipment by our customers along with new capacity coming into the premium into the market has kept day rates for the 350-foot jack-ups from moving significantly higher. As noted in our last call, we delivered our second 240C jack-up at Ralph Coffman at the end of last year. And that rig had a great start-up in the first quarter working for McMoRan.
This past weekend, we christened our first new EXL high-spec jack-up, which will also soon begin drilling for McMoRan. That rig was on time and on budget as are the remaining four high-spec jack-ups we have under construction. 
Our Land division continues to see good demand, and we believe we will shortly sign contracts on three of our four remaining uncontracted market land rigs. Our manufacturing company, LeTourneau Technologies, had a mixed quarter. Margins were in line with expectations, but revenues were negatively impacted by delays in the shipments of both the land rig package and a loader that were expected in the first quarter but will now occur in the second quarter.
Also after a rigorous review of both the condition and rate of consumption of our substantial inventory, we determined that a reduction in the carrying value of inventory was appropriate. Bill will give you more details on that in his comments, but I would note that as a non-cash charge, it does not reduce our optimism about the future for Letourneau.
And finally, I'd like to say that despite some recent headlines following a couple of press interviews I gave, there has been no material change in the strategy we've been discussing with you over the past year nor in our thoughts on timing. We continue to be strategically focused on growing the offshore drilling side of our business. We'll consider the possible separation of the manufacturing and land drilling operations when market conditions for those businesses are such that we feel we can get good value for our shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a review of the rig market."

Our offshore fleet of 24 jack-ups is currently contracted at 79% utilization with an average day rate of approximately $171,000. 15 of our 24 rigs are located in international markets: Nine in the Middle East, two in the North Sea, one in We",1007,"Thanks, Matt. Our offshore fleet of 24 jack-ups is currently contracted at 79% utilization with an average day rate of approximately $171,000. 15 of our 24 rigs are located in international markets: Nine in the Middle East, two in the North Sea, one in West Africa, one in Eastern Canada, one in Mexico and one in Egypt. The remaining nine jack-ups are located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including the EXL #1 delivered this weekend. As I mentioned in the last call, we have established a marketing presence in Kuala Lumpur. We’re positioning the company to take advantage of the higher spec HPHT requirements in the Southeast Asia region.
Tender and inquiry activity has improved in 2010, and we are currently seeing open demand for more than 40 jack-ups in regions such as the U.S., Gulf of Mexico, Central and South America, Mexico, the North Sea, the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia.
While we are encouraged by the increased demand, we do not anticipate a significant increase in day rates until some of these tenders have been awarded and more of the excess capacity has been absorbed. The market has remained relatively steady since our last earnings call in March. According to ODS-Petrodata, there are currently 460 jack-ups worldwide. Demand is 350 rigs with utilization at 76%, the highest it's been since May 2009.
As Matt mentioned, utilization for 350 independent-leg cantilever jack-ups and greater is at 90%. For this class of rig, day rate fixtures over the last six months are averaging 122,000 per day, approximately 38,500 per day higher than the 300-foot independent-leg cantilevers currently in the market.
63% of Rowan's jack-ups are in the 350-foot-or-greater classification, and we will continue to benefit from the high grading of the worldwide fleet that the industry is currently experiencing.
I will now address our areas of operation. Let's begin with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Supplying the region is 81 jack-ups while demand is 42 rigs for a utilization of 52%. This is the first time the U.S. Gulf has been above 50% since March of 2009. We have nine jack-ups in the region with a contracted utilization of 89% and an average day rate of approximately $129,000. The EXL #1 will begin operations in mid May, and we are pleased to expand our relationship with McMoRan and their partners by adding another jack-up to their deep-gas drilling program.
The Davy Jones discovery has the potential to trigger a resurgence of activity on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico shipment. While geographic diversity is still an important part of our overall strategy, we remain focused on meeting the domestic deep-gas demands with our high-spec fleet of jack-ups.
Regarding the remainder of our domestic fleet, we’re in constant communication with operators working through the issues of the upcoming hurricane season to maximize utilization of our commodity rigs in the region. With respect to the Horizon incident, all of our rigs are located west of the oil spill, and we do not expect our operations to be affected by the clean-up efforts.
To briefly mention Mexico, we have received PEMEX’s tenders for five independent lake cantilever jack-ups, three 300-footers, one 350 and one 250. All tenders but the 250 are required to be less than 10 years of age or have undergone major modifications during that same time period. We believe this puts Rowan’s gem fleet [ph] in a strong competitive position in this bidding process. We are actively participating and hopeful to mobilize additional rigs into the region to join the Gorilla IV currently working for PEMEX.
Moving on to the North Sea. Supply is 37 jack-ups, while demand is 32 rigs and contracted utilization is 86%. Despite the softness in the region for standard jack-ups, the marketed utilization for 350 independent-leg cantilever jack-ups or greater was 100%. Rowan currently has two Super Gorilla class jack-ups operating in the area and as previously reported the Gorilla VII will mobilize into the region upon its completion of Cabinda Gulf contract for the West Africa to commence operations for Apache U.K. All three jack-ups are contracted through second quarter 2011. Rowan is actively tendering for additional high spec projects in the North Sea.
Now turning to the Middle East. The supply in this region is 119 jack-ups, while demand is currently at 90 rigs and contracted utilization is 76%. 16 of the available units are 300-foot independent-leg cantilevers or greater, resulting in strong competition for outstanding tenders. Rowan has nine jack-ups in the Middle East. Five units are currently contracted at an average day rate of $143,000 and the Rowan-California will commence operations for Wintershall later this quarter.
Saudi Aramco currently has outstanding tenders for two gas rigs and two workover rigs. Rowan is being considered for all projects and we are encouraged about the opportunity to continue our relationship with Saudi Aramco. The remainder of our fleet is relatively unchanged since our last call. The Gorilla III is in Eastern Canada on contract within Canada, the J.P. Bussell continues its contract with Shell in Egypt and the Gorilla IV continues operation with PEMEX. The Gorilla VII contract with Cabinda Gulf has been extended in West Africa for an additional well at $315,000 per day.
The well is expected to last approximately 85 days before the unit mobilizes to the North Sea for Apache U.K. in late summer. And finally, I'll mention our Onshore division. We have a marketed fleet of 30 land rigs located in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alaska. Currently 87% of our fleet is contracted at an average day rate of approximately $20,000. 88% of our contracted fleet is operating in U.S. shale and gas plays, including the Haynesville and Deep Bossier. Rowan currently has the deepest average well depth of approximately 16,000 feet, proving that our customers recognize that our fleet of high spec land rigs is designed to meet the operational challenges presented by deeper or more difficult wells.
This concludes our market overview. I will now turn the call over to Bill Wells."
300794,100860164,60877,"Rowan Companies Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-04-2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As noted in our press release, our results were $0.56 per share, after an inventory charge of $42 million or $0.25 per share related to non-conforming and slow-moving items in Letourneau's Drilling Products and",1383,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As noted in our press release, our results were $0.56 per share, after an inventory charge of $42 million or $0.25 per share related to non-conforming and slow-moving items in Letourneau's Drilling Products and Systems segment. During the past two months LTI's new management team performed a thorough bottom-up assessment of the Houston-based inventory of drilling equipment components and parts. As a result, we determined that a significant number of items have experienced some level of deterioration, such as they are out-of-tolerance with original specifications or no longer conform to minimum quality standards. Full provision has been made to the cost of items that cannot be efficiently reworked, and we have taken steps to avoid any further physical deterioration.
In addition, notwithstanding increased quotation activity for land rig packages, we have thus far in 2010 continued to work off existing drilling products backlog. The quantity and age of slow-moving inventory items has continued to grow in 2010, a trend that we currently expect will continue for the foreseeable future. Thus, we have recorded an additional provision to reflect reduced recoverable value of slow-moving inventory. While this provision reflects our best estimate at this time, it does not in most cases provide a 100% reserve against the slow-moving items. The total charge was almost 15% of LTI's drilling equipment inventories and was spread across all major product line. 
Turning to our drilling operations. Our first quarter 2010 revenues were $331 million, down by 13% in the prior year, but up by 30% from last quarter, with both changes driven primarily by fleet utilization. The addition of the Ralph Coffman in early January of this year contributed to the sequential increase.
The first quarter also benefited from above market rates temporarily obtained by two of our Gulf of Mexico slot rigs as part of a contract work out on a third rig. As this above market arrangement will be fully concluded by mid-May, these two rigs will experience a reduction in revenues during the second quarter. However, we expect that this impact will likely be substantially offset by the aggregate effects of the Ralph Coffman, the delivery of our first EXL class rig and increased land rig activity.
As of April 21, the date of our most recent fleet status update, our backlog of drilling contracts totaled approximately $1.2 billion. We expect that approximately 63% of that amount will be realized as revenue during the remainder of 2010, 31% will occur in 2011 and the balance in 2012 or beyond. Our first quarter drilling expenses of $137 million were 6% below the prior year, 12% above last quarter and at the low end of our previous guidance. The year-over-year reduction was primarily in maintenance and reimbursable costs, whereas the sequential increase resulted from the reactivation of certain rigs, the conclusion of most rig upgrade projects, the startup of the Ralph Coffman and a full quarter of activity for Gorilla VI in Norway.
We expect that our second quarter 2010 drilling expenses will be in the range of $145 million to $150 million with a sequential increase due to the expected reactivation of certain rigs and the startup of EXL #1. We’re holding off our full year 2010 estimate of drilling expenses at approximately $595 million, with the year-over-year increase due largely to the factors mentioned previously.
Turning to our Manufacturing operations. Our first quarter revenues totaled $147 million, including $46 million of arms length sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $101 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year and 30% from last quarter. The Drilling Products and Systems segment contributed $96 million or 65% of total revenues, including sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $50 million and featured 23 million from offshore rig projects, and $15 million from land rigs and $4 million from drilling equipment.
Our Mining, Forestry and Steel products revenues totaled $51 million, including $15 million from shipments of mining equipment and $10 million from steel plate. We shipped three mining loaders during the first quarter, including one each of our large L-2350 and L-1850 units. We've seen an increase in quotations in bookings and have a total of 16 units in our March 31 backlog. We expect to ship 21 units in 2010, up from 14 units in 2009.
Our combined aftermarket parts and service revenues were $30 million during the first quarter, down by 12% from the prior year, but unchanged from last quarter. Our average operating margin was 17% of Manufacturing revenues during the first quarter, down from 21% the prior year, but unchanged from last quarter. At March 31 our external manufacturing backlog of $392 million included $185 million related to offshore rig projects, $63 million related to land rig projects, $65 million of mining equipment and $28 million of drilling equipment, with the remainder primarily parts and other components.
We booked approximately $79 million of new orders in the first quarter or 78% of external revenues during the period, over one-half of which was mining products. Our estimated backlog-at-risk remained at $15 million or less than 4% of our external backlog at March 31, 2010.
We expect that approximately 90% of our external manufacturing backlog at March 31 will be realized as revenues in 2010. We indicated earlier this year that we expected 2010 external revenues to be flat to slightly up, when compared to 2009, and that average operating margins would increase to the upper teens.  We continue to believe that these results are obtainable.
As previously mentioned, we have no further plans for rig construction at our Vicksburg, Mississippi shipyard following delivery of the Joe Douglas in 2011. Absent additional orders or sufficient prospects for future work, the activities at the facility will be significantly reduced at that time, in which case we would incur additional costs, such as employee severance among other charges.
Closing or significantly reducing activity levels at the facility could result in cash charges ranging from $5 million to $6 million and non-cash charges ranging from $7 million $10 million. The carrying value of our investment in the facility and related inventories totaled approximately $51 million at March 31.
Our first quarter depreciation expense totaled $46 million, which tracked our previous guidance and was up by 12% over last year and by 2% over last quarter, primarily due to the rig fleet additions. Our latest estimate for 2010 depreciation is in the range of $185 million to $188 million, including approximately $46 million to $47 million in the second quarter.
Our first quarter SG&A expenses totaled $26 million, up by 5% from last year, but down by 12% from last quarter and below our previous guidance, primarily due to fluctuations in incentive compensation costs and professional fees related to tax planning. Our latest estimate for 2010 costs is in a range of $116 million to $118 million for the year, including approximately $30 million to $31 million in the second quarter.
Interest expense net of interest capitalized was $5.7 million during the quarter, assuming no new borrowings our 2010 interest expense should be in the range of $51 million to $52 million, about one-half of which would be capitalized. Our first quarter and expected full year effective tax rate is approximately 31%.
Property and equipment additions totaled $103 million in the first quarter, which included $18 million for a third 240C jack-up, $61 million for the four EXL rigs and $18 million for existing fleet, including contractually required upgrades. At March 31, we had approximately $425 million remaining to be spent under our newbuild program over the next three years, 62% of which is expected to recur in 2010, followed by 31% to 2011 and the balance in 2012.
Our [audio gap] 2010 capital expenditures are projected at approximately $408 million, including $82 million towards the Joe Douglas, $180 million for the EXL jack-ups and $105 million for existing rigs, including contractually required upgrades. The remaining $41 million includes the cost of drill pipe, needed improvements to our manufacturing facilities and shore basins, and other enhancements. We currently intend to fully fund our capital program through existing cash or operating cash flows.
That concludes our prepared remarks. With Everett’s assistance we will now open it up for questions."

We've got a long history of safe operations as does the whole industry. It’s been by various counts somewhere around 40,000 wells drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the first spill in my memory of any consequence and very unusual circumstances. There's been a lot of uncertainty, but. So we are just refocusing our people on all of our policies and practices. We feel like everybody's going to be pretty well set because they've handled it before. Now I do expect that they’ll be additional regulatory oversight for maybe -- even additional testing procedures or something like that, that could follow along. I’ve read some accounts to that effect. But I don't really see -- certainly, it's going to, well, in my opinion, I shouldn’t say, certainly. I expect that it will slow down if not stop them from opening up any additional areas to drilling. But for Rowan that’s not of much consequence because we believe that the areas that have been opened are the areas that have the best opportunities for our high-spec jack-ups. So we don't really think that sort of opportunity extends to the Eastern Gulf anyway. So from our perspective, we're not really expecting much more. We think the primary outcome will be more regulatory attention there."

300794,109135889,71767,"Rowan Companies Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'd like to begin by commenting about the effect of the Macondo blowout on our safety practices here at Rowan. David Russell will be available on the call to give you more detail on the Q",491,"Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'd like to begin by commenting about the effect of the Macondo blowout on our safety practices here at Rowan. David Russell will be available on the call to give you more detail on the Q&A session if there's interest or questions, but I want to emphasize that we expect to have to change very little about how we manage our operations from the standpoint of safety.
At Rowan, safety is our highest priority and was long before the Macondo event. Our first reaction to the event was to reiterate to all of our drilling managers and crews the right and the obligation they have to take any action or refuse to take any action as necessary to protect our people and the environment. Rowan is well known in this industry for the capability of our crews and our equipment in providing demanding drilling services. A critical aspect of achieving and maintaining that reputation is our focus on safety.
You will get more details from others on the call this morning. But let me just say that we're pleased with our results for the quarter, especially the strong contribution from the drilling group in both revenues and cost control. We've commented in the past several quarters that the jack-up market is stratified with the most capable jack-ups enjoying higher day rates and better utilization as demonstrated by the current 93% utilization in the high-spec [high specification] market, compared to 73% for the jack-up market overall.
We expect this trend to continue, which contributes to our confidence that we'll be able to find good opportunities for the very capable N-class jack-ups we are acquiring in the SKDP transaction. We expect to begin our formal tender offer later this month and conclude it before the end of September. In the meantime, we have the SKDP management team in Houston this week planning the integration process.
And finally, let me say that Rowan has been fortunate in that the permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico since the Macondo event have not had a material impact on our financial results in the second quarter. We currently expect our two jack-ups that have been waiting on permits to return to work in the next week or two. We've also recently entered or expect to enter into agreements to move three of our high-spec jack-ups from the U.S. Gulf to international markets. Like all of the energy service firms with operations in the Gulf, we're hoping that the legislation currently being considered in Congress doesn't become law. 
In my personal view, it's an overreaction that will likely damage our domestic offshore energy industry without making it meaningfully safer, as prudent managers will be considering every opportunity to reposition our fleet to minimize any potential impact from this ill conceived legislation.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark Keller for comments on our rig markets."
300794,109135889,71767,"Rowan Companies Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Matt. Since our last earnings call, worldwide market utilization has soften slightly, due mostly to the market conditions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. According to ODS-Petrodata, there are currently 461 jack-ups worldwide, demand is 338 rigs with u",835,"Thanks, Matt. Since our last earnings call, worldwide market utilization has soften slightly, due mostly to the market conditions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. According to ODS-Petrodata, there are currently 461 jack-ups worldwide, demand is 338 rigs with utilization at 73%, down 3% from its recent peak of 76%. Higher capability rigs continue to outperform the industry average with 350-foot cantilevers and above at 90% utilization or higher. International tender and inquiry activity remains strong, and we currently see open demand for more than 52 jack-ups in the regions such as the North Sea, the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia.
The drilling requirements in these tenders are increasingly stringent, and Rowan's high-spec jack-ups are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. Historically, Rowan is always been successful contracting our new builds prior to delivery. Recently the EXL-II was contracted with BP for three years of work in Trinidad. The rig is expected to be delivered at the end of August and should begin operations in mid-October at a contract value of approximately $164 million.
Additionally, we are very close to commitment on the EXL-III with McMoRan in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico upon its delivery in March 2011. We expect the day rate to be comparable to the EXL-I.
The addition of the N-class units further solidifies our niche in the high-spec market. Considering the long-term commitments of our current fleet of 2 million pound hook-load rigs, this acquisition enables us to respond to tenders for which we otherwise would not have had rigs available. By year-end 2012, Rowan will have 19 of the industry's 38 high-spec rigs or 50% of the sought after market.
I will now address our areas of operation. Let's begin with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Supply in the region is 82 jack-ups while demand is 34 rigs for a utilization of 41%, down 11% from the recent May peak of 52%. The combination of hurricane season and the regulatory uncertainty of the region, after the Deepwater Horizon incident have made it difficult for utilization to stabilize. We have nine jack-ups in the region, with a contracted utilization of 67% and an average day rate of approximately $123,000. 
Recent permitting issues have had some effect on Rowan with the Rowan-Louisiana currently waiting on permit approval, and the Bob Palmer recently released from its contract with Apache. We expect the Bob Palmer to return to work within the week on a well-to-well basis in the Gulf.
Only 15 marketed jack-ups that are 300-foot cantilevers or above remain in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with four of those scheduled to migrate out of the region. Considering that most contractors are bidding their remaining units internationally, there is strong concern that E&P companies will not have access to rigs necessary to meet production goals for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Shelf. 
We are hopeful that as the permitting situation improves and hurricane season concludes activity will begin to recover. Despite tendering internationally, Rowan is dedicated to meeting the needs of our Gulf of Mexico customers and is optimistic about the continued success of deep-gas drilling on the shelf.
Now turning to the North Sea. Supply is 38 jack-ups while demand is 33 rigs and contracted utilization is 87%. The focus of the region remains on the heavy-duty sector as the standard jack-up market continues to suffer from a lack of long-term demand. Rowan currently has two Super Gorilla class jack-ups operating in the area. In addition, the Rowan Gorilla VII is currently en route from West Africa and scheduled to arrive in Dundee in mid-August for modifications before its contract with Apache U.K. commences in October 2010. All three jack-ups are committed on long-term contracts. The North Sea is the most active region in terms of tenders and inquiries with open demand for as many as 20 units over the next two years.
Moving on to the Middle East. The supply in this region is 119 jack-ups while demand is currently at 91 rigs and contracted utilization is 76%. The market has averaged 75% for most of 2010, significantly lower than the 90% average in 2008. Rowan has nine jack-ups in the Middle East. Six units are currently contracted at an average day rate of $131,000. We currently have several active tenders for high-spec jack-ups in the region.
Regarding our Onshore division, we have a marketed fleet of 29 land rigs located in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alaska. Currently, 90% of our fleet is contracted at an average day rate of approximately $20,000. All 23 of our 2,000-horsepower rigs are contracted at 100% utilization as operators realize the advantage of fast-moving, high-spec land rigs.
Tender activity for high-spec land rigs remains high. The U.S. shale and gas plays continue to be the driving force of the land rig market, including the Haynesville, Eagle Ford and Deep Bossier areas, and Rowan is actively drilling in these regions. 
This concludes our market overview. I'll now turn the call over to Bill Wells."

Our second quarter 2010 revenues were $328 million, up by 2% over the prior year, but down by 1% from last quarter. As the impact of offshore fleet additions and increasing land utilization has been offset by lower average day rates. 
Our current drilling revenue backlog totals approximately $1.2 billion. We expect that approximately 39% of that amount will be realized as revenue during the remainder of 2010, another 39% will occur in 2011 and the balance in 2012 or beyond.
Our second quarter drilling expenses of $139 million were approximately 2% above the prior year and last quarter as result of fleet additions between periods that are well below our previous guidance. Both comparisons reflect increases in labor and related personnel costs, reimbursables and certain other activity-based expenses that were largely offset by lower insurance costs. We expect that our third quarter 2010 drilling expenses will be in the range of $139 million to $141 million or relatively unchanged from the second quarter level, as the impact of incremental activity from the EXL-I, the Rowan-California and our land fleet should be substantially offset by the departure of the Gorilla VI from Norway and a deferral of certain cost on the Gorilla VII, while on the shipyard preparing for its next assignment. For full year 2010 estimate of drilling expenses is now approximately $575 million, down by 3% from our previous guidance, due largely to the factors mentioned previously.
Turning to our manufacturing operations. Second quarter revenues totaled $214 million, including $52 million of arm's-length sales to our drilling division. External revenues were $162 million during the second quarter, virtually unchanged from the prior year, but up by 60% over last quarter. 
Our Drilling Products and Systems segment contribute a $124 million or 58% of total manufacturing revenues during the second quarter, including sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $72 million and featured $37 million from offshore rig projects, $21 million from land rigs and $6 million from drilling equipment. 
Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment contributed revenues of $90 million during the second quarter, up by 65% over the prior year and by 76% over last quarter. Revenues included $46 million from shipments of mining equipment and $11 million from steel plate. We shipped 10 mining loaders during the second quarter, including one L-2350 and six L-1850 units.
Our combined aftermarket's parts and service revenue were $36 million during the second quarter, up by 14% over the prior year and by 19% over last quarter. Our average operating margin was 15% of manufacturing revenues during the second quarter, up from 9% in the prior year. But down from 17% last quarter and below our previous guidance, due largely to an estimated $15 million of additional clean-up expenses recognized during the period, including $6 million of accrued warranty costs and another $6 million of inventory and cost of sales adjustments.
At June 30, our external manufacturing backlog of $337 million included $162 million related to offshore rig projects, $60 million of mining equipment, $42 million related to land rig projects and $33 million of drilling equipment, with the remainder primarily parts and other components.
We booked approximately $105 million of new orders in the second quarter or approximately 2/3 of external revenues during the period. Over 60% of the new orders were from mining products.
We expect that approximately 86% of our external manufacturing backlog at June 30 will be realized as revenues in 2010. We indicated earlier this year that we expected 2010 external revenues to be flat to slightly up, when compared to 2009, and that average operating margins would increase to the upper teens. We continue to believe that these results are obtainable. Tom Burke will have more to say about our Manufacturing business momentarily.
Our second quarter depreciation expense totaled $47 million, which tracked our previous guidance and was up by 9% over last year and by 2% over last quarter, primarily due to the rig fleet additions. Our latest estimate for 2010 depreciation is in the range of $186 million to $188 million, including approximately $46 million to $47 million in the third quarter.
Our second quarter SG&A expenses totaled $36 million, up by 46% over last year and by 40% over last quarter and above our previous guidance, primarily due to a $4.5 million provision for the expected costs to terminate our agency agreement in Mexico. Costs associated with our corporate and drilling functions were otherwise in line with expectations. Costs associated with our manufacturing functions reflected higher-than-expected personnel costs and bad debt provisions during the quarter.
Our latest estimate for 2010 SG&A cost is in the range of $125 million to $127 million for the year, including approximately $31 million to $32 million in the third quarter.
Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, was $5.2 million during the second quarter and should be close to that level during the third quarter. Assuming no new borrowings and reflecting our full assumption of the SKDP debt on September 1, we estimate remaining 2010 interest expense will be in the range of $36 million to $37 million, about 2/3 of which should be capitalized. We are evaluating options around refinancing the SKDP debt, but 1/2 of which is non-interest bearing until December 1. 
Our expected full year effective tax rate is approximately 29%, down from 31% previously forecast as a result of the out bounding of additional offshore rigs into our international structure. Thus, we provided taxes that are 27% rate in the second quarter.
Property and equipment additions totaled $109 million in the second quarter, which included $39 million for our third 240C jack-up, $47 million toward the EXL rigs and $17 million for our existing fleet, including contractually required upgrades. At June 30, we had approximately $787 million of remaining capital expenditures under our new build program, including the N-Class construction commitments, net of SKDP cash on hand. We expect that 52% of this amount will occur in 2010 followed by 44% in 2011 and the balance in 2012.
Our remaining 2010 net capital expenditures are projected at approximately $555 million, including $51 million towards the Joe Douglas, $142 million for the EXL jack-ups, $214 million for the N-Class rigs and $111 million for our existing rigs, including contractually required upgrades. The remaining $37 million includes costs of drill pipe needed improvements to our manufacturing facilities and shore bases and other enhancements. We currently intend to fully fund our capital program through existing cash or operating cash flows.
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it over to Tom Burke for additional comments on our Manufacturing businesses."

At the end of the second quarter, we had 11 loaders in backlog all for delivery in 2010. We expect to deliver 25 to 28 loaders in 2010. This compares favorably to the 14 that's shipped in 2009. This year, we anticipate selling nine of our largest loader, the L-2350, which represents impressive growth in this product line when you consider that we have sold only six of these units over the prior five years. 
Our new loader, gen [generation] two hybrid power technology, which has a number of improvements over previous systems, the most important being increased fuel efficiency and lower emissions is creating significant interest in the mining market. Multiple customers are positioning to purchase only gen two loaders as soon as possible. As a result of this strong product acceptance and a sustained recovery in the commodity markets, our Mining Products business is projecting a substantial increase in loader sales in 2011.
In the drilling products group, we will have worked off most of our current backlog at the end of this year. This part of our business relies to a large extent on new jack-up rig construction, which has seen a downturn in new commitments. We are evaluating alternatives to help grow backlog in this business. One possibility is new land rig construction, we have seen an increasing quoting activity for land rig packages. We quoted 340 million in packages during the second quarter, up from 194 million in the first quarter and we have 16 bids for international delivery, outstanding at present.
Early this month, Lamprell plc shipyard in the UAE won an order for two of LeTourneau designed, high-spec Super 116E rigs. These rigs are expected to include full LeTourneau drilling packages, including top drive drill works, electrical systems and mud pumps. Although this win will not add materially to LeTourneau's backlog, as the two jack-up rig kits and one of the drilling packages has already been purchased by the shipyard, it is nonetheless excellent news and confirms a superior design of a LeTourneau jack-up rigs.
That concludes our prepared remarks. With Melissa's assistance, we will now open it up for questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'd like to begin by commenting about the effect of the Macondo blowout on our safety practices here at Rowan.

I'd like to begin by commenting about the effect of the Macondo blowout on our safety practices here at Rowan. David Russell will be available on the call to give you more detail on the Q&A session if there's interest or questions, but I want to emphasize that we expect to have to change very little about how we manage our operations from the standpoint of safety.
At Rowan, safety is our highest priority and was long before the Macondo event. Our first reaction to the event was to reiterate to all of our drilling managers and crews the right and the obligation they have to take any action or refuse to take any action as necessary to protect our people and the environment. Rowan is well known in this industry for the capability of our crews and our equipment in providing demanding drilling services. A critical aspect of achieving and maintaining that reputation is our focus on safety.
You will get more details from others on the call this morning. But let me just say that we're pleased with our results for the quarter, especially the strong contribution from the drilling group in both revenues and cost control. We've commented in the past several quarters that the jack-up market is stratified with the most capable jack-ups enjoying higher day rates and better utilization as demonstrated by the current 93% utilization in the high-spec [high specification] market, compared to 73% for the jack-up market overall.
We expect this trend to continue, which contributes to our confidence that we'll be able to find good opportunities for the very capable N-class jack-ups we are acquiring in the SKDP transaction. We expect to begin our formal tender offer later this month and conclude it before the end of September. In the meantime, we have the SKDP management team in Houston this week planning the integration process.
And finally, let me say that Rowan has been fortunate in that the permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico since the Macondo event have not had a material impact on our financial results in the second quarter. We currently expect our two jack-ups that have been waiting on permits to return to work in the next week or two. We've also recently entered or expect to enter into agreements to move three of our high-spec jack-ups from the U.S. Gulf to international markets. Like all of the energy service firms with operations in the Gulf, we're hoping that the legislation currently being considered in Congress doesn't become law. 
In my personal view, it's an overreaction that will likely damage our domestic offshore energy industry without making it meaningfully safer, as prudent managers will be considering every opportunity to reposition our fleet to minimize any potential impact from this ill conceived legislation.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark Keller for comments on our rig markets.

Since our last earnings call, worldwide market utilization has soften slightly, due mostly to the market conditions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

Since our last earnings call, worldwide market utilization has soften slightly, due mostly to the market conditions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. According to ODS-Petrodata, there are currently 461 jack-ups worldwide, demand is 338 rigs with utilization at 73%, down 3% from its recent peak of 76%. Higher capability rigs continue to outperform the industry average with 350-foot cantilevers and above at 90% utilization or higher. International tender and inquiry activity remains strong, and we currently see open demand for more than 52 jack-ups in the regions such as the North Sea, the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia.
The drilling requirements in these tenders are increasingly stringent, and Rowan's high-spec jack-ups are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. Historically, Rowan is always been successful contracting our new builds prior to delivery. Recently the EXL-II was contracted with BP for three years of work in Trinidad. The rig is expected to be delivered at the end of August and should begin operations in mid-October at a contract value of approximately $164 million.
Additionally, we are very close to commitment on the EXL-III with McMoRan in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico upon its delivery in March 2011. We expect the day rate to be comparable to the EXL-I.
The addition of the N-class units further solidifies our niche in the high-spec market. Considering the long-term commitments of our current fleet of 2 million pound hook-load rigs, this acquisition enables us to respond to tenders for which we otherwise would not have had rigs available. By year-end 2012, Rowan will have 19 of the industry's 38 high-spec rigs or 50% of the sought after market.
I will now address our areas of operation. Let's begin with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Supply in the region is 82 jack-ups while demand is 34 rigs for a utilization of 41%, down 11% from the recent May peak of 52%. The combination of hurricane season and the regulatory uncertainty of the region, after the Deepwater Horizon incident have made it difficult for utilization to stabilize. We have nine jack-ups in the region, with a contracted utilization of 67% and an average day rate of approximately $123,000. 
Recent permitting issues have had some effect on Rowan with the Rowan-Louisiana currently waiting on permit approval, and the Bob Palmer recently released from its contract with Apache. We expect the Bob Palmer to return to work within the week on a well-to-well basis in the Gulf.
Only 15 marketed jack-ups that are 300-foot cantilevers or above remain in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with four of those scheduled to migrate out of the region. Considering that most contractors are bidding their remaining units internationally, there is strong concern that E&P companies will not have access to rigs necessary to meet production goals for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Shelf. 
We are hopeful that as the permitting situation improves and hurricane season concludes activity will begin to recover. Despite tendering internationally, Rowan is dedicated to meeting the needs of our Gulf of Mexico customers and is optimistic about the continued success of deep-gas drilling on the shelf.
Now turning to the North Sea. Supply is 38 jack-ups while demand is 33 rigs and contracted utilization is 87%. The focus of the region remains on the heavy-duty sector as the standard jack-up market continues to suffer from a lack of long-term demand. Rowan currently has two Super Gorilla class jack-ups operating in the area. In addition, the Rowan Gorilla VII is currently en route from West Africa and scheduled to arrive in Dundee in mid-August for modifications before its contract with Apache U.K. commences in October 2010. All three jack-ups are committed on long-term contracts. The North Sea is the most active region in terms of tenders and inquiries with open demand for as many as 20 units over the next two years.
Moving on to the Middle East. The supply in this region is 119 jack-ups while demand is currently at 91 rigs and contracted utilization is 76%. The market has averaged 75% for most of 2010, significantly lower than the 90% average in 2008. Rowan has nine jack-ups in the Middle East. Six units are currently contracted at an average day rate of $131,000. We currently have several active tenders for high-spec jack-ups in the region.
Regarding our Onshore division, we have a marketed fleet of 29 land rigs located in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alaska. Currently, 90% of our fleet is contracted at an average day rate of approximately $20,000. All 23 of our 2,000-horsepower rigs are contracted at 100% utilization as operators realize the advantage of fast-moving, high-spec land rigs.
Tender activity for high-spec land rigs remains high. The U.S. shale and gas plays continue to be the driving force of the land rig market, including the Haynesville, Eagle Ford and Deep Bossier areas, and Rowan is actively drilling in these regions. 
This concludes our market overview. I'll now turn the call over to Bill Wells.

Our second quarter 2010 revenues were $328 million, up by 2% over the prior year, but down by 1% from last quarter. As the impact of offshore fleet additions and increasing land utilization has been offset by lower average day rates. 
Our current drilling revenue backlog totals approximately $1.2 billion. We expect that approximately 39% of that amount will be realized as revenue during the remainder of 2010, another 39% will occur in 2011 and the balance in 2012 or beyond.
Our second quarter drilling expenses of $139 million were approximately 2% above the prior year and last quarter as result of fleet additions between periods that are well below our previous guidance. Both comparisons reflect increases in labor and related personnel costs, reimbursables and certain other activity-based expenses that were largely offset by lower insurance costs. We expect that our third quarter 2010 drilling expenses will be in the range of $139 million to $141 million or relatively unchanged from the second quarter level, as the impact of incremental activity from the EXL-I, the Rowan-California and our land fleet should be substantially offset by the departure of the Gorilla VI from Norway and a deferral of certain cost on the Gorilla VII, while on the shipyard preparing for its next assignment. For full year 2010 estimate of drilling expenses is now approximately $575 million, down by 3% from our previous guidance, due largely to the factors mentioned previously.
Turning to our manufacturing operations. Second quarter revenues totaled $214 million, including $52 million of arm's-length sales to our drilling division. External revenues were $162 million during the second quarter, virtually unchanged from the prior year, but up by 60% over last quarter. 
Our Drilling Products and Systems segment contribute a $124 million or 58% of total manufacturing revenues during the second quarter, including sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $72 million and featured $37 million from offshore rig projects, $21 million from land rigs and $6 million from drilling equipment. 
Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment contributed revenues of $90 million during the second quarter, up by 65% over the prior year and by 76% over last quarter. Revenues included $46 million from shipments of mining equipment and $11 million from steel plate. We shipped 10 mining loaders during the second quarter, including one L-2350 and six L-1850 units.
Our combined aftermarket's parts and service revenue were $36 million during the second quarter, up by 14% over the prior year and by 19% over last quarter. Our average operating margin was 15% of manufacturing revenues during the second quarter, up from 9% in the prior year. But down from 17% last quarter and below our previous guidance, due largely to an estimated $15 million of additional clean-up expenses recognized during the period, including $6 million of accrued warranty costs and another $6 million of inventory and cost of sales adjustments.
At June 30, our external manufacturing backlog of $337 million included $162 million related to offshore rig projects, $60 million of mining equipment, $42 million related to land rig projects and $33 million of drilling equipment, with the remainder primarily parts and other components.
We booked approximately $105 million of new orders in the second quarter or approximately 2/3 of external revenues during the period. Over 60% of the new orders were from mining products.
We expect that approximately 86% of our external manufacturing backlog at June 30 will be realized as revenues in 2010. We indicated earlier this year that we expected 2010 external revenues to be flat to slightly up, when compared to 2009, and that average operating margins would increase to the upper teens. We continue to believe that these results are obtainable. Tom Burke will have more to say about our Manufacturing business momentarily.
Our second quarter depreciation expense totaled $47 million, which tracked our previous guidance and was up by 9% over last year and by 2% over last quarter, primarily due to the rig fleet additions. Our latest estimate for 2010 depreciation is in the range of $186 million to $188 million, including approximately $46 million to $47 million in the third quarter.
Our second quarter SG&A expenses totaled $36 million, up by 46% over last year and by 40% over last quarter and above our previous guidance, primarily due to a $4.5 million provision for the expected costs to terminate our agency agreement in Mexico. Costs associated with our corporate and drilling functions were otherwise in line with expectations. Costs associated with our manufacturing functions reflected higher-than-expected personnel costs and bad debt provisions during the quarter.
Our latest estimate for 2010 SG&A cost is in the range of $125 million to $127 million for the year, including approximately $31 million to $32 million in the third quarter.
Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, was $5.2 million during the second quarter and should be close to that level during the third quarter. Assuming no new borrowings and reflecting our full assumption of the SKDP debt on September 1, we estimate remaining 2010 interest expense will be in the range of $36 million to $37 million, about 2/3 of which should be capitalized. We are evaluating options around refinancing the SKDP debt, but 1/2 of which is non-interest bearing until December 1. 
Our expected full year effective tax rate is approximately 29%, down from 31% previously forecast as a result of the out bounding of additional offshore rigs into our international structure. Thus, we provided taxes that are 27% rate in the second quarter.
Property and equipment additions totaled $109 million in the second quarter, which included $39 million for our third 240C jack-up, $47 million toward the EXL rigs and $17 million for our existing fleet, including contractually required upgrades. At June 30, we had approximately $787 million of remaining capital expenditures under our new build program, including the N-Class construction commitments, net of SKDP cash on hand. We expect that 52% of this amount will occur in 2010 followed by 44% in 2011 and the balance in 2012.
Our remaining 2010 net capital expenditures are projected at approximately $555 million, including $51 million towards the Joe Douglas, $142 million for the EXL jack-ups, $214 million for the N-Class rigs and $111 million for our existing rigs, including contractually required upgrades. The remaining $37 million includes costs of drill pipe needed improvements to our manufacturing facilities and shore bases and other enhancements. We currently intend to fully fund our capital program through existing cash or operating cash flows.
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it over to Tom Burke for additional comments on our Manufacturing businesses.

At the end of the second quarter, we had 11 loaders in backlog all for delivery in 2010. We expect to deliver 25 to 28 loaders in 2010. This compares favorably to the 14 that's shipped in 2009. This year, we anticipate selling nine of our largest loader, the L-2350, which represents impressive growth in this product line when you consider that we have sold only six of these units over the prior five years. 
Our new loader, gen [generation] two hybrid power technology, which has a number of improvements over previous systems, the most important being increased fuel efficiency and lower emissions is creating significant interest in the mining market. Multiple customers are positioning to purchase only gen two loaders as soon as possible. As a result of this strong product acceptance and a sustained recovery in the commodity markets, our Mining Products business is projecting a substantial increase in loader sales in 2011.
In the drilling products group, we will have worked off most of our current backlog at the end of this year. This part of our business relies to a large extent on new jack-up rig construction, which has seen a downturn in new commitments. We are evaluating alternatives to help grow backlog in this business. One possibility is new land rig construction, we have seen an increasing quoting activity for land rig packages. We quoted 340 million in packages during the second quarter, up from 194 million in the first quarter and we have 16 bids for international delivery, outstanding at present.
Early this month, Lamprell plc shipyard in the UAE won an order for two of LeTourneau designed, high-spec Super 116E rigs. These rigs are expected to include full LeTourneau drilling packages, including top drive drill works, electrical systems and mud pumps. Although this win will not add materially to LeTourneau's backlog, as the two jack-up rig kits and one of the drilling packages has already been purchased by the shipyard, it is nonetheless excellent news and confirms a superior design of a LeTourneau jack-up rigs.
That concludes our prepared remarks. With Melissa's assistance, we will now open it up for questions.

So we certainly wouldn't miss an opportunity to build new equipment, where we could get an acceptable rate of return subject, of course, to board approval on that. But with regard to the longer-term question, it is still definitely our intention to separate from LTI as that opportunity presents itself. And we've been quite candid with our crews and as well as with the investment community that we do believe that at some point it will make sense to use the land rig fleet as a source of capital for further expansion and to the offshore side of the business. So we're watching for that opportunity. At this point, I would say that we probably -- even though there is some new construction, there's still quite a bit of idle equipment so that the utilization, the high utilization is at the upper end of the market. And at this point, we're not seeing what we think is kind of activity level that would give us the opportunity to get the value we think we should get for these rigs, but we continue to watch it closely.

Or are you seeing more and more where that's actually required for the wells? In other words, what I'm trying to get a sense of is, if you do see the high-spec market tightening up in terms of the pricing, would there be some operators who would be willing to trade off, like capability, for price and go to maybe the higher end of the standard market?

So when that market gets tight, you'll see operators that don't need all the capability they can get for a good price now drop to the next kind of strata of rigs there.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'd like to begin by commenting about the effect of the Macondo blowout on our safety practices here at Rowan.

I'd like to begin by commenting about the effect of the Macondo blowout on our safety practices here at Rowan. David Russell will be available on the call to give you more detail on the Q&A session if there's interest or questions, but I want to emphasize that we expect to have to change very little about how we manage our operations from the standpoint of safety.
At Rowan, safety is our highest priority and was long before the Macondo event. Our first reaction to the event was to reiterate to all of our drilling managers and crews the right and the obligation they have to take any action or refuse to take any action as necessary to protect our people and the environment. Rowan is well known in this industry for the capability of our crews and our equipment in providing demanding drilling services. A critical aspect of achieving and maintaining that reputation is our focus on safety.
You will get more details from others on the call this morning. But let me just say that we're pleased with our results for the quarter, especially the strong contribution from the drilling group in both revenues and cost control. We've commented in the past several quarters that the jack-up market is stratified with the most capable jack-ups enjoying higher day rates and better utilization as demonstrated by the current 93% utilization in the high-spec [high specification] market, compared to 73% for the jack-up market overall.
We expect this trend to continue, which contributes to our confidence that we'll be able to find good opportunities for the very capable N-class jack-ups we are acquiring in the SKDP transaction. We expect to begin our formal tender offer later this month and conclude it before the end of September. In the meantime, we have the SKDP management team in Houston this week planning the integration process.
And finally, let me say that Rowan has been fortunate in that the permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico since the Macondo event have not had a material impact on our financial results in the second quarter. We currently expect our two jack-ups that have been waiting on permits to return to work in the next week or two. We've also recently entered or expect to enter into agreements to move three of our high-spec jack-ups from the U.S. Gulf to international markets. Like all of the energy service firms with operations in the Gulf, we're hoping that the legislation currently being considered in Congress doesn't become law. 
In my personal view, it's an overreaction that will likely damage our domestic offshore energy industry without making it meaningfully safer, as prudent managers will be considering every opportunity to reposition our fleet to minimize any potential impact from this ill conceived legislation.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark Keller for comments on our rig markets."
300794,109135889,71869,"Rowan Companies Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Matt. Since our last earnings call, worldwide market utilization has soften slightly, due mostly to the market conditions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

Since our last earnings call, worldwide market utilization has soften slightly, due mostly to the market conditions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. According to ODS-Petrodata, there are currently 461 jack-ups worldwide, demand is 338 rigs with utilization at 73%, down 3% from its recent peak of 76%. Higher capability rigs continue to outperform the industry average with 350-foot cantilevers and above at 90% utilization or higher. International tender and inquiry activity remains strong, and we currently see open demand for more than 52 jack-ups in the regions such as the North Sea, the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia.
The drilling requirements in these tenders are increasingly stringent, and Rowan's high-spec jack-ups are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. Historically, Rowan is always been successful contracting our new builds prior to delivery. Recently the EXL-II was contracted with BP for three years of work in Trinidad. The rig is expected to be delivered at the end of August and should begin operations in mid-October at a contract value of approximately $164 million.
Additionally, we are very close to commitment on the EXL-III with McMoRan in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico upon its delivery in March 2011. We expect the day rate to be comparable to the EXL-I.
The addition of the N-class units further solidifies our niche in the high-spec market. Considering the long-term commitments of our current fleet of 2 million pound hook-load rigs, this acquisition enables us to respond to tenders for which we otherwise would not have had rigs available. By year-end 2012, Rowan will have 19 of the industry's 38 high-spec rigs or 50% of the sought after market.
I will now address our areas of operation. Let's begin with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Supply in the region is 82 jack-ups while demand is 34 rigs for a utilization of 41%, down 11% from the recent May peak of 52%. The combination of hurricane season and the regulatory uncertainty of the region, after the Deepwater Horizon incident have made it difficult for utilization to stabilize. We have nine jack-ups in the region, with a contracted utilization of 67% and an average day rate of approximately $123,000. 
Recent permitting issues have had some effect on Rowan with the Rowan-Louisiana currently waiting on permit approval, and the Bob Palmer recently released from its contract with Apache. We expect the Bob Palmer to return to work within the week on a well-to-well basis in the Gulf.
Only 15 marketed jack-ups that are 300-foot cantilevers or above remain in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, with four of those scheduled to migrate out of the region. Considering that most contractors are bidding their remaining units internationally, there is strong concern that E&P companies will not have access to rigs necessary to meet production goals for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Shelf. 
We are hopeful that as the permitting situation improves and hurricane season concludes activity will begin to recover. Despite tendering internationally, Rowan is dedicated to meeting the needs of our Gulf of Mexico customers and is optimistic about the continued success of deep-gas drilling on the shelf.
Now turning to the North Sea. Supply is 38 jack-ups while demand is 33 rigs and contracted utilization is 87%. The focus of the region remains on the heavy-duty sector as the standard jack-up market continues to suffer from a lack of long-term demand. Rowan currently has two Super Gorilla class jack-ups operating in the area. In addition, the Rowan Gorilla VII is currently en route from West Africa and scheduled to arrive in Dundee in mid-August for modifications before its contract with Apache U.K. commences in October 2010. All three jack-ups are committed on long-term contracts. The North Sea is the most active region in terms of tenders and inquiries with open demand for as many as 20 units over the next two years.
Moving on to the Middle East. The supply in this region is 119 jack-ups while demand is currently at 91 rigs and contracted utilization is 76%. The market has averaged 75% for most of 2010, significantly lower than the 90% average in 2008. Rowan has nine jack-ups in the Middle East. Six units are currently contracted at an average day rate of $131,000. We currently have several active tenders for high-spec jack-ups in the region.
Regarding our Onshore division, we have a marketed fleet of 29 land rigs located in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alaska. Currently, 90% of our fleet is contracted at an average day rate of approximately $20,000. All 23 of our 2,000-horsepower rigs are contracted at 100% utilization as operators realize the advantage of fast-moving, high-spec land rigs.
Tender activity for high-spec land rigs remains high. The U.S. shale and gas plays continue to be the driving force of the land rig market, including the Haynesville, Eagle Ford and Deep Bossier areas, and Rowan is actively drilling in these regions. 
This concludes our market overview. I'll now turn the call over to Bill Wells."

Our second quarter 2010 revenues were $328 million, up by 2% over the prior year, but down by 1% from last quarter. As the impact of offshore fleet additions and increasing land utilization has been offset by lower average day rates. 
Our current drilling revenue backlog totals approximately $1.2 billion. We expect that approximately 39% of that amount will be realized as revenue during the remainder of 2010, another 39% will occur in 2011 and the balance in 2012 or beyond.
Our second quarter drilling expenses of $139 million were approximately 2% above the prior year and last quarter as result of fleet additions between periods that are well below our previous guidance. Both comparisons reflect increases in labor and related personnel costs, reimbursables and certain other activity-based expenses that were largely offset by lower insurance costs. We expect that our third quarter 2010 drilling expenses will be in the range of $139 million to $141 million or relatively unchanged from the second quarter level, as the impact of incremental activity from the EXL-I, the Rowan-California and our land fleet should be substantially offset by the departure of the Gorilla VI from Norway and a deferral of certain cost on the Gorilla VII, while on the shipyard preparing for its next assignment. For full year 2010 estimate of drilling expenses is now approximately $575 million, down by 3% from our previous guidance, due largely to the factors mentioned previously.
Turning to our manufacturing operations. Second quarter revenues totaled $214 million, including $52 million of arm's-length sales to our drilling division. External revenues were $162 million during the second quarter, virtually unchanged from the prior year, but up by 60% over last quarter. 
Our Drilling Products and Systems segment contribute a $124 million or 58% of total manufacturing revenues during the second quarter, including sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $72 million and featured $37 million from offshore rig projects, $21 million from land rigs and $6 million from drilling equipment. 
Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment contributed revenues of $90 million during the second quarter, up by 65% over the prior year and by 76% over last quarter. Revenues included $46 million from shipments of mining equipment and $11 million from steel plate. We shipped 10 mining loaders during the second quarter, including one L-2350 and six L-1850 units.
Our combined aftermarket's parts and service revenue were $36 million during the second quarter, up by 14% over the prior year and by 19% over last quarter. Our average operating margin was 15% of manufacturing revenues during the second quarter, up from 9% in the prior year. But down from 17% last quarter and below our previous guidance, due largely to an estimated $15 million of additional clean-up expenses recognized during the period, including $6 million of accrued warranty costs and another $6 million of inventory and cost of sales adjustments.
At June 30, our external manufacturing backlog of $337 million included $162 million related to offshore rig projects, $60 million of mining equipment, $42 million related to land rig projects and $33 million of drilling equipment, with the remainder primarily parts and other components.
We booked approximately $105 million of new orders in the second quarter or approximately 2/3 of external revenues during the period. Over 60% of the new orders were from mining products.
We expect that approximately 86% of our external manufacturing backlog at June 30 will be realized as revenues in 2010. We indicated earlier this year that we expected 2010 external revenues to be flat to slightly up, when compared to 2009, and that average operating margins would increase to the upper teens. We continue to believe that these results are obtainable. Tom Burke will have more to say about our Manufacturing business momentarily.
Our second quarter depreciation expense totaled $47 million, which tracked our previous guidance and was up by 9% over last year and by 2% over last quarter, primarily due to the rig fleet additions. Our latest estimate for 2010 depreciation is in the range of $186 million to $188 million, including approximately $46 million to $47 million in the third quarter.
Our second quarter SG&A expenses totaled $36 million, up by 46% over last year and by 40% over last quarter and above our previous guidance, primarily due to a $4.5 million provision for the expected costs to terminate our agency agreement in Mexico. Costs associated with our corporate and drilling functions were otherwise in line with expectations. Costs associated with our manufacturing functions reflected higher-than-expected personnel costs and bad debt provisions during the quarter.
Our latest estimate for 2010 SG&A cost is in a range of $125 million to $127 million for the year, including approximately $31 million to $32 million in the third quarter.
Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, was $5.2 million during the second quarter and should be close to that level during the third quarter. Assuming no new borrowings and reflecting our full assumption of the SKDP debt on September 1, we estimate remaining 2010 interest expense will be in the range of $36 million to $37 million, about 2/3 of which should be capitalized. We are evaluating options around refinancing the SKDP debt, although 1/2 of which is non-interest bearing until December 1. 
Our expected full year effective tax rate is approximately 29%, down from 31% previously forecast as a result of the out bounding of additional offshore rigs into our international structure. Thus, we provided taxes that are 27% rate in the second quarter.
Property and equipment additions totaled $109 million in the second quarter, which included $39 million for our third 240C jack-up, $47 million toward the EXL rigs and $17 million for our existing fleet, including contractually required upgrades. At June 30, we had approximately $787 million of remaining capital expenditures under our new build program, including the N-Class construction commitments, net of SKDP cash on hand. We expect that 52% of this amount will occur in 2010 followed by 44% in 2011 and the balance in 2012.
Our remaining 2010 net capital expenditures are projected at approximately $555 million, including $51 million towards the Joe Douglas, $142 million for the EXL jack-ups, $214 million for the N-Class rigs and $111 million for our existing rigs, including contractually required upgrades. The remaining $37 million includes costs of drill pipe needed improvements to our manufacturing facilities and shore bases and other enhancements. We currently intend to fully fund our capital program through existing cash or operating cash flows.
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it over to Tom Burke for additional comments on our Manufacturing businesses."

At the end of the second quarter, we had 11 loaders in backlog all for delivery in 2010. We expect to deliver 25 to 28 loaders in 2010. This compares favorably to the 14 that's shipped in 2009. This year, we anticipate selling nine of our largest loader, the L-2350, which represents impressive growth in this product line when you consider that we have sold only six of these units over the prior five years. 
Our new loader, gen [generation] two hybrid power technology, which has a number of improvements over previous systems, the most important being increased fuel efficiency and lower emissions is creating significant interest in the mining market. Multiple customers are positioning to purchase only gen two loaders as soon as possible. As a result of this strong product acceptance and a sustained recovery in the commodity markets, our Mining Products business is projecting a substantial increase in loader sales in 2011.
In the drilling products group, we will have worked off most of our current backlog at the end of this year. This part of our business relies to a large extent on new jack-up rig construction, which has seen a downturn in new commitments. We are evaluating alternatives to help grow backlog in this business. One possibility is new land rig construction, we have seen an increase in quoting activity for land rig packages. We quoted 340 million in packages during the second quarter, up from 194 million in the first quarter and we have 16 bids for international delivery, outstanding at present.
Early this month, a Lamprell plc shipyard in the UAE won an order for two of LeTourneau designed, high-spec Super 116E rigs. These rigs are expected to include full LeTourneau drilling packages, including top drive drill works, electrical systems and mud pumps. Although this win will not add materially to LeTourneau's backlog, as the two jack-up rig kits and one of the drilling packages has already been purchased by the shipyard, it is nonetheless excellent news and confirms a superior design of a LeTourneau jack-up rigs.
That concludes our prepared remarks. With Melissa's assistance, we will now open it up for questions."

And we've been quite candid with our crews and as well as with the investment community that we do believe that at some point it will make sense to use the land rig fleet as a source of capital for further expansion and to the offshore side of the business. So we're watching for that opportunity. At this point, I would say that we probably -- even though there is some new construction, there's still quite a bit of idle equipment so that the utilization, the high utilization is at the upper end of the market.

The high-spec jack-up markets been north at 90% utilization for quite sometime, however, haven't been able to really necessarily push pricing on that end because of the oversupply in the standard jack-up market. Your commentary continues to be very bullish on high-specs, maybe even incrementally so, over the course of the past three months. So are we at that point where you finally able to get some pricing power to high-spec market?"

And we think those rates are continuing to go up in the U.K. sector and, certainly, the Norwegian sector that we're looking at right now with the Skeie rigs. But overall, I think you're going to see an increase in day rates in the higher-spec rigs, simply because there's going to be more demand over the next year. As you've heard us mentioned before in Southeast Asia, there are a few tenders out for HPHT rigs there, once again, approaching the 2 million.

300794,114308474,84388,"Rowan Companies Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter 2010 earnings call.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter 2010 earnings call. I want to begin by noting that in September, we completed our acquisition of Skeie Drilling in production and its three in class high specification jack-up rigs, and I want to take this opportunity to welcome the SKDP employees joining Rowan.
The talented team at Skeie has worked hard with the Keppel FELS shipboard in Singapore to help design and deliver this new generation of rig that will be certified to work in the demanding Norwegian sector of the North Sea, where we see increasing demand for high-spec jack-ups. This design also provides our customers the flexibility of using a jack-up for simultaneous drilling and production operations.
We are proud to own these exceptional drilling rigs and look forward to working with our new team members from SKDP to make this a successful investment.
On that note, I am very pleased to announce that we've received a commitment for the Rowan Viking, the first of the three in class rigs to be delivered. We are not yet at liberty to disclose the customer pending partner approval, but we believe the customer could have work in the U.K. sector for the rig well beyond our initial 19-month commitment. The rate is in the low 200s which is slightly below our target day rate to achieve a 12% internal rate of return. However, the anticipated contract commencement date in early March 2011 allows us to go straight to work following mobilization and operational and regulatory startup.
We thereby avoid idle time following operational availability, which was always a risk for this rig since we had so little time for marketing prior to delivery. We still see multiple opportunities which Mark will discuss in his comments for the second and third in class rigs that Rowan Stavanger and the Rowan Norway when they're delivered next year and continue to believe that we can meet or exceed our hurdle day rates.
This commitment continues our unbroken string of having work for our new builds following delivery and operational readiness. It also brings our total new contracts and commitments, added during 2010, to $1.3 billion, which is a significant achievement considering that utilization for the worldwide jack-up fleet has been in the low to mid-70% range this year. It is a testament to the ongoing demand for high-spec jack-ups.
I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, which reflect our continuing focus on cost-effectiveness and the progress we're making on reducing our effective tax rate. As Bill will explain, the quarter included a rate adjustment related to an expected full year tax rate of 26%. As our new rigs are delivered to our offshore drilling subsidiaries, our effective tax rate is projected to continue to improve.
Our balance sheet following the SKDP transaction remains quite strong, and we expect to extinguish all of the SKDP secured debt in the fourth quarter, utilizing cash provided by our unsecured debt offerings in 2009 and 2010. Capital expenditures related to our newbuild program, including the SKDP rigs, will largely be completed between now and the end of 2011 with an expected peak net debt to capitalization ratio in the mid-20% range, in line with our intention to maintain and invest in great credit profile.
Turning to LeTourneau. We are continuing to improve efficiencies and overall execution as new people are added to the management team and these strategic priorities are steadily bringing LeTourneau closer to an eventual separation from Rowan. In the meantime, the mining group continues to see strong demand for its innovative line of front loaders while the recent announcements regarding new and potential rig orders have boosted our optimism regarding improved demand for the drilling systems and offshore products groups.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to discuss the market for our rigs."

According to ODS-Petrodata, there are currently 468 jack-ups worldwide. Demand is 328 rigs, with utilization at 70%, down 6% from the May peak of 76%.

Demand is 328 rigs, with utilization at 70%, down 6% from the May peak of 76%. Despite the softening in worldwide demand, high-spec jack-ups continue to outperform the industry with a consistent utilization rate of 93%. Rowan's high-spec fleet is currently fully contracted.
Demand remains strong for these units as evidenced by our recent contract awards. As I mentioned on our last call, the EXL-II has contracted the BP for three works of work in Trinidad. The rig is in the final stages of modifications and acceptance and is expected to commence operations in late November. The EXL-III received a verbal commitment from McMoRan for one ultra-deep gas well commencing upon delivery in January 2011 at a day rate of $140,000 and that Joe Douglas also received a verbal commitment from McMoRan for one ultra-deep gas well commencing upon delivery in third quarter of 2011 at a rate of $180,000. Additionally, the Bob Palmer and the Ralph Coffman were recently contracted for three-year terms to Saudi Aramco for a total contract value of approximately $540 million. And as Matt mentioned, the Rowan Viking will go to work in the U.K. sector of the North Sea at a rate in the low 200s for approximately 19 months, commencing in February or early March 2011.
International tender and inquiry activity remains strong, and we currently see demand for more than 70 jack-ups over the next two years. Regions such as the North Sea, the Middle East and Southeast Asia are driving this demand. The drilling requirements in these tenders are increasingly stringent and Rowan's fleet of high-spec jack-ups is well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. I will now address our areas of operations.
Let's begin with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Supply in the region is 81 jack-ups while demand is 33 rigs for a utilization of 41%, remaining flat since our last call. We currently have nine jack-ups in the region with a contracted utilization of 78%. However, our average day rate of $119,000 leads our peer group by $49,000 per day. Four of our jack-ups are currently on contract with McMoRan, and we are very pleased with the partnership we built with them over the past few years. They currently have plans to expand their deep shelf exploration program and we expect to do all of their deep gas drilling.
While we have been fortunate in not being significantly impacted by permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to await permit approval for the Rowan Louisiana on the boudan [ph] well. The uncertainties surrounding the permitting process has caused contractors to tender their premium rigs out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. After the Bob Palmer and the Ralph Coffman migrate to the Middle East, only 10 marketed jack-ups that are 300-foot cantilevers or above will remain on the shelf. This remains a point of high concern for U.S. E&P companies.
Now turning to the North Sea. Supply is 38 jack-ups while demand is 31 rigs and contracted utilization is 82%. Rowan currently has three Super Gorilla class jack-ups in the area with an average day rate of $179,000. All three jack-ups are committed on long-term contracts. The Gorilla VII has completed modifications in the Dundee shipyard after mobilizing from West Africa. The rig is currently waiting on weather and is expected to commence operations for Apache sometime this week.
The North Sea remains one of the most active regions in terms of tenders and inquiries for high-spec jack-ups, with demand for as many as 25 units over the next two years. We remain confident in our ability to contract the Rowan Stavanger and the Rowan Norway prior to their respective delivery dates and consider the North Sea our focus market for these rigs.
Moving on to the Middle East. The supply on this region is 116 jack-ups while demand is currently at 87 rigs and contracted utilization is 75%. Rowan has nine jack-ups in the Middle East, six units are currently contracted at an average day rate of $131,000. The Middle East is expected to see an increase in demand in the near future, with Saudi Aramco up for tender for an additional six units, two in the Al-Khafji Joint Operating [Operations] area and recent approvals for South Pars projects in Iran. We are hopeful that these opportunities will absorb some of the excess capacity currently in the region.
Regarding our Onshore division, we have a marketed fleet of 28 land rigs located in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama and Alaska. Currently, 93% of our fleet has contracted at an average day rate of approximately $20,000. All 23 of our 2,000-horsepower rigs are contracted at 100% utilization as operators realize the advantage of fast-moving high-spec land rigs. Tender activity for high-spec land rigs remains high. The U.S. shale and gas plays continued to be the driving force of the land rig market, including the Haynesville and the deep Bossier areas and Rowan remains active in these regions.
This concludes our market overview. I will now turn the call over to Tom Burke."

This is another quarter of progress for LeTourneau, as we strengthened our management team, increased our focus on manufacturing efficiencies and saw a growth in our Mining business and a significant upturn in prospects",378,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning. This is another quarter of progress for LeTourneau, as we strengthened our management team, increased our focus on manufacturing efficiencies and saw a growth in our Mining business and a significant upturn in prospects for new jack-up orders. Mining markets continue to be very active.
Indices of mine commodity prices reached new highs this quarter, with continuing strength expected. These trends have led to significant greenfield mine startups, as well as replacement machines for existing fleets. Against this backdrop, we ended the quarter with 13 loaders in backlog, another 20 loaders, where we are well along on finalizing orders and a strong ongoing Pars business. This activity reflects our highest levels in several years. As a result, we expect solid growth in top and bottom line mining results in 2011.
In our Drilling Products business, jack-up quotation activity picked up significantly in the quarter. In fact, it was more active than we have seen for some time. This seems to come from a combination of both fleet replacement efforts and specific contracts opportunity. While it is too soon to say how this trend will affect our sales, conditions seem favorable for adding kits to our backlog over coming quarters.
As an indication of this trend, on October 19, Lamprell PLC, a shipyard in the UAE, entered into an MOU with Eurasia drilling for the construction of a LeTourneau design super 116E jack-up rig to work in the Caspian Sea. We're delighted with this announcement and are working with Lamprell to bring this project to fruition.
In our Drilling Capital Equipment business, we have been working through our backlog over the last several quarters and as with jack-up rig kits, floating activity has recently increased, leading us to be more optimistic for this business unit over the intermediate term.
As I mentioned earlier, we continued strengthening our management team this quarter, with our latest addition being Pharr Smith who will lead the commercial activities for all LeTourneau's oilfield businesses. Pharr started his career with LeTourneau, and brings a deep background of industry experience and contracts, having most recently served as VP Engineering, Project Management and New Construction for Transocean.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn it over to Bill Wells."

Starting with our drilling operations. Our third quarter 2010 revenues were $290 million, up by 12% over the prior year, but down by 12% from last quarter. The year-over-over increase reflects the impact of offs",1310,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our drilling operations. Our third quarter 2010 revenues were $290 million, up by 12% over the prior year, but down by 12% from last quarter. The year-over-over increase reflects the impact of offshore fleet additions, and increasing land utilization, while the sequential decrease results primarily from lower average day rates following the completion of work offshore Norway and West Africa.
We expect that our fourth quarter 2010 drilling revenues will be down from third quarter levels as the impacts of the Gorilla III, which completed work offshore Eastern Canada in October and the Bob Palmer which is on route to the Middle East, offset the late Q4 start up of the EXL-II offshore Trinidad and the return to service of the Gorilla VII in the North Sea this week. Our current drilling revenue backlog totals approximately $1.6 billion. We expect that approximately 16% of that amount will be realized as revenue during the remainder of 2010 and another 41% will occur in 2011 and the balance in 2012 or beyond.
Our third quarter drilling expenses of $142 million were approximately 17% above the prior year and 2% above last quarter as a result of fleet additions between periods, but only slightly above our previous guidance. The year-over-year increase reflects higher labor and related personnel costs, maintenance, reimbursables, and certain other activity-based expenses resulting from a 37% increase in operating days between periods that were partially offset by lower insurance costs. The sequential increase results primarily from higher reimbursable expenses.
We expect that our fourth quarter 2010 drilling expenses will be in the range of $147 million to $150 million, a 4% to 6% above the third quarter level, with most of that increase associated with the EXL-II, the Gorilla VII and the first in-class rig, the Rowan Viking. That would bring our full year 2010 drilling expenses to approximately $565 million or down by 2% from our previous guidance reflecting further progress on cost effectiveness.
Turning to our manufacturing operations. Third quarter revenues totaled $197 million, including $49 million of  arm's length sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $148 million during the third quarter, up by 10% over the prior year, but down by 9% from last quarter. Our Drilling Products and Systems segment contributed $127 million or 65% of total manufacturing revenues during the third quarter, including sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $78 million and featured $52 million from offshore rig projects and $13 million from drilling equipment.
Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment contributed revenues of $70 million during the third quarter, up by 68% over the prior year, but down by 22% from last quarter. Revenues include $22 million from shipments of mining equipment and $10 million from steel plate. We shipped four mining loaders during the third quarter, including two L-2350 and one L-1850 units. Our combined aftermarket parts and service revenues were $44 million during the third quarter, up by 48% over the prior year and by 23% over last quarter. Average aftermarket margins as a percentage of revenues have remained consistent among these periods in the low to mid-40s.
Our average operating margins is 15% of manufacturing revenues during the third quarter, up from 13% in the prior year, but unchanged from last quarter and slightly below our previous guidance due largely to warranty costs and inventory and costs to sales adjustments. At September 30, our manufacturing backlog of $267 million included $112 million related to offshore rig projects, $49 million of mining equipment, $39 million related to land rig projects and $23 million of drilling equipment, with the remainder primarily parts and other components. We booked approximately $59 million in orders in the third quarter or approximately 40% of external revenues during the period.
We expect that approximately 62% of our external manufacturing backlog at September 30 will be realized as revenues in the fourth quarter, in which case, external revenues in 2010 will slightly exceed 2009 levels. Based on the expected mix of sales, our average operating margin in the fourth quarter should remain in the mid-teens. Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $47 million, which tracked our previous guidance and was up by 8% over last year and by 2% over last quarter, primarily due to rig fleet additions.
Our latest estimate for 2010 depreciation is in the range of $189 million to $190 million, including approximately $50 million to $51 million in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter SG&A expenses totaled $35 million, up by 44% over last year, but down by 4% from last quarter and above our previous guidance, primarily due to settlement costs, including an additional $0.7 million provision to terminate our agency agreement in Mexico and $1.9 million to settle a nine-year-old dispute in Chile. Costs were otherwise in line with expectations.
Our latest estimate for 2010 SG&A cost is a range of $129 million to $130 million for the year, including approximately $32 million to $33 million in the fourth quarter. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, was $8.2 million during the third quarter, above our previous guidance as a result of our $400 million bond offering in August. Assuming no further borrowings and reflecting our full redemption of outstanding SKDP debt before year end as planned, we estimate fourth quarter 2010 interest expense will be in the range of $20 million to $21 million, about 1/2 of which should be capitalized.
Our expected full year effective tax rate is approximately 26%, down from 29% previously forecast as a result of the outbounding of one additional offshore rig into our international structure. Following the MARAD's approval, we were finally able to move the Gorilla VII to a foreign subsidiary, thus we provided taxes at a 19% rate in the third quarter.
Third quarter cash flows attributable to the SKDP acquisition included $259 million of SKDP cash on hand, less $39 million of SKDP debt purchased by Rowan, part of the acquisition effective date, $13 million paid for SKDP equity and $6 million of transaction costs. The resulting $201 million of net cash acquired included $193 million dedicated to the final shipyard payment on the Rowan Viking. Another $44 million of SKDP debt was purchased during the third quarter after the acquisition effective date.
Property and equipment additions totaled $111 million in the third quarter, which included $13 million for our third 240C jack-up, $56 million for the EXL rigs and $34 million for existing fleet, including contractually required upgrades. At September 30, we had approximately $964 million of remaining capital expenditures under our newbuild program including the N-Class construction commitments, of which approximately $568 million will occur in 2010 followed by $364 million in 2011 and the balance in early 2012.
Our estimated remaining 2010 capital expenditures include $33 million towards the Joe Douglas, $78 million for the EXL jack-ups, $456 million for the N-Class rigs and $71 million for our existing rigs, including contractually required upgrades. The remaining $23 million includes the cost of drill pipe needed improvements to our manufacturing facilities and shore basis and other enhancements. We currently intend to fully fund these 2010 expenditures through existing cash or operating cash flows.
Our outstanding debt totaled approximately $1.7 billion at September 30, including the $400 million of new seven-year bonds and the remaining $485 million of SKDP debt at fair value. We have another $600 million of bank financing available, including a $350 million term loan facility and a $250 million revolver. We expect to complete the redemption of outstanding SKDP debt in the fourth quarter without drawing on the term loan facility, which would reduce our outstanding debt to approximately $1.2 billion or 24% of book capitalization at year end.
That concludes our prepared remarks. With LaTonya's assistance, we will now open it up for questions."

But generally speaking, I mean, we don't like to see -- speaking for just Rowan now, we don't like to see new capacity coming into the market. But it's inevitable given the age of the world jack-up fleet out there, that there's going to have to be fleet renewal. A lot of the units that were once considered premium rigs are now in the standard or almost into the commodity brackets. And so I think the other contractors whose fleets are much older than ours and with less capable units are going to be faced with, what we believe, is kind of a steady building program for the next several years in order to upgrade their fleets. But as we've said numerous times, the thing that's helping us is that there's been new capacity that's come into the premium category. Of course, we differentiate ourselves and call ourselves high-spec because of the heavy drilling packages on the rigs that we've been delivering, but even on the premium categories, there's been a lot of new rigs delivered. But that's where all the demand is coming from. So that's why despite a lot of new capacity coming into the upper end of the jack-up market, the utilization overall for 350s and above has been in the high 80s even 90% where in the high-spec, for us, it's been running 100%. So we think that we will continue to be differentiated. There's very little of the equipment that's being -- or none of the equipment has been ordered and very little of it has been rumored is competitive with the most capable units in our fleet. And we expect that to continue to be a fairly narrow market with the strong returns into the market because of just the capital cost of that sort of equipment similar to the Skeie rigs."

I mean, if you look at our two Gorillas, the Skeie rigs, the workflow class rigs, 2.5 million hookload rigs the rigs with very high environmental criteria, so those are rigs that don't have a lot of competition. So in terms of that end of the market, we feel like, so far, there hasn't been much that's going to compete with those when that capability is required. But just as in the -- and I'll take this opportunity to say little bit more about this contract for the Rowan Viking that we just took in the low 200s, that's a contract that didn't need all the capabilities of that rig. There are contracts out there that do need all the capabilities of those rigs, and we believe we will get very attractive day rates on those and could have on the Viking. The problem with the Viking is its delivery is imminent. So there we were faced with do we wait for some of this work that we know is out there, kind of mid-year or even later in 2011. And when you look at it, we need somewhere in the 240s to achieve a 12% rate of return in the U.K. on this equipment. And if we had to wait three months to find work in that day rate, that's the equivalent of the contract that we took. So that's the rationale for that. But this rig beat out other high-spec rigs that have -- that could do the work and that bid actually substantially below what we got, but it's just a preferred class of equipment. And I think you'll see that when we're in the Norwegian market, which has such limited competition, or as we get -- find work in the other sectors that need that capability, that we'll see differentiated day rates."

Now in this case, we're very pleased to get this rig with this customer because we think that they could have a lot of work beyond this.

However, they are, however, there are 1.5 million hookload requirement, they are not the high-spec gas tenders that are still being evaluated by Aramco currently. We still believe there will be some of those tenders issued, they just haven't been issued yet. Four of the rigs are 116-Cs, two of them are extended-reach well prospects. They require a little more of a modified 116-C class rig which our rigs would certainly fit. They've used those rigs in the past, so we feel good about that. The North Sea, we're seeing demand for about 25 rigs. As Matt talked about earlier, the requirements from the operators have changed dramatically. There is some very upper premium jack-ups that have been stacked for over a year there that haven't secured jobs because the operators in the region are looking at Super Gorilla class or in-class type rigs to fill those needs. As I've mentioned also, that's one of the major focus areas of the N-Class rigs in our marketing effort. But what we're seeing in all different areas of the world, we're seeing it in South America, we're seeing it in Mexico. David Russell and I met with the Head of PEMEX a few weeks ago, and certainly, his vision is to hydrate that rig fleet and increase the operating capability of that rig fleet. And you're seeing it in different basins and med for HPHT requirements certainly in West Africa in certain cases. But it's pretty widespread. There's no question, you've heard us it say before, that tender requirements worldwide have become more stringent. I think you would see in the next couple of years out of the 70-rig demand scenario, you would see that number be higher than 30 in the next two years. I hope that answers your question, Rob."

And he is very proud of the fact that they've been able to enforce some of these restrictions. And along this line, they're trying to upgrade the fleet, is what they're trying to do. And he spent a lot of time talking about that. And so that's why you're seeing, on the first two tenders, there's a 350- and a 300-foot tender, one was for 486 days and the other one was for 662 days. They had the 10-year restriction, we did not tender those because we didn't have rigs that were available that would meet that requirement at the time. They've also come out with some fast-track tenders. I believe, there are four of them. And those are just a bridge to the end of the year, give them time to get some tenders approved. And they had like 40 to 60 days in term on them, and mainly for incumbent rigs that are operating there. But they're in review currently. They have a 350 for 730 days and two 300-foot cantilevers coming out in excess of 700 days and then one that we're really interested in taking a look at it is there's a tender requirement for a little over 800 days that possibly one of our skid-off rigs out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could be contracted for. So we're very excited about seeing that tender when it comes out. And then they're in review right now for as many as seven to nine additional tenders currently that's why you saw those short-term fast-track tenders."

300794,114308474,84410,"Rowan Companies Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter 2010 earnings call.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter 2010 earnings call. I want to begin by noting that in September, we completed our acquisition of Skeie Drilling in production and its three in class high specification jack-up rigs, and I want to take this opportunity to welcome the SKDP employees joining Rowan.
The talented team at Skeie has worked hard with the Keppel FELS shipboard in Singapore to help design and deliver this new generation of rig that will be certified to work in the demanding Norwegian sector of the North Sea, where we see increasing demand for high-spec jack-ups. This design also provides our customers the flexibility of using a jack-up for simultaneous drilling and production operations.
We are proud to own these exceptional drilling rigs and look forward to working with our new team members from SKDP to make this a successful investment.
On that note, I am very pleased to announce that we've received a commitment for the Rowan Viking, the first of the three in class rigs to be delivered. We are not yet at liberty to disclose the customer pending partner approval, but we believe the customer could have work in the U.K. sector for the rig well beyond our initial 19-month commitment. The rate is in the low 200s which is slightly below our target day rate to achieve a 12% internal rate of return. However, the anticipated contract commencement date in early March 2011 allows us to go straight to work following mobilization and operational and regulatory startup.
We thereby avoid idle time following operational availability, which was always a risk for this rig since we had so little time for marketing prior to delivery. We still see multiple opportunities which Mark will discuss in his comments for the second and third in class rigs that Rowan Stavanger and the Rowan Norway when they're delivered next year and continue to believe that we can meet or exceed our hurdle day rates.
This commitment continues our unbroken string of having work for our new builds following delivery and operational readiness. It also brings our total new contracts and commitments, added during 2010, to $1.3 billion, which is a significant achievement considering that utilization for the worldwide jack-up fleet has been in the low to mid-70% range this year. It is a testament to the ongoing demand for high-spec jack-ups.
I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, which reflect our continuing focus on cost-effectiveness and the progress we're making on reducing our effective tax rate. As Bill will explain, the quarter included a rate adjustment related to an expected full year tax rate of 26%. As our new rigs are delivered to our offshore drilling subsidiaries, our effective tax rate is projected to continue to improve.
Our balance sheet following the SKDP transaction remains quite strong, and we expect to extinguish all of the SKDP secured debt in the fourth quarter, utilizing cash provided by our unsecured debt offerings in 2009 and 2010. Capital expenditures related to our newbuild program, including the SKDP rigs, will largely be completed between now and the end of 2011 with an expected peak net debt to capitalization ratio in the mid-20% range, in line with our intention to maintain and invest in great credit profile.
Turning to LeTourneau. We are continuing to improve efficiencies and overall execution as new people are added to the management team and these strategic priorities are steadily bringing LeTourneau closer to an eventual separation from Rowan. In the meantime, the mining group continues to see strong demand for its innovative line of front loaders while the recent announcements regarding new and potential rig orders have boosted our optimism regarding improved demand for the drilling systems and offshore products groups.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to discuss the market for our rigs.

According to ODS-Petrodata, there are currently 468 jack-ups worldwide. Demand is 328 rigs, with utilization at 70%, down 6% from the May peak of 76%.

Demand is 328 rigs, with utilization at 70%, down 6% from the May peak of 76%. Despite the softening in worldwide demand, high-spec jack-ups continue to outperform the industry with a consistent utilization rate of 93%. Rowan's high-spec fleet is currently fully contracted.
Demand remains strong for these units as evidenced by our recent contract awards. As I mentioned on our last call, the EXL-II has contracted the BP for three works of work in Trinidad. The rig is in the final stages of modifications and acceptance and is expected to commence operations in late November. The EXL-III received a verbal commitment from McMoRan for one ultra-deep gas well commencing upon delivery in January 2011 at a day rate of $140,000 and that Joe Douglas also received a verbal commitment from McMoRan for one ultra-deep gas well commencing upon delivery in third quarter of 2011 at a rate of $180,000. Additionally, the Bob Palmer and the Ralph Coffman were recently contracted for three-year terms to Saudi Aramco for a total contract value of approximately $540 million. And as Matt mentioned, the Rowan Viking will go to work in the U.K. sector of the North Sea at a rate in the low 200s for approximately 19 months, commencing in February or early March 2011.
International tender and inquiry activity remains strong, and we currently see demand for more than 70 jack-ups over the next two years. Regions such as the North Sea, the Middle East and Southeast Asia are driving this demand. The drilling requirements in these tenders are increasingly stringent and Rowan's fleet of high-spec jack-ups is well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. I will now address our areas of operations.
Let's begin with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Supply in the region is 81 jack-ups while demand is 33 rigs for a utilization of 41%, remaining flat since our last call. We currently have nine jack-ups in the region with a contracted utilization of 78%. However, our average day rate of $119,000 leads our peer group by $49,000 per day. Four of our jack-ups are currently on contract with McMoRan, and we are very pleased with the partnership we built with them over the past few years. They currently have plans to expand their deep shelf exploration program and we expect to do all of their deep gas drilling.
While we have been fortunate in not being significantly impacted by permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to await permit approval for the Rowan Louisiana on the boudan [ph] well. The uncertainties surrounding the permitting process has caused contractors to tender their premium rigs out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. After the Bob Palmer and the Ralph Coffman migrate to the Middle East, only 10 marketed jack-ups that are 300-foot cantilevers or above will remain on the shelf. This remains a point of high concern for U.S. E&P companies.
Now turning to the North Sea. Supply is 38 jack-ups while demand is 31 rigs and contracted utilization is 82%. Rowan currently has three Super Gorilla class jack-ups in the area with an average day rate of $179,000. All three jack-ups are committed on long-term contracts. The Gorilla VII has completed modifications in the Dundee shipyard after mobilizing from West Africa. The rig is currently waiting on weather and is expected to commence operations for Apache sometime this week.
The North Sea remains one of the most active regions in terms of tenders and inquiries for high-spec jack-ups, with demand for as many as 25 units over the next two years. We remain confident in our ability to contract the Rowan Stavanger and the Rowan Norway prior to their respective delivery dates and consider the North Sea our focus market for these rigs.
Moving on to the Middle East. The supply on this region is 116 jack-ups while demand is currently at 87 rigs and contracted utilization is 75%. Rowan has nine jack-ups in the Middle East, six units are currently contracted at an average day rate of $131,000. The Middle East is expected to see an increase in demand in the near future, with Saudi Aramco up for tender for an additional six units, two in the Al-Khafji Joint Operating [Operations] area and recent approvals for South Pars projects in Iran. We are hopeful that these opportunities will absorb some of the excess capacity currently in the region.
Regarding our Onshore division, we have a marketed fleet of 28 land rigs located in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama and Alaska. Currently, 93% of our fleet has contracted at an average day rate of approximately $20,000. All 23 of our 2,000-horsepower rigs are contracted at 100% utilization as operators realize the advantage of fast-moving high-spec land rigs. Tender activity for high-spec land rigs remains high. The U.S. shale and gas plays continued to be the driving force of the land rig market, including the Haynesville and the deep Bossier areas and Rowan remains active in these regions.
This concludes our market overview. I will now turn the call over to Tom Burke.

This is another quarter of progress for LeTourneau, as we strengthened our management team, increased our focus on manufacturing efficiencies and saw a growth in our Mining business and a significant upturn in prospects for new jack-up orders. Mining markets continue to be very active.
Indices of mine commodity prices reached new highs this quarter, with continuing strength expected. These trends have led to significant greenfield mine startups, as well as replacement machines for existing fleets. Against this backdrop, we ended the quarter with 13 loaders in backlog, another 20 loaders, where we are well along on finalizing orders and a strong ongoing Pars business. This activity reflects our highest levels in several years. As a result, we expect solid growth in top and bottom line mining results in 2011.
In our Drilling Products business, jack-up quotation activity picked up significantly in the quarter. In fact, it was more active than we have seen for some time. This seems to come from a combination of both fleet replacement efforts and specific contracts opportunity. While it is too soon to say how this trend will affect our sales, conditions seem favorable for adding kits to our backlog over coming quarters.
As an indication of this trend, on October 19, Lamprell PLC, a shipyard in the UAE, entered into an MOU with Eurasia drilling for the construction of a LeTourneau design super 116E jack-up rig to work in the Caspian Sea. We're delighted with this announcement and are working with Lamprell to bring this project to fruition.
In our Drilling Capital Equipment business, we have been working through our backlog over the last several quarters and as with jack-up rig kits, floating activity has recently increased, leading us to be more optimistic for this business unit over the intermediate term.
As I mentioned earlier, we continued strengthening our management team this quarter, with our latest addition being Pharr Smith who will lead the commercial activities for all LeTourneau's oilfield businesses. Pharr started his career with LeTourneau, and brings a deep background of industry experience and contracts, having most recently served as VP Engineering, Project Management and New Construction for Transocean.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn it over to Bill Wells.

Our third quarter 2010 revenues were $290 million, up by 12% over the prior year, but down by 12% from last quarter. The year-over-over increase reflects the impact of offshore fleet additions, and increasing land utilization, while the sequential decrease results primarily from lower average day rates following the completion of work offshore Norway and West Africa.
We expect that our fourth quarter 2010 drilling revenues will be down from third quarter levels as the impacts of the Gorilla III, which completed work offshore Eastern Canada in October and the Bob Palmer which is on route to the Middle East, offset the late Q4 start up of the EXL-II offshore Trinidad and the return to service of the Gorilla VII in the North Sea this week. Our current drilling revenue backlog totals approximately $1.6 billion. We expect that approximately 16% of that amount will be realized as revenue during the remainder of 2010 and another 41% will occur in 2011 and the balance in 2012 or beyond.
Our third quarter drilling expenses of $142 million were approximately 17% above the prior year and 2% above last quarter as a result of fleet additions between periods, but only slightly above our previous guidance. The year-over-year increase reflects higher labor and related personnel costs, maintenance, reimbursables, and certain other activity-based expenses resulting from a 37% increase in operating days between periods that were partially offset by lower insurance costs. The sequential increase results primarily from higher reimbursable expenses.
We expect that our fourth quarter 2010 drilling expenses will be in the range of $147 million to $150 million, a 4% to 6% above the third quarter level, with most of that increase associated with the EXL-II, the Gorilla VII and the first in-class rig, the Rowan Viking. That would bring our full year 2010 drilling expenses to approximately $565 million or down by 2% from our previous guidance reflecting further progress on cost effectiveness.
Turning to our manufacturing operations. Third quarter revenues totaled $197 million, including $49 million of  arm's length sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $148 million during the third quarter, up by 10% over the prior year, but down by 9% from last quarter. Our Drilling Products and Systems segment contributed $127 million or 65% of total manufacturing revenues during the third quarter, including sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $78 million and featured $52 million from offshore rig projects and $13 million from drilling equipment.
Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment contributed revenues of $70 million during the third quarter, up by 68% over the prior year, but down by 22% from last quarter. Revenues include $22 million from shipments of mining equipment and $10 million from steel plate. We shipped four mining loaders during the third quarter, including two L-2350 and one L-1850 units. Our combined aftermarket parts and service revenues were $44 million during the third quarter, up by 48% over the prior year and by 23% over last quarter. Average aftermarket margins as a percentage of revenues have remained consistent among these periods in the low to mid-40s.
Our average operating margins is 15% of manufacturing revenues during the third quarter, up from 13% in the prior year, but unchanged from last quarter and slightly below our previous guidance due largely to warranty costs and inventory and costs to sales adjustments. At September 30, our manufacturing backlog of $267 million included $112 million related to offshore rig projects, $49 million of mining equipment, $39 million related to land rig projects and $23 million of drilling equipment, with the remainder primarily parts and other components. We booked approximately $59 million in orders in the third quarter or approximately 40% of external revenues during the period.
We expect that approximately 62% of our external manufacturing backlog at September 30 will be realized as revenues in the fourth quarter, in which case, external revenues in 2010 will slightly exceed 2009 levels. Based on the expected mix of sales, our average operating margin in the fourth quarter should remain in the mid-teens. Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $47 million, which tracked our previous guidance and was up by 8% over last year and by 2% over last quarter, primarily due to rig fleet additions.
Our latest estimate for 2010 depreciation is in the range of $189 million to $190 million, including approximately $50 million to $51 million in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter SG&A expenses totaled $35 million, up by 44% over last year, but down by 4% from last quarter and above our previous guidance, primarily due to settlement costs, including an additional $0.7 million provision to terminate our agency agreement in Mexico and $1.9 million to settle a nine-year-old dispute in Chile. Costs were otherwise in line with expectations.
Our latest estimate for 2010 SG&A cost is a range of $129 million to $130 million for the year, including approximately $32 million to $33 million in the fourth quarter. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, was $8.2 million during the third quarter, above our previous guidance as a result of our $400 million bond offering in August. Assuming no further borrowings and reflecting our full redemption of outstanding SKDP debt before year end as planned, we estimate fourth quarter 2010 interest expense will be in the range of $20 million to $21 million, about 1/2 of which should be capitalized.
Our expected full year effective tax rate is approximately 26%, down from 29% previously forecast as a result of the outbounding of one additional offshore rig into our international structure. Following the MARAD's approval, we were finally able to move the Gorilla VII to a foreign subsidiary, thus we provided taxes at a 19% rate in the third quarter.
Third quarter cash flows attributable to the SKDP acquisition included $259 million of SKDP cash on hand, less $39 million of SKDP debt purchased by Rowan, part of the acquisition effective date, $13 million paid for SKDP equity and $6 million of transaction costs. The resulting $201 million of net cash acquired included $193 million dedicated to the final shipyard payment on the Rowan Viking. Another $44 million of SKDP debt was purchased during the third quarter after the acquisition effective date.
Property and equipment additions totaled $111 million in the third quarter, which included $13 million for our third 240C jack-up, $56 million for the EXL rigs and $34 million for existing fleet, including contractually required upgrades. At September 30, we had approximately $964 million of remaining capital expenditures under our newbuild program including the N-Class construction commitments, of which approximately $568 million will occur in 2010 followed by $364 million in 2011 and the balance in early 2012.
Our estimated remaining 2010 capital expenditures include $33 million towards the Joe Douglas, $78 million for the EXL jack-ups, $456 million for the N-Class rigs and $71 million for our existing rigs, including contractually required upgrades. The remaining $23 million includes the cost of drill pipe needed improvements to our manufacturing facilities and shore basis and other enhancements. We currently intend to fully fund these 2010 expenditures through existing cash or operating cash flows.
Our outstanding debt totaled approximately $1.7 billion at September 30, including the $400 million of new seven-year bonds and the remaining $485 million of SKDP debt at fair value. We have another $600 million of bank financing available, including a $350 million term loan facility and a $250 million revolver. We expect to complete the redemption of outstanding SKDP debt in the fourth quarter without drawing on the term loan facility, which would reduce our outstanding debt to approximately $1.2 billion or 24% of book capitalization at year end.
That concludes our prepared remarks. With LaTonya's assistance, we will now open it up for questions.

So as we get through the financials, we'll start to look at what we think our list of opportunities are and make a decision about which route to go, and we may look at some sort of separation as a sale of the unit, with the back-up being the ability spin it off if we think the market would be supportive of that.

But generally speaking, I mean, we don't like to see -- speaking for just Rowan now, we don't like to see new capacity coming into the market. But it's inevitable given the age of the world jack-up fleet out there, that there's going to have to be fleet renewal. A lot of the units that were once considered premium rigs are now in the standard or almost into the commodity brackets. And so I think the other contractors whose fleets are much older than ours and with less capable units are going to be faced with, what we believe, is kind of a steady building program for the next several years in order to upgrade their fleets. But as we've said numerous times, the thing that's helping us is that there's been new capacity that's come into the premium category. Of course, we differentiate ourselves and call ourselves high-spec because of the heavy drilling packages on the rigs that we've been delivering, but even on the premium categories, there's been a lot of new rigs delivered. But that's where all the demand is coming from. So that's why despite a lot of new capacity coming into the upper end of the jack-up market, the utilization overall for 350s and above has been in the high 80s even 90% where in the high-spec, for us, it's been running 100%. So we think that we will continue to be differentiated. There's very little of the equipment that's being -- or none of the equipment has been ordered and very little of it has been rumored is competitive with the most capable units in our fleet. And we expect that to continue to be a fairly narrow market with the strong returns into the market because of just the capital cost of that sort of equipment similar to the Skeie rigs.

I mean, if you look at our two Gorillas, the Skeie rigs, the workflow class rigs, 2.5 million hookload rigs the rigs with very high environmental criteria, so those are rigs that don't have a lot of competition. So in terms of that end of the market, we feel like, so far, there hasn't been much that's going to compete with those when that capability is required. But just as in the -- and I'll take this opportunity to say little bit more about this contract for the Rowan Viking that we just took in the low 200s, that's a contract that didn't need all the capabilities of that rig. There are contracts out there that do need all the capabilities of those rigs, and we believe we will get very attractive day rates on those and could have on the Viking. The problem with the Viking is its delivery is imminent. So there we were faced with do we wait for some of this work that we know is out there, kind of mid-year or even later in 2011. And when you look at it, we need somewhere in the 240s to achieve a 12% rate of return in the U.K. on this equipment. And if we had to wait three months to find work in that day rate, that's the equivalent of the contract that we took. So that's the rationale for that. But this rig beat out other high-spec rigs that have -- that could do the work and that bid actually substantially below what we got, but it's just a preferred class of equipment. And I think you'll see that when we're in the Norwegian market, which has such limited competition, or as we get -- find work in the other sectors that need that capability, that we'll see differentiated day rates.

Now in this case, we're very pleased to get this rig with this customer because we think that they could have a lot of work beyond this. And from a tactical standpoint, putting this rig away makes increased scarcity value for the other two rigs which in turn, we think, when they get contracts, will ratchet up the expectations for these very high-spec units as far as future renewals on that rig.

We're seeing it certainly in the Middle East. The tenders part of your question was the tenders I talked about in my prepared remarks, two of those are gas tenders. However, they are, however, there are 1.5 million hookload requirement, they are not the high-spec gas tenders that are still being evaluated by Aramco currently. We still believe there will be some of those tenders issued, they just haven't been issued yet. Four of the rigs are 116-Cs, two of them are extended-reach well prospects. They require a little more of a modified 116-C class rig which our rigs would certainly fit. They've used those rigs in the past, so we feel good about that. The North Sea, we're seeing demand for about 25 rigs. As Matt talked about earlier, the requirements from the operators have changed dramatically. There is some very upper premium jack-ups that have been stacked for over a year there that haven't secured jobs because the operators in the region are looking at Super Gorilla class or in-class type rigs to fill those needs. As I've mentioned also, that's one of the major focus areas of the N-Class rigs in our marketing effort. But what we're seeing in all different areas of the world, we're seeing it in South America, we're seeing it in Mexico. David Russell and I met with the Head of PEMEX a few weeks ago, and certainly, his vision is to hydrate that rig fleet and increase the operating capability of that rig fleet. And you're seeing it in different basins and med for HPHT requirements certainly in West Africa in certain cases. But it's pretty widespread. There's no question, you've heard us it say before, that tender requirements worldwide have become more stringent. I think you would see in the next couple of years out of the 70-rig demand scenario, you would see that number be higher than 30 in the next two years. I hope that answers your question, Rob.

And he is very proud of the fact that they've been able to enforce some of these restrictions. And along this line, they're trying to upgrade the fleet, is what they're trying to do. And he spent a lot of time talking about that. And so that's why you're seeing, on the first two tenders, there's a 350- and a 300-foot tender, one was for 486 days and the other one was for 662 days. They had the 10-year restriction, we did not tender those because we didn't have rigs that were available that would meet that requirement at the time. They've also come out with some fast-track tenders. I believe, there are four of them. And those are just a bridge to the end of the year, give them time to get some tenders approved. And they had like 40 to 60 days in term on them, and mainly for incumbent rigs that are operating there. But they're in review currently. They have a 350 for 730 days and two 300-foot cantilevers coming out in excess of 700 days and then one that we're really interested in taking a look at it is there's a tender requirement for a little over 800 days that possibly one of our skid-off rigs out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could be contracted for. So we're very excited about seeing that tender when it comes out. And then they're in review right now for as many as seven to nine additional tenders currently that's why you saw those short-term fast-track tenders.

300794,114308474,84508,"Rowan Companies Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter 2010 earnings call.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter 2010 earnings call. I want to begin by noting that in September, we completed our acquisition of Skeie Drilling in production and its three in class high specification jack-up rigs, and I want to take this opportunity to welcome the SKDP employees joining Rowan.
The talented team at Skeie has worked hard with the Keppel FELS shipyard in Singapore to help design and deliver this new generation of rig that will be certified to work in the demanding Norwegian sector of the North Sea, where we see increasing demand for high-spec jack-ups. This design also provides our customers the flexibility of using a jack-up for simultaneous drilling and production operations.
We are proud to own these exceptional drilling rigs and look forward to working with our new team members from SKDP to make this a successful investment.
On that note, I am very pleased to announce that we've received a commitment for the Rowan Viking, the first of the three in class rigs to be delivered. We are not yet at liberty to disclose the customer pending partner approval, but we believe the customer could have work in the U.K. sector for the rig well beyond our initial 19-month commitment. The rate is in the low 200s, which is slightly below our target day rate to achieve the 12% internal rate of return. However, the anticipated contract commencement date in early March 2011 allows us to go straight to work following mobilization and operational and regulatory startup.
We thereby avoid idle time following operational availability, which was always a risk for this rig since we had so little time for marketing prior to delivery. We still see multiple opportunities which Mark will discuss in his comments for the second and third-in-class rigs that Rowan Stavanger and the Rowan Norway when they're delivered next year and continue to believe that we can meet or exceed our hurdle day rates.
This commitment continues our unbroken string of having work for our new builds following delivery and operational readiness. It also brings our total new contracts and commitments, added during 2010, to $1.3 billion, which is a significant achievement considering that utilization for the worldwide jack-up fleet has been in the low to mid-70% range this year. It is a testament to the ongoing demand for high-spec jack-ups.
I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, which reflect our continuing focus on cost-effectiveness and the progress we're making on reducing our effective tax rate. As Bill will explain, the quarter included a rate adjustment related to an expected full year tax rate of 26%. As our new rigs are delivered to our offshore drilling subsidiaries, our effective tax rate is projected to continue to improve.
Our balance sheet following the SKDP transaction remains quite strong, and we expect to extinguish all of the SKDP secured debt in the fourth quarter, utilizing cash provided by our unsecured debt offerings in 2009 and 2010. Capital expenditures related to our newbuild program, including the SKDP rigs, will largely be completed between now and the end of 2011 with an expected peak net debt to capitalization ratio in the mid-20% range, in line with our intention to maintain and invest in great credit profile.
Turning to LeTourneau. We are continuing to improve efficiencies and overall execution as new people are added to the management team and these strategic priorities are steadily bringing LeTourneau closer to an eventual separation from Rowan. In the meantime, the mining group continues to see strong demand for its innovative line of front loaders while the recent announcements regarding new and potential rig orders have boosted our optimism regarding improved demand for the drilling systems and offshore products groups.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to discuss the market for our rigs."

According to ODS-Petrodata, there are currently 468 jack-ups worldwide. Demand is 328 rigs, with utilization at 70%, down 6% from the May peak of 76%.

Demand is 328 rigs, with utilization at 70%, down 6% from the May peak of 76%. Despite the softening in worldwide demand, high-spec jack-ups continue to outperform the industry with a consistent utilization rate of 93%. Rowan's high-spec fleet is currently fully contracted.
Demand remains strong for these units as evidenced by our recent contract awards. As I mentioned on our last call, the EXL-II has contracted the BP for three works of work in Trinidad. The rig is in the final stages of modifications and acceptance and is expected to commence operations in late November. The EXL-III received a verbal commitment from McMoRan for one ultra-deep gas well commencing upon delivery in January 2011 at a day rate of $140,000 and that Joe Douglas also received a verbal commitment from McMoRan for one ultra-deep gas well commencing upon delivery in third quarter 2011 at a rate of $180,000. Additionally, the Bob Palmer and the Ralph Coffman were recently contracted for three-year terms to Saudi Aramco for a total contract value of approximately $540 million. And as Matt mentioned, the Rowan Viking will go to work in the U.K. sector of the North Sea at a rate in the low 200s for approximately 19 months, commencing in February or early March 2011.
International tender and inquiry activity remains strong, and we currently see demand for more than 70 jack-ups over the next two years. Regions such as the North Sea, the Middle East and Southeast Asia are driving this demand. The drilling requirements in these tenders are increasingly stringent and Rowan's fleet of high-spec jack-ups is well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. I will now address our areas of operation.
Let's begin with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Supply in the region is 81 jack-ups while demand is 33 rigs for a utilization of 41%, remaining flat since our last call. We currently have nine jack-ups in the region with a contracted utilization of 78%. However, our average day rate of $119,000 leads our peer group by $49,000 per day. Four of our jack-ups are currently on contract with McMoRan, and we are very pleased with the partnership we built with them over the past few years. They currently have plans to expand their deep shelf exploration program and we expect to do all of their deep gas drilling.
While we have been fortunate in not being significantly impacted by permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to await permit approval for the Rowan Louisiana on the boudan [ph] well. The uncertainties surrounding the permitting process has caused contractors to tender their premium rigs out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. After the Bob Palmer and the Ralph Coffman migrate to the Middle East, only 10 marketed jack-ups that are 300-foot cantilevers or above will remain on the shelf. This remains a point of high concern for U.S. E&P companies.
Now turning to the North Sea. Supply is 38 jack-ups while demand is 31 rigs and contracted utilization is 82%. Rowan currently has three Super Gorilla class jack-ups in the area with an average day rate of $179,000. All three jack-ups are committed on long-term contracts. The Gorilla VII has completed modifications in the Dundee shipyard after mobilizing from West Africa. The rig is currently waiting on weather and is expected to commence operations for Apache sometime this week.
The North Sea remains one of the most active regions in terms of tenders and inquiries for high-spec jack-ups, with demand for as many as 25 units over the next two years. We remain confident in our ability to contract the Rowan Stavanger and the Rowan Norway prior to their respective delivery dates and consider the North Sea our focus market for these rigs.
Moving on to the Middle East. The supply on this region is 116 jack-ups while demand is currently at 87 rigs and contracted utilization is 75%. Rowan has nine jack-ups in the Middle East, six units are currently contracted at an average day rate of $131,000. The Middle East is expected to see an increase in demand in the near future, with Saudi Aramco up for tender for an additional six units, two in the Al-Khafji Joint Operating [Operations] area and recent approvals for South Pars projects in Iran. We are hopeful that these opportunities will absorb some of the excess capacity currently in the region.
Regarding our Onshore division, we have a marketed fleet of 28 land rigs located in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama and Alaska. Currently, 93% of our fleet has contracted at an average day rate of approximately $20,000. All 23 of our 2,000-horsepower rigs are contracted at 100% utilization as operators realize the advantage of fast-moving high-spec land rigs. Tender activity for high-spec land rigs remains high. The U.S. shale and gas plays continued to be the driving force of the land rig market, including the Haynesville and the deep Bossier areas and Rowan remains active in these regions.
This concludes our market overview. I will now turn the call over to Tom Burke."

This is another quarter of progress for LeTourneau, as we strengthened our management team, increased our focus on manufacturing efficiencies and saw a growth in our Mining business and a significant upturn in prospects",377,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning. This is another quarter of progress for LeTourneau, as we strengthened our management team, increased our focus on manufacturing efficiencies and saw a growth in our Mining business and a significant upturn in prospects for new jack-up orders. Mining markets continue to be very active.
Indices of mine commodity prices reached new highs this quarter, with continuing strength expected. These trends have led to significant greenfield mine startups, as well as replacement machines for existing fleets. Against this backdrop, we ended the quarter with 13 loaders in backlog, another 20 loaders, where we are well along on finalizing orders and a strong ongoing Pars business. This activity reflects our highest levels in several years. As a result, we expect solid growth in top and bottom line mining results in 2011.
In our Drilling Products business, jack-up quotation activity picked up significantly in the quarter. In fact, it was more active than we have seen for some time. This seems to come from a combination of both fleet replacement efforts and specific contract opportunity. While it is too soon to say how this trend will affect our sales, conditions seem favorable for adding kits to our backlog over coming quarters.
As an indication of this trend, on October 19, Lamprell PLC, a shipyard in the UAE, entered into an MOU with Eurasia Drilling for the construction of a LeTourneau-designed super 116E jack-up rig to work in the Caspian Sea. We're delighted with this announcement and are working with Lamprell to bring this project to fruition.
In our Drilling Capital Equipment business, we have been working through our backlog over the last several quarters and as with jack-up rig kits, floating activity has recently increased, leading us to be more optimistic for this business unit over the intermediate term.
As I mentioned earlier, we continued strengthening our management team this quarter, with our latest addition being Pharr Smith, who will lead the commercial activities for all LeTourneau's oilfield businesses. Pharr started his career with LeTourneau, and brings a deep background of industry experience and contracts, having most recently served as VP Engineering, Project Management and New Construction for Transocean.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn it over to Bill Wells."

Starting with our drilling operations. Our third quarter 2010 revenues were $290 million, up by 12% over the prior year, but down by 12% from last quarter.

Our third quarter 2010 revenues were $290 million, up by 12% over the prior year, but down by 12% from last quarter. The year-over-over increase reflects the impact of offshore fleet additions, and increasing land utilization, while the sequential decrease results primarily from lower average day rates following the completion of work offshore Norway and West Africa.
We expect that our fourth quarter 2010 drilling revenues will be down from third quarter levels as the impacts of the Gorilla III, which completed work offshore Eastern Canada in October and the Bob Palmer which is on route to the Middle East, offset the late Q4 start up of the EXL-II offshore Trinidad and the return to service of the Gorilla VII in the North Sea this week. Our current drilling revenue backlog totals approximately $1.6 billion. We expect that approximately 16% of that amount will be realized as revenue during the remainder of 2010 and another 41% will occur in 2011 and the balance in 2012 or beyond.
Our third quarter drilling expenses of $142 million were approximately 17% above the prior year and 2% above last quarter as a result of fleet additions between periods, but only slightly above our previous guidance. The year-over-year increase reflects higher labor and related personnel costs, maintenance, reimbursables, and certain other activity-based expenses resulting from a 37% increase in operating days between periods that were partially offset by lower insurance costs. The sequential increase resulted primarily from higher reimbursable expenses.
We expect that our fourth quarter 2010 drilling expenses will be in the range of $147 million to $150 million, a 4% to 6% above the third quarter level, with most of that increase associated with the EXL-II, the Gorilla VII and the first in-class rig, the Rowan Viking. That would bring our full year 2010 drilling expenses to approximately $565 million or down by 2% from our previous guidance reflecting further progress on cost effectiveness.
Turning to our manufacturing operations. Third quarter revenues totaled $197 million, including $49 million of arm's length sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $148 million during the third quarter, up by 10% over the prior year, but down by 9% from last quarter. Our Drilling Products and Systems segment contributed $127 million or 65% of total manufacturing revenues during the third quarter, including sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $78 million and featured $52 million from offshore rig projects and $13 million from drilling equipment.
Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment contributed revenues of $70 million during the third quarter, up by 68% over the prior year, but down by 22% from last quarter. Revenues include $22 million from shipments of mining equipment and $10 million from steel plate. We shipped four mining loaders during the third quarter, including two L-2350 and one L-1850 units. Our combined aftermarket parts and service revenues were $44 million during the third quarter, up by 48% over the prior year and by 23% over last quarter. Average aftermarket margins as a percentage of revenues have remained consistent among these periods in the low to mid-40s.
Our average operating margins is 15% of manufacturing revenues during the third quarter, up from 13% in the prior year, but unchanged from last quarter and slightly below our previous guidance due largely to warranty costs and inventory and costs to sales adjustments. At September 30, our manufacturing backlog of $267 million included $112 million related to offshore rig projects, $49 million of mining equipment, $39 million related to land rig projects and $23 million of drilling equipment, with the remainder primarily parts and other components. We booked approximately $59 million in orders in the third quarter or approximately 40% of external revenues during the period.
We expect that approximately 62% of our external manufacturing backlog at September 30 will be realized as revenues in the fourth quarter, in which case, external revenues in 2010 will slightly exceed 2009 levels. Based on the expected mix of sales, our average operating margin in the fourth quarter should remain in the mid-teens. Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $47 million, which tracked our previous guidance and was up by 8% over last year and by 2% over last quarter, primarily due to rig fleet additions.
Our latest estimate for 2010 depreciation is in the range of $189 million to $190 million, including approximately $50 million to $51 million in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter SG&A expenses totaled $35 million, up by 44% over last year, but down by 4% from last quarter and above our previous guidance, primarily due to settlement costs, including an additional $0.7 million provision to terminate our agency agreement in Mexico and $1.9 million to settle a nine-year-old dispute in Chile. Costs were otherwise in line with expectations.
Our latest estimate for 2010 SG&A cost is a range of $129 million to $130 million for the year, including approximately $32 million to $33 million in the fourth quarter. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, was $8.2 million during the third quarter, above our previous guidance as a result of our $400 million bond offering in August. Assuming no further borrowings and reflecting our full redemption of outstanding SKDP debt before year end as planned, we estimate fourth quarter 2010 interest expense will be in the range of $20 million to $21 million, about 1/2 of which should be capitalized.
Our expected full year effective tax rate is approximately 26%, down from 29% previously forecast as a result of the outbounding of one additional offshore rig into our international structure. Following the MARAD's approval, we were finally able to move the Gorilla VII to a foreign subsidiary, thus we provided taxes at a 19% rate in the third quarter.
Third quarter cash flows attributable to the SKDP acquisition included $259 million of SKDP cash on hand, less $39 million of SKDP debt purchased by Rowan, part of the acquisition effective date, $13 million paid for SKDP equity and $6 million of transaction costs. The resulting $201 million of net cash acquired included $193 million dedicated to the final shipyard payment on the Rowan Viking. Another $44 million of SKDP debt was purchased during the third quarter after the acquisition effective date.
Property and equipment additions totaled $111 million in the third quarter, which included $13 million for our third 240C jack-up, $56 million for the EXL rigs and $34 million for our existing fleet, including contractually required upgrades. At September 30, we had approximately $964 million of remaining capital expenditures under our newbuild program including the N-Class construction commitments, of which approximately $568 million will occur in 2010 followed by $364 million in 2011 and the balance in early 2012.
Our estimated remaining 2010 capital expenditures include $33 million towards the Joe Douglas, $78 million for the EXL jack-ups, $456 million for the N-Class rigs and $71 million for our existing rigs, including contractually required upgrades. The remaining $23 million includes the cost of drill pipe needed improvements to our manufacturing facilities and shore basis and other enhancements. We currently intend to fully fund these 2010 expenditures through existing cash or operating cash flows.
Our outstanding debt totaled approximately $1.7 billion at September 30, including the $400 million of new seven-year bonds and the remaining $485 million of SKDP debt at fair value. We have another $600 million of bank financing available, including a $350 million term loan facility and a $250 million revolver. We expect to complete the redemption of outstanding SKDP debt in the fourth quarter without drawing on the term loan facility, which would reduce our outstanding debt to approximately $1.2 billion or 24% of book capitalization at year end.
That concludes our prepared remarks. With LaTonya's assistance, we will now open it up for questions."

But generally speaking, I mean, we don't like to see -- speaking for just Rowan now, we don't like to see new capacity coming into the market. But it's inevitable given the age of the world jack-up fleet out there, that there's going to have to be fleet renewal. A lot of the units that were once considered premium rigs are now in the standard or almost into the commodity brackets. And so I think the other contractors whose fleets are much older than ours and with less capable units are going to be faced with, [indiscernible] (0:36:27) we believe, kind of steady building program for the next several years in order to upgrade their fleets. But as we've said numerous times, the thing that's helping us is that there's been new capacity that's come into the premium category. Of course, we differentiate ourselves and call ourselves high-spec because of the heavy drilling packages on the rigs that we've been delivering, but even on the premium categories, there's been a lot of new rigs delivered. But that's where all the demand is coming from. So that's why despite a lot of new capacity coming into the upper end of the jack-up market, the utilization overall for 350s and above has been in the high 80s even 90% where in the high-spec, for us, it's been running 100%. So we think that we will continue to be differentiated. There's very little of the equipment that's being -- or none of the equipment has been ordered and very little of it has been rumored is competitive with the most capable units in our fleet. And we expect that to continue to be a fairly narrow market with the strong returns into the market because of just the capital cost of that sort of equipment similar to the Skeie rigs."

I mean, if you look at our two Gorillas, the Skeie rigs, the workforce class of rigs, all 2.5 million pound hookload rigs with very high environmental criteria, so those are rigs that don't have a lot of competition. So in terms of that end of the market, we feel like, so far, there hasn't been much that's going to compete with those when that capability is required. But just as in the -- and I'll take this opportunity to say little bit more about this contract for the Rowan Viking that we just took in the low 200s, that's a contract that didn't need all the capabilities of that rig. There are contracts out there that do need all the capabilities of those rigs, and we believe we will get very attractive day rates on those and could have on the Viking. The problem with the Viking is its delivery is imminent. So there we were faced with, do we wait for some of this work that we know is out there, kind of mid-year or even later in 2011? And when you look at it, we need somewhere in the 240s to achieve a 12% rate of return in the U.K. on this equipment. And if we had to wait three months to find work in that day rate, that's the equivalent of the contract that we took. So that's the rationale for that. But this rig beat out other high-spec rigs that have -- that could do the work and that bid actually substantially below what we got, but it's just a preferred class of equipment. And I think you'll see that when we're in the Norwegian market, which has such limited competition, or as we find work in the other sectors that need that capability, that we'll see differentiated day rates."

Now in this case, we're very pleased to get this rig with this customer because we think that they could have a lot of work beyond this.

We're seeing it certainly in the Middle East. The tenders, part of your question was the tenders I talked about in my prepared remarks, two of those are gas tenders. However, they are 1.5 million hookload requirement, they are not the high-spec gas tenders that are still being evaluated by Aramco currently. We still believe there will be some of those tenders issued, they just haven't been issued yet. Four of the rigs are 116-Cs, two of them are extended-reach oil prospects. They require a little more of a modified 116-C class rig which our rigs would certainly fit. They've used those rigs in the past, so we feel good about that. The North Sea, we're seeing demand for about 25 rigs. As Matt talked about earlier, the requirements from the operators have changed dramatically. There are some very upper premium jack-ups that have been stacked for over a year there that haven't secured jobs because the operators in the region are looking at Super Gorilla class or in-class type rigs to fill those needs. As I've mentioned also, that's one of the major focus areas of the N-Class rigs in our marketing effort. But what we're seeing in all different areas of the world, we're seeing it in South America, we're seeing it in Mexico. David Russell and I met with the Head of PEMEX a few weeks ago, and certainly, his vision is to hydrate that rig fleet and increase the operating capability of that rig fleet. And you're seeing it in different basins and med for HPHT requirements certainly in West Africa in certain cases. But it's pretty widespread. There's no question, you've heard us it say before, that tender requirements worldwide have become more stringent. I think you would see in the next couple of years out of the 70-rig demand scenario, you would see that number be higher than 30 in the next two years. I hope that answers your question, Rob."

And he is very proud of the fact that they've been able to enforce some of these restrictions. And along this line, they're trying to upgrade the fleet, is what they're trying to do. And he spent a lot of time talking about that. And so that's why you're seeing, on the first two tenders, there's a 350- and a 300-foot tender, one was for 486 days and the other one was for 662 days. They had the 10-year restriction, we did not tender those because we didn't have rigs that were available that would meet that requirement at the time. They've also come out with some fast-track tenders. I believe, there are four of them. And those are just a bridge to the end of the year, give them time to get some tenders approved. And they had like 40 to 60 days in term on them, and mainly for incumbent rigs that are operating there. But they're in review currently. They have a 350 for 730 days and two 300-foot cantilevers coming out in excess of 700 days and then one that we're really interested in taking a look at it is there's a tender requirement for a little over 800 days that possibly one of our skid-off rigs out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could be contracted for. So we're very excited about seeing that tender when it comes out. And then they're in review right now for as many as seven to nine additional tenders currently that's why you saw those short-term fast-track tenders."

300794,114308474,86574,"Rowan Companies Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives"," Thanks, Suzanne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter 2010 earnings call.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our third quarter 2010 earnings call. I want to begin by noting that in September, we completed our acquisition of Skeie Drilling in production and its three in class high specification jack-up rigs, and I want to take this opportunity to welcome the SKDP employees joining Rowan.
 The talented team at Skeie has worked hard with the Keppel FELS shipboard in Singapore to help design and deliver this new generation of rig that will be certified to work in the demanding Norwegian sector of the North Sea, where we see increasing demand for high-spec jack-ups. This design also provides our customers the flexibility of using a jack-up for simultaneous drilling and production operations.
 We are proud to own these exceptional drilling rigs and look forward to working with our new team members from SKDP to make this a successful investment.
 On that note, I am very pleased to announce that we've received a commitment for the Rowan Viking, the first of the three in class rigs to be delivered. We are not yet at liberty to disclose the customer pending partner approval, but we believe the customer could have work in the U.K. sector for the rig well beyond our initial 19-month commitment. The rate is in the low 200s which is slightly below our target day rate to achieve a 12% internal rate of return. However, the anticipated contract commencement date in early March 2011 allows us to go straight to work following mobilization and operational and regulatory startup.
 We thereby avoid idle time following operational availability, which was always a risk for this rig since we had so little time for marketing prior to delivery. We still see multiple opportunities which Mark will discuss in his comments for the second and third in class rigs that Rowan Stavanger and the Rowan Norway when they're delivered next year and continue to believe that we can meet or exceed our hurdle day rates.
 This commitment continues our unbroken string of having work for our new builds following delivery and operational readiness. It also brings our total new contracts and commitments, added during 2010, to $1.3 billion, which is a significant achievement considering that utilization for the worldwide jack-up fleet has been in the low to mid-70% range this year. It is a testament to the ongoing demand for high-spec jack-ups.
 I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, which reflect our continuing focus on cost-effectiveness and the progress we're making on reducing our effective tax rate. As Bill will explain, the quarter included a rate adjustment related to an expected full year tax rate of 26%. As our new rigs are delivered to our offshore drilling subsidiaries, our effective tax rate is projected to continue to improve.
 Our balance sheet following the SKDP transaction remains quite strong, and we expect to extinguish all of the SKDP secured debt in the fourth quarter, utilizing cash provided by our unsecured debt offerings in 2009 and 2010. Capital expenditures related to our newbuild program, including the SKDP rigs, will largely be completed between now and the end of 2011 with an expected peak net debt to capitalization ratio in the mid-20% range, in line with our intention to maintain and invest in great credit profile.
 Turning to LeTourneau. We are continuing to improve efficiencies and overall execution as new people are added to the management team and these strategic priorities are steadily bringing LeTourneau closer to an eventual separation from Rowan. In the meantime, the mining group continues to see strong demand for its innovative line of front loaders while the recent announcements regarding new and potential rig orders have boosted our optimism regarding improved demand for the drilling systems and offshore products groups.
 With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to discuss the market for our rigs.

According to ODS-Petrodata, there are currently 468 jack-ups worldwide. Demand is 328 rigs, with utilization at 70%, down 6% from the May peak of 76%.

Demand is 328 rigs, with utilization at 70%, down 6% from the May peak of 76%. Despite the softening in worldwide demand, high-spec jack-ups continue to outperform the industry with a consistent utilization rate of 93%. Rowan's high-spec fleet is currently fully contracted.
 Demand remains strong for these units as evidenced by our recent contract awards. As I mentioned on our last call, the EXL-II has contracted the BP for three works of work in Trinidad. The rig is in the final stages of modifications and acceptance and is expected to commence operations in late November. The EXL-III received a verbal commitment from McMoRan for one ultra-deep gas well commencing upon delivery in January 2011 at a day rate of $140,000 and that Joe Douglas also received a verbal commitment from McMoRan for one ultra-deep gas well commencing upon delivery in third quarter of 2011 at a rate of $180,000. Additionally, the Bob Palmer and the Ralph Coffman were recently contracted for three-year terms to Saudi Aramco for a total contract value of approximately $540 million. And as Matt mentioned, the Rowan Viking will go to work in the U.K. sector of the North Sea at a rate in the low 200s for approximately 19 months, commencing in February or early March 2011.
 International tender and inquiry activity remains strong, and we currently see demand for more than 70 jack-ups over the next two years. Regions such as the North Sea, the Middle East and Southeast Asia are driving this demand. The drilling requirements in these tenders are increasingly stringent and Rowan's fleet of high-spec jack-ups is well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. I will now address our areas of operations.
 Let's begin with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Supply in the region is 81 jack-ups while demand is 33 rigs for a utilization of 41%, remaining flat since our last call. We currently have nine jack-ups in the region with a contracted utilization of 78%. However, our average day rate of $119,000 leads our peer group by $49,000 per day. Four of our jack-ups are currently on contract with McMoRan, and we are very pleased with the partnership we built with them over the past few years. They currently have plans to expand their deep shelf exploration program and we expect to do all of their deep gas drilling.
 While we have been fortunate in not being significantly impacted by permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to await permit approval for the Rowan Louisiana on the boudan [ph] well. The uncertainties surrounding the permitting process has caused contractors to tender their premium rigs out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. After the Bob Palmer and the Ralph Coffman migrate to the Middle East, only 10 marketed jack-ups that are 300-foot cantilevers or above will remain on the shelf. This remains a point of high concern for U.S. E&P companies.
 Now turning to the North Sea. Supply is 38 jack-ups while demand is 31 rigs and contracted utilization is 82%. Rowan currently has three Super Gorilla class jack-ups in the area with an average day rate of $179,000. All three jack-ups are committed on long-term contracts. The Gorilla VII has completed modifications in the Dundee shipyard after mobilizing from West Africa. The rig is currently waiting on weather and is expected to commence operations for Apache sometime this week.
 The North Sea remains one of the most active regions in terms of tenders and inquiries for high-spec jack-ups, with demand for as many as 25 units over the next two years. We remain confident in our ability to contract the Rowan Stavanger and the Rowan Norway prior to their respective delivery dates and consider the North Sea our focus market for these rigs.
 Moving on to the Middle East. The supply on this region is 116 jack-ups while demand is currently at 87 rigs and contracted utilization is 75%. Rowan has nine jack-ups in the Middle East, six units are currently contracted at an average day rate of $131,000. The Middle East is expected to see an increase in demand in the near future, with Saudi Aramco up for tender for an additional six units, two in the Al-Khafji Joint Operating [Operations] area and recent approvals for South Pars projects in Iran. We are hopeful that these opportunities will absorb some of the excess capacity currently in the region.
 Regarding our Onshore division, we have a marketed fleet of 28 land rigs located in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama and Alaska. Currently, 93% of our fleet has contracted at an average day rate of approximately $20,000. All 23 of our 2,000-horsepower rigs are contracted at 100% utilization as operators realize the advantage of fast-moving high-spec land rigs. Tender activity for high-spec land rigs remains high. The U.S. shale and gas plays continued to be the driving force of the land rig market, including the Haynesville and the deep Bossier areas and Rowan remains active in these regions.
 This concludes our market overview. I will now turn the call over to Tom Burke.

This is another quarter of progress for LeTourneau, as we strengthened our management team, increased our focus on manufacturing efficiencies and saw a growth in our Mining business and a significant upturn in prospects",378," Thank you, Mark, and good morning. This is another quarter of progress for LeTourneau, as we strengthened our management team, increased our focus on manufacturing efficiencies and saw a growth in our Mining business and a significant upturn in prospects for new jack-up orders. Mining markets continue to be very active.
 Indices of mine commodity prices reached new highs this quarter, with continuing strength expected. These trends have led to significant greenfield mine startups, as well as replacement machines for existing fleets. Against this backdrop, we ended the quarter with 13 loaders in backlog, another 20 loaders, where we are well along on finalizing orders and a strong ongoing Pars business. This activity reflects our highest levels in several years. As a result, we expect solid growth in top and bottom line mining results in 2011.
 In our Drilling Products business, jack-up quotation activity picked up significantly in the quarter. In fact, it was more active than we have seen for some time. This seems to come from a combination of both fleet replacement efforts and specific contracts opportunity. While it is too soon to say how this trend will affect our sales, conditions seem favorable for adding kits to our backlog over coming quarters.
 As an indication of this trend, on October 19, Lamprell PLC, a shipyard in the UAE, entered into an MOU with Eurasia drilling for the construction of a LeTourneau design super 116E jack-up rig to work in the Caspian Sea. We're delighted with this announcement and are working with Lamprell to bring this project to fruition.
 In our Drilling Capital Equipment business, we have been working through our backlog over the last several quarters and as with jack-up rig kits, floating activity has recently increased, leading us to be more optimistic for this business unit over the intermediate term.
 As I mentioned earlier, we continued strengthening our management team this quarter, with our latest addition being Pharr Smith who will lead the commercial activities for all LeTourneau's oilfield businesses. Pharr started his career with LeTourneau, and brings a deep background of industry experience and contracts, having most recently served as VP Engineering, Project Management and New Construction for Transocean.
 That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn it over to Bill Wells.

Starting with our drilling operations. Our third quarter 2010 revenues were $290 million, up by 12% over the prior year, but down by 12% from last quarter.

Our third quarter 2010 revenues were $290 million, up by 12% over the prior year, but down by 12% from last quarter. The year-over-over increase reflects the impact of offshore fleet additions, and increasing land utilization, while the sequential decrease results primarily from lower average day rates following the completion of work offshore Norway and West Africa.
 We expect that our fourth quarter 2010 drilling revenues will be down from third quarter levels as the impacts of the Gorilla III, which completed work offshore Eastern Canada in October and the Bob Palmer which is on route to the Middle East, offset the late Q4 start up of the EXL-II offshore Trinidad and the return to service of the Gorilla VII in the North Sea this week. Our current drilling revenue backlog totals approximately $1.6 billion. We expect that approximately 16% of that amount will be realized as revenue during the remainder of 2010 and another 41% will occur in 2011 and the balance in 2012 or beyond.
 Our third quarter drilling expenses of $142 million were approximately 17% above the prior year and 2% above last quarter as a result of fleet additions between periods, but only slightly above our previous guidance. The year-over-year increase reflects higher labor and related personnel costs, maintenance, reimbursables, and certain other activity-based expenses resulting from a 37% increase in operating days between periods that were partially offset by lower insurance costs. The sequential increase results primarily from higher reimbursable expenses.
 We expect that our fourth quarter 2010 drilling expenses will be in the range of $147 million to $150 million, a 4% to 6% above the third quarter level, with most of that increase associated with the EXL-II, the Gorilla VII and the first in-class rig, the Rowan Viking. That would bring our full year 2010 drilling expenses to approximately $565 million or down by 2% from our previous guidance reflecting further progress on cost effectiveness.
 Turning to our manufacturing operations. Third quarter revenues totaled $197 million, including $49 million of  arm's length sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $148 million during the third quarter, up by 10% over the prior year, but down by 9% from last quarter. Our Drilling Products and Systems segment contributed $127 million or 65% of total manufacturing revenues during the third quarter, including sales to our Drilling division. External revenues were $78 million and featured $52 million from offshore rig projects and $13 million from drilling equipment.
 Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment contributed revenues of $70 million during the third quarter, up by 68% over the prior year, but down by 22% from last quarter. Revenues include $22 million from shipments of mining equipment and $10 million from steel plate. We shipped four mining loaders during the third quarter, including two L-2350 and one L-1850 units. Our combined aftermarket parts and service revenues were $44 million during the third quarter, up by 48% over the prior year and by 23% over last quarter. Average aftermarket margins as a percentage of revenues have remained consistent among these periods in the low to mid-40s.
 Our average operating margins is 15% of manufacturing revenues during the third quarter, up from 13% in the prior year, but unchanged from last quarter and slightly below our previous guidance due largely to warranty costs and inventory and costs to sales adjustments. At September 30, our manufacturing backlog of $267 million included $112 million related to offshore rig projects, $49 million of mining equipment, $39 million related to land rig projects and $23 million of drilling equipment, with the remainder primarily parts and other components. We booked approximately $59 million in orders in the third quarter or approximately 40% of external revenues during the period.
 We expect that approximately 62% of our external manufacturing backlog at September 30 will be realized as revenues in the fourth quarter, in which case, external revenues in 2010 will slightly exceed 2009 levels. Based on the expected mix of sales, our average operating margin in the fourth quarter should remain in the mid-teens. Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $47 million, which tracked our previous guidance and was up by 8% over last year and by 2% over last quarter, primarily due to rig fleet additions.
 Our latest estimate for 2010 depreciation is in the range of $189 million to $190 million, including approximately $50 million to $51 million in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter SG&A expenses totaled $35 million, up by 44% over last year, but down by 4% from last quarter and above our previous guidance, primarily due to settlement costs, including an additional $0.7 million provision to terminate our agency agreement in Mexico and $1.9 million to settle a nine-year-old dispute in Chile. Costs were otherwise in line with expectations.
 Our latest estimate for 2010 SG&A cost is a range of $129 million to $130 million for the year, including approximately $32 million to $33 million in the fourth quarter. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, was $8.2 million during the third quarter, above our previous guidance as a result of our $400 million bond offering in August. Assuming no further borrowings and reflecting our full redemption of outstanding SKDP debt before year end as planned, we estimate fourth quarter 2010 interest expense will be in the range of $20 million to $21 million, about 1/2 of which should be capitalized.
 Our expected full year effective tax rate is approximately 26%, down from 29% previously forecast as a result of the outbounding of one additional offshore rig into our international structure. Following the MARAD's approval, we were finally able to move the Gorilla VII to a foreign subsidiary, thus we provided taxes at a 19% rate in the third quarter.
 Third quarter cash flows attributable to the SKDP acquisition included $259 million of SKDP cash on hand, less $39 million of SKDP debt purchased by Rowan, part of the acquisition effective date, $13 million paid for SKDP equity and $6 million of transaction costs. The resulting $201 million of net cash acquired included $193 million dedicated to the final shipyard payment on the Rowan Viking. Another $44 million of SKDP debt was purchased during the third quarter after the acquisition effective date.
 Property and equipment additions totaled $111 million in the third quarter, which included $13 million for our third 240C jack-up, $56 million for the EXL rigs and $34 million for existing fleet, including contractually required upgrades. At September 30, we had approximately $964 million of remaining capital expenditures under our newbuild program including the N-Class construction commitments, of which approximately $568 million will occur in 2010 followed by $364 million in 2011 and the balance in early 2012.
 Our estimated remaining 2010 capital expenditures include $33 million towards the Joe Douglas, $78 million for the EXL jack-ups, $456 million for the N-Class rigs and $71 million for our existing rigs, including contractually required upgrades. The remaining $23 million includes the cost of drill pipe needed improvements to our manufacturing facilities and shore basis and other enhancements. We currently intend to fully fund these 2010 expenditures through existing cash or operating cash flows.
 Our outstanding debt totaled approximately $1.7 billion at September 30, including the $400 million of new seven-year bonds and the remaining $485 million of SKDP debt at fair value. We have another $600 million of bank financing available, including a $350 million term loan facility and a $250 million revolver. We expect to complete the redemption of outstanding SKDP debt in the fourth quarter without drawing on the term loan facility, which would reduce our outstanding debt to approximately $1.2 billion or 24% of book capitalization at year end.
 That concludes our prepared remarks. With LaTonya's assistance, we will now open it up for questions.

But generally speaking, I mean, we don't like to see -- speaking for just Rowan now, we don't like to see new capacity coming into the market. But it's inevitable given the age of the world jack-up fleet out there, that there's going to have to be fleet renewal. A lot of the units that were once considered premium rigs are now in the standard or almost into the commodity brackets. And so I think the other contractors whose fleets are much older than ours and with less capable units are going to be faced with, what we believe, is kind of a steady building program for the next several years in order to upgrade their fleets. But as we've said numerous times, the thing that's helping us is that there's been new capacity that's come into the premium category. Of course, we differentiate ourselves and call ourselves high-spec because of the heavy drilling packages on the rigs that we've been delivering, but even on the premium categories, there's been a lot of new rigs delivered. But that's where all the demand is coming from. So that's why despite a lot of new capacity coming into the upper end of the jack-up market, the utilization overall for 350s and above has been in the high 80s even 90% where in the high-spec, for us, it's been running 100%. So we think that we will continue to be differentiated. There's very little of the equipment that's being -- or none of the equipment has been ordered and very little of it has been rumored is competitive with the most capable units in our fleet. And we expect that to continue to be a fairly narrow market with the strong returns into the market because of just the capital cost of that sort of equipment similar to the Skeie rigs.

I mean, if you look at our two Gorillas, the Skeie rigs, the workflow class rigs, 2.5 million hookload rigs the rigs with very high environmental criteria, so those are rigs that don't have a lot of competition. So in terms of that end of the market, we feel like, so far, there hasn't been much that's going to compete with those when that capability is required. But just as in the -- and I'll take this opportunity to say little bit more about this contract for the Rowan Viking that we just took in the low 200s, that's a contract that didn't need all the capabilities of that rig. There are contracts out there that do need all the capabilities of those rigs, and we believe we will get very attractive day rates on those and could have on the Viking. The problem with the Viking is its delivery is imminent. So there we were faced with do we wait for some of this work that we know is out there, kind of mid-year or even later in 2011. And when you look at it, we need somewhere in the 240s to achieve a 12% rate of return in the U.K. on this equipment. And if we had to wait three months to find work in that day rate, that's the equivalent of the contract that we took. So that's the rationale for that. But this rig beat out other high-spec rigs that have -- that could do the work and that bid actually substantially below what we got, but it's just a preferred class of equipment. And I think you'll see that when we're in the Norwegian market, which has such limited competition, or as we get -- find work in the other sectors that need that capability, that we'll see differentiated day rates.

Now in this case, we're very pleased to get this rig with this customer because we think that they could have a lot of work beyond this.

We're seeing a trend not only in the Middle East, but Southeast Asia.

We're seeing it certainly in the Middle East. The tenders part of your question was the tenders I talked about in my prepared remarks, two of those are gas tenders. However, they are, however, there are 1.5 million hookload requirement, they are not the high-spec gas tenders that are still being evaluated by Aramco currently. We still believe there will be some of those tenders issued, they just haven't been issued yet. Four of the rigs are 116-Cs, two of them are extended-reach well prospects. They require a little more of a modified 116-C class rig which our rigs would certainly fit. They've used those rigs in the past, so we feel good about that. The North Sea, we're seeing demand for about 25 rigs. As Matt talked about earlier, the requirements from the operators have changed dramatically. There is some very upper premium jack-ups that have been stacked for over a year there that haven't secured jobs because the operators in the region are looking at Super Gorilla class or in-class type rigs to fill those needs. As I've mentioned also, that's one of the major focus areas of the N-Class rigs in our marketing effort. But what we're seeing in all different areas of the world, we're seeing it in South America, we're seeing it in Mexico. David Russell and I met with the Head of PEMEX a few weeks ago, and certainly, his vision is to hydrate that rig fleet and increase the operating capability of that rig fleet. And you're seeing it in different basins and med for HPHT requirements certainly in West Africa in certain cases. But it's pretty widespread. There's no question, you've heard us it say before, that tender requirements worldwide have become more stringent. I think you would see in the next couple of years out of the 70-rig demand scenario, you would see that number be higher than 30 in the next two years. I hope that answers your question, Rob.

And he is very proud of the fact that they've been able to enforce some of these restrictions. And along this line, they're trying to upgrade the fleet, is what they're trying to do. And he spent a lot of time talking about that. And so that's why you're seeing, on the first two tenders, there's a 350- and a 300-foot tender, one was for 486 days and the other one was for 662 days. They had the 10-year restriction, we did not tender those because we didn't have rigs that were available that would meet that requirement at the time. They've also come out with some fast-track tenders. I believe, there are four of them. And those are just a bridge to the end of the year, give them time to get some tenders approved. And they had like 40 to 60 days in term on them, and mainly for incumbent rigs that are operating there. But they're in review currently. They have a 350 for 730 days and two 300-foot cantilevers coming out in excess of 700 days and then one that we're really interested in taking a look at it is there's a tender requirement for a little over 800 days that possibly one of our skid-off rigs out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could be contracted for. So we're very excited about seeing that tender when it comes out. And then they're in review right now for as many as seven to nine additional tenders currently that's why you saw those short-term fast-track tenders.
