As Paul said, this morning we’ll discuss our fourth quarter and our full year results as well as Northrop Grumman’s outlook for 2010. We had a solid finish to 2009.
Earnings per share totaled $5.21 exceeding our guidance of $5 to 5.15 and we had outstanding cash results. Cash from operations and free cash flow were very strong and when adjusted for discretionary pension contributions and the taxes that we paid on the TASC sale were at the high end of our guidance and comparable to last year’s record levels.
During 2009 we continued to deploy cash to create value for our shareholders. We raised the dividend by 7.5% and we used $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 23 million shares of our stock including 8.4 million shares repurchased in the fourth quarter.
At year end we had $924 million remaining on our share purchase reauthorization. As we previously announced, the most recent increase in the authorization was funded by the net proceeds from the TASC divestiture. Another 2009 highlight is our yearend backlog of more than $69 billion. Total backlog continues to represent more than two years of sales and includes $32 billion of new awards captured in 2009. We’re very pleased that despite delays on several competitions, our book to bill ratio for the year was 96%. We continue to capture high quality competitive contracts.
Turning to results for our businesses, Aerospace Systems continues to perform well. Sales grew 7% for the quarter and 6% for the year. Our unmanned and manned aircraft programs along with our restricted work were the drivers for the quarter and for the year. Volume increases on programs like BAMS, Global Hawk, F-35, F-18 and the B-2 have more than offset declines in some of our missile and space programs. We expect continued strength in both manned and unmanned programs.
During the quarter we received a $300 million contract for five Global Hawks. This fixed price and Santa Fe contract runs through 2011. We also introduced the first Euro Hawk unmanned vehicle, marking the first international configuration of the Global Hawk. Aerospace also continues to improve their margin rates with expansion to 10.5% for the quarter and 10.3% for the year.
Electronic Systems also had a strong quarter in the year. Sales increased 2% for the quarter and 9% for the year was solid margin rates for both periods. During the fourth quarter the Royal Australian Air Force accepted initial delivery of the first two Wedgetail aircraft and we reached agreement on delivery requirements.
Final delivery and full acceptance is expected later this year and delivery of all six aircraft is planned by mid 2011. With Wedgetail development complete and agreement reached on the remaining contract requirements, we believe the financial risk on Wedgetail is behind us. For Information Systems fourth quarter sales were comparable to the prior year and full year sales increased 5%.
Margin rates for the quarter and the year were impacted by state income taxes resulting from the TASC sale and lower performance on the Virginia outsourcing contract know as VITA. These two items offset the positive margin rate trends generated in our intelligence and defense businesses, which now account for about 75% of Information Systems sales. These two profitable growing businesses are very well positioned in their markets, including cybersecurity and C4ISR. They will be the performance drivers for the sector. As a result of strong business captured during the year, IS grew backlog by nearly $480 million or 6% to 8.8 billion.
During the quarter, Information Systems won the five-year $580 million IBCS program, which is the first step toward enabling integrated joint and combined Air and Missile Defense capabilities. In Shipbuilding, we continue to focus on improving performance in the gulf through the new operating system that we put in place last year. We’re making good progress.
The new operating system is providing increased visibility in the workflow and it’s enabling us to better sequence work to reduced cost growth that results from work performed out of sequence. Currently, we’re addressing two quality issues that received some attention in the press and I wanted to address each of them individually.
Regarding pipe weld, we’ve been working closely with the Navy since last year when it was discovered that some of our pipe joints may not have met specifications. Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, our EACs were updated to include the expected cost to repair the pipe welds. We believe we understand what’s required to correct the piping.
Late last year, LPD 21 experienced a problem with its main proportion diesel engines. We’re working hand in hand with the Navy to identify and understand the real causes of the engine problems and to support implementation of the appropriate corrective actions. Based on what we know today, we do not believe that the corrective actions represent significant financial exposure for the company.
We’re confident that quality and performance will continue to improve as we refine and mature the operating approach that’s now in place on the Gulf Coast. The new processes providing better information on a more timely basis and have helped us address some of the cost issues that we faced on our Gulf Coast programs particularly the LPD. Today, we’re under contract for four remaining LPD’s which will be delivered over the next three years.
As a result of the LPD issues that we’ve described over the last year, we expect minimum margin on these shifts and the pace of our margin rate improvement in shipbuilding will be impacted by the substantial sales volumes on these contracts over the next three years. In Technical Services, sales increased an 11% for the quarter and 10% for the year. And the margin rates also expanded for both periods.
Business capture was outstanding this year. TS won some major competitive awards such as the $3.8 billion KC-10 program and at the end of the year they captured the Saudi Arabian National Guard Contract which has a potential award value of $550 million. For the year TS backlog increased by 10%. So now let’s talk about our priorities for 2010. Northrop Grumman has a tremendous range of capabilities that are well aligned with our customer spending priorities and we have outstanding human technical and financial resources.
Our number one priority is to achieve sustainable performance improvement. That’s the message I conveyed to our senior management team at the beginning of the year. Our goal is to instill a true culture of performance across the entire organization. This will shape our decision making, the way we set our strategy and the way that we measure and incentivize our team.
Our leadership is driving improvement with a real sense of urgency. Change will not occur overnight but we will succeed at this. I’m excited about what I believe the team can achieve in creating value for our shareholders and for our shareholders and for our customers. Earlier this week the administration released its proposed FY ’11 budget and provided details of the QDR. The release of the budget process is a first step and a very long and dynamic process.
In general Northrop Grumman programs are well supported which reflects their relevance and importance to current and future national security requirements. In the days and weeks ahead additional budget details will be available and the deliberative process and Congress will begin.
As that process moves forward specific program challenges and opportunities will be more clearly defined. At this early point in the process we don’t want to speculate on the final outcome for any individual program, but in the aggregate it appears that Northrop Grumman’s portfolio continues to be well aligned with the nations security needs.
We’re well positioned in high priority areas such as unmanned systems, cybersecurity C4ISR, long range strike and logistics, but we recognize that the investment accounts like all government spending will face increasing pressure. In terms of new business opportunities we’re pursuing high quality growth in a disciplined way, our stands on the upcoming tanker competition is a prime example.
Among other issues unless the final RFP is restructured to provide a best value competition one that recognizes value for performance that exceeds minimum capability thresholds and one that enables to improve financial terms this program is not an attractive opportunity for Northrop Grumman. Northrop Grumman’s greatest opportunity to generate value for shareholders is by improving our performance.
Our primary objective is to create value through bottom line performance and continued strong cash generation. Consistent with this our guidance for 2010 caused for modest sales growth, with an improved operating margin rate. Our guidance for 2010 EPS from continuing operations is $5.70 to $5.95 and primarily reflects a combination of segment margin rate expansion across the businesses, lower net pension expense and continuing share repurchases. Our guidance contemplates that these improvements will be somewhat offset by a higher tax rate.
We also expect continued robust cash flows. Cash from operations is expected to range between 2.5 and $3 billion and free cash flow is expected to range between 1.7 and $2.2 billion before discretionary pension contributions. As a management team, we’re firmly committed to realizing positive performance improvements in all of our businesses. So now I’d like to turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our 2009 performance and our 2010 outlook. Jim?

My comments begin with Slide Four. I’ll discuss our 2009 results and include some detail on the financial impact of the TASC sale and then update you on the trends, underline our 2010 guidance including pension. I would echo Wes’ comments regarding 2009 performance and add that on a pension adjusted basis, earnings per share from continued operations increased 24% year-over-year, after adjusting for the goodwill impairment charge in 2008.
Cash generation was also very strong, essentially comparable to last year’s record levels, when you consider the impact of the discretionary pension plan contributions and the taxes paid on the past divestiture. As you know in 2008 we had outstanding cash results that were driven by substantially reduced working capital while sales in 2008 increased by 6%.
This year’s cash results before taxes related to the TASC sale and the voluntary pension contributions reflect relatively stable working capital while sales again grew by 4.5%. So the positive trend in cash management were maintained in 2009 allowing us to continue a balance cash deployment strategy that calls for returning cash to shareholders investing in the business and funding our pension plans.
The strong financial results were accomplished well addressing several major operational initiatives. First was the realignment of the seven sectors into five business sectors last January. In addition, to establishing a more customer focused business structure the consolidation also allowed us to reduce overhead and to streamline operations. We have also expended a tremendous amount of effort to improve our Gulf Coast operations with the new operating system that Wes discussed in his remarks.
And obviously the TASC sale was successfully executed, this activity was initiated in response to our customers changing initiatives on - all operational conflicts of interest OCI and require considerable effort in achieving a very good market price for the business while at the same time ensuring a successful future for the business.
When we announced the sale we indicated that TASC's operating results for 2009 will be reported as discontinued operations in our 2009 and prior financial statements. Not all of the analyst estimates on our financial results were updated to reflect that accounting treatment that was reported today. So in order to help you reconcile your models to our reported results we provided a Pro forma reconciliation.
That’s on slide five. It reconciles are reported results with the Pro forma results if TASC had been part of continuing operations for the entire year. The highlighted top row shows consolidated Pro forma results and then under the discontinued operations caption the first row shows TASC operating results that are now classified as discontinued operations.
Through December 18th the date of the sale TASC had sales of 1.536 billion and operating income of 147 million, which translates into $0.28 of earnings per share that will move from continuing to discontinued operations. The next line is simply the net gain on the sale which totaled $0.05 per share.
Moving to the continuing operations captions state income taxes directly associated with the sale totaled a $106 of which 87 million were directly allocable to our continuing operations. Of that amount 50 million impacted sales and 37 million impacted Information Systems operating margin.
The 50 million is recoverable under our cost type contracts and is therefore recognized the sales, while the 37 million was allocated to fixed price contracts and directly impacted that has reduced the IS operating margins for the quarter and the year. These onetime state income taxes reduced earnings per share by $0.08.
Finally, in 2009 we paid $508 million for federal and state taxes on the transactions. So cash from operations and free cash flow were reduced by commensurate amount. However, for financial reporting purposes these taxes are recognized as cash from operations in the cash flow statement while the cash proceeds on the sale are recognized in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement.
So adding back the taxes to the reported free cash flow, gives us a free cash flow number of $1.9 billion for 2009 that essentially our businesses generated from ""its normal operations"". This 1.9 million is or has been reduced by the $462 million of after-tax effect of the additional voluntary pension contributions to our plans, pension plans in 2009.
Now, I'd like to take a few minutes and talk about 2010 guidance on slide six, we expect to 2010 sales of 34 to $34.6 billion. Our sales guidance reflects growth for Electronic Systems, Information Systems and Technical Services in the range of two to 4% each. Stable revenues for Aerospace Systems and a three to 4% revenue decline in shipbuilding as a result of lower carrier repair and overhaul volume in 2010.
Our outlook for Aerospace Systems does contemplate our understanding of the potential restructuring of the NPOESS and F-35 programs. We have not received any formal contractual direction on either program at this point, but for inflows our customers has access to participate in a restructuring other program and the path forward will involve over the next several months.
For the F-35 we anticipated a potential change in the program fee structure in the fourth quarter and we adjusted our financial assumptions accordingly. We expect 2010 segment operating margin rate to improve to the low 9% rate from this year’s 8.7%. The improvement will be driven by margin rate expansion across the businesses.
In shipbuilding, we are currently booking minimal margins on the LPD program as Wes mentioned and we expect shipbuildings 2010 margin rate to be in the 5 to 6% range. This represents a modest incremental improvement from 2009, but in my view it’s the right level of expectation given where we are in the LPD program.
Until we see that our operating systems improvements are generating sustainable performance improvement and that our program mix improves as LPD revenue contribution declines from the delivery of these ships currently under construction margin rate improvement in shipbuilding will be gradual and modest.
In the appendix of today’s presentation we provided 2010 sales and operating margin rate guidance for each of the five businesses, for your information. For the company in total we expect 2010 operating margin rate to expand to the mid 8% range from 7.4% in 2009. This reflects the operational improvements that I just described above as well as the substantial improvement in the net pension adjustment. Our earnings per share guidance also assumes a lower share count which is offset somewhat by the higher estimated tax rate of 34.5% for 2010.
Moving to cash metrics, as Wes mentioned, we expect cash from operations at 2.5 to $3 billion and free cash flow of 1.7 to 2.2 billion. Both of these estimates are before the impact of planned discretionary pension pre-funding. And on Slide Seven, we provided a bridge from our 2009 earnings per share from continuing operations through our guidance for 2010, so that you can see proportionally on an EPS basis where the improvements are coming from.
The largest improvements are operationally driven and from lower pension expense are somewhat offset by lower other net items and then the higher estimated tax rate for 2010. And finally our guidance includes a reduction in the average shares outstanding as we use the proceeds from the past sale to repurchase our stock.
In summary, we expect 17 to 22% increase in our earnings per share from continuing operations for 2010. Slide eight provides some additional detail regarding pension accounting. We expect 2010 net pension adjustment to be in expense of approximately 35 million or $0.07 a share. This is an improvement of about $275 million over 2009 and the year-over-year improvement is detailed on the chart and driven by several factors. In 2009 our plan assets earned more than 15%, substantially higher than the 8.5% projected long term rate of return.
In 2009, we also made $800 million at discretionary contributions to the plan. So the combination of these two factors significantly reduced our projected FAS expense for 2010 and in addition, our CAS recovery improves by about $25 million in 2010.
Those positive factors were offset by 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate from 6.25 to the 6%. And our assumed long-term rate return on plan asset is unchanged at 8.5%. You can also see on the chart that the funded status of the plans improved to 88% at the end of 2009 compared to 84% at the end of 2008.
The improvement reflects the cash contributions to healthy plan returns and some adjustments to our actuarial assumptions. And those positive impacts were partially offset by the lower discount rate which increased our year end pension obligation by approximately $700 million.
For 2010, we have a $57 million of mandatory funding requirement and our current cash deployment plans call for approximately $300 million a discretionary pension funding in 2010. So, Paul, I think with that introduction, we're ready for some Q&A.

Now, clearly LPD presents a challenge as I mention earlier and as Jim also described in his remarks as we go forward. But when we look more broadly across the portfolio there are also good opportunities that we’re addressing.
For example, the increase in the submarine procurement to two per year, starting fairly soon. That is well supported in the budget that will represent very nice opportunity for our Shipbuilding business. And I would say broadly as we looked at the budget coming through earlier this week the Presidents recommending a good strong support for shipbuilding. So as we look out on the horizon we do see our nation continuing to recognize the imperative or strong able cost structure and given our position in shipbuilding that should represent a good opportunity for our business over the longer term.
But all that being said I would reinforce what we communicated during our remarks that given that we do have a substantial sales volume on LPD at a very low margin rate it will represent a downward turn on the rate at which we can improve margin rates here over the near term.

With respect to the positioning of our Information Systems business, as I mentioned in my remarks the defense and intelligence components of that business today represent about 75% of the sales. And as you could see and looking at the budget request those areas are very, very well supported with respect to what the administration is requesting and quite frankly we believe with respect to what the Congress will support going forward. The other roughly 25% of the sales is the area that we describe as civil business within Information Systems that is a mix of Federal civil business and state and local.
We’ve been fairly clear in our prior communications that we are stepping back from the state and local IT outsourcing market the market that we are not deemed to be particularly attractive. And as a result that is causing that aspect of the business to reduce over time. The civil federal market the market in which we participate continues to represent some very good opportunities for the company. So while our overall civil business is not looking at substantial growth because of the purpose and reducing our exposure in state and local IT outsourcing the component of that marketplace that deals with other departments of government beyond defense and intelligence, we continue to see as representing good opportunities for us going forward.

From a exposure, financial exposure perspective I mentioned in the past that I see this type of contract having two major elements of exposure one is the cost of transformation at this point I think we have a fairly good handle on that subject to resolving the exact scope of some of the agencies. On the other issue associated with these types of programs is the future revenue stream associated with the total contract life. At this point, I would characterize that is the largest variable in our thinking about this program.

And clearly, as you know, it's a portfolio and so there are a number of programs that are growing. And there are another set of programs that are actually shrinking. So, on the growing side, we see programs like F-35, the F-18 bands and some of our restricted activities continuing to grow. And then on the downside, programs like KEI and TASC that we're capable obviously have smaller or no revenues in 2010 when they had revenues in ‘09. The E-2C is essentially transitioning and completing much of its production activities. And the E-2D is on the front end of the ramp up in production. And so, there is an evolution or decline in E-2 revenues in total. And then UCAS has some lower revenues in 2010 as compared to 2009. Shipbuilding is largely, the decline is largely driven by the amount of carrier overhaul work that we anticipate in 2010 compared to ‘09. And then the technical services growth is largely related to the successful new awards that they won in 2010 or 2009 rather. Information Systems the growth largely is coming out of the intelligence and defense divisions which continue to grow with the civil division actually shrinking somewhat on a year-over-year basis and then the Electronic Systems, just the growth is across the portfolio with again some programs up and others down, but on an overall basis a very well diversified portfolio with growth.

We of course have provided the departments a lot of commentary around the financial terms and conditions that were resident in the draft RFP. And they were a variety of issues there that we identified that represented a risk profile that we did not find acceptable to support our bid. There are other issues associated with tanker beyond the financial terms.
As I indicated in my remarks, we're also quite frankly displeased with the approach where value beyond the threshold requirements is not really well recognized in the scoring methodology for the proposal. So as structured it really does not represent a meaningful competitive opportunity for our offering, which inherently is a larger aircraft and inherently provides more capability, but a bigger airplane inherently cost little bit more.
So, without that value recognition methodology in the final RFP, we are fundamentally disadvantaged in the source selection evaluation process. So, there are variety of factors that go into our conclusion that unless we see some major restructuring in this final RFP this is simply an unattractive proposition for our company to pursue bidding on. So, that’s a perhaps a little bit broader picture on tanker than just the financial terms and conditions. But certainly the financial terms and conditions are very, very important and every single one of the new activities that we're going to assess bidding upon, we're going to take a very careful look at the financial terms and we are going to be very candid with the procuring organizations as to our perspectives on those. We're early in taking the look at GMD.
We are not particularly concerned about competing against incumbents. We have been quite successful at doing that in the past or simply because there is a long entrenched incumbency does not necessarily meaning that you cannot have a very effective opportunity. We’ve demonstrated that last year in our win of the KC-10 Contractor Logistics Support Competition. So GMB is one that we’re taking a very careful look at and we are certainly going to be highly engaged in working with Missile Defense Agency in assessing the procurement terms and giving them our feedback, I believe that they are looking for a good robust competition here and we’re quite interested in that.

One is the GPS OCX program out of our information system sector and the other is also out of IS CANES [ph] program and both of these cases we’ve had a proposals and been working through the final proposal update processes and I believe that the government is on track for awards later in the first quarter.
There are several others that we’re focusing on that appear to get continuing good support in the budget process. We talk about GMD a little bit earlier just kind of add to some of our earlier discussion on that as you know we have been the IPIC contractor for over 50 years. And so, we have a tremendous legacy of excellence and supporting the sustainment and continued evolution of those weapon systems. We believe that brings a strong competency to compete on GMD.
So, we’re looking at that one very, very carefully. The EMALS [ph] program, which is another one of the ISR platforms intended to provide more near terms support in the battlefield there is an area that we’re also focusing on but we have a number of strong capabilities with position as well in the EMALS. Chase back is another good example that’s their joint space operation center. We’re taking a careful look at that. We here again have a very substantial side of capabilities and managing space systems and also in large scale operation centers and we’re looking at that and very careful.
So if we look across our businesses, we see a wide variety of opportunities and as the administration is continuing to focus in the ISR arena, C4ISR and more probably, certainly in Cybersecurity and some of the other areas that I mentioned in my remarks earlier. So, it is unmanned. We see a very robust side of opportunities. I would say though just put a little bit of flavor on that we are driving a degree of discipline into our system around the evaluation of opportunities that not until beyond where we have been. And so we’re going to be looking at each one of these very carefully to make sure that successful capture of the opportunity supports our objectives or improving our margin rates, continuing to drive the overall performance of the company. So, when we look at the opportunities, we’re not thinking about scale. We’re thinking about performance.

As Paul said, this morning, we will discuss our fourth quarter and our full year results, as well as Northrop Grumman's outlook for 2010. We had a solid finish to 2009. Earnings per share totaled $5.21, exceeding our guidance of $5 to $5.15, and we had outstanding cash results. Cash from operations and free cash flow were very strong. And when adjusted for discretionary pension contributions and the taxes that we paid on the TASC sale, were at the high end of our guidance and comparable to last year's record levels. During 2009, we continue to deploy cash to create value for our shareholders. We raised the dividend by 7.5% and we used $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 23 million shares of our stock, including 8.4 million shares repurchased in the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had $924 million remaining on our share repurchase reauthorization. As we previously announced, the most recent increase in the authorization was funded by the net proceeds from the TASC divestiture.  Another 2009 highlight is our year-end backlog of more than $69 billion. Total backlog continues to represent more than two years of sales and includes $32 billion of new awards captured in 2009. We're very pleased that despite delays on several competitions, our book-to-bill ratio for the year was 96%. We continue to capture high-quality competitive contracts. Turning to results for our businesses, Aerospace Systems continues to perform well. Sales grew 7% for the quarter and 6% for the year. Our unmanned and manned aircraft programs, along with our restricted work, were the drivers for the quarter and for the year. Volume increases on programs like dams, Global Hawk, F-35, F-18 and the B-2 have more than offset declines in some of our missile and space programs. We expect continued strength in both manned and unmanned programs. During the quarter we received a $300 million contract for five Global Hawks. This fixed price incentive fee contract runs through 2011. We also introduced the first Euro Hawk unmanned vehicle, marking the first international configuration of the Global Hawk.  Aerospace also continues to improve their margin rates, with expansion to 10.5% for the quarter and 10.3% for the year. Electronic Systems also had a strong quarter and year. Sales increased 2% for the quarter and 9% for the year, with solid margin rates for both periods. During the fourth quarter, the Royal Australian Air Force accepted initial delivery of the first two Wedgetail aircraft, and we reached agreement on delivery requirements. Final delivery and full acceptance is expected later this year, and delivery of all six aircraft is planned by mid-2011.  With Wedgetail development complete and agreement reached on the remaining contract requirements, we believe the financial risk on Wedgetail is behind us. For Information Systems, fourth quarter sales were comparable to the prior year, and full year sales increased 5%. Margin rates for the quarter and the year were impacted by state income taxes, resulting from the TASC sale and lower performance on the Virginia outsourcing contract known as VITA. These two items offset the positive margin rate trends generated in our Intelligence and Defense businesses, which now account for about 75% of Information Systems sales. These two profitable growing businesses are very well-positioned in their markets, including Cybersecurity and C4ISR. They will be the performance drivers for the sector. As a result of strong business capture during the year, IS grew backlog by nearly $480 million or 6% to 8.8 billion.  During the quarter, Information Systems won the five-year $580 million  IBCS program, which is the first step toward enabling integrated joint and combined air and missile defense capabilities. In Shipbuilding, we continue to focus on improving performance in the Gulf through the new operating system that we put in place last year. We're making good progress. The new operating system is providing increased visibility in the workflow and it's enabling us to better sequence work to reduce costs growth that results from work performed out of sequence.Currently, we're addressing two quality issues that have received some attention in the press, and I wanted to address each of them individually.  Regarding pipe welds, we have been working closely with the Navy since last year when it was discovered that some of our pipe joints may not have met specifications. Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, our EACs were updated to include the expected cost to repair the pipe welds. We believe we understand what's required to correct the piping. Late last year, LPD 21 experienced a problem with its main propulsion diesel engines. We're working hand-in-hand with the Navy to identify and understand the root causes of the engine problems and to support implementation of the appropriate corrective actions. Based on what we know today, we do not believe that the corrective actions represent significant financial exposure for the company.  We're confident that quality and performance will continue to improve as we refine and mature the operating approach that's now in place on the Gulf Coast. The new processes are providing better information on a more timely basis and have helped us address some of the cost issues that we based on our Gulf Coast programs, particularly the LPD. Today, we're under contract for four remaining LPDs, which will be delivered over the next three years. As a result of the LPD issues that we've described over the last year, we expect minimal margin on these ships, and the pace of our margin rate improvement in Shipbuilding will be impacted by the substantial sales volume on these contracts over the next three years. In Technical Services, sales increased 11% for the quarter and 10% for the year, and the margin rates also expanded for both periods. Business capture was outstanding this year. TS won some major competitive awards such as the $3.8 billion KC-10 program. And at the end of the year, they captured the Saudi Arabia National Guard contract, which has a potential award value of $550 million. For the year, TS backlog increased by 10%. So now let's talk about our priorities for 2010. Northrop Grumman has a tremendous range of capabilities that are well aligned with our customer spending priorities, and we have outstanding human, technical and financial resources. Our number one priority is to achieve sustainable performance improvement. That's the message I convey to our senior management team at the beginning of the year. Our goal is to instill a true culture of performance across the entire organization. This will shape our decision making, the way we set our strategy and the way that we measure and incentivize our team.  Our leadership is driving improvement with a real sense of urgency. Change will not occur overnight, but we will succeed at this. I'm excited about what I believe the team can achieve in creating value for our shareholders and for our customers. Earlier this week, the administration released its proposed FY '11 budget and provided details of the QDR. The release of the budget process is a first step in a very long and dynamic process. In general, Northrop Grumman programs are well supported, which reflects their relevance and importance to current and future national security requirements. In the days and weeks ahead, additional budget details will be available, and the deliberative process in Congress will begin. As that process moves forward, specific program challenges and opportunities will be more clearly defined. At this early point in the process, we don't want to speculate on the final outcome for any individual program. But in the aggregate, it appears that Northrop Grumman's portfolio continues to be well aligned with the nation's security needs. We're very well-positioned in high priority areas such as unmanned systems, Cybersecurity, C4ISR, long-range strike and logistics, but we recognize that the investment accounts, like all government spending, will face increasing pressure.In terms of new business opportunities, we're pursuing high-quality growth in a disciplined way. Our stance on the upcoming tanker competition is a prime example. Among other issues, unless the final RFP is restructured to provide a best value competition, one that recognizes value for performance that exceeds minimum capability thresholds and one that enables improved financial terms, this program is not an attractive opportunity for Northrop Grumman.Northrop Grumman's greatest opportunity to generate value for shareholders is by improving our performance. Our primary objective is to create value through bottom line performance and continued strong cash generation. Consistent with this, our guidance for 2010 calls for modest sales growth with an improved operating margin rate. Our guidance for 2010 EPS from continuing operations is $5.70 to $5.95, and primarily reflects a combination of segment margin rate expansion across the businesses, lower net pension expense and continuing share repurchases. Our guidance contemplates that these improvements will be somewhat offset by a higher tax rate. We also expect continued robust cash flows. Cash from operation is expected to range between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, and free cash flow is expected to range between $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion before discretionary pension Coster contributions. As a management team, we're firmly committed to realizing positive performance improvement in all of our businesses.  So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our 2009 performance and our 2010 outlook. Jim?"
97199,84647417,48459,"Northrop Grumman Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Northrop Grumman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My comments begin with Slide 4. I'll discuss our 2009 results and include some detail on the financial impact of the TASC sale and then update you on the trends underlying our 2010 guidance, including p",1490,"Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My comments begin with Slide 4. I'll discuss our 2009 results and include some detail on the financial impact of the TASC sale and then update you on the trends underlying our 2010 guidance, including pension.  I would echo Wes' comments regarding 2009 performance and add that, on a pension adjusted basis, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24% year-over-year after adjusting for the goodwill impairment charge in 2008. Cash generation was also very strong, essentially comparable to last year's record levels when you consider the impact of the discretionary pension plan contributions and the taxes paid on the TASC divestiture. As you know, in 2008, we had outstanding cash results that were driven by substantially-reduced working capital, while sales in 2008 increased by 6%. This year's cash results before taxes related to the TASC sale and the voluntary cash pension contributions reflect relatively-stable working capital, while sales again grew by 4.5%. So the positive trends in cash management were maintained in 2009, allowing us to continue a balanced cash deployment strategy that calls for returning cash to shareholders, investing in the business and funding our pension plans.These strong financial results were accomplished while addressing several major operational initiatives. First was the realignment of seven sectors into five business sectors last January. In addition to establishing a more customer-focused business structure, the consolidation also allowed us to reduce overhead and to streamline operations. We have also expanded a tremendous amount of effort to improve our Gulf Coast operations with a new operating system that Wes discussed in his remarks. And obviously, the TASC sale was successfully executed.  This activity was initiated in response to our customers' changing initiatives on operational conflicts of interest, or OCI, and required considerable effort in achieving a very good market price for the business, while at the same time, ensuring a successful future for the business. When we announced the sale, we indicated that TASC operating results for 2009 will be recorded as discontinued operations in our 2009 and prior financial statements. Not all of the analyst's estimates on our financial results were updated to reflect that accounting treatment that was reported today. So in order to help you reconcile your models to our reported results, we provided a pro forma reconciliation. That's on Slide 5. It reconciles our reported results with the pro forma results if TASC had been part of continuing operations for the entire year.  The highlighted top row shows consolidated pro forma results and then under the discontinued operations caption, the first row shows TASC operating results that are now classified as discontinued operations. Through December 18, the date of the sale, TASC had sales of $1.536 billion and operating income of $147 million, which translates into $0.28 of earnings per share that were moved from continuing to discontinuing operations. The next line is simply the net gain on the sale, which totaled $0.05 per share. Moving to the continuing operations captions, state income taxes directly associated with the sale totaled $106 million, of which $87 million were directly allocable to our continuing operations. Of that amount, $50 million impacted sales and $37 million impacted Information Systems operating margin. The $50 million is recoverable under our cost-type contracts and is therefore recognized as sales, while the $37 million was allocated to our fixed price contracts and directly impacted that has reduced the IS operating margins for the quarter and the year. These one-time state income taxes reduced earnings per share by $0.08.Finally, in 2009, we paid $508 million for Federal and state taxes on the transactions. So cash from operations and free cash flow were reduced by commensurate amount. However, for financial reporting purposes, these taxes are recognized as cash from operations in the cash flow statement, while the cash proceeds on the sale are recognized in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. So adding back the taxes to the reported free cash flow gives us a free cash flow number of $1.9 billion for 2009 that, essentially, our business has generated from its ""normal operations"". This $1.9 million (sic) [$1.9 billion] has been reduced by the $462 million of after-tax effect of the additional voluntary pension contributions to our pension plans in 2009. Now, I'd like to take a few minutes and talk about 2010 guidance on Slide 6. We expect a 2010 sales of $34 billion to $34.6 billion. Our sales guidance reflects growth for Electronic Systems, Information Systems and Technical Services in the range of 2% to 4% each, stable revenues for ever Aerospace Systems and a 3% to 4% revenue decline in Shipbuilding as a result of lower carrier repair and overhaul volume in 2010. Our outlook for Aerospace System does contemplate our understanding of the potential restructuring of the NPOESS and F-35 programs. We have not received any formal contractual direction on either program at this point. But for NPOESS, our customer has asked us to participate in a restructuring of the program, and the path forward will involve over the next several months. For the F-35, we anticipated a potential change in the program fee structure in the fourth quarter and we adjusted our financial assumptions accordingly. We expect 2010 segment operating margin rate to improve to the low 9% rate from this year's 8.7%. The improvement will be driven by margin rate expansion across the businesses. In Shipbuilding, we are currently booking minimum margins on the LPD program, as Wes mentioned, and we expect Shipbuilding's 2010 margin rate to be in the 5% to 6% range. This represents a modest incremental improvement from 2009, but in my view, it's the right level of expectation given where we are in the LPD program. Until we see that our operating systems improvements are generating sustainable performance improvement, and that our program mix improves as LPD revenue contribution declines from the delivery of these ships currently under construction, margin rate improvement in Shipbuilding will be gradual and modest.In the appendix of today's presentation, we provided 2010 sales and operating margin rate guidance for each of the five businesses for your information. For the company in total, we expect 2010 operating margin rate to expand to the mid-8% range from 7.4% in 2009. This reflects the operational improvements that I just described above, as well as the substantial improvement in the net pension adjustment. Our earnings per share guidance also assumes a lower share count, which is offset somewhat by the higher estimated tax rate of 34.5% for 2010.Moving to cash metrics, as Wes mentioned, we expect cash from operations at $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion. Both of these estimates are before the impact of planned discretionary pension pre-funding. On Slide 7, we provided a bridge from our 2009 earnings per share from continuing operations through our guidance for 2010 so that you can see proportionally on an EPS basis where the improvements are coming from. The largest improvements are operationally driven and from lower pension expense, somewhat offset by lower other net items and then the higher estimated tax rate for 2010. And finally, our guidance includes a reduction in the average shares outstanding as we used the proceeds from the TASC sale to repurchase stock. In summary, we expect a 17% to 22% increase in our earnings per share from continuing operations for 2010.Slide 8 provides some additional detail regarding pension accounting. We expect 2010 net pension adjustment to be an expense of approximately $35 million or $0.07 a share. This is an improvement of about $275 million over 2009, and the year-over-year improvement is detailed on the chart are driven by several factors. In 2009, our plan assets earned more than 15%, substantially higher than the 8.5% projected long-term rate of return. In 2009 we also made $800 million of discretionary contributions to the plan. So the combination of these two factors significantly reduced our projected FAS expense for 2010. And in addition, our cash recovery improved by about $25 million in 2010.  Those positive factors were offset by a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate from 6.25% to 6%, and our assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is unchanged at 8.5%. You can also see the chart that the funded status of the plans improved to 88% at the end of 2009 compared to 84% at the end of 2008. The improvement reflects the cash contributions, the healthy plan returns and some adjustments to our actuarial assumptions. And those positive impacts were partially offset by the lower discount rate, which increased our year end pension obligation by approximately $700 million.For 2010, we have a $57 million mandatory funding requirement, and our current cash deployment plans call for approximately $300 million of discretionary pension funding in 2010. So Paul, I think with that introduction, we're ready for some Q&A."

As you know, our Shipbuilding business has two major components to it: One, the Nuclear business and Newport News and the Surface business in the Gulf. Clearly, LPD represents a challenge, as I mentioned earlier and as Jim also described in his remarks, as we go forward. But when we look more broadly across the portfolio, there are also good opportunities that we're addressing. For example, the increase in the submarine procurement to two per year starting fairly soon, was is well supported in the budget. That will represent a very nice opportunity for our Shipbuilding business. And I would say broadly as we look at budget coming through earlier this week, the President is recommending a good strong support for Shipbuilding. So as we look out on the horizon, we do see our nation continuing to recognize the imperative for a strong naval force structure. And given our position in Shipbuilding, that should represent a good opportunity for our business over the longer term. But all that being said, I would reinforce what we communicated during our remarks, that given that we do have a substantial sales volume on LPD at a very low margin rate, it will represent a downward tug on the rate at which we can improve margin rates here over the near-term."

And, Jim, you might want to give a little financial flavor on VITA. With respect to the positioning of our Information Systems business, as I mentioned in my remarks, the defense and intelligence components of that business, today, represent about 75% of the sales. And as you could see in looking at the budget request, those areas are very, very well supported with respect to what the administration is requesting and, quite frankly, we believe, with respect to what the Congress will support going forward. The other roughly 25% of the sales is the area we described as Civil business within Information Systems. That is a mix of Federal, Civil business and state and local. We've been fairly clear in our prior communications that we are stepping back from the state and local IT outsourcing market, a market that we do not deem to be particularly attractive. And as a result, that is causing that aspect of the business to reduce overtime. The Civil Federal market, the market in which we participate, continues to represent some very good opportunities for the company. So while our overall Civil business is not looking at a substantial growth because of the focus in reducing our exposure in state local IT outsourcing, the component of that marketplace that deals with other departments of government, beyond defense and intelligence, we continue to see as representing good opportunities for us going forward."

As you know, we've, from all the press reports, we have been in conversations with the state commonwealth over potential changes to the contract that we think are warranted. Those conversations continue. I wouldn't want to speculate on what that outcome might be. In terms of the operational activities, we continue transitioning a number of the agencies and we continue having conversations with the commonwealth about whether certain agency should be outside the scope or have a different scope associated with their transformation. From a financial exposure perspective, I mentioned in the past that I see this type of contract having two major elements of exposure, one is the cost of transformation. At this point, I think we have a fairly good handle on that subject to resolving the exact scope of some of the agencies. The other issue associated with these types of programs is the future revenue stream associated with the total contract life. At this point, I would characterize that as the largest variable in our thinking about this program. But I think our financial assumptions at this time are reasonable and reflect that variability as well."

Our forecast is for stable revenues in aerospace. And clearly, as you know, it's a portfolio. And so there are a number of programs that are growing, and there are another set of programs that are actually shrinking. So on the growing side, we see programs like F-35, the F-18, BAMS [Broad Area Maritime Surveillance] and some of our restricted activities continuing to grow. And then on the downside, programs like KEI [Kinetic Energy Interceptors] and TSAT [Transformational Satellite Communications System] that were capable obviously, have smaller or no revenues in 2010, when they had revenues in '09. The E-2C is essentially transitioning and completing much of its production activities, and the E-2D is on the front-end of the ramp-up in production. And so there's a evolution or decline in E-2 revenues in total. And then UCAS [Unmanned Combat Air System] has some lower revenues in 2010 as compared to 2009. Shipbuilding, the decline is largely driven by the amount of carrier overhaul work that we anticipate in 2010 compared to '09. And then the technical services growth is largely related to the successful new awards that they won in 2009. Information Systems, the growth largely is coming out of the Intelligence and Defense divisions, which continue to grow, with the Civil division actually shrinking somewhat on a year-over-year basis. And then Electronic Systems, just the growth is across the portfolio, with again, some programs up and others down; but on an overall basis, a very well diversified portfolio with growth."

We, of course, have provided the departments a lot of commentary around the financial terms and conditions that were resident in the draft RFP [request for proposal]. There were a variety of issues there that we identified that represented a risk profile that we did not find acceptable to support our bid. There are other issues associated with tanker beyond the financial terms. As I indicated in my remarks, we're also, quite frankly, displeased with the approach where value beyond the threshold requirements is not really well recognized in the scoring methodology for the proposal. So as structured, it really does not represent a meaningful competitive opportunity for our offering, which inherently is a larger aircraft and inherently provides more capability. But a bigger airplane inherently costs a little bit more. So without that value-recognition methodology in the final RFP, we are fundamentally disadvantaged in the source selection evaluation process. So there are a variety of factors that go into our inclusion that unless we see some major restructuring in this final RFP, this is simply an unattractive proposition for our company to pursue bidding on. So that's perhaps a little bit broader picture on tanker than just the financial terms and conditions. But certainly, the financial terms and conditions are very, very important. And every single one of the new activities that we're going to assess bidding on, we're going to take a very careful look at the financial terms. And we're going to be very candid with the procuring organizations, as to our perspectives on those. We're early in taking a look at GMD. We are not particularly concerned about competing against incumbents. We have been quite successful at doing that in the past. So simply because there is a long-entrenched incumbency does not necessarily mean that you cannot have a very effective opportunity. We demonstrated that last year in our win at the KC-10 contractor logistics support competition. So GMD is one that we are taking a very careful look at. And we are certainly going to be highly engaged in working with the Missile Defense Agency in assessing the procurement terms and giving them our feedback. I believe that they are looking for a good robust competition here, and we're quite interested in that."

One is the GPS OCX [Global Positioning System Next Generation Operational Control Segment] program out of our Information Systems sector. And the other is also out of IS, the CAINS [Carrier Aircraft Inertial Navigational System] program. In both of those cases, we've had our proposals and been working through the final proposal update processes, and believe that the government is on track for awards later in the first quarter. There are several others that we're focusing on that appear to get continuing good support in the budget process. We talked about GMD a little bit earlier. Just to kind of add to some of our earlier discussion on that, as you know, we had been the IPIC contractor for over 50 years. And so we have a tremendous legacy of excellence in supporting the sustainment and continued evolution of those weapon systems. We believe that brings a strong competency to compete on GMD, so we're looking at that one very, very carefully. The EMARs program, which is another one of the ISR platforms intended to provide more near-term support in the battlefield is an area that we're also focusing on; believe we have a number of strong capabilities that would position us well on EMARs. JSpOC is another good example. That's the Joint Space Operations Center. We're taking a careful look at that. We here, again, have a very substantial set of capabilities in managing space systems and also in large-scale operation centers, and we're looking at that one very carefully. So if we looked across our businesses, we see a wide variety of opportunities. And as the administration is continuing to focus in the ISR arena, C4ISR more broadly; certainly in cybersecurity and some of the other areas that I mentioned in my remarks earlier, such as unmanned. We see a very robust set of opportunities. I would say though, just to put a little bit of flavor on that, we are driving a degree of discipline into our system around the evaluation of opportunities that's a notch or two beyond where we have been. And so we're going to be looking at each one of these very carefully to make sure that successful capture of the opportunity supports our objectives for improving our margin rates, continuing to drive the overall performance of the company. So when we look at the opportunities, we're not thinking about scale. We're thinking about performance."

That increase in cost accounting or CAS expense is largely reflecting from CAS, the amortization of the 2008 losses. And so it's being reflected in our CAS expense as we go forward.

As Paul said, this morning, we will discuss our fourth quarter and our full year results, as well as Northrop Grumman's outlook for 2010. We had a solid finish to 2009. Earnings per share totaled $5.21, exceeding our guidance of $5 to $5.15, and we had outstanding cash results. Cash from operations and free cash flow were very strong. And when adjusted for discretionary pension contributions and the taxes that we paid on the TASC sale, were at the high end of our guidance and comparable to last year's record levels. During 2009, we continue to deploy cash to create value for our shareholders. We raised the dividend by 7.5% and we used $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 23 million shares of our stock, including 8.4 million shares repurchased in the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had $924 million remaining on our share repurchase reauthorization. As we previously announced, the most recent increase in the authorization was funded by the net proceeds from the TASC divestiture.  Another 2009 highlight is our year-end backlog of more than $69 billion. Total backlog continues to represent more than two years of sales and includes $32 billion of new awards captured in 2009. We're very pleased that despite delays on several competitions, our book-to-bill ratio for the year was 96%. We continue to capture high-quality competitive contracts. Turning to results for our businesses, Aerospace Systems continues to perform well. Sales grew 7% for the quarter and 6% for the year. Our unmanned and manned aircraft programs, along with our restricted work, were the drivers for the quarter and for the year. Volume increases on programs like dams, Global Hawk, F-35, F-18 and the B-2 have more than offset declines in some of our missile and space programs. We expect continued strength in both manned and unmanned programs. During the quarter we received a $300 million contract for five Global Hawks. This fixed price incentive fee contract runs through 2011. We also introduced the first Euro Hawk unmanned vehicle, marking the first international configuration of the Global Hawk.  Aerospace also continues to improve their margin rates, with expansion to 10.5% for the quarter and 10.3% for the year. Electronic Systems also had a strong quarter and year. Sales increased 2% for the quarter and 9% for the year, with solid margin rates for both periods. During the fourth quarter, the Royal Australian Air Force accepted initial delivery of the first two Wedgetail aircraft, and we reached agreement on delivery requirements. Final delivery and full acceptance is expected later this year, and delivery of all six aircraft is planned by mid-2011.  With Wedgetail development complete and agreement reached on the remaining contract requirements, we believe the financial risk on Wedgetail is behind us. For Information Systems, fourth quarter sales were comparable to the prior year, and full year sales increased 5%. Margin rates for the quarter and the year were impacted by state income taxes, resulting from the TASC sale and lower performance on the Virginia outsourcing contract known as VITA. These two items offset the positive margin rate trends generated in our Intelligence and Defense businesses, which now account for about 75% of Information Systems sales. These two profitable growing businesses are very well-positioned in their markets, including Cybersecurity and C4ISR. They will be the performance drivers for the sector. As a result of strong business capture during the year, IS grew backlog by nearly $480 million or 6% to 8.8 billion.  During the quarter, Information Systems won the five-year $580 million IBCS program, which is the first step toward enabling integrated joint and combined air and missile defense capabilities. In Shipbuilding, we continue to focus on improving performance in the Gulf through the new operating system that we put in place last year. We're making good progress. The new operating system is providing increased visibility in the workflow and it's enabling us to better sequence work to reduce costs growth that results from work performed out of sequence.Currently, we're addressing two quality issues that have received some attention in the press, and I wanted to address each of them individually.  Regarding pipe welds, we have been working closely with the Navy since last year when it was discovered that some of our pipe joints may not have met specifications. Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, our EACs were updated to include the expected cost to repair the pipe welds. We believe we understand what's required to correct the piping. Late last year, LPD 21 experienced a problem with its main propulsion diesel engines. We're working hand-in-hand with the Navy to identify and understand the root causes of the engine problems and to support implementation of the appropriate corrective actions. Based on what we know today, we do not believe that the corrective actions represent significant financial exposure for the company.  We're confident that quality and performance will continue to improve as we refine and mature the operating approach that's now in place on the Gulf Coast. The new processes are providing better information on a more timely basis and have helped us address some of the cost issues that we based on our Gulf Coast programs, particularly the LPD. Today, we're under contract for four remaining LPDs, which will be delivered over the next three years. As a result of the LPD issues that we've described over the last year, we expect minimal margin on these ships, and the pace of our margin rate improvement in Shipbuilding will be impacted by the substantial sales volume on these contracts over the next three years. In Technical Services, sales increased 11% for the quarter and 10% for the year, and the margin rates also expanded for both periods. Business capture was outstanding this year. TS won some major competitive awards such as the $3.8 billion KC-10 program. And at the end of the year, they captured the Saudi Arabia National Guard contract, which has a potential award value of $550 million. For the year, TS backlog increased by 10%. So now let's talk about our priorities for 2010. Northrop Grumman has a tremendous range of capabilities that are well aligned with our customer spending priorities, and we have outstanding human, technical and financial resources. Our number one priority is to achieve sustainable performance improvement. That's the message I convey to our senior management team at the beginning of the year. Our goal is to instill a true culture of performance across the entire organization. This will shape our decision making, the way we set our strategy and the way that we measure and incentivize our team.  Our leadership is driving improvement with a real sense of urgency. Change will not occur overnight, but we will succeed at this. I'm excited about what I believe the team can achieve in creating value for our shareholders and for our customers. Earlier this week, the administration released its proposed FY '11 budget and provided details of the QDR. The release of the budget process is a first step in a very long and dynamic process. In general, Northrop Grumman programs are well supported, which reflects their relevance and importance to current and future national security requirements. In the days and weeks ahead, additional budget details will be available, and the deliberative process in Congress will begin. As that process moves forward, specific program challenges and opportunities will be more clearly defined. At this early point in the process, we don't want to speculate on the final outcome for any individual program. But in the aggregate, it appears that Northrop Grumman's portfolio continues to be well aligned with the nation's security needs. We're very well-positioned in high priority areas such as unmanned systems, Cybersecurity, C4ISR, long-range strike and logistics, but we recognize that the investment accounts, like all government spending, will face increasing pressure.In terms of new business opportunities, we're pursuing high-quality growth in a disciplined way. Our stance on the upcoming tanker competition is a prime example. Among other issues, unless the final RFP [request for proposal] is restructured to provide a best value competition, one that recognizes value for performance that exceeds minimum capability thresholds and one that enables improved financial terms, this program is not an attractive opportunity for Northrop Grumman.Northrop Grumman's greatest opportunity to generate value for shareholders is by improving our performance. Our primary objective is to create value through bottom line performance and continued strong cash generation. Consistent with this, our guidance for 2010 calls for modest sales growth with an improved operating margin rate. Our guidance for 2010 EPS from continuing operations is $5.70 to $5.95, and primarily reflects a combination of segment margin rate expansion across the businesses, lower net pension expense and continuing share repurchases. Our guidance contemplates that these improvements will be somewhat offset by a higher tax rate. We also expect continued robust cash flows. Cash from operations is expected to range between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, and free cash flow is expected to range between $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion before discretionary pension contributions. As a management team, we're firmly committed to realizing positive performance improvements in all of our businesses. So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our 2009 performance and our 2010 outlook. Jim?"

My comments begin with Slide 4. I'll discuss our 2009 results and include some detail on the financial impact of the TASC sale and then update you on the trends underlying our 2010 guidance, including p",1491,"Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My comments begin with Slide 4. I'll discuss our 2009 results and include some detail on the financial impact of the TASC sale and then update you on the trends underlying our 2010 guidance, including pension. I would echo Wes' comments regarding 2009 performance and add that on a pension adjusted basis, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24% year-over-year after adjusting for the goodwill impairment charge in 2008. Cash generation was also very strong, essentially comparable to last year's record levels when you consider the impact of the discretionary pension plan contributions and the taxes paid on the TASC divestiture. As you know, in 2008, we had outstanding cash results that were driven by substantially-reduced working capital, while sales in 2008 increased by 6%. This year's cash results before taxes related to the TASC sale and the voluntary cash pension contributions reflect relatively stable working capital, while sales again grew by 4.5%. So the positive trends in cash management were maintained in 2009, allowing us to continue a balanced cash deployment strategy that calls for returning cash to shareholders, investing in the business and funding our pension plans.These strong financial results were accomplished while addressing several major operational initiatives. First, was the realignment of seven sectors into five business sectors last January. In addition to establishing a more customer-focused business structure, the consolidation also allowed us to reduce overhead and to streamline operations. We have also expended a tremendous amount of effort to improve our Gulf Coast operations with the new operating system that Wes discussed in his remarks. And obviously, the TASC sale was successfully executed. This activity was initiated in response to our customers' changing initiatives on operational conflicts of interest, or OCI, and required considerable effort in achieving a very good market price for the business, while at the same time, ensuring a successful future for the business. When we announced the sale, we indicated that TASC operating results for 2009 would be recorded as discontinued operations in our 2009 and prior financial statements. Not all of the analysts’ estimates on our financial results were updated to reflect that accounting treatment that was reported today. So in order to help you reconcile your models to our reported results, we provided a pro forma reconciliation. That's on Slide 5. It reconciles our reported results with the pro forma results if TASC had been part of continuing operations for the entire year.  The highlighted top row shows consolidated pro forma results and then under the discontinued operations caption, the first row shows TASC operating results that are now classified as discontinued operations. Through December 18, the date of the sale, TASC had sales of $1.536 billion and operating income of $147 million, which translates into $0.28 of earnings per share that were moved from continuing to discontinuing operations. The next line is simply the net gain on the sale, which totaled $0.05 per share. Moving to the continuing operations captions, state income taxes directly associated with the sale totaled $106 million, of which $87 million were directly allocable to our continuing operations. Of that amount, $50 million impacted sales and $37 million impacted Information Systems operating margin. The $50 million is recoverable under our cost-type contracts and is therefore recognized as sales, while the $37 million was allocated to our fixed price contracts and directly impacted that has reduced the IS operating margins for the quarter and the year. These one-time state income taxes reduced earnings per share by $0.08.Finally, in 2009, we paid $508 million for Federal and state taxes on the transactions. So cash from operations and free cash flow were reduced by commensurate amount. However, for financial reporting purposes, these taxes are recognized as cash from operations in the cash flow statement, while the cash proceeds on the sale are recognized in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. So adding back the taxes to the reported free cash flow gives us a free cash flow number of $1.9 billion for 2009 that, essentially, our business has generated from its ""normal operations"". This $1.9 million (sic) [$1.9 billion] has been reduced by the $462 million of after-tax effect of the additional voluntary pension contributions to our pension plans in 2009. Now I'd like to take a few minutes and talk about 2010 guidance on Slide 6. We expect a 2010 sales of $34 billion to $34.6 billion. Our sales guidance reflects growth for Electronic Systems, Information Systems and Technical Services in the range of 2% to 4% each, stable revenues for ever Aerospace Systems and a 3% to 4% revenue decline in Shipbuilding as a result of lower carrier repair and overhaul volume in 2010. Our outlook for Aerospace System does contemplate our understanding of the potential restructuring of the NPOESS and F-35 programs. We have not received any formal contractual direction on either program at this point. But for NPOESS, our customer has asked us to participate in a restructuring of the program, and the path forward will involve over the next several months. For the F-35, we anticipated a potential change in the program fee structure in the fourth quarter and we adjusted our financial assumptions accordingly. We expect 2010 segment operating margin rate to improve to the low 9% rate from this year's 8.7%. The improvement will be driven by margin rate expansion across the businesses. In Shipbuilding, we are currently booking minimum margins on the LPD program, as Wes mentioned, and we expect Shipbuilding's 2010 margin rate to be in the 5% to 6% range. This represents a modest incremental improvement from 2009, but in my view, it's the right level of expectation given where we are in the LPD program. Until we see that our operating systems improvements are generating sustainable performance improvement, and that our program mix improves as LPD revenue contribution declines from the delivery of these ships currently under construction, margin rate improvement in Shipbuilding will be gradual and modest.In the appendix of today's presentation, we provided 2010 sales and operating margin rate guidance for each of the five businesses for your information. For the company in total, we expect 2010 operating margin rate to expand to the mid-8% range from 7.4% in 2009. This reflects the operational improvements that I just described above, as well as the substantial improvement in the net pension adjustment. Our earnings per share guidance also assumes a lower share count, which is offset somewhat by the higher estimated tax rate of 34.5% for 2010.Moving to cash metrics, as Wes mentioned, we expect cash from operations at $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion. Both of these estimates are before the impact of planned discretionary pension pre-funding. On Slide 7, we provided a bridge from our 2009 earnings per share from continuing operations through our guidance for 2010 so that you can see proportionally on an EPS basis where the improvements are coming from. The largest improvements are operationally driven and from lower pension expense, somewhat offset by lower other net items and then the higher estimated tax rate for 2010. And finally, our guidance includes a reduction in the average shares outstanding as we used the proceeds from the TASC sale to repurchase stock. In summary, we expect a 17% to 22% increase in our earnings per share from continuing operations for 2010.Slide 8 provides some additional detail regarding pension accounting. We expect 2010 net pension adjustment to be an expense of approximately $35 million or $0.07 a share. This is an improvement of about $275 million over 2009, and the year-over-year improvement is detailed on the chart and driven by several factors. In 2009, our plan assets earned more than 15%, substantially higher than the 8.5% projected long-term rate of return. In 2009, we also made $800 million of discretionary contributions to the plan. So the combination of these two factors significantly reduced our projected FAS expense for 2010. And in addition, our CAS recovery improved by about $25 million in 2010.  Those positive factors were offset by a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate from 6.25% to 6%, and our assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is unchanged at 8.5%. You can also see on the chart that the funded status of the plans improved to 88% at the end of 2009 compared to 84% at the end of 2008. The improvement reflects the cash contributions, the healthy plan returns and some adjustments to our actuarial assumptions. And those positive impacts were partially offset by the lower discount rate, which increased our year-end pension obligation by approximately $700 million.For 2010, we have a $57 million mandatory funding requirement, and our current cash deployment plans call for approximately $300 million of discretionary pension funding in 2010. So Paul, I think with that introduction, we're ready for some Q&A."

As you know, our Shipbuilding business has two major components to it: One, the Nuclear business and Newport News and the Surface business in the Gulf. Clearly, LPD represents a challenge, as I mentioned earlier and as Jim also described in his remarks, as we go forward. But when we look more broadly across the portfolio, there are also good opportunities that we're addressing. For example, the increase in the submarine procurement to two per year starting fairly soon, was well-supported in the budget. That will represent a very nice opportunity for our Shipbuilding business. And I would say broadly, as we looked at budget coming through earlier this week, the President’s recommending a good strong support for Shipbuilding. So as we look out on the horizon, we do see our nation continuing to recognize the imperative for a strong Naval force structure. And given our position in Shipbuilding, that should represent a good opportunity for our business over the longer term. But all that being said, I would reinforce what we communicated during our remarks, that given that we do have a substantial sales volume on LPD at a very low margin rate, it will represent a downward tug on the rate at which we can improve margin rates here over the near term."

And, Jim, you might want to give a little financial flavor on VITA. With respect to the positioning of our Information Systems business, as I mentioned in my remarks, the defense and intelligence components of that business, today, represent about 75% of the sales. And as you could see in looking at the budget request, those areas are very, very well supported with respect to what the administration is requesting and, quite frankly, we believe, with respect to what the Congress will support going forward. The other roughly 25% of the sales is the area we described as Civil business within Information Systems. That is a mix of Federal, Civil business and state and local. We've been fairly clear in our prior communications that we are stepping back from the state and local IT outsourcing market, a market that we do not deem to be particularly attractive. And as a result, that is causing that aspect of the business to reduce overtime. The Civil Federal market, the market in which we participate, continues to represent some very good opportunities for the company. So while our overall Civil business is not looking at a substantial growth because of the focus in reducing our exposure in state local IT outsourcing, the component of that marketplace that deals with other departments of government, beyond defense and intelligence, we continue to see as representing good opportunities for us going forward."

In terms of the operational activities, we continue transitioning a number of the agencies and we continue having conversations with the commonwealth about whether certain agency should be outside the scope or have a different scope associated with their transformation. From a financial exposure perspective, I mentioned in the past that I see this type of contract having two major elements of exposure, one is the cost of transformation. At this point, I think we have a fairly good handle on that subject to resolving the exact scope of some of the agencies. The other issue associated with these types of programs is the future revenue stream associated with the total contract life. At this point, I would characterize that as the largest variable in our thinking about this program. But I think our financial assumptions at this time are reasonable and reflect that variability as well."

The E-2C is essentially transitioning and completing much of its production activities, and the E-2D is on the front-end of the ramp-up in production. And so there's a evolution or decline in E-2 revenues in total. And then UCAS [Unmanned Combat Air System] has some lower revenues in 2010 as compared to 2009. Shipbuilding, the decline is largely driven by the amount of carrier overhaul work that we anticipate in 2010 compared to '09. And then the technical services growth is largely related to the successful new awards that they won in 2009. Information Systems, the growth largely is coming out of the Intelligence and Defense divisions, which continue to grow, with the Civil division actually shrinking somewhat on a year-over-year basis.

We, of course, have provided the departments a lot of commentary around the financial terms and conditions that were resident in the draft RFP [request for proposal]. There were a variety of issues there that we identified that represented a risk profile that we did not find acceptable to support our bid. There are other issues associated with tanker beyond the financial terms. As I indicated in my remarks, we're also, quite frankly, displeased with the approach where value beyond the threshold requirements is not really well-recognized in the scoring methodology for the proposal. So as structured, it really does not represent a meaningful competitive opportunity for our offering, which inherently is a larger aircraft and inherently provides more capability. But a bigger airplane inherently costs a little bit more. So without that value-recognition methodology in the final RFP [request for proposal], we are fundamentally disadvantaged in the source selection evaluation process. So there are a variety of factors that go into our inclusion that unless we see some major restructuring in this final RFP [request for proposal], this is simply an unattractive proposition for our company to pursue bidding on. So that's perhaps a little bit broader picture on tanker than just the financial terms and conditions. But certainly, the financial terms and conditions are very, very important. And every single one of the new activities that we're going to assess bidding on, we're going to take a very careful look at the financial terms. And we're going to be very candid with the procuring organizations, as to our perspectives on those. We're early in taking a look at GMD. We are not particularly concerned about competing against incumbents. We have been quite successful at doing that in the past. So simply because there is a long-entrenched incumbency does not necessarily mean that you cannot have a very effective opportunity. We demonstrated that last year in our win at the KC-10 contractor logistics support competition. So GMD is one that we are taking a very careful look at. And we are certainly going to be highly engaged in working with the Missile Defense Agency in assessing the procurement terms and giving them our feedback. I believe that they are looking for a good robust competition here, and we're quite interested in that."

One is the GPS OCX [Global Positioning System Generation Operational Control Segment] program out of our Information Systems sector. And the other is also out of IS, the CAINS [Carrier Aircraft Inertial Navigational System] program. In both of those cases, we've had our proposals and been working through the final proposal update processes, and I believe that the government is on track for awards later in the first quarter. There are several others that we're focusing on that appear to get continuing good support in the budget process. We talked about GMD a little bit earlier. Just to kind of add to some of our earlier discussion on that, as you know, we had been the IPIC contractor for over 50 years. And so we have a tremendous legacy of excellence in supporting the sustainment and continued evolution of those weapon systems. We believe that brings a strong competency to compete on GMD, so we're looking at that one very, very carefully. The EMARs program, which is another one of the ISR platforms intended to provide more near-term support in the battlefield is an area that we're also focusing on; believe we have a number of strong capabilities that would position us well on EMARs. JSpOC is another good example. That's the Joint Space Operations Center. We're taking a careful look at that. We here, again, have a very substantial set of capabilities in managing space systems and also in large-scale operation centers, and we're looking at that one very carefully. So if we looked across our businesses, we see a wide variety of opportunities. And as the administration is continuing to focus in the ISR arena, C4ISR more broadly; certainly in cybersecurity and some of the other areas that I mentioned in my remarks earlier, such as unmanned. We see a very robust set of opportunities. I would say though, just to put a little bit of flavor on that, we are driving a degree of discipline into our system around the evaluation of opportunities that's a notch or two beyond where we have been. And so we're going to be looking at each one of these very carefully to make sure that successful capture of the opportunity supports our objectives for improving our margin rates, continuing to drive the overall performance of the company. So when we look at the opportunities, we're not thinking about scale. We're thinking about performance."

This morning, we'll discuss our first quarter results, operational highlights and Northrop Grumman's outlook for 2010. Overall, we're pleased with the quarter. EPS grew 37% to $1.51 as a result of higher sales, higher operating outcome and lower shares outstanding. We now expect 2010 earnings from continuing operations of $5.75 to $6 per share due to operational improvements. Cash flow for the quarter was impacted by some timing issues, but as we look at the year, we're comfortable that we will meet our cash guidance. During the quarter, we purchased 8.3 million shares of our stock for approximately $500 million. And approximately $440 million remains on our current authorization.  Combined with last year's fourth quarter repurchases of 8.4 million shares, we have now essentially offset the TASC divestiture's impact to 2010 earnings per share. As a result, we expect share repurchases to moderate from the pace of the last two quarters. 
First quarter new business awards totaled $6.9 billion, bringing total backlog to $67.5 billion or approximately two years of sales. The decline from year end is almost entirely due to a $1.4 billion decline in Shipbuilding backlog, where order flow is more lumpy due to the size and duration of contract awards. 
Looking ahead, we have many exciting new business opportunities. At the company level, EMARS is a key competitive ISR opportunity that evolved from the Aerial Common Sensor requirements. Northrop Grumman can bring an unparalleled set of capabilities to this pursuit from across our sectors, and EMARS' announcement is expected sometime in the fall.
For Aerospace, in the unmanned domain, we're pursuing several major new programs, including UCLASS. This is a multi-billion dollar Navy opportunity that builds on our UCAS work and leverages our industry-leading unmanned technology. We're also pursuing NATO AGS, a $2 billion program to deploy Global Hawk's Tornado and other promising international targets. We continue to make good progress on BAMS, our Global Hawk derivative for the Navy. This program is currently in development and the Navy has plans to procure multiple systems in the future, and this represents a terrific opportunity for us down the road when the program goes into production.
On the manned side, we have major international opportunities on Advanced Hawkeye and the FA-18. In space, we have opportunities for additional Advanced EHF payload builds and upgrades, and we are pursuing the Precision Tracking Space System, which builds on the recently launched STSS missile tracking program.
We continue to be excited about our broad array of differentiated sensor products on Electronics, such as VADER, our Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, which is capable of tracking vehicles and foot traffic over a wide area, and SABR, our Scalable Agile Beam Radar, which will provide state-of-the-art radar performance for the F-16.
Our Information Systems sector continues to pursue a robust set of targets, including the Joint Space Operations Center Mission System, which we expect to be awarded later this year. We're also excited about being BAE's teammate on the ground combat vehicle, which over the long term could be a major program for the company. 
In Shipbuilding, we are working with the Navy on follow-on awards with the DDG, LPD and LHA classes. And finally, Technical Services also has a number of new opportunities primarily in the logistics and maintenance area, including longer-term opportunities like the C-21 and C-9 CLS programs. So although we expect top line budgets to remain under pressure in the coming years, we continue to address a very robust new business pipeline.
Now I'd like to touch on a few of the operating highlights. As I said on our last call, our number one priority is to achieve sustainable operating performance improvement. Our sector results this quarter support achievement of our performance objectives for the year. Aerospace Systems had a strong quarter, in which they expanded their operating margin rate to 11%. We continue to see growth in our manned and unmanned programs as development programs like Global Hawk and Advanced Hawkeye move into production, complementing strong performance in legacy programs such as the FA-18 and B-2. 
During the quarter, we continued to build on our base of franchise programs, with new business awards for Advanced Hawkeye, Global Hawk, restricted work, ICBM, Joint STARS and the FA-18 program. Our industry-leading unmanned systems continue to deliver mission-enabling capabilities to our customers. Global Hawk is providing unparalleled in-theater service. It also recently demonstrated its utility and civil missions, with inaugural science flights for NASA and in support of earthquake relief efforts in Haiti. And Fire Scout, deployed aboard the USS McInerney, successfully supported its first drug interdiction mission. 
Electronic Systems also had solid results for the quarter, with a 12% operating margin rate. The lower margin rate this quarter principally reflects lower performance on our Flat Sequencing System program, which resulted from higher integration, test and deployment costs. We expect ES will meet our guidance of a mid- to high 12% margin rate for the year despite the slow start in the first quarter. Operational highlights for the quarter included $143 million order for more than 500 Lightweight Laser Designated Rangefinders (sic) [Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder] for the Army. To date, more than 1,300 of these systems have been delivered and fielded in Iraq and Afghanistan. We delivered our 500 Directional Infrared Countermeasures aircraft self-protection systems, and our Starlight program completed all of its testing. Starlight is a lightweight multi-function radar that can support a variety of manned and unmanned platforms for tactical reconnaissance, surveillance and target detection. And shortly after the end of the first quarter, our F-35 radar successfully flew its first Mission System's flight.
Information Systems sales were slightly lower than last year, primarily due to the planned decline in Civil Systems volume related to lower state and local government volume. We view improving performance in IS as one of our best opportunities, so we're particularly pleased with the 8.9% margin rate for the quarter. We continue to move along a path of sustainable performance improvement at IS. We had important positive developments this quarter on our VITA program. The Commonwealth of Virginia announced a comprehensive set of changes to the VITA contract. We believe the new agreement is an important step forward in both parties. Upon completion of its review period in late June, the modified agreement will significantly improve the clarity of program's scope and performance expectations. Another positive was the 7% increase in IS new business awards. We were one of two contractors selected for the development phase of the Navy's Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services program or CANES. This will lead to a down-selected contract to improve interoperability and affordability at shipboard network systems across the fleet. We also continued to capture restricted business in our Intelligence division, and Defense Systems was awarded additional work for our Battlefield Airborne Communications Node or BACN, which is providing in-theater warfighters with critical realtime battlefield information. 
For Shipbuilding, first quarter sales increased 25%, which reflects the extra working days this year and revenue step-backs in last year's first quarter. We continued to focus on improving performance in the Gulf, and our 6.2% margin rate this quarter reflects that progress. The four LPD ships in the Gulf remain our biggest challenge going forward. As we said last quarter, our improved operating system provides enhanced visibility that enables us to continually assess performance. Last week, we redelivered the USS Enterprise to the Navy. The recent redeliveries of the Enterprise, the Carl Vinson and the George H.W. Bush will result in lower carrier volume going forward and will contribute to more ratable Shipbuilding sales for the balance of the year.
Technical Services had a very strong quarter, with margin rate expansion to 6.4%. This reflects our strategy of focusing on higher margin opportunities, especially in the Lifecycle Optimization & Engineering business area. 
In summary, we're refining our sales estimate for the year to approximately $34.5 billion and raising our EPS guidance to reflect this quarter's strong operational performance. The new range is $5.75 to $6 per share. Our focus for the remainder of the year and our number one priority across the entire organization will continue to be achieving sustainable performance improvement. Improving performance and disciplined cash deployment continue to be Northrop Grumman's greatest shareholder value drivers. As a management team, we are firmly committed to realizing positive performance improvements in all of our businesses, and we demonstrated some of that improvement with our first quarter results.
So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our quarter and our 2010 outlook. Jim?"

During my comments this morning, I'll give you my perspective on the quarter, the sector results and our guidance for the sectors, as well as cash flow performance and guidance for the year.As Wes sai",1405,"Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During my comments this morning, I'll give you my perspective on the quarter, the sector results and our guidance for the sectors, as well as cash flow performance and guidance for the year.
As Wes said, it was a good solid quarter and a good start for the year. EPS growth was 37%, with sales, operating improvement and a lower share count being the biggest growth drivers. Due largely to cost cuts implemented in 2006, we did not have a charge related to the recent legislative changes impacting the Medicare Part D subsidies. You all might remember that we had indicated in our 10-K that Medicare Part D subsidies were not significant.
So let's look at the quarter, starting with sales, a growth rate of 8.5%, which included the impact of more working days in this year's first quarter. Excluding that impact, we estimate that sales growth was consistent with our guidance for the low single-digit growth rate. Operating income increased 24% due to lower net pension expense, higher segment operating income and lower corporate unallocated expenses. And then, the third driver of EPS growth was a nearly 8% reduction in our weighted average share count as a result of our share repurchase program.
So let me start with sales then again and try to put it into a little bit of perspective due to the additional working days. Depending on the sector of the impacts, an impact just like the snow on the East Coast that we saw in the first quarter, the additional days ranged anywhere from two to five days. And obviously, the impact was not uniform across the five sectors, but I estimated that they accounted for about $400 million of this quarter's year-over-year growth. And then, another $100 million of growth reflects the first quarter 2009 step-back in sales that we recorded in Shipbuilding, due to the negative contact adjustments on the LPD and DDG programs last year in the first quarter. So adjusting for those two items, sales growth was between 2% and 3% and as I said, consistent with our updated guidance for the year.
On an earnings per share basis, the additional working days represent about $0.08 per share. So looking ahead, the fourth quarter of 2010 will have fewer working days than last year's fourth quarter, with the second and third quarters having the same number of workdays as in 2009. So let's spend a few minutes and talk about each of the sectors. Aerospace sales reflect the impact of the extra working days, with some modest growth beyond that. For the year, we continued to expect stable revenues, with some variability, depending upon the timing of the NPOESS' restructuring. Until that program is restructured, we continue to work under our current contract, with 2010 first quarter revenues for NPOESS being comparable to last year. Aerospace sales performance reflects the overall strength of its portfolio, especially in light of last year's KEI termination, which represented about $60 million in sales in last year's first quarter that were not repeated this year. Solid sales results were accompanied by the strong 11% operating margin, 50 basis points better than last year due to improved performance across a number of different programs. For the year, we continue to expect a mid-10% operating margin rate, but I think we could potentially do slightly better as well. 
Electronic sales grew 5%, reflecting the extra days with a 12% operating margin. The lower margin rate this quarter reflects the lower performance on our Flat Sequencing System program, as well as a lower royalty income than in the prior year and a small provision for workforce reduction at some selected sites at ES. They recently announced a small reduction in workforce to rebalance the skill mix required for the existing backlog and anticipated new awards. And for the year, we continue to expect ES operating margin rates in the mid- to high 12% range. 
For Information Systems, the additional days were not a significant benefit in the quarter due to the snow days in the East Coast. The decline in Civil revenues, which were anticipated or planned, were partially offset by about a 4% increase for our intelligence programs, where we continue to see growth opportunities. In our Defense Systems division, revenue was down slightly this quarter due to the higher volume of in-theater hardware deliveries during the first quarter of 2009. This included programs like the Command Post Platform, Trailer Mounted Support System, Counter-Rocket Artillery and Mortars, and Integrated Base Defense Security System. Looking forward, we continue to see good demand in our core C4ISR areas and intelligence domains, particularly in a number of restricted areas. We do see some pressure on IS sales for the year, but we are also increasing our margin rate guidance for Information Systems to the mid 8% from low to mid 8%.
Shipbuilding sales increased 25%. This increase needs to be put in context in terms of what I expect for the balance of the year. $346 million sales growth for the quarter was driven by several factors. First, the additional days accounted for about $115 million of growth. Secondly, last quarter's first quarter sales were reduced by about $100 million step-back in revenues for the LPD and DDG EAC adjustments. And thirdly, we experienced some cost growth in LPDs this quarter as we worked towards ensuring that we were producing and delivering quality ships. Looking ahead, Shipbuilding sales will be more ratable for the rest of the year due to the redelivery of the Enterprise, which contributed about $55 million of revenues in the first quarter that obviously won't continue for the balance of the year. As Wes said, we expect Shipbuilding sales will be approximately $6.2 billion for the year or comparable to the 2009 sales level, with margin rate between 5% and 6%. 
Technical Services had a 21% sales growth and their operating income increased 32% to 6.4%. First quarter sales benefited from the additional days and included higher volume for existing programs like the Counter-Narcoterrorism program, as well as new programs like KC-10 and C-20, which were competitive captures in 2009. Higher operating income and higher operating rate reflect the volume increases, as well as the more favorable contract mix towards the higher-margin Lifecycle Optimization & Engineering programs. We continue to expect a low to mid-6% margin rate and sales could be stronger than our original guidance of 2% to 4%, depending upon ID/IQ TASC order levels over the balance of the year. 
Turning to cash for the quarter, operations used $531 million of cash and free cash outflow totaled $669 million for the quarter. As many of you know, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter, but in addition to the seasonality issues, there were several timing issues that impacted our results. The first was a delay in Information Systems' billings and collections, which was related to the TASC divestiture. This, along with a decrease in payables, negatively impacted working capital by about $425 million. These are timing issues. We're already in process of recovering those issues in the second quarter.
The first quarter also included an additional payroll payment due to additional days in the quarter, as well as a higher federal tax payment. These two items represented about $150 million. So when I consider each of those items, as Wes said, we're comfortable with our guidance for cash flow, and we continue to expect cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year and free cash flow in a range of $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion before discretionary pension contributions. And also, as Wes mentioned, based on first quarter results, we now expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $5.75 to $6 per share, an additional -- an increase of $0.05 for the year. Driven by higher sales at Shipbuilding and say, potentially higher sales in Aerospace Systems and Technical Services, with higher-margin rates for Information Systems and potentially slight increase in Aerospace Systems, I see as the drivers for the increase.
So I'd say in summary, a good solid quarter, one that supports our improved operational outlook for the year and demonstrates the focus that Wes talked about in driving sustainable performance improvement, and that performance improvement yielding results. So, Paul, I think with that, we're ready to turn it over for Q&A."

Let me address that. We have been, I think, very clear and you referenced it, that we have taken a very careful look over the last few years of in state and local, determined that, that is not really a very attractive marketplace for us, given the way that we typically bring ultimate value to customers. And so, we've been backing away from that, and as we said in our remarks, our sales in our Civil Systems part of IS have been on a planned decline as a result of those decisions that we made. At the same time, the Defense business and the Intelligence business at Information Systems, which together represent right around 75% of our total sales at IS, are strong, healthy businesses. And when I went through my earlier remarks on opportunities, you probably noticed that there were quite a few of the opportunities that I discussed associated with Information Systems. We bring a number of what we see as truly discriminating capabilities to Defense and Intelligence, ranging from the work that we do in command and control, the work, of course, that we do in ISR, where we have some just absolutely preeminent positions, and the work that we do in cybersecurity, which we see continuing to grow quite robustly. So we are optimistic about the outlook at IS in both Intel and Defense. We see sort of a little bit of a longer cycle for Civil, largely driven by bringing the expertise that we have in cybersecurity from Intel and defense into many of our Civil applications, where we're beginning to see the cyber capabilities as an enabler to go after some of the more sophisticated requirements of other federal agencies. So we like this business. We think it's a good business for our future, and we're looking forward to getting to the right place in our balance of the portfolio in Civil in continuing to grow the rest of the business. Now let me also give a perspective how we're thinking about that growth. There are various layers in the Information Systems market. We are really focusing our attention on the layers where we can bring real value through engineering content, where we have truly differentiated offerings and where the margin opportunities are consistent with our margin expansion objectives in the company. So we will not be going after opportunities in this space simply because of top line revenue opportunities. We're looking very carefully at the opportunities as to whether or not they support our margin rate objectives."

The HALE systems are large platforms, each individually large, and they're large programs such as Global Hawk and BAMS. So naturally, they do represent a substantial fraction.

The idea that you can have an asset at an altitude that affords it, and enormous amount of visibility and selection capability and availability over many, many a long hour of duration of focus is just a very, very useful tool for the military. That said, while we are really focused on growing HALE, we're also focused on some of the other applications. And there's a long list I could point out, but one in particular is UCAS. The concept of having unmanned operations off of a carrier will transform a lot of the fundamental concept of operations for force deployment. And we see that as another groundbreaking opportunity in the application of unmanned. We have a lot of other great actions going on in unmanned, whether it's Fire Scout or even smaller unmanned vehicles. We continue to apply a lot of engineering innovations to this field.

On the last few years as we went through some of the struggles in the Gulf, that performance declined. But we expect that with the new class of ships, we will be able to return to the level of performance we've demonstrated in the past. A big part of that is the operating system that we put in place in the Gulf that's up and running. That's giving us the type of transparency and the grid, the in-depth understanding that we need to not only better plan the execution, but in realtime, really see how it's going in a shipyard today is managing multiple classes of ships compared to the past, back in the 90s, when it really was primarily just the DDG program that was going through. So we feel good about the progress that we've made operationally and being able to get that underway. The other thing I would say though is we are not yet under contract fully for those DDGs, so we are in the process of working through the contracting with the Navy, and we are very focused on making sure that those contracts support our opportunity to perform well.

We've, I think, done a very good job under Mike's leadership, Mike and his team's leadership of figuring out how to best optimize where we're going. And that means looking at every single aspect. We've talked a lot about the operating system and how we actually manage the flow of the work through the yard in the Gulf. Quality is another area where we've just put an extraordinary focus on changing the way that we've address that opportunity. Leadership development, talent development, training of the workforce, you name it, just about every aspect of the operational capacity in the Gulf, and then translating a lot of that back into Newport News. So I think while we're clearly not out of the woods, we have a margin rate that we're forecasting in Shipbuilding this year. That's not a margin rate that we would be happy with in the long term, but it does represent a good step up over last year. We still have several programs, primarily the LPDs in the Gulf that are operating at low or no margin rate that will pull us down for a while on our margin rate improvements curve.

If anything, I think -- this is Wes, I think that the outcome that we saw out of the DOD confirmed our thinking in our divestiture, very strongly confirmed it. The rule that came forward if you decompose it really had sort of three basic types of conflicts. But I was worried about cases where there were impaired objectivity. So if a contractor is giving technical advise on a procurement and the contractor also has some form of financial interest in that procurement, that's a conflict that talked about unfair access to non-public information, which kind of a broad statement around how you would look at access. And then the third category around biased ground rules. So that's if the contractor happens to be working on one contract, but you're in a position to help set the ground rules for some future acquisition that it might compete for. These are pretty broad statements about the way that federal procurement officials need to think about OCI and interpret OCI, and are pretty well aligned with the framework that we saw our largest customers in the TASC business using when they were alerting us last year that we would not be able to compete for some of the business we currently had. So instead of standing by and watching that business dissipate, we think we took a very appropriate action both for our customers and our shareholders to divest that business, put it in the hands of an organization that did not have these types of conflicts, so that it can grow and thrive. And I think with these rules, it has a good opportunity to grow and thrive looking at how it's situated relative to the businesses that remain within some of the other large contractors. So I do think it will cause others to stand back and think carefully about what they're doing."

In Information Systems, we tend to participate in sort of the higher end of the marketplace that's largely engineering driven, large-scale solutions driven. And while there is always pricing pressure in every single market that we participate in, there it is largely value determinations that we see in source selection. So you've got to support the customers' budgets, obviously. But I think the customers in those areas have a little bit broader view of value in terms of the solutions being brought to the table and how that satisfies their business case. In Technical Services, that area has always been and, I think, will increasingly be much more price sensitive. We have sort of three major areas in Technical Services. We do a lot of base and range support in our systems' life cycle, the systems support group. We do a lot of training work and, of course, we do a lot of operations and maintenance, some logistics work in our Life Cycle Optimization business. All three of those have, I would say, intense price sensitivity, and I think we'll continue to have that sensitivity. So a little bit different flavor for the two different businesses."

This morning, we'll discuss our first quarter results, operational highlights and Northrop Grumman's outlook for 2010. Overall, we're pleased with the quarter. EPS grew 37% to $1.51 as a result of higher sales, higher operating outcome and lower shares outstanding. We now expect 2010 earnings from continuing operations of $5.75 to $6 per share due to operational improvements. Cash flow for the quarter was impacted by some timing issues, but as we look at the year, we're comfortable that we will meet our cash guidance. During the quarter, we purchased 8.3 million shares of our stock for approximately $500 million. And approximately $440 million remains on our current authorization.  Combined with last year's fourth quarter repurchases of 8.4 million shares, we have now essentially offset the TASC divestiture's impact to 2010 earnings per share. As a result, we expect share repurchases to moderate from the pace of the last two quarters. 
First quarter new business awards totaled $6.9 billion, bringing total backlog to $67.5 billion or approximately two years of sales. The decline from year end is almost entirely due to a $1.4 billion decline in Shipbuilding backlog, where order flow is more lumpy due to the size and duration of contract awards. 
Looking ahead, we have many exciting new business opportunities. At the company level, EMARS is a key competitive ISR opportunity that evolved from the Aerial Common Sensor requirements. Northrop Grumman can bring an unparalleled set of capabilities to this pursuit from across our sectors, and EMARS' announcement is expected sometime in the fall.
For Aerospace, in the unmanned domain, we're pursuing several major new programs, including UCLASS. This is a multi-billion dollar Navy opportunity that builds on our UCAS work and leverages our industry-leading unmanned technology. We're also pursuing NATO AGS, a $2 billion program to deploy Global Hawk's Tornado and other promising international targets. We continue to make good progress on BAMS, our Global Hawk derivative for the Navy. This program is currently in development and the Navy has plans to procure multiple systems in the future, and this represents a terrific opportunity for us down the road when the program goes into production.
On the manned side, we have major international opportunities on Advanced Hawkeye and the FA-18. In space, we have opportunities for additional Advanced EHF payload builds and upgrades, and we are pursuing the Precision Tracking Space System, which builds on the recently launched STSS missile tracking program.
We continue to be excited about our broad array of differentiated sensor products on Electronics, such as VADER, our Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, which is capable of tracking vehicles and foot traffic over a wide area, and SABR, our Scalable Agile Beam Radar, which will provide state-of-the-art radar performance for the F-16.
Our Information Systems sector continues to pursue a robust set of targets, including the Joint Space Operations Center Mission System, which we expect to be awarded later this year. We're also excited about being BAE's teammate on the ground combat vehicle, which over the long term could be a major program for the company. 
In Shipbuilding, we are working with the Navy on follow-on awards with the DDG, LPD and LHA classes. And finally, Technical Services also has a number of new opportunities primarily in the logistics and maintenance area, including longer-term opportunities like the C-21 and C-9 CLS programs. So although we expect top line budgets to remain under pressure in the coming years, we continue to address a very robust new business pipeline.
Now I'd like to touch on a few of the operating highlights. As I said on our last call, our number one priority is to achieve sustainable operating performance improvement. Our sector results this quarter support achievement of our performance objectives for the year. Aerospace Systems had a strong quarter, in which they expanded their operating margin rate to 11%. We continue to see growth in our manned and unmanned programs as development programs like Global Hawk and Advanced Hawkeye move into production, complementing strong performance in legacy programs such as the FA-18 and B-2. 
During the quarter, we continued to build on our base of franchise programs, with new business awards for Advanced Hawkeye, Global Hawk, restricted work, ICBM, Joint STARS and the FA-18 program. Our industry-leading unmanned systems continue to deliver mission-enabling capabilities to our customers. Global Hawk is providing unparalleled in-theater service. It also recently demonstrated its utility and civil missions, with inaugural science flights for NASA and in support of earthquake relief efforts in Haiti. And Fire Scout, deployed aboard the USS McInerney, successfully supported its first drug interdiction mission. 
Electronic Systems also had solid results for the quarter, with a 12% operating margin rate. The lower margin rate this quarter principally reflects lower performance on our Flat Sequencing System program, which resulted from higher integration, test and deployment costs. We expect ES will meet our guidance of a mid- to high 12% margin rate for the year despite the slow start in the first quarter. Operational highlights for the quarter included $143 million order for more than 500 Lightweight Laser Designated Rangefinders (sic) [Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder] for the Army. To date, more than 1,300 of these systems have been delivered and fielded in Iraq and Afghanistan. We delivered our 500 Directional Infrared Countermeasures aircraft self-protection systems, and our Starlight program completed all of its testing. Starlight is a lightweight multi-function radar that can support a variety of manned and unmanned platforms for tactical reconnaissance, surveillance and target detection. And shortly after the end of the first quarter, our F-35 radar successfully flew its first Mission System's flight.
Information Systems sales were slightly lower than last year, primarily due to the planned decline in Civil Systems volume related to lower state and local government volume. We view improving performance in IS as one of our best opportunities, so we're particularly pleased with the 8.9% margin rate for the quarter. We continue to move along a path of sustainable performance improvement at IS. We had important positive developments this quarter on our VITA program. The Commonwealth of Virginia announced a comprehensive set of changes to the VITA contract. We believe the new agreement is an important step forward in both parties. Upon completion of its review period in late June, the modified agreement will significantly improve the clarity of program's scope and performance expectations. Another positive was the 7% increase in IS new business awards. We were one of two contractors selected for the development phase of the Navy's Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services program or CANES. This will lead to a down-selected contract to improve interoperability and affordability at shipboard network systems across the fleet. We also continued to capture restricted business in our Intelligence division, and Defense Systems was awarded additional work for our Battlefield Airborne Communications Node or BACN, which is providing in-theater warfighters with critical realtime battlefield information. 
For Shipbuilding, first quarter sales increased 25%, which reflects the extra working days this year and revenue step-backs in last year's first quarter. We continued to focus on improving performance in the Gulf, and our 6.2% margin rate this quarter reflects that progress. The four LPD ships in the Gulf remain our biggest challenge going forward. As we said last quarter, our improved operating system provides enhanced visibility that enables us to continually assess performance. Last week, we redelivered the USS Enterprise to the Navy. The recent redeliveries of the Enterprise, the Carl Vinson and the George H.W. Bush will result in lower carrier volume going forward and will contribute to more ratable Shipbuilding sales for the balance of the year.
Technical Services had a very strong quarter, with margin rate expansion to 6.4%. This reflects our strategy of focusing on higher margin opportunities, especially in the Lifecycle Optimization & Engineering business area. 
In summary, we're refining our sales estimate for the year to approximately $34.5 billion and raising our EPS guidance to reflect this quarter's strong operational performance. The new range is $5.75 to $6 per share. Our focus for the remainder of the year and our number one priority across the entire organization will continue to be achieving sustainable performance improvement. Improving performance and disciplined cash deployment continue to be Northrop Grumman's greatest shareholder value drivers. As a management team, we are firmly committed to realizing positive performance improvements in all of our businesses, and we demonstrated some of that improvement with our first quarter results.
So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our quarter and our 2010 outlook. Jim?"

During my comments this morning, I'll give you my perspective on the quarter, the sector results and our guidance for the sectors, as well as cash flow performance and guidance for the year.As Wes sai",1405,"Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During my comments this morning, I'll give you my perspective on the quarter, the sector results and our guidance for the sectors, as well as cash flow performance and guidance for the year.
As Wes said, it was a good solid quarter and a good start for the year. EPS growth was 37%, with sales, operating improvement and a lower share count being the biggest growth drivers. Due largely to cost cuts implemented in 2006, we did not have a charge related to the recent legislative changes impacting the Medicare Part D subsidies. You all might remember that we had indicated in our 10-K that Medicare Part D subsidies were not significant.
So let's look at the quarter, starting with sales, a growth rate of 8.5%, which included the impact of more working days in this year's first quarter. Excluding that impact, we estimate that sales growth was consistent with our guidance for the low single-digit growth rate. Operating income increased 24% due to lower net pension expense, higher segment operating income and lower corporate unallocated expenses. And then, the third driver of EPS growth was a nearly 8% reduction in our weighted average share count as a result of our share repurchase program.
So let me start with sales then again and try to put it into a little bit of perspective due to the additional working days. Depending on the sector of the impacts, an impact just like the snow on the East Coast that we saw in the first quarter, the additional days ranged anywhere from two to five days. And obviously, the impact was not uniform across the five sectors, but I estimated that they accounted for about $400 million of this quarter's year-over-year growth. And then, another $100 million of growth reflects the first quarter 2009 step-back in sales that we recorded in Shipbuilding, due to the negative contact adjustments on the LPD and DDG programs last year in the first quarter. So adjusting for those two items, sales growth was between 2% and 3% and as I said, consistent with our updated guidance for the year.
On an earnings per share basis, the additional working days represent about $0.08 per share. So looking ahead, the fourth quarter of 2010 will have fewer working days than last year's fourth quarter, with the second and third quarters having the same number of workdays as in 2009. So let's spend a few minutes and talk about each of the sectors. Aerospace sales reflect the impact of the extra working days, with some modest growth beyond that. For the year, we continued to expect stable revenues, with some variability, depending upon the timing of the NPOESS' restructuring. Until that program is restructured, we continue to work under our current contract, with 2010 first quarter revenues for NPOESS being comparable to last year. Aerospace sales performance reflects the overall strength of its portfolio, especially in light of last year's KEI termination, which represented about $60 million in sales in last year's first quarter that were not repeated this year. Solid sales results were accompanied by the strong 11% operating margin, 50 basis points better than last year due to improved performance across a number of different programs. For the year, we continue to expect a mid-10% operating margin rate, but I think we could potentially do slightly better as well. 
Electronic sales grew 5%, reflecting the extra days with a 12% operating margin. The lower margin rate this quarter reflects the lower performance on our Flat Sequencing System program, as well as a lower royalty income than in the prior year and a small provision for workforce reduction at some selected sites at ES. They recently announced a small reduction in workforce to rebalance the skill mix required for the existing backlog and anticipated new awards. And for the year, we continue to expect ES operating margin rates in the mid- to high 12% range. 
For Information Systems, the additional days were not a significant benefit in the quarter due to the snow days in the East Coast. The decline in Civil revenues, which were anticipated or planned, were partially offset by about a 4% increase for our intelligence programs, where we continue to see growth opportunities. In our Defense Systems division, revenue was down slightly this quarter due to the higher volume of in-theater hardware deliveries during the first quarter of 2009. This included programs like the Command Post Platform, Trailer Mounted Support System, Counter-Rocket Artillery and Mortars, and Integrated Base Defense Security System. Looking forward, we continue to see good demand in our core C4ISR areas and intelligence domains, particularly in a number of restricted areas. We do see some pressure on IS sales for the year, but we are also increasing our margin rate guidance for Information Systems to the mid 8% from low to mid 8%.
Shipbuilding sales increased 25%. This increase needs to be put in context in terms of what I expect for the balance of the year. $346 million sales growth for the quarter was driven by several factors. First, the additional days accounted for about $115 million of growth. Secondly, last quarter's first quarter sales were reduced by about $100 million step-back in revenues for the LPD and DDG EAC adjustments. And thirdly, we experienced some cost growth in LPDs this quarter as we worked towards ensuring that we were producing and delivering quality ships. Looking ahead, Shipbuilding sales will be more ratable for the rest of the year due to the redelivery of the Enterprise, which contributed about $55 million of revenues in the first quarter that obviously won't continue for the balance of the year. As Wes said, we expect Shipbuilding sales will be approximately $6.2 billion for the year or comparable to the 2009 sales level, with margin rate between 5% and 6%. 
Technical Services had a 21% sales growth and their operating income increased 32% to 6.4%. First quarter sales benefited from the additional days and included higher volume for existing programs like the Counter-Narcoterrorism program, as well as new programs like KC-10 and C-20, which were competitive captures in 2009. Higher operating income and higher operating rate reflect the volume increases, as well as the more favorable contract mix towards the higher-margin Lifecycle Optimization & Engineering programs. We continue to expect a low to mid-6% margin rate and sales could be stronger than our original guidance of 2% to 4%, depending upon ID/IQ TASC order levels over the balance of the year. 
Turning to cash for the quarter, operations used $531 million of cash and free cash outflow totaled $669 million for the quarter. As many of you know, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter, but in addition to the seasonality issues, there were several timing issues that impacted our results. The first was a delay in Information Systems' billings and collections, which was related to the TASC divestiture. This, along with a decrease in payables, negatively impacted working capital by about $425 million. These are timing issues. We're already in process of recovering those issues in the second quarter.
The first quarter also included an additional payroll payment due to additional days in the quarter, as well as a higher federal tax payment. These two items represented about $150 million. So when I consider each of those items, as Wes said, we're comfortable with our guidance for cash flow, and we continue to expect cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year and free cash flow in a range of $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion before discretionary pension contributions. And also, as Wes mentioned, based on first quarter results, we now expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $5.75 to $6 per share, an additional -- an increase of $0.05 for the year. Driven by higher sales at Shipbuilding and say, potentially higher sales in Aerospace Systems and Technical Services, with higher-margin rates for Information Systems and potentially slight increase in Aerospace Systems, I see as the drivers for the increase.
So I'd say in summary, a good solid quarter, one that supports our improved operational outlook for the year and demonstrates the focus that Wes talked about in driving sustainable performance improvement, and that performance improvement yielding results. So, Paul, I think with that, we're ready to turn it over for Q&A."

Let me address that. We have been, I think, very clear and you referenced it, that we have taken a very careful look over the last few years of in state and local, determined that, that is not really a very attractive marketplace for us, given the way that we typically bring ultimate value to customers. And so, we've been backing away from that, and as we said in our remarks, our sales in our Civil Systems part of IS have been on a planned decline as a result of those decisions that we made. At the same time, the Defense business and the Intelligence business at Information Systems, which together represent right around 75% of our total sales at IS, are strong, healthy businesses. And when I went through my earlier remarks on opportunities, you probably noticed that there were quite a few of the opportunities that I discussed associated with Information Systems. We bring a number of what we see as truly discriminating capabilities to Defense and Intelligence, ranging from the work that we do in command and control, the work, of course, that we do in ISR, where we have some just absolutely preeminent positions, and the work that we do in cybersecurity, which we see continuing to grow quite robustly. So we are optimistic about the outlook at IS in both Intel and Defense. We see sort of a little bit of a longer cycle for Civil, largely driven by bringing the expertise that we have in cybersecurity from Intel and defense into many of our Civil applications, where we're beginning to see the cyber capabilities as an enabler to go after some of the more sophisticated requirements of other federal agencies. So we like this business. We think it's a good business for our future, and we're looking forward to getting to the right place in our balance of the portfolio in Civil in continuing to grow the rest of the business. Now let me also give a perspective how we're thinking about that growth. There are various layers in the Information Systems market. We are really focusing our attention on the layers where we can bring real value through engineering content, where we have truly differentiated offerings and where the margin opportunities are consistent with our margin expansion objectives in the company. So we will not be going after opportunities in this space simply because of top line revenue opportunities. We're looking very carefully at the opportunities as to whether or not they support our margin rate objectives."

The HALE systems are large platforms, each individually large, and they're large programs such as Global Hawk and BAMS. So naturally, they do represent a substantial fraction.

The idea that you can have an asset at an altitude that affords it, and enormous amount of visibility and selection capability and availability over many, many a long hour of duration of focus is just a very, very useful tool for the military. That said, while we are really focused on growing HALE, we're also focused on some of the other applications. And there's a long list I could point out, but one in particular is UCAS. The concept of having unmanned operations off of a carrier will transform a lot of the fundamental concept of operations for force deployment. And we see that as another groundbreaking opportunity in the application of unmanned. We have a lot of other great actions going on in unmanned, whether it's Fire Scout or even smaller unmanned vehicles. We continue to apply a lot of engineering innovations to this field.

But we expect that with the new class of ships, we will be able to return to the level of performance we've demonstrated in the past. A big part of that is the operating system that we put in place in the Gulf that's up and running. That's giving us the type of transparency and the grid, the in-depth understanding that we need to not only better plan the execution, but in realtime, really see how it's going in a shipyard today is managing multiple classes of ships compared to the past, back in the 90s, when it really was primarily just the DDG program that was going through. So we feel good about the progress that we've made operationally and being able to get that underway. The other thing I would say though is we are not yet under contract fully for those DDGs, so we are in the process of working through the contracting with the Navy, and we are very focused on making sure that those contracts support our opportunity to perform well.

We've, I think, done a very good job under Mike's leadership, Mike and his team's leadership of figuring out how to best optimize where we're going. And that means looking at every single aspect. We've talked a lot about the operating system and how we actually manage the flow of the work through the yard in the Gulf. Quality is another area where we've just put an extraordinary focus on changing the way that we've address that opportunity. Leadership development, talent development, training of the workforce, you name it, just about every aspect of the operational capacity in the Gulf, and then translating a lot of that back into Newport News. So I think while we're clearly not out of the woods, we have a margin rate that we're forecasting in Shipbuilding this year. That's not a margin rate that we would be happy with in the long term, but it does represent a good step up over last year. We still have several programs, primarily the LPDs in the Gulf that are operating at low or no margin rate that will pull us down for a while on our margin rate improvements curve.

If anything, I think -- this is Wes, I think that the outcome that we saw out of the DOD confirmed our thinking in our divestiture, very strongly confirmed it. The rule that came forward if you decompose it really had sort of three basic types of conflicts. But I was worried about cases where there were impaired objectivity. So if a contractor is giving technical advise on a procurement and the contractor also has some form of financial interest in that procurement, that's a conflict that talked about unfair access to non-public information, which kind of a broad statement around how you would look at access. And then the third category around biased ground rules. So that's if the contractor happens to be working on one contract, but you're in a position to help set the ground rules for some future acquisition that it might compete for. These are pretty broad statements about the way that federal procurement officials need to think about OCI and interpret OCI, and are pretty well aligned with the framework that we saw our largest customers in the TASC business using when they were alerting us last year that we would not be able to compete for some of the business we currently had. So instead of standing by and watching that business dissipate, we think we took a very appropriate action both for our customers and our shareholders to divest that business, put it in the hands of an organization that did not have these types of conflicts, so that it can grow and thrive. And I think with these rules, it has a good opportunity to grow and thrive looking at how it's situated relative to the businesses that remain within some of the other large contractors. So I do think it will cause others to stand back and think carefully about what they're doing."

In Information Systems, we tend to participate in sort of the higher end of the marketplace that's largely engineering driven, large-scale solutions driven. And while there is always pricing pressure in every single market that we participate in, there it is largely value determinations that we see in source selection.

But I think the customers in those areas have a little bit broader view of value in terms of the solutions being brought to the table and how that satisfies their business case. In Technical Services, that area has always been and, I think, will increasingly be much more price sensitive. We have sort of three major areas in Technical Services. We do a lot of base and range support in our systems' life cycle, the systems support group. We do a lot of training work and, of course, we do a lot of operations and maintenance, some logistics work in our Life Cycle Optimization business.

Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings, and may cause actual company results to differ materially.
During today's call, we'll discuss first quarter results and our guidance for 2010. We will refer to non-GAAP measures, which are defined and reconciled in our earnings release. I also want to point out that results for all periods reported reflect the TASC divestiture, which was completed in December of 2009. On the income statement, TASC sales, operating income and the net gain on sale are accounted for as discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2009 and for all periods presented.

This morning, we'll discuss our first quarter results, operational highlights and Northrop Grumman's outlook for 2010. Overall, we're pleased with the quarter. EPS grew 37% to $1.51 as a result of higher sales, higher operating outcome and lower shares outstanding. We now expect 2010 earnings from continuing operations of $5.75 to $6 per share due to operational improvements. Cash flow for the quarter was impacted by some timing issues, but as we look at the year, we're comfortable that we will meet our cash guidance. During the quarter, we purchased 8.3 million shares of our stock for approximately $500 million. And approximately $440 million remains on our current authorization.  Combined with last year's fourth quarter repurchases of 8.4 million shares, we have now essentially offset the TASC divestiture's impact to 2010 earnings per share. As a result, we expect share repurchases to moderate from the pace of the last two quarters. 
First quarter new business awards totaled $6.9 billion, bringing total backlog to $67.5 billion or approximately two years of sales. The decline from year end is almost entirely due to a $1.4 billion decline in Shipbuilding backlog, where order flow is more lumpy due to the size and duration of contract awards. 
Looking ahead, we have many exciting new business opportunities. At the company level, EMARS is a key competitive ISR opportunity that evolved from the Aerial Common Sensor requirements. Northrop Grumman can bring an unparalleled set of capabilities to this pursuit from across our sectors, and EMARS' announcement is expected sometime in the fall.
For Aerospace, in the unmanned domain, we're pursuing several major new programs, including UCLASS. This is a multi-billion dollar Navy opportunity that builds on our UCAS work and leverages our industry-leading unmanned technology. We're also pursuing NATO AGS, a $2 billion program to deploy Global Hawk's Tornado and other promising international targets. We continue to make good progress on BAMS, our Global Hawk derivative for the Navy. This program is currently in development and the Navy has plans to procure multiple systems in the future, and this represents a terrific opportunity for us down the road when the program goes into production.
On the manned side, we have major international opportunities on Advanced Hawkeye and the FA-18. In space, we have opportunities for additional Advanced EHF payload builds and upgrades, and we are pursuing the Precision Tracking Space System, which builds on the recently launched STSS missile tracking program.
We continue to be excited about our broad array of differentiated sensor products on Electronics, such as VADER, our Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, which is capable of tracking vehicles and foot traffic over a wide area, and SABR, our Scalable Agile Beam Radar, which will provide state-of-the-art radar performance for the F-16.
Our Information Systems sector continues to pursue a robust set of targets, including the Joint Space Operations Center Mission System, which we expect to be awarded later this year. We're also excited about being BAE's teammate on the ground combat vehicle, which over the long term could be a major program for the company. 
In Shipbuilding, we are working with the Navy on follow-on awards with the DDG, LPD and LHA classes. And finally, Technical Services also has a number of new opportunities primarily in the logistics and maintenance area, including longer-term opportunities like the C-21 and C-9 CLS programs. So although we expect top line budgets to remain under pressure in the coming years, we continue to address a very robust new business pipeline.
Now I'd like to touch on a few of the operating highlights. As I said on our last call, our number one priority is to achieve sustainable operating performance improvement. Our sector results this quarter support achievement of our performance objectives for the year. Aerospace Systems had a strong quarter, in which they expanded their operating margin rate to 11%. We continue to see growth in our manned and unmanned programs as development programs like Global Hawk and Advanced Hawkeye move into production, complementing strong performance in legacy programs such as the FA-18 and B-2. 
During the quarter, we continued to build on our base of franchise programs, with new business awards for Advanced Hawkeye, Global Hawk, restricted work, ICBM, Joint STARS and the FA-18 program. Our industry-leading unmanned systems continue to deliver mission-enabling capabilities to our customers. Global Hawk is providing unparalleled in-theater service. It also recently demonstrated its utility and civil missions, with inaugural science flights for NASA and in support of earthquake relief efforts in Haiti. And Fire Scout, deployed aboard the USS McInerney, successfully supported its first drug interdiction mission. 
Electronic Systems also had solid results for the quarter, with a 12% operating margin rate. The lower margin rate this quarter principally reflects lower performance on our Flat Sequencing System program, which resulted from higher integration, test and deployment costs. We expect ES will meet our guidance of a mid- to high 12% margin rate for the year despite the slow start in the first quarter. Operational highlights for the quarter included $143 million order for more than 500 Lightweight Laser Designated Rangefinders (sic) [Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder] for the Army. To date, more than 1,300 of these systems have been delivered and fielded in Iraq and Afghanistan. We delivered our 500 Directional Infrared Countermeasures aircraft self-protection systems, and our Starlight program completed all of its testing. Starlight is a lightweight multi-function radar that can support a variety of manned and unmanned platforms for tactical reconnaissance, surveillance and target detection. And shortly after the end of the first quarter, our F-35 radar successfully flew its first Mission System's flight.
Information Systems sales were slightly lower than last year, primarily due to the planned decline in Civil Systems volume related to lower state and local government volume. We view improving performance in IS as one of our best opportunities, so we're particularly pleased with the 8.9% margin rate for the quarter. We continue to move along a path of sustainable performance improvement at IS. We had important positive developments this quarter on our VITA program. The Commonwealth of Virginia announced a comprehensive set of changes to the VITA contract. We believe the new agreement is an important step forward in both parties. Upon completion of its review period in late June, the modified agreement will significantly improve the clarity of program's scope and performance expectations. Another positive was the 7% increase in IS new business awards. We were one of two contractors selected for the development phase of the Navy's Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services program or CANES. This will lead to a down-selected contract to improve interoperability and affordability at shipboard network systems across the fleet. We also continued to capture restricted business in our Intelligence division, and Defense Systems was awarded additional work for our Battlefield Airborne Communications Node or BACN, which is providing in-theater warfighters with critical realtime battlefield information. 
For Shipbuilding, first quarter sales increased 25%, which reflects the extra working days this year and revenue step-backs in last year's first quarter. We continue to focus on improving performance in the Gulf, and our 6.2% margin rate this quarter reflects that progress. The four LPD ships in the Gulf remain our biggest challenge going forward. As we said last quarter, our improved operating system provides enhanced visibility that enables us to continually assess performance. Last week, we redelivered the USS Enterprise to the Navy. The recent redeliveries of the Enterprise, the Carl Vinson and the George H.W. Bush will result in lower carrier volume going forward and will contribute to more ratable Shipbuilding sales for the balance of the year.
Technical Services had a very strong quarter, with margin rate expansion to 6.4%. This reflects our strategy of focusing on higher margin opportunities, especially in the Life Cycle Optimization & Engineering business area. 
In summary, we're refining our sales estimate for the year to approximately $34.5 billion and raising our EPS guidance to reflect this quarter's strong operational performance. The new range is $5.75 to $6 per share. Our focus for the remainder of the year and our number one priority across the entire organization will continue to be achieving sustainable performance improvement. Improving performance and disciplined cash deployment continue to be Northrop Grumman's greatest shareholder value drivers. As a management team, we are firmly committed to realizing positive performance improvements in all of our businesses, and we demonstrated some of that improvement with our first quarter results.
So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our quarter and our 2010 outlook. Jim?"

During my comments this morning, I'll give you my perspective on the quarter, the sector results and our guidance for the sectors, as well as cash flow performance and guidance for the year.As Wes sai",1404,"Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During my comments this morning, I'll give you my perspective on the quarter, the sector results and our guidance for the sectors, as well as cash flow performance and guidance for the year.
As Wes said, it was a good solid quarter and a good start for the year. EPS growth was 37%, with sales, operating improvement and a lower share count being the biggest growth drivers. Due largely to cost caps implemented in 2006, we did not have a charge related to the recent legislative changes impacting the Medicare Part D subsidies. You all might remember that we had indicated in our 10-K that Medicare Part D subsidies were not significant.
So let's look at the quarter, starting with sales, a growth rate of 8.5%, which included the impact of more working days in this year's first quarter. Excluding that impact, we estimate that sales growth was consistent with our guidance for the low single-digit growth rate. Operating income increased 24% due to lower net pension expense, higher segment operating income and lower corporate unallocated expenses. And then, the third driver of EPS growth was a nearly 8% reduction in our weighted average share count as a result of our share repurchase program.
So let me start with sales then again and try to put it into a little bit of perspective due to the additional working days. Depending on the sector of the impacts, and impacts like the snow on the East Coast that we saw in the first quarter, the additional days ranged anywhere from two to five days. And obviously, the impact was not uniform across the five sectors, but I estimated that they accounted for about $400 million of this quarter's year-over-year growth. And then, another $100 million of growth reflects the first quarter 2009 step-back in sales that we recorded in Shipbuilding, due to the negative contract adjustments on the LPD and DDG programs last year in the first quarter. So adjusting for those two items, sales growth was between 2% and 3% and as I said, consistent with our updated guidance for the year.
On an earnings per share basis, the additional working days represent about $0.08 per share. So looking ahead, the fourth quarter of 2010 will have fewer working days than last year's fourth quarter, with the second and third quarters having the same number of workdays as in 2009. So let's spend a few minutes and talk about each of the sectors. Aerospace sales reflect the impact of the extra working days, with some modest growth beyond that. For the year, we continued to expect stable revenues, with some variability, depending upon the timing of the NPOESS' restructuring. Until that program is restructured, we continue to work under our current contract, with 2010 first quarter revenues for NPOESS being comparable to last year. Aerospace sales performance reflects the overall strength of its portfolio, especially in light of last year's KEI termination, which represented about $60 million in sales in last year's first quarter that were not repeated this year. Solid sales results were accompanied by the strong 11% operating margin, 50 basis points better than last year due to improved performance across a number of different programs. For the year, we continue to expect a mid-10% operating margin rate, but I think we could potentially do slightly better as well. 
Electronic sales grew 5%, reflecting the extra days with a 12% operating margin. The lower margin rate this quarter reflects the lower performance on our Flat Sequencing System program, as well as a lower royalty income than in the prior year and a small provision for workforce reduction at some selected sites at ES. They recently announced a small reduction in workforce to rebalance the skill mix required for the existing backlog and anticipated new awards. And for the year, we continue to expect ES operating margin rates in the mid- to high 12% range. 
For Information Systems, the additional days were not a significant benefit in the quarter due to the snow days in the East Coast. The decline in Civil revenues, which were anticipated or planned, were partially offset by about a 4% increase for our intelligence programs, where we continue to see growth opportunities. In our Defense Systems division, revenue was down slightly this quarter due to the higher volume of in-theater hardware deliveries during the first quarter of 2009. This included programs like the Command Post Platform, Trailer Mounted Support System, Counter-Rocket Artillery and Mortars, and Integrated Base Defense Security System. Looking forward, we continue to see good demand in our core C4ISR areas and intelligence domains, particularly in a number of restricted areas. We do see some pressure on IS sales for the year, but we are also increasing our margin rate guidance for Information Systems to the mid 8% from low to mid 8%.
Shipbuilding sales increased 25%. This increase needs to be put in context in terms of what I expect for the balance of the year. $346 million sales growth for the quarter was driven by several factors. First, the additional days accounted for about $115 million of growth. Secondly, last quarter's first quarter sales were reduced by about $100 million step-back in revenues for the LPD and DDG EAC adjustments. And thirdly, we experienced some cost growth in LPDs this quarter as we worked towards ensuring that we were producing and delivering quality ships. Looking ahead, Shipbuilding sales will be more ratable for the rest of the year due to the redelivery of the Enterprise, which contributed about $55 million of revenues in the first quarter that obviously won't continue for the balance of the year. As Wes said, we expect Shipbuilding sales will be approximately $6.2 billion for the year or comparable to the 2009 sales level, with margin rate between 5% and 6%. 
Technical Services had a 21% sales growth and their operating income increased 32% to 6.4%. First quarter sales benefited from the additional days and included higher volume for existing programs like the Counter-Narcoterrorism program, as well as new programs like KC-10 and C-20, which were competitive captures in 2009. Higher operating income and higher operating rate reflect the volume increases, as well as the more favorable contract mix towards the higher-margin Lifecycle Optimization & Engineering programs. We continue to expect a low to mid-6% margin rate and sales could be stronger than our original guidance of 2% to 4%, depending upon ID/IQ TASC order levels over the balance of the year. 
Turning to cash for the quarter, operations used $531 million of cash and free cash outflow totaled $669 million for the quarter. As many of you know, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter, but in addition to the seasonality issues, there were several timing issues that impacted our results. The first was a delay in Information Systems' billings and collections, which was related to the TASC divestiture. This, along with a decrease in payables, negatively impacted working capital by about $425 million. These are timing issues. We're already in process of recovering those issues in the second quarter.
The first quarter also included an additional payroll payment due to additional days in the quarter, as well as a higher federal tax payment. These two items represented about $150 million. So when I consider each of those items, as Wes said, we're comfortable with our guidance for cash flow, and we continue to expect cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year and free cash flow in a range of $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion before discretionary pension contributions. And also, as Wes mentioned, based on first quarter results, we now expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $5.75 to $6 per share, an additional -- an increase of $0.05 for the year. Driven by higher sales at Shipbuilding and say, potentially higher sales in Aerospace Systems and Technical Services, with higher-margin rates for Information Systems and potentially slight increase in Aerospace Systems, I see as the drivers for the increase.
So I'd say in summary, a good solid quarter, one that supports our improved operational outlook for the year and demonstrates the focus that Wes talked about in driving sustainable performance improvement, and that performance improvement yielding results. So, Paul, I think with that, we're ready to turn it over for Q&A."

At the same time, the Defense business and the Intelligence business at Information Systems, which together represent right around 75% of our total sales at IS, are strong, healthy businesses. And when I went through my earlier remarks on opportunities, you probably noticed that there were quite a few of the opportunities that I discussed associated with Information Systems. We bring a number of what we see as truly discriminating capabilities to Defense and Intelligence, ranging from the work that we do in command and control, the work, of course, that we do in ISR, where we have some just absolutely preeminent positions, and the work that we do in cybersecurity, which we see continuing to grow quite robustly. So we are optimistic about the outlook at IS in both Intel and Defense. We see sort of a little bit of a longer cycle for Civil, largely driven by bringing the expertise that we have in cybersecurity from Intel and Defense into many of our Civil applications, where we're beginning to see the cyber capabilities as an enabler to go after some of the more sophisticated requirements of other federal agencies. So we like this business. We think it's a good business for our future, and we're looking forward to getting to the right place in our balance of the portfolio on Civil and continuing to grow the rest of the business. Now let me also give a perspective how we're thinking about that growth. There are various layers in the Information Systems market. We are really focusing our attention on the layers where we can bring real value through engineering content, where we have truly differentiated offerings and where the margin opportunities are consistent with our margin expansion objectives in the company. So we will not be going after opportunities in this space simply because of top line revenue opportunities. We're looking very carefully at the opportunities as to whether or not they support our margin rate objectives."

The HALE systems are large platforms, each individually large, and they're large programs such as Global Hawk and BAMS. So naturally, they do represent a substantial fraction. As we look at the emerging requirements, we see a very healthy continuing future for HALE. The idea that you can have an asset at an altitude that affords it, and enormous amount of visibility and selection capability and availability over many, many a long hour of duration of focus is just a very, very useful tool for the military. That said, while we are really focused on growing HALE, we're also focused on some of the other applications. And there's a long list I could point out, but one in particular is UCAS. The concept of having unmanned operations off of a carrier will transform a lot of the fundamental concept of operations for force deployment. And we see that as another groundbreaking opportunity in the application of unmanned. We have a lot of other great actions going on in unmanned, whether it's Fire Scout or even smaller unmanned vehicles. We continue to apply a lot of engineering innovations to this field. We want to stay differentiated technologically and capability wise, because we see this as a business area that's got a great future."

On the last few years as we went through some of the struggles in the Gulf, that performance declined. But we expect that with the new class of ships, we will be able to return to the level of performance we've demonstrated in the past. A big part of that is the operating system that we put in place in the Gulf that's up and running. That's giving us the type of transparency and degree, the in-depth understanding that we need to not only better plan the execution, but in realtime, really see how it's going in a shipyard today is managing multiple classes of ships compared to the past, back in the 90s, when it really was primarily just the DDG program that was going through. So we feel good about the progress that we've made operationally and being able to get that underway. The other thing I would say though is we are not yet under contract fully for those DDGs, so we are in a process of working through the contracting with the Navy, and we are very focused on making sure that those contracts support our opportunity to perform well.

As you know, we integrated -- we brought together the Newport News operations, the Gulf operations under a common leadership with Mike Petters at the beginning of 2008. So we're more than two years into that process. By doing that, we've been able to bring a lot of things from Newport News to the Gulf and quite frankly, vice versa. We've, I think, done a very good job under Mike's leadership, Mike and his team's leadership of figuring out how to best optimize where we're going. And that means looking at every single aspect. We've talked a lot about the operating system and how we actually manage the flow of the work through the yard in the Gulf. Quality is another area where we've just put an extraordinary focus on changing the way that we've address that opportunity. Leadership development, talent development, training of the workforce, you name it, just about every aspect of the operational capacity in the Gulf, and then translating a lot of that back into Newport News. So I think while we're clearly not out of the woods, we have a margin rate that we're forecasting in Shipbuilding this year. That's not a margin rate that we would be happy with in the long term, but it does represent a good step up over last year. We still have several programs, primarily the LPDs in the Gulf that are operating at low or no margin rate that will pull us down for a while on our margin rate improvements curve. But I see us making the solid incremental steps forward to make this Shipbuilding business a business that is doing the right things for both our customers and for our shareholders."

We do have a fair amount left in our outstanding authorization, and we continually look at what the level of authorization should be that we seek from our board. And I think you can see from our history, we've got a pretty good track record of what we call balanced cash deployment in our company."

If anything, I think -- this is Wes, I think that the outcome that we saw out of the DOD confirmed our thinking in our divestiture, very strongly confirmed it. The rule that came forward if you decompose it really had sort of three basic types of conflicts. But I was worried about cases where there were impaired objectivity. So if a contractor is giving technical advise on a procurement and the contractor also has some form of financial interest in that procurement, that's a conflict that talked about unfair access to non-public information, which kind of a broad statement around how you would look at access. And then the third category around biased ground rules. So that's if the contractor happens to be working on one contract, but you're in a position to help set the ground rules for some future acquisition that it might compete for. These are pretty broad statements about the way that federal procurement officials need to think about OCI and interpret OCI, and are pretty well aligned with the framework that we saw our largest customers in the TASC business using when they were alerting us last year that we would not be able to compete for some of the business we currently had. So instead of standing by and watching that business dissipate, we think we took a very appropriate action both for our customers and our shareholders to divest that business, put it in the hands of an organization that did not have these types of conflicts, so that it can grow and thrive. And I think with these rules, it has a good opportunity to grow and thrive looking at how it's situated relative to the businesses that remain within some of the other large contractors. So I do think it will cause others to stand back and think carefully about what they're doing."

In Information Systems, we tend to participate in sort of the higher end of the marketplace that's largely engineering driven, large-scale solutions driven. And while there is always pricing pressure in every single market that we participate in, there it is largely value determinations that we see in source selection. So you've got to support the customers' budgets, obviously. But I think the customers in those areas have a little bit broader view of value in terms of the solutions being brought to the table and how that satisfies their business case. In Technical Services, that area has always been and, I think, will increasingly be much more price sensitive. We have sort of three major areas in Technical Services. We do a lot of base and range support in our systems' life cycle, the systems support group. We do a lot of training work and, of course, we do a lot of operations and maintenance, some logistics work in our Life Cycle Optimization business.

During the quarter, we purchased 8.3 million shares of our stock for approximately $500 million. And approximately $440 million remains on our current authorization.  Combined with last year's fourth quarter repurchases of 8.4 million shares, we have now essentially offset the TASC divestiture's impact to 2010 earnings per share. As a result, we expect share repurchases to moderate from the pace of the last two quarters. 
First quarter new business awards totaled $6.9 billion, bringing total backlog to $67.5 billion or approximately two years of sales. The decline from year end is almost entirely due to a $1.4 billion decline in Shipbuilding backlog, where order flow is more lumpy due to the size and duration of contract awards. 
Looking ahead, we have many exciting new business opportunities. At the company level, EMARS is a key competitive ISR opportunity that evolved from the Aerial Common Sensor requirements. Northrop Grumman can bring an unparalleled set of capabilities to this pursuit from across our sectors, and EMARS' announcement is expected sometime in the fall.
For Aerospace, in the unmanned domain, we're pursuing several major new programs, including UCLASS. This is a multi-billion dollar Navy opportunity that builds on our UCAS work and leverages our industry-leading unmanned technology. We're also pursuing NATO AGS, a $2 billion program to deploy Global Hawk's Tornado and other promising international targets. We continue to make good progress on BAMS, our Global Hawk derivative for the Navy. This program is currently in development and the Navy has plans to procure multiple systems in the future, and this represents a terrific opportunity for us down the road when the program goes into production.
On the manned side, we have major international opportunities on Advanced Hawkeye and the FA-18. In space, we have opportunities for additional Advanced EHF payload builds and upgrades, and we are pursuing the Precision Tracking Space System, which builds on the recently launched STSS missile tracking program.
We continue to be excited about our broad array of differentiated sensor products on Electronics, such as VADER, our Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, which is capable of tracking vehicles and foot traffic over a wide area, and SABR, our Scalable Agile Beam Radar, which will provide state-of-the-art radar performance for the F-16.
Our Information Systems sector continues to pursue a robust set of targets, including the Joint Space Operations Center Mission System, which we expect to be awarded later this year. We're also excited about being BAE's teammate on the ground combat vehicle, which over the long term could be a major program for the company. 
In Shipbuilding, we are working with the Navy on follow-on awards with the DDG, LPD and LHA classes. And finally, Technical Services also has a number of new opportunities primarily in the logistics and maintenance area, including longer-term opportunities like the C-21 and C-9 CLS programs. So although we expect top line budgets to remain under pressure in the coming years, we continue to address a very robust new business pipeline.
Now I'd like to touch on a few of the operating highlights. As I said on our last call, our number one priority is to achieve sustainable operating performance improvement. Our sector results this quarter support achievement of our performance objectives for the year. Aerospace Systems had a strong quarter, in which they expanded their operating margin rate to 11%. We continue to see growth in our manned and unmanned programs as development programs like Global Hawk and Advanced Hawkeye move into production, complementing strong performance in legacy programs such as the FA-18 and B-2. 
During the quarter, we continued to build on our base of franchise programs, with new business awards for Advanced Hawkeye, Global Hawk, restricted work, ICBM, Joint STARS and the FA-18 program. Our industry-leading unmanned systems continue to deliver mission-enabling capabilities to our customers. Global Hawk is providing unparalleled in-theater service. It also recently demonstrated its utility and civil missions, with inaugural science flights for NASA and in support of earthquake relief efforts in Haiti. And Fire Scout, deployed aboard the USS McInerney, successfully supported its first drug interdiction mission. 
Electronic Systems also had solid results for the quarter, with a 12% operating margin rate. The lower margin rate this quarter principally reflects lower performance on our Flat Sequencing System program, which resulted from higher integration, test and deployment costs. We expect ES will meet our guidance of a mid- to high 12% margin rate for the year despite the slow start in the first quarter. Operational highlights for the quarter included $143 million order for more than 500 Lightweight Laser Designated Rangefinders (sic) [Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder] for the Army. To date, more than 1,300 of these systems have been delivered and fielded in Iraq and Afghanistan. We delivered our 500 Directional Infrared Countermeasures aircraft self-protection systems, and our Starlight program completed all of its testing. Starlight is a lightweight multi-function radar that can support a variety of manned and unmanned platforms for tactical reconnaissance, surveillance and target detection. And shortly after the end of the first quarter, our F-35 radar successfully flew its first Mission System's flight.
Information Systems sales were slightly lower than last year, primarily due to the planned decline in Civil Systems volume related to lower state and local government volume. We view improving performance in IS as one of our best opportunities, so we're particularly pleased with the 8.9% margin rate for the quarter. We continue to move along a path of sustainable performance improvement at IS. We had important positive developments this quarter on our VITA program. The Commonwealth of Virginia announced a comprehensive set of changes to the VITA contract. We believe the new agreement is an important step forward in both parties. Upon completion of its review period in late June, the modified agreement will significantly improve the clarity of program's scope and performance expectations. Another positive was the 7% increase in IS new business awards. We were one of two contractors selected for the development phase of the Navy's Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services program or CANES. This will lead to a down-selected contract to improve interoperability and affordability at shipboard network systems across the fleet. We also continued to capture restricted business in our Intelligence division, and Defense Systems was awarded additional work for our Battlefield Airborne Communications Node or BACN, which is providing in-theater warfighters with critical realtime battlefield information. 
For Shipbuilding, first quarter sales increased 25%, which reflects the extra working days this year and revenue step-backs in last year's first quarter. We continue to focus on improving performance in the Gulf, and our 6.2% margin rate this quarter reflects that progress. The four LPD ships in the Gulf remain our biggest challenge going forward. As we said last quarter, our improved operating system provides enhanced visibility that enables us to continually assess performance. Last week, we redelivered the USS Enterprise to the Navy. The recent redeliveries of the Enterprise, the Carl Vinson and the George H.W. Bush will result in lower carrier volume going forward and will contribute to more ratable Shipbuilding sales for the balance of the year.
Technical Services had a very strong quarter, with margin rate expansion to 6.4%. This reflects our strategy of focusing on higher margin opportunities, especially in the Life Cycle Optimization & Engineering business area. 
In summary, we're refining our sales estimate for the year to approximately $34.5 billion and raising our EPS guidance to reflect this quarter's strong operational performance. The new range is $5.75 to $6 per share. Our focus for the remainder of the year and our number one priority across the entire organization will continue to be achieving sustainable performance improvement. Improving performance and disciplined cash deployment continue to be Northrop Grumman's greatest shareholder value drivers. As a management team, we are firmly committed to realizing positive performance improvements in all of our businesses, and we demonstrated some of that improvement with our first quarter results.
So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our quarter and our 2010 outlook. Jim?"
97199,100507388,61186,"Northrop Grumman Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Northrop Grumman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During my comments this morning, I'll give you my perspective on the quarter, the sector results and our guidance for the sectors, as well as cash flow performance and guidance for the year.As Wes sai",1404,"Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During my comments this morning, I'll give you my perspective on the quarter, the sector results and our guidance for the sectors, as well as cash flow performance and guidance for the year.
As Wes said, it was a good solid quarter and a good start for the year. EPS growth was 37%, with sales, operating improvement and a lower share count being the biggest growth drivers. Due largely to cost caps implemented in 2006, we did not have a charge related to the recent legislative changes impacting the Medicare Part D subsidies. You all might remember that we had indicated in our 10-K that Medicare Part D subsidies were not significant.
So let's look at the quarter, starting with sales, a growth rate of 8.5%, which included the impact of more working days in this year's first quarter. Excluding that impact, we estimate that sales growth was consistent with our guidance for the low single-digit growth rate. Operating income increased 24% due to lower net pension expense, higher segment operating income and lower corporate unallocated expenses. And then, the third driver of EPS growth was a nearly 8% reduction in our weighted average share count as a result of our share repurchase program.
So let me start with sales then again and try to put it into a little bit of perspective due to the additional working days. Depending on the sector of the impacts, and impacts like the snow on the East Coast that we saw in the first quarter, the additional days ranged anywhere from two to five days. And obviously, the impact was not uniform across the five sectors, but I estimated that they accounted for about $400 million of this quarter's year-over-year growth. And then, another $100 million of growth reflects the first quarter 2009 step-back in sales that we recorded in Shipbuilding, due to the negative contract adjustments on the LPD and DDG programs last year in the first quarter. So adjusting for those two items, sales growth was between 2% and 3% and as I said, consistent with our updated guidance for the year.
On an earnings per share basis, the additional working days represent about $0.08 per share. So looking ahead, the fourth quarter of 2010 will have fewer working days than last year's fourth quarter, with the second and third quarters having the same number of workdays as in 2009. So let's spend a few minutes and talk about each of the sectors. Aerospace sales reflect the impact of the extra working days, with some modest growth beyond that. For the year, we continued to expect stable revenues, with some variability, depending upon the timing of the NPOESS' restructuring. Until that program is restructured, we continue to work under our current contract, with 2010 first quarter revenues for NPOESS being comparable to last year. Aerospace sales performance reflects the overall strength of its portfolio, especially in light of last year's KEI termination, which represented about $60 million in sales in last year's first quarter that were not repeated this year. Solid sales results were accompanied by the strong 11% operating margin, 50 basis points better than last year due to improved performance across a number of different programs. For the year, we continue to expect a mid-10% operating margin rate, but I think we could potentially do slightly better as well. 
Electronic sales grew 5%, reflecting the extra days with a 12% operating margin. The lower margin rate this quarter reflects the lower performance on our Flat Sequencing System program, as well as a lower royalty income than in the prior year and a small provision for workforce reduction at some selected sites at ES. They recently announced a small reduction in workforce to rebalance the skill mix required for the existing backlog and anticipated new awards. And for the year, we continue to expect ES operating margin rates in the mid- to high 12% range. 
For Information Systems, the additional days were not a significant benefit in the quarter due to the snow days in the East Coast. The decline in Civil revenues, which were anticipated or planned, were partially offset by about a 4% increase for our intelligence programs, where we continue to see growth opportunities. In our Defense Systems division, revenue was down slightly this quarter due to the higher volume of in-theater hardware deliveries during the first quarter of 2009. This included programs like the Command Post Platform, Trailer Mounted Support System, Counter-Rocket Artillery and Mortars, and Integrated Base Defense Security System. Looking forward, we continue to see good demand in our core C4ISR areas and intelligence domains, particularly in a number of restricted areas. We do see some pressure on IS sales for the year, but we are also increasing our margin rate guidance for Information Systems to the mid 8% from low to mid 8%.
Shipbuilding sales increased 25%. This increase needs to be put in context in terms of what I expect for the balance of the year. $346 million sales growth for the quarter was driven by several factors. First, the additional days accounted for about $115 million of growth. Secondly, last quarter's first quarter sales were reduced by about $100 million step-back in revenues for the LPD and DDG EAC adjustments. And thirdly, we experienced some cost growth in LPDs this quarter as we worked towards ensuring that we were producing and delivering quality ships. Looking ahead, Shipbuilding sales will be more ratable for the rest of the year due to the redelivery of the Enterprise, which contributed about $55 million of revenues in the first quarter that obviously won't continue for the balance of the year. As Wes said, we expect Shipbuilding sales will be approximately $6.2 billion for the year or comparable to the 2009 sales level, with margin rate between 5% and 6%. 
Technical Services had a 21% sales growth and their operating income increased 32% to 6.4%. First quarter sales benefited from the additional days and included higher volume for existing programs like the Counter-Narcoterrorism program, as well as new programs like KC-10 and C-20, which were competitive captures in 2009. Higher operating income and higher operating rate reflect the volume increases, as well as the more favorable contract mix towards the higher-margin Lifecycle Optimization & Engineering programs. We continue to expect a low to mid-6% margin rate and sales could be stronger than our original guidance of 2% to 4%, depending upon ID/IQ TASC order levels over the balance of the year. 
Turning to cash for the quarter, operations used $531 million of cash and free cash outflow totaled $669 million for the quarter. As many of you know, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter, but in addition to the seasonality issues, there were several timing issues that impacted our results. The first was a delay in Information Systems' billings and collections, which was related to the TASC divestiture. This, along with a decrease in payables, negatively impacted working capital by about $425 million. These are timing issues. We're already in process of recovering those issues in the second quarter.
The first quarter also included an additional payroll payment due to additional days in the quarter, as well as a higher federal tax payment. These two items represented about $150 million. So when I consider each of those items, as Wes said, we're comfortable with our guidance for cash flow, and we continue to expect cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year and free cash flow in a range of $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion before discretionary pension contributions. And also, as Wes mentioned, based on first quarter results, we now expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $5.75 to $6 per share, an additional -- an increase of $0.05 for the year. Driven by higher sales at Shipbuilding and say, potentially higher sales in Aerospace Systems and Technical Services, with higher-margin rates for Information Systems and potentially slight increase in Aerospace Systems, I see as the drivers for the increase.
So I'd say in summary, a good solid quarter, one that supports our improved operational outlook for the year and demonstrates the focus that Wes talked about in driving sustainable performance improvement, and that performance improvement yielding results. So, Paul, I think with that, we're ready to turn it over for Q&A."

Let me address that. We have been, I think, very clear and you referenced it, that we have taken a very careful look over the last few years of state and local, determined that, that is not really a very attractive marketplace for us, given the way that we typically bring ultimate value to customers. And so, we've been backing away from that, and as we said in our remarks, our sales in our Civil Systems part of IS have been on a planned decline as a result of those decisions that we made. At the same time, the Defense business and the Intelligence business at Information Systems, which together represent right around 75% of our total sales at IS, are strong, healthy businesses. And when I went through my earlier remarks on opportunities, you probably noticed that there were quite a few of the opportunities that I discussed associated with Information Systems. We bring a number of what we see as truly discriminating capabilities to Defense and Intelligence, ranging from the work that we do in command and control, the work, of course, that we do in ISR, where we have some just absolutely preeminent positions, and the work that we do in cybersecurity, which we see continuing to grow quite robustly. So we are optimistic about the outlook at IS in both Intel and Defense. We see sort of a little bit of a longer cycle for Civil, largely driven by bringing the expertise that we have in cybersecurity from Intel and Defense into many of our Civil applications, where we're beginning to see the cyber capabilities as an enabler to go after some of the more sophisticated requirements of other federal agencies. So we like this business. We think it's a good business for our future, and we're looking forward to getting to the right place in our balance of the portfolio on Civil and continuing to grow the rest of the business. Now let me also give a perspective how we're thinking about that growth. There are various layers in the Information Systems market. We are really focusing our attention on the layers where we can bring real value through engineering content, where we have truly differentiated offerings and where the margin opportunities are consistent with our margin expansion objectives in the company. So we will not be going after opportunities in this space simply because of top line revenue opportunities. We're looking very carefully at the opportunities as to whether or not they support our margin rate objectives."

The idea that you can have an asset at an altitude that affords it, and enormous amount of visibility and selection capability and availability over many, many a long hour of duration of focus is just a very, very useful tool for the military. That said, while we are really focused on growing HALE, we're also focused on some of the other applications. And there's a long list I could point out, but one in particular is UCAS. The concept of having unmanned operations off of a carrier will transform a lot of the fundamental concept of operations for force deployment. And we see that as another groundbreaking opportunity in the application of unmanned. We have a lot of other great actions going on in unmanned, whether it's Fire Scout or even smaller unmanned vehicles. We continue to apply a lot of engineering innovations to this field.

It represents, as you know, an opportunity to continue a line of ship class that over the years we have demonstrated very, very good performance. On the last few years as we went through some of the struggles in the Gulf, that performance declined. But we expect that with the new class of ships, we will be able to return to the level of performance we've demonstrated in the past. A big part of that is the operating system that we put in place in the Gulf that's up and running. That's giving us the type of transparency and degree, the in-depth understanding that we need to not only better plan the execution, but in realtime, really see how it's going in a shipyard today is managing multiple classes of ships compared to the past, back in the 90s, when it really was primarily just the DDG program that was going through. So we feel good about the progress that we've made operationally and being able to get that underway. The other thing I would say though is we are not yet under contract fully for those DDGs, so we are in a process of working through the contracting with the Navy, and we are very focused on making sure that those contracts support our opportunity to perform well. So we're looking at it both operationally and contracting to make sure that we end up in the right place."

As you know, we integrated -- we brought together the Newport News operations, the Gulf operations under a common leadership with Mike Petters at the beginning of 2008. So we're more than two years into that process. By doing that, we've been able to bring a lot of things from Newport News to the Gulf and quite frankly, vice versa. We've, I think, done a very good job under Mike's leadership, Mike and his team's leadership of figuring out how to best optimize where we're going. And that means looking at every single aspect. We've talked a lot about the operating system and how we actually manage the flow of the work through the yard in the Gulf. Quality is another area where we've just put an extraordinary focus on changing the way that we've address that opportunity. Leadership development, talent development, training of the workforce, you name it, just about every aspect of the operational capacity in the Gulf, and then translating a lot of that back into Newport News. So I think while we're clearly not out of the woods, we have a margin rate that we're forecasting in Shipbuilding this year. That's not a margin rate that we would be happy with in the long term, but it does represent a good step up over last year. We still have several programs, primarily the LPDs in the Gulf that are operating at low or no margin rate that will pull us down for a while on our margin rate improvements curve. But I see us making the solid incremental steps forward to make this Shipbuilding business a business that is doing the right things for both our customers and for our shareholders."

If anything, I think -- this is Wes, I think that the outcome that we saw out of the DOD confirmed our thinking in our divestiture, very strongly confirmed it. The rule that came forward if you decompose it really had sort of three basic types of conflicts. But I was worried about cases where there were impaired objectivity. So if a contractor is giving technical advise on a procurement and the contractor also has some form of financial interest in that procurement, that's a conflict that talked about unfair access to non-public information, which kind of a broad statement around how you would look at access. And then the third category around biased ground rules. So that's if the contractor happens to be working on one contract, but you're in a position to help set the ground rules for some future acquisition that it might compete for. These are pretty broad statements about the way that federal procurement officials need to think about OCI and interpret OCI, and are pretty well aligned with the framework that we saw our largest customers in the TASC business using when they were alerting us last year that we would not be able to compete for some of the business we currently had. So instead of standing by and watching that business dissipate, we think we took a very appropriate action both for our customers and our shareholders to divest that business, put it in the hands of an organization that did not have these types of conflicts, so that it can grow and thrive. And I think with these rules, it has a good opportunity to grow and thrive looking at how it's situated relative to the businesses that remain within some of the other large contractors. So I do think it will cause others to stand back and think carefully about what they're doing."

In Information Systems, we tend to participate in sort of the higher end of the marketplace that's largely engineering driven, large-scale solutions driven. And while there is always pricing pressure in every single market that we participate in, there it is largely value determinations that we see in source selection. So you've got to support the customers' budgets, obviously. But I think the customers in those areas have a little bit broader view of value in terms of the solutions being brought to the table and how that satisfies their business case. In Technical Services, that area has always been and, I think, will increasingly be much more price sensitive. We have sort of three major areas in Technical Services. We do a lot of base and range support in our systems' life cycle, the systems support group. We do a lot of training work and, of course, we do a lot of operations and maintenance, some logistics work in our Life Cycle Optimization business. All three of those have, I would say, intense price sensitivity, and I think we'll continue to have that sensitivity. So a little bit different flavor for the two different businesses."

Our results for the quarter reflect the net benefit of this quarter's $296 million tax settlement and our announced plans to consolidate our Gulf Coast Shipbuilding operations. In addition, results for all periods reported reflect the TASC divestiture, which was completed in December 2009 as discontinued operations.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'll discuss our second quarter results, operational highlights and our outlook for 2010. We're very pleased to report another solid quarter that demonstrates",1640,"All right. Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'll discuss our second quarter results, operational highlights and our outlook for 2010. We're very pleased to report another solid quarter that demonstrates our commitment to delivering sustainable performance improvement across all of our businesses. Sales rose 3%, and our segment operating income increased 14%. Earnings per share of $2.34 includes $0.73 for the net benefit of this quarter's tax settlement and the Shipbuilding consolidation-related charge. Before these items, our second quarter earnings per share increased 42% to $1.61, driven by higher sales, higher segment operating income, lower net pension expense and a reduction in shares outstanding. 
Before the consolidation-related charge, all five of our businesses generated higher operating income and a higher margin rate than in the prior-year period. Aerospace, Electronics, Shipbuilding and Technical Services also generated higher sales. The company's second quarter segment operating profit would have totaled 9.9% before the consolidation-related charge, representing underlying margin rate expansion of nearly 200 basis points. 
EPS growth also benefited from a lower share count. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares of our common stock, bringing this year's repurchases to 14.8 million shares for approximately $850 million. Based on our performance through the first half of the year, we are increasing our guidance for 2010 earnings to a range of $6.60 to $6.80 per share. 
Turning to cash, second quarter cash from operations and free cash flow totaled $619 million and $515 million, respectively. These results included the impact of the $300 million discretionary pension plan contribution we made during the quarter. We're lowering our cash guidance for the year, principally to reflect the anticipated cash impacts of the wind down of ship construction at Avondale. We now expect that cash from operations will range between $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, and free cash flow will range between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. Guidance for both these metrics is before discretionary pension contributions. Our updated guidance for cash reflects the impact of the consolidation decision and a strengthening of cash flows in the second half of the year, and Jim will provide more detail on cash later in the call. 
During the second quarter, we also continued to execute our balanced cash deployment strategy. This included the previously mentioned pension contributions and share repurchases, a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization and a 9.3% increase in our quarterly dividend. Going forward, we remain committed to a balanced cash deployment strategy that calls for investing for the future, managing liabilities and returning cash to shareholders. At the end of the second quarter, we had a total backlog of $66 billion, which reflects new awards of $6.5 billion in the quarter. 
Moving on to sector highlights. Aerospace sales increased 6%, operating income increased more than 30% and margin rate improved more than 200 basis points to 11.8%. We also had several notable awards, including a competitive Army award with potential value of up to $517 million to develop up to three Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle systems or LEMVs. LEMV is another example of our ability to meet an urgent customer need, with an innovative solution that's flexible and rapidly deployable. This program will leverage our core competencies in unmanned air systems, C4ISR and systems integration. The design allows for plug-and-play sensor payloads and can be readily integrated with the Army's existing ground station command centers. 
The LEMV will have the flexibility to operate optionally manned or unmanned, and will provide unprecedented dwell capability over theater. Also in the unmanned domain, Euro Hawk successfully completed its first flight, and we received the DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] award to develop and demonstrate air-to-air refueling of high-altitude unmanned systems. Under the contract, we will modify an existing Global Hawk to access a tanker to fuel another Global Hawk. This is an important step in the evolution of unmanned technology, and our successful demonstration of this capability will further strengthen our strong position in the unmanned domain. 
Aerospace Systems was also awarded $260 million for Global Hawk, which continues to make tremendous in-theater contributions to our nation's war fighters. We share our customers' concern regarding costs in the program, and we are working closely with the Air Force to address their affordability constraints. During the quarter, Aerospace also received awards of $200 million for F-35 and $135 million for F/A-18. 
Electronic Systems sales rose about 1% for the quarter, operating income increased more than 5% and margin rate expanded more than 50 basis points to 13.3%. An important highlight in the quarter was the successful inaugural flight of the mission systems on F-35. Electronic Systems' new Active Electronically Scanned Array radar performed very well. The F-35 is also equipped with our Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System, which provides passive missile and aircraft track detection, as well as infrared day and night vision that is projected directly onto the pilot's helmet visor for a fully spherical view around the aircraft. This is the first time the F-35 has flown with mission-enabling sensor systems, including the fire control radar from Electronics and the integrated communications, navigation and identification avionics from Information Systems. 
Information Systems sales were slightly lower than last year, but operating income increased 26% and margin rate expanded more than 200 basis points. Backlog at IS increased more than 15% to $10.1 billion, which reflects the completion of the Commonwealth of Virginia's review period for our new agreement on the VITA [Virginia Information Technologies Agency] program. We continue to make solid progress on VITA, and we believe that our risks going forward on the program has been reduced. Another second quarter highlight was being selected as one of four companies to receive contracts in all areas of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's TASER [Total Application Services for Enterprise Requirements] program. This ID/IQ [indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity] contract with a $1 billion ceiling provides for timely and innovative solutions to critical geospatial intelligence requirements. 
Sales at Shipbuilding increased 5%, and as a result of our decision to consolidate future new construction in Mississippi, we recorded a charge of $113 million, which resulted in a $16 million operating loss for the quarter. As I said during our conference call to discuss the strategic actions of Shipbuilding, the consolidation-related charge of Shipbuilding does not reflect performance deterioration on the Gulf Coast. Before the charge, Shipbuilding's second quarter operating income and margin rate totaled $97 million and 5.7%, respectively. And for six months, totaled $203 million or 5.9% of sales. So Shipbuilding was on track to meet or exceed our prior margin rate guidance. 
Shipbuilding ended the second quarter with a total backlog of $18.4 billion. During the quarter, we received advanced procurement contracts for the LPD 26, LHA 7 and DDG 114. We were also awarded a contract for additional effort on CVN 78. Together, these Navy contracts totaled more than $600 million. 
At Technical Services, sales rose 14% during the second quarter, operating income increased 21% and margin rate expanded to 6.5%. The solid sales growth in TS is being paced by the continued ramp up on logistics programs such as the KC-10 and C-20, which are key contracts we were awarded last year. Shortly after the close of the quarter, the State Department awarded Technical Services a five-year $150 million ID/IQ contract to continue to support to the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance [ACOTA] program. 
While we continue to have solid new business opportunities across the company, both we and our customers recognize that we face a challenging environment going forward due to the economic environment and the federal budget deficit. We fully support the efficiency and affordability initiatives that OSD leadership is bringing forward. We also appreciate the opportunity that industry is being given to participate in the definition of these initiatives. 
The 2011 budget is still evolving. There is a high probability that we may have to operate under continuing resolution for some period of time before the budget is finalized. Both the House and Senate Authorization committees have proposed reductions and modifications to the President's budget, and convergence is likely to take some time. To date, our programs have generally been well supported, and we expect that to continue to be the case. However, an expanded continuing resolution would impact the timing of awards and delay new starts. 
While not an entirely new situation, clearly the fiscal environment going forward will be challenging, and the competition for funding even more intense. We've been proactively positioning Northrop Grumman to compete and succeed in this environment, and we remain keenly focused on driving continuous, sustainable performance improvement and efficiency throughout the organization. Our actions over the last few years to consolidate eight sectors into five have been important steps in this direction. The move of our corporate office to the Washington D.C. area will also provide an opportunity to reduce costs. 
And our recent Shipbuilding announcement was another important step. The decision to consolidate future new ship construction in Mississippi was difficult, but necessary to ensure long-term improvement in Gulf Coast program performance, cost competitiveness and quality. This decision was also aimed at aligning our capacity with future Navy plans and improving future efficiency and affordability. 
I know that many of you are very interested in our process for exploring strategic alternatives for Shipbuilding. As I indicated in our call a couple of weeks ago, our primary focus will be on a spin-off to shareholders, but we also will assess a sale. We are just at the beginning of this process and until we announce our final decision, we don't plan any further comment on this process. 
So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of the financials and more color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Jim?"
97199,109461649,70489,"Northrop Grumman Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Northrop Grumman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During my comments, I'll provide additional detail on sector results, cash performance and our guidance for the year. I just want to reiterate that it was another good solid quarter. As Wes said, exclud",1380,"Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During my comments, I'll provide additional detail on sector results, cash performance and our guidance for the year. I just want to reiterate that it was another good solid quarter. As Wes said, excluding the net benefit of $0.73 from the IRS settlement and the consolidation-related charge, underlying EPS growth was 42%. Operating margin coupled with higher sales, lower net pension and a reduction in the share count was the biggest growth driver. 
Sales increased 3% and even with the consolidation charge, segment operating income increased by 14% and total operating income increased by 17%. Through the first six months, segment operating income was up 10%, and total operating income has increased by 20%. These positive trends largely reflect improved operational results as well as lower net pension expense, but partially offset by higher corporate unallocated expenses due to the $64 million favorable legal adjustment in last year's second quarter results. 
Now let's turn to the sectors for a little bit of discussion. Through the first six months, Aerospace Systems sales are up approximately 8%. Aerospace sales performance continues to reflect the overall strength of our unmanned and manned aircraft programs like Global Hawk, BAMS, F-35, B-2 and the EA-18G, as well as some restrictive work. The positive trends for these programs were partially offset by the KEI cancellation and lower volume for our ICBM program. 
You'll recall that last quarter, we mentioned that the NPOESS program is being restructured. We continue to work with the Air Force and NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] on a path forward for this program. We now expect some resolution during the second half of the year. So while the restructuring has not affected results through the second quarter, it could impact the second half results. 
Aerospace second quarter sales were again accompanied by a very strong operating income. For the quarter, margin rate expanded to 11.8%, and through the first six months, margin rate has expanded by about 140 basis points to 11.4%. The improvement in second quarter results reflects improved program performance across a variety of programs, especially in manned aircraft platforms where we increased our margin rates on several programs due to risk retirement. As a result of the strong performance through six months, we now expect the margin rate in Aerospace of approximately 11% for the year while sales growth of about 5%, depending on the outcome and the timing of the NPOESS restructuring. 
Electronic Systems' sales were slightly higher for the quarter and through the first six months, sales were in line with our guidance at 2% to 4% growth. ES generated a 13.3% margin rate for the quarter, which reflects improved program performance in targeting systems programs and land and self protection systems. These performance improvements were partially offset by lower performance for postal automation. Through six months, ES  generated a margin rate of 12.7% comparable with last year and consistent with our guidance for the year of mid to high 12%. 
For Information Systems, second quarter sales continue to reflect the planned declines in civil revenues as well as a slight decline in volume for intelligence programs. These areas were partially offset by higher volume in our Defense programs. The second quarter trend for intelligence principally reflects lower volume for the Counter-Narcoterrorism program and the loss of the GPS OCX program. Through six months, Information Systems' sales are down about 1%, and I would speculate that there's some risk through our 2010 sales guidance of 2% to 4% growth due principally to delayed awards and the potential impact from an extended continuing resolution that Wes mentioned in his comments. 
I would also note that in the second quarter, operating income included risk retirement related to a subcontractor on our New York City Wireless program. Some of you may recall that in the third quarter of 2008, we took a charge on this program, part of which related to subcontractor risk that has now been retired, resulting in $18 million being reflected in this quarter's operating income. Excluding this item, IS had an operating margin rate of 8.8% for both the quarter and for the six months, which is a little bit better than our mid-8% guidance for the year and represents good solid performance improvement over 2009. 
Shipbuilding sales increased 5%, reflecting higher volume for aircraft carrier, submarine and expeditionary warfare programs. The increase in estimates to complete the LPDs 23 and 25 through a consolidation decision resulted in about $115 million reduction in sales for the quarter. Operating income reflects the impact of the consolidation-related charge, and I would reiterate Wes' comments that excluding that decision to consolidate Gulf Coast construction, Shipbuilding was on track to meet or beat our guidance of 5% to 6% margin rate for the year. As a result of the consolidation decision, we now expect an operating margin rate of 4% to 4.5% for Shipbuilding on a sales base of about $6.3 billion for the year. 
Technical Services had a 14% sales growth, with an operating income increasing by 21% to 6.5%. Through six months, sales were up about 17%, operating income is up 26%. Higher operating income and rate reflect the volume increases as well as a more favorable business mix, with logistics representing an increasing share of sales this year versus last. While we continue to expect a low- to mid-6% margin rate, we now expect low double-digit sales growth with frankly the biggest variable being ID/IQ task order levels over the balance of the year. 
Turning to cash, operations generated $619 million, and free cash flow totaled $515 million. And during the quarter, we made discretionary pension contributions of $300 million. So before this contribution and recognizing the tax benefit of those contributions, operations generated $895 million and free cash flow would have been $791 million. 
As many of you know, the first half of our year is typically lower than the second half. In addition to those seasonality impacts this year, we did experienced some working capital growth during the first half of the year, driven by higher sales volume and less efficient collections in some areas. In addition, last year's first half cash flow results included about $100 million for discontinued operations, principally related to the TASC operations. 
So we now expect cash from operations of $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion for the year, and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. This range is before the impact of discretionary pension contributions, and the modest adjustment to our cash flow guidance principally reflects impact of the Shipbuilding consolidation decision. It really doesn't reflect any fundamental change to our operating performance or our underlying cash generation. 
At this point, let me also briefly comment on our outlook for pension expense. The sensitivities that we've talked about in the past that I provided for changes in discount rate and variance around our expected investment performance are unchanged from what we talked about at the beginning of the year. Just to reiterate that, holding all assumptions constant, 100 basis-point variance to our 2010 expected rate of return of 8.5% is about a $40 million change in 2011 FAS expense. And a 25 basis-point change in the year end discount rate assumption for our liabilities, which was 6% for 2010, will generate about a $75 million change in our 2011 as pension expense. 
As I think all of you know, our plan assets are mark-to-market at the end of the year, and we will really not know what our FAS/CAS pension adjustment will be for 2011 until the end of the year. I should also comment that through the end of the second quarter, client investment returns were positive, it's about 2%, and they have improved with the market during July. 
So in conclusion, results for the first half of the year support an outlook for continued operational improvement. We've modestly increased our sales guidance to $34.8 billion, and our new guidance for earnings from continuing operations is $6.60 to $6.80 per share. Our outlook for cash calls for a strong second half that will be reduced principally by the strategic actions we are taking at Shipbuilding.

We do modulate the rate of repurchase based on the share price that we see in the marketplace, and we make decisions on what that rate looks like each time we enter into a share repurchase program.

The last few years, we've been quite successful in capturing a number of major development activities, and generally, when you're in the development phase, your margin rate opportunity is a little bit lower. As we move into the production, Aerospace has a large number of examples of that, whether it's joint strike fighter, whether it's the E-2 program, the continuing production work on Global Hawk and the variety of unmanned systems. As we move into production, those are better opportunities. Clearly, we have to perform. We have to deliver on those improved opportunities, but those represent really good examples of the types of things that we see as driving ourselves in the right direction. The other thing that we've been doing obviously is working on the portfolio in Information Systems. We have been working hard to de-tune the parts of the portfolio that really don't represent great margin opportunities, state and local. IT outsourcing is a good example that. We're continuing to look at that throughout the portfolio. And obviously, we make some bigger announcements, but there are a lot of smaller things that we're doing that I would say we're not quite as public about that are better tuning the businesses to the way that they're pursuing new captures, with a stronger focus around profitability. We are walking away from things that might give us a nice run on the top line but really don't achieve what we're trying to do from a profitability perspective. And that's just a part of the mindset that we're taking as we're looking at improving the overall performance of the company."

And that really is a product of going through our view of the marketplace where we see the opportunities in terms of where our customers are focused, but also to your point earlier about how we have been thinking about shipbuilding. Where we see opportunities to create value by bringing the different pieces of the company together to create offerings to our customer and to create levels of performance that we wouldn't be able to achieve with just individual business units, so when we thought about where the market's going, where those opportunities are to really bring the pieces of the company together, that's led us to a view of where to focus that I think we've been pretty public about. It led us to a view that shipbuilding really did not represent a high degree of synergy with the other parts of the company in addressing those bases, and that most likely, we could generate a higher degree of value by separating the pieces so that they can each focus on the areas where they see their best future opportunities. So across the company, that really is the message. That's where the focus is, but I would say, whether you want to call it tactical or not, the key message that goes with it is we're looking for good business."

On EMARS, you know what, I've been careful not to get into the business of projecting award dates as there are so many different factors. We do know that the Army is focused on EMARS. It's a very important program, and we do see that most likely working its way to an award some time in the fall. So that's the schedule that I've been giving, one is working hard to support. Now we have a broad variety of opportunities across the company that we're addressing. If you look at the world of unmanned is a good example, continues to evolve. We see both increasing demands domestically and internationally. The unmanned programs are gaining broader attention and I think do represent some meaningful opportunities as we go forward. When I look at Electronics and the work that's being done to address a variety of new applications for the sensors that we have in Electronics, I think there are some very, very good opportunities, again, both domestically and internationally that we're seeing there on the radar side, as we continue to expand our focus on radars beyond, I would say, our more traditional airborne radar position to the work that we do on the ground and eventually over time for the Navy. The IRCM programs continue to get good support, and I think there's going to be good opportunities for that as well. Cyber is another area where we talked about the continued push to make sure that not only are the new cyber-specific programs put in place and getting underway, but also the application of cyber to other new program starts where cyber becomes an embedded part or an enabling part of those acquisitions. So we're seeing good opportunities, a good solid pipeline of business across our businesses. The one caveat I would put to that is what I indicated in my other commentary that a continuing resolution would likely dampen the rate at which awards could be made and certainly would impact the ability of our customers to get new starts put in place, just given the rules that go with operating in SCR environment. So we're being a little bit cautious in terms of sounding too optimistic from that perspective. That being said, we see a robust pipeline across all of our businesses."

Our headquarters operations, a few hundred people out of the 120,000 employees we have in our company. So I don't want to overemphasize the importance of the move, but it is important. It's important from a lot of perspectives. One, it is important in terms of what we really want to be doing in driving the intimacy with our customers. And sometimes, I think that's misunderstood as, let's see, Wes wants to be in Washington or Jim wants to be Washington, but it really is about having our headquarters team more deeply immersed in total in our customer environment and being able to make better decisions and support our customers in an enhanced way as we go forward. And I would say that was really the primary focus as we thought about relocating. But to your point, it is an important opportunity for us to resize our corporate office. We are doing that. We've not been public about any numbers, and I won't go into that in great detail other than to say we are using this as an opportunity to address our broader affordability initiatives across the company. We've asked that of each of our sectors. This work, the hard work that's been done and the consolidation of our sectors has enabled us to take cost out of our overhead structures and how we're managing those sectors and the operating costs as well, and we should have that same expectation for our headquarters team. And so we're using this move to drive cost out as we do it. And of course, we're managing it like a program. We have a schedule and a whole set of milestones that we're using to get us in place. The target date for doing that is to have the team in place and operating over the course of next summer. Of course, we've targeted the summer as the best time for move for the families that would be moving. We do expect that we will be hiring here in D.C., yet, it's always difficult to get everyone to move, particularly when the headquarters has been in the location where it is for so long, a lot of deeply established roots. But at the same time, it's an opportunity to bring in some folks that I think can help us move forward. And we have some good announcements over the last few months of new members of the team that we're bringing on. And their arrivals will be timely in helping to build the teams that they want to have in place as when they just moved.

Consolidations I think are going to be a part of it in terms of really looking at the industrial base footprint as we go forward. Our action in shipbuilding is a good representative example of that. I think a lot of what's going to have to be done is related to how the government goes under contract as it tries to think about cost structures. And part of what I've been happy to see in this process is a receptivity on the part of those in government that are pushing on this to hear what they need to do to make it work. It's not all one-sided about. This is what industry has to do, and so when we think about how the government is making decisions, how it's buying, how it manages the oversight functions, those are all things that are in the mix that together, I think, can lead to some very good outcomes. I think we have to get to some outcomes with affordability and efficiency. I think it's incumbent on all of us to make this work, to not be blockers of the process and say, ""Gee, it's been tried before, it didn't work before, it's not going to work again."" I just don't find that to be a constructive way of engaging on this because we are in it together. We owe it to the nation and to our allies to do better, and I think we can. So I would put it in a category of yes, there are a lot of things we've got to do from an industry perspective, some of which you've seen already get put in place, others that I think are going to unfold as it become far more clear, how that the government is going to focus. But there are a number of things that our government customers are also going to need to do, and that will be a big part of whether or not this succeeds."

It has been an extraordinarily successful program from the perspective of providing support to the war fighters that they desperately need. The capabilities of the platform itself, I mean, on the altitude at which it operates, the endurance that it demonstrates, the amount of payload that it can carry has resulted in it being a little bit of a victim of its own success. And that the requirements have continued to grow. Its flight time hours have continued to increase, and as a result, when all of those things happen, costs go up, whether it's cost for spares and theater support or it's cost for supporting all the new requirements. And over time, those costs add up, and you have to stand back periodically and look at it and say, okay, are we at the right place on that? Do we have the right balance between what we really need out of the platforms and what the cost is. That's kind of the process that we're going through with the Air Force right now. We have committed to the Air Force to go on working hard on the affordability part of this. We are doing that. I think it demonstrated some very good progress to date on some of the learning-curve initiatives that we have. There are other things we need to do. So I would characterize that as a set of actions underway, haven't reached resolution yet as to what it all means, so that's what we're doing now with the Air Force. And as we go forward over the next several months, I think that really is the timeline to have a good perspective on, okay, what does it mean for the program, what does it mean for the requirements on the program, what it mean for the production rates as we go forward?

We have made a business decision. We are proceeding with that business decision. And from a looking-forward perspective, we believe that, that business decision is the right thing for the customer and is the right thing for the overall business, for the sustainability of that business for the long term. As I said in the call we had a couple of weeks ago, when we think about Gulf Coast shipbuilding, we think it's important to the nation that we have a strong Gulf Coast shipbuilding capability, and to achieve that outcome, we need to consolidate. So we are marching forward in that direction, and I know that, that's difficult from a lot of different perspectives. It was a difficult decision, but we believe strongly it is the right decision that we're moving forward. We see that as a decision focused around the business, what's the right thing to do for the business. The separation decision is a decision focused around the strategy of the company and how we create best value with the two pieces going forward for our shareholders. And we also are focused on driving that to the right conclusions as we explore these alternatives. So I'd be careful about overly linking these things. We see them as two decisions, both of which are, we believe the absolute right decisions for the future of the business."

This morning, I'll discuss our third quarter results, operational highlights and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. They demonstrate that across the entire enterprise, our team is focused on driving sustainable performance improvement.
Our efforts are generating positive results across our business, which is reflected in this quarter's double-digit EPS growth. Financial highlights for the quarter include 4% sales growth and a 14% increase in segment operating income.
Third quarter segment operating margin rate improved 80 basis points to 9.8%, which is the primary indicator of performance improvement at the sectors. Operating income also increased substantially reflecting the operational improvements and lower pension expense. In addition to operational improvements, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares of our common stock, bringing this year's repurchases to 17.8 million shares or approximately $1.1 billion.
Based on our performance for the first nine months of the year, we now expect 2010 earnings to range between $6.85 and $7 per share. We also have a strong quarter for cash. Cash from operations before discretionary pension contributions totaled more than $1 billion, and free cash flow, also before discretionary pension contributions, totaled approximately $850 million. Based on year-to-date results and again, before discretionary pension contributions, we continue to expect cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.8 billion and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
Through the first nine months, our pension contributions totaled $390 million. Jim will provide more detail on cash and pension trends later in the call.
At the end of the third quarter, total backlog was $64.6 billion, which reflects new awards of $7.4 billion in the quarter. The decline in backlog through the end of the third quarter is principally driven by Aerospace and Shipbuilding, our two large primarily platform businesses, where awards are typically large and occur periodically. In Electronics, Information Systems and Technical Services, our shorter-cycle businesses, the backlog trends are generally positive. Several major Aerospace and Shipbuilding awards are pending. And as these awards are finalized in the coming months, we expect an improvement in our book-to-bill rate. A prolonged period of continuing resolution could delay some awards, however.
Turning to sector highlights. Aerospace sales increased 7%. Operating income increased more than 14%, and margin rate improved 70 basis points to 11.2%. Sales trends in Aerospace continue to reflect higher volume for manned and unmanned aircraft platforms, which was partially offset by lower sales for missile defense and civil space programs. We achieved several milestones in the Global Hawk program this quarter. In addition to supporting in-theater operations 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Global Hawk recently achieved 35,000 combat hours and two Global Hawks were deployed to new overseas locations. One to Sigonella Naval Air Station in Italy and the other to the Pacific Command at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. Overall, the system continues to perform very well, and the program is on track for achieving its critical initial operational test and evaluation milestone, which we expect will lead a full rate production decision next spring.
Global Hawk affordability continues to be a key priority that we are working jointly with our customer. The air vehicle production costs has continued to decline across each production line. And for the payloads, we are utilizing combined buys and an economic order quantity approach to reduce cost.
As platform configurations continue to mature and affordability initiatives are implemented, we expect air vehicle and sensor costs will continue to decline. Driving production efficiencies is an ongoing focus for Aerospace Systems, not only for Global Hawk but for all of our key programs, including the F-35 and the F/A-18.
In Electronic Systems, sales rose about 2% for the quarter. Operating income increased 21%, and margin rate expanded more than 200 basis points to 13.9%. During the quarter, Electronic Systems received one of the three contracts for the technology development phase of the Navy's AMDR program, the next-generation radar capability from Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense. We also won a very important role on the Air Force's $2.3 billion ID/IQ program to provide new advanced targeting pods along with associated support equipment, spares and product support. Under the Air Force's new two-pod strategy, Northrop Grumman was awarded a 40% share of the program. This award was a tremendous win for the sector.
Information Systems sales were comparable to last year. IS operating income increased 13%, and as a percent of sales, improved 100 basis points to 8.9%. IS had some very important competitive wins in the quarter, including a role on the Social Security Administration's $2.8 billion ID/IQ contract for updated IT solutions. And shortly after the end of the quarter, IS was selected by the Centers for Disease Control to compete for task orders to provide information management and technology services under a $5 billion ID/IQ contract. These programs have multibillion-dollar potential over their respective performance periods but as ID/IQ contracts, they are not reflected in backlog until task orders are awarded. I would also note that IS won a $2.6 billion task order for the installation of a campus-wide information technology infrastructure for secure communications and operations at Saint Elizabeths, the Department of Homeland Security's new headquarters. This award has been protested, so there is a stay of performance in effect.
Sales at Shipbuilding increased 1%, and operating income totaled 6% of sales. Most of you are aware that we recently filed a Form 10 with the SEC for a potential Shipbuilding spin-off. We continue to weigh a potential separation of Shipbuilding, and as part of that evaluation, we continue to explore a potential sale or spin-off. The Form 10 filing was an initial step toward a potential spin-off of Shipbuilding, but a final decision regarding a separation has not been made.
In the meantime, our Shipbuilding team is keenly focused on performance and quality. We continue to work closely with the Navy and the Coast Guard to ensure we are delivering quality ships.
In the Technical Services, sales rose 26% during the third quarter. Operating income increased 37%, and margin rate expanded to 6.4%. The substantial sales growth in TS is being paced by the continued ramp up on new logistics programs like KC-10 and the C-20.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to touch briefly on our customer's affordability initiatives and other changes that we're seeing in the marketplace. Under Secretary, Dr. Ash Carter, has cleared articulated the DoD's plans to drive efficiency and increase affordability with guidelines that include 23 principal actions. The objective is consistent with what the department's leadership has been saying for some time. We don't believe these initiatives are intended to drive down industry profit margins or weaken the industrial base. Of course, the challenge in achieving the department's objectives will be in how the initiatives are implemented. It's clear that future success in our industry will require the ability to demonstrate sustained productivity, efficiency and performance improvement.
We also have to keep in mind that we continue to face an unparalleled dynamic range of national security threats. We in industry need to do all that we can to provide the most cost-effective systems and capabilities to our customers. At Northrop Grumman, we are focused on reducing overhead, managing our supply chain, streamlining organizations and processes and increasing productivity so that we can provide our customer with the best value possible. As we've demonstrated with our recent actions, we fully understand the challenges, and we'll continue to make the difficult decisions and take the actions necessary to position our company to create value for all of our stakeholders.
As we look ahead to next year, we would expect U.S. defense spending to be flat to low-single digit growth. However, there is more revenue uncertainty today than we've had in the recent past, given the budget pressures the U.S. government faces. And as we've said before, we believe that our greatest value creation opportunity lies in driving sustainable performance improvement, generating cash, deploying it effectively, optimizing our portfolio and effectively managing our balance sheet. We're making progress closing the performance gap with our peers, and we have opportunities for further improvement, especially as we reduce risk on some of our underperforming programs. We are also focused on future execution of a balanced cash deployment strategy that includes returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of the financials and a bit more color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Jim?"

Let me just reiterate Wes' comments, which was a really, really good quarter, double-digit earnings per share growth and solid cash generation. Earnings per share from continuing operations grew 13%, even with the headwind of last year's $0.23 tax benefit. So adjusting for last year's tax settlement, earnings per share growth was 34%, with segment operating income, lower net pension expense and share buybacks being the principal earnings per share growth drivers.
Looking at the sectors through nine months, Aerospace System sales were up about 8%. Their year-to-date sales performance continues to reflect the overall strength of our unmanned and manned aircraft programs like Global Hawk, BAMS, F-35, B-2, EA-18G and Advanced Hawkeye. The positive trends for these programs were partially offset by declines in civil space and missile programs like the James Webb Space Telescope, NPOESS, KEI and ICBM. While we continue to work under the existing NPOESS contract, the DoD and the Department of Commerce will have separate roles going forward.
On the DoD side, we expect to be the prime integrating contract for the Defense Weather Satellite System or DWSS. We've been working closely with the Air Force to transition elements of NPOESS to DWSS. And we are beginning to see a decline in year-over-year NPOESS volume as we enter this transition phase. Staffing has recently been scaled back, and the government's plans and funding levels and schedules are still evolving, so we really can't fully quantify future impacts. But we do expect that sales for the balance of the year will reflect a lower spend profile.
We believe we have developed a compelling path forward for this effort, but the realization of that path will depend on the release of sufficient fiscal 2011 funding for the program. Aerospace third quarter sales, again, were accompanied by strong operating income. For the quarter, the margin rate expanded to 11.2% and through the nine months, our margin rate has expanded about 110 basis points to 11.3%.
Third quarter improvement was primarily driven by improved performance in our manned programs. As a result of the strong performance through nine months, we now expect the margin rate in Aerospace a slightly more than 11% for the year, with sales of about $11 billion.
Electronic Systems sales rose approximately 2% for the quarter and through nine months, sales are in line with our guidance of 2% to 4% growth for the year. ES generated a 13.9% margin rate for the quarter, which reflects improved performance in the period for postal automation and self protection systems. The Flats Sequencing System or FSS is the major driver of the postal automation results. FSS performance was stable this quarter, and last year's quarter included some negative team catch-up adjustments on that program. We now have received unconditional acceptance of the first article test for the U.S. Postal Service, with subsequent system acceptances underway. Through the nine months, ES has generated a margin rate of 13.1%, and we expect the 2010 margin rate to be in the high 12% to 13% range.
For Information Systems, third quarter sales reflect lower civil volume, consistent with our focus on higher quality opportunities in this marketplace and lower volume for intelligence program, which was more than offset by higher volume in defense programs. Through nine months, Information Systems are essentially flat, and based on year-to-date results, we now expect IS sales to range between $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion for the year. The IS team continues to do a good job in winning new quality business and retiring risk. This is reflected in their improvement in margin rate. Last quarter, we raised IS margin guidance to mid to high 8%. And based on this quarter, it's likely that they will hit 9% for the year.
Shipbuilding sales were up slightly this quarter and up nearly 10% through nine months. Growth for the quarter and for the year reflect higher volume for Expeditionary Warfare programs and aircraft carriers. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 6%, which reflects overall lower performance on Expeditionary Warfare programs, which included negotiation and recognition of milestone incentives on the LPD program. I should also point out that the lower performance on expeditionary warfare also includes a reduction on LPD's 23% and 25% margin rate related to our previously announced decision to consolidate our Gulf Coast shipyards. In addition, we also had a negative performance adjustment on the postdelivery work on LHD 8 that impacted this quarter. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect Shipbuilding sales of about $6.5 billion for the year, and our margin rate guidance is unchanged at 4% to 4.5%, reflecting the impact of last year's quarter's decision to consolidate our Gulf Coast facilities.
Turning to Technical Services, reported a 26% sales growth, operating income increased 37%, and margin rate expanded 50 basis points to 6.4%. Through nine months, sales were up 20%. Operating income is up 30%. Higher operating income and the rate reflect volume increases as well as a more favorable business mix with logistics representing an increasing share of sales.
While we continue to expect a low- to mid-6% range for margin, we expect sales to approach $3.2 billion for the year. The biggest variable in annual sales will be ID/IQ task order levels over the balance of the year. As expected, cash generation accelerated substantially during the quarter. Cash from operations before discretionary pension contributions totaled slightly over $1 billion for the quarter, with free cash flow of approximately $850 million.
Through nine months, before discretionary pension contributions, cash from operations totaled $1.4 billion, and free cash flow was just over $1 billion. We plan to accelerate a total of about $500 million of pension contributions into the second half of 2010, including the $60 million that was made in the third quarter. Timing on that $60 million third quarter contribution was driven by the opportunity to reduce PBGC premiums. And for all of 2010, we now expect discretionary contributions of about $830 million for the year.
We are also considering the possibility of another sizable discretionary pension contribution in the first part of 2011. The decision to accelerate pension funding reflects the compelling economics of low interest rates, improving investment returns, tax benefits associated with contributions and the opportunity to further reduce funding in our FAS expense obligations going forward.
I should remind you that for 2011 FAS pension expense, a 25 basis points change in our discount rate generates about a $75 million change in FAS pension expense, and that a 100 basis point change in our plan investment returns generate a $40 million change in FAS pension expense. Through the end of the third quarter, we estimate that the return on our plan assets was in the range of 9% to 9.5% compared with our 8.5% expected annual rate of return.
Regarding the discount rate, the current yield curve in our analysis of our appliance, to just 2011 discount rate in the range of 5% to 5.25% based on September 30 data compared with the 6% that we used for this year.
I would also note that while today's historically low interest rates have a negative impact on our future FAS pension expense, they also create a very attractive borrowing opportunity or environment for public companies. And we're currently looking at how we might take advantage of this lower rate environment. 
So in conclusion, I would, again, add it was a very good, strong quarter. We modestly increased our sales guidance to $34.9 billion, and our new guidance for earnings from continuing operations is $6.85 to $7 per share. Our guidance contemplates a fourth quarter impact of about $0.11 per share for deferred state taxes associated with our planned fourth quarter discretionary pension contributions, as well as higher unallowable costs associated with the exploration of strategic alternatives for the Shipbuilding business.
We are comfortable with our outlook for cash from operations and free cash flow guidance, both of which are before discretionary pension contributions. 
Paul, with that, I think we're ready to turn it over for Q&A."

So the wins that we've announced are reflections of that strategy of being more focused on civilian agencies and then being, I would say, quite selective within the civilian agencies range of opportunities for those areas where we can bring things such as our Cyber Security capabilities to many other solutions or other substantial engineering content that reflects the type of value that we can deliver to customers. So we see that marketplace as an attractive marketplace. Again, we are selective in what we're pursuing. And part of that selection process goes to the second part of your question, which is the margin rate. We are pursuing those opportunities that we believe are consistent with our margin rate objectives that we've laid out for Information Systems in total.

But I would say more broadly in the things that perhaps connect even more directly in terms of the affordability initiatives, we've also taken on, enterprise-wide, a variety of activities around Shared Services that are really paying dividends for our company. And we we're going to continue to push on those. But the day-to-day cost leverage, the things that really are driving the outcomes the department is looking for, are really happening at the program level. Program by programs, is where we have to take on the cost affordability challenges and demonstrate that we can, if necessary, re-architect how those programs are being done and in all cases, go and find the cost opportunities that will continue to bring down the cost curve. So I know there's a lot of play, a lot of focus that happens around head count reduction.

And as I think we've been pretty explicit about, our exploration of alternatives around Shipbuilding, that's a case where we see a very good quality business with great opportunities for continued margin rate expansion, but a business where we've not been able to demonstrate very substantial synergies to the operations of Shipbuilding with other parts of our company. And that has led us down this path of exploring alternatives to see if there might be a way of enhancing overall value, both for our shareholders and for our customers and employees by having Shipbuilding operate as a separate entity. I think it is indicative of our thought process, and just would illuminate the way that we're looking at our company. But I do get the question sometimes, should the marketplace the actions we've taken on TASC and Shipbuilding as some sort of a signal that we're looking to figure out how to dismantle the company and sell the pieces for more than the whole?

I don't know anyone that's described me that way of late. And so perhaps let me give you my kind of a broader view. I know I touched a little bit of this on my commentary, but just a broader view of where we see things going. It is clear to all of us that the budget pressures will certainly be a big factor in setting the top line environment for the DoD and the intelligence community, which represent the vast preponderance of our customer base. I don't think there's any debate out there. It's also clear that affordability and variety of initiatives that are connected to the affordability thrust are going to have some implications for the defense industry. We are very pleased by the engagement that the DoD has had with industry in reaching out and setting a course on affordability. But as I said in my remarks, the key to that is going to be in implementation and how all of that rolls out. I do look forward to that continued engagement with the department to shape it as we go forward, and I would say that we have a team at DoD today that has demonstrated a real connection to the importance of industrial base, both the strength of the industrial base and the future of the industrial base that I personally haven't seen for some time. And I really like that. And so perhaps that comes across as a little bit of a rosy outlook, but it's more intended to reflect my view of the interaction that we have with the department, very positive nature of that interaction. They are tough taskmasters. You've seen them hold us publicly accountable when they don't like the outcomes that they're seeing, but I think it's fair. And I think the message is that we need to be doing what the we need to do. And on the programs like Global Hawk, when we've gone and see them to talk about affordability, we've been able to have the two-way conversation about the things the department needs to do. And they've taken that on board. So I like that part of our environment today. I think it will be healthy for our industry over time to be aligned and supportive of that. But just let me be very clear about how I see all that adding up. We do not expect, and I would say nor are we dependent on significant top line growth to create value. And so many of the changes that we've been driving in the company over the course of this year had been focusing on the areas where we see those value creation opportunities, and that goes to program performance, and we've talked a lot about mitigating risk in the programs where we've had some challenges in the past, driving that risk out, generating a margin rates that we know we can demonstrate by focusing on core program performance and then being very good stewards of the cash that we generate. And our value equation is based largely around that improvement in margin rates, that intelligent deployment of cash and being proactive with our portfolio to make sure that we stay lined up actually a little bit ahead if we can with where our customers is going, and we feel good about how that looks in terms of portfolio. So I can't agree with you more. There are a lot of negative, if you will, issues out there surrounding the outlook of the top line, concerns about how the customers will react to that over time. But I would also tell you that, and you have as much or more experience than I do in this, Howard, that over time, we see our nation respond to the external threat profile. And I don't see that diminishing. In fact, I am increasingly concerned about some of the new aspects of the threat profile that we've all seen emerging over these last couple of years. And I do have confidence that our nation stands up and addresses those, and that doesn't translate to earnings or sales in any particular quarter. But it does drive the way we think about positioning this business for the long term, to be good stewards for both our shareholders and our customers and of course, our employees as well. Probably said a little more than you're asking for there, but I appreciated the opportunity to reflect on the environment."

We manage all of that under tight boundaries of confidentiality and it's just a matter of policy we don't comment on that aspect of our M&A. You did see, I think, hopefully everyone noticed that on October 15, we submitted a Form 10 registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission. And that was an important filing because that really gets the process started to provide us an alternative should we elect to go down the path of a spin-off. There's a fair amount of information about our Shipbuilding business in that Form 10 and I would say we were quite proud of being able to pull that together and represent what we see to be a very high quality business in the filing of that Form 10.

But we are a good partner, I believe, with Lockheed. You'd have to ask them, and their perspective of that. But I believe we've been a very good partner with Lockheed on this program. I would say they've been a good prime on this program, and part of being a partner is being supportive of the affordability initiatives that are underway. We have to look at each of the three pieces of F-35, sometimes, a little bit differently because there are different risk return characteristics. By the three pieces, I mean, we do work on this program as a subcontractor, Lockheed, in Aerospace Systems, Information Systems and Electronic Systems. And so the approach that we might take while similar in most respects, might be tuned slightly differently given the individual characteristics of those areas. The one thing I would say about FPI and it always goes, of course, to the actual structure of airline geometry and target cost. But in general FPI can be a very good contract if you're in the LRIP phase, particularly after you get past the first view of the LRIPs where you have a very good cost base line, where you have a very comprehensive risk management approach and where you know what you're really producing and how the production lines are supposed to operate. And that's where we are in F-35. We've made tremendous progress on this program. I feel good about the products that we're delivering on F-35. And then, there's always elements of the program that require continued tuning and at the prime level, Lockheed continues to go through their overall test program. And so there is the SDD overlay to this and any of their recurring or the new issues that might occur get addressed through that concurrent SDD approach. But given all of that, I think that there's a reasonable contractual approach to be taken here to support what Lockheed's customer is asking of them. And as a partner, we are focused on supporting that."

But what's interesting about our business in Aero is we've worked so hard over these last few years on development programs to get those development programs transitioned into production so that we can do exactly what our customer is asking us to do today, which is manage the cost down over the course of production. And so I would say we've been getting ready for this. We've been preparing to be in an environment where we're focused probably a little bit more in production than development, although we, of course, are going to be out looking to win new development opportunities. But on those particular programs, we are driving on cost as we go through these earlier stages of production so that we can hit the lower targets that's should come with learning curve, both in the work we do and in what we expect of our supply base in going through this. And we are not at all interested in taking profitability down as we go through this. We've been working hard to get to the point in production where we're reducing cost and realizing the profitable returns that should come from the big investments we've made to get us here. So there is a big discussion around costs very appropriately. That's what we expected. That's what we've been working to get to. But we believe we should have good profitability opportunities in the production phase. Production is the lifeblood of our industry.

This morning, I'll discuss our third quarter results, operational highlights and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. They demonstrate that across the entire enterprise, our team is focused on driving sustainable performance improvement.
Our efforts are generating positive results across our business, which is reflected in this quarter's double-digit EPS growth. Financial highlights for the quarter include 4% sales growth and a 14% increase in segment operating income.
Third quarter segment operating margin rate improved 80 basis points to 9.8%, which is the primary indicator of performance improvement at the sectors. Operating income also increased substantially reflecting the operational improvements and lower pension expense. In addition to operational improvements, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares of our common stock, bringing this year's repurchases to 17.8 million shares or approximately $1.1 billion.
Based on our performance for the first nine months of the year, we now expect 2010 earnings to range between $6.85 and $7 per share. We also have a strong quarter for cash. Cash from operations before discretionary pension contributions totaled more than $1 billion, and free cash flow, also before discretionary pension contributions, totaled approximately $850 million. Based on year-to-date results and again, before discretionary pension contributions, we continue to expect cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.8 billion and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
Through the first nine months, our pension contributions totaled $390 million. Jim will provide more detail on cash and pension trends later in the call.
At the end of the third quarter, total backlog was $64.6 billion, which reflects new awards of $7.4 billion in the quarter. The decline in backlog through the end of the third quarter is principally driven by Aerospace and Shipbuilding, our two large primarily platform businesses, where awards are typically large and occur periodically. In Electronics, Information Systems and Technical Services, our shorter-cycle businesses, the backlog trends are generally positive. Several major Aerospace and Shipbuilding awards are pending. And as these awards are finalized in the coming months, we expect an improvement in our book-to-bill rate. A prolonged period of continuing resolution could delay some awards, however.
Turning to sector highlights. Aerospace sales increased 7%. Operating income increased more than 14%, and margin rate improved 70 basis points to 11.2%. Sales trends in Aerospace continue to reflect higher volume for manned and unmanned aircraft platforms, which was partially offset by lower sales for missile defense and civil space programs. We achieved several milestones in the Global Hawk program this quarter. In addition to supporting in-theater operations 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Global Hawk recently achieved 35,000 combat hours and two Global Hawks were deployed to new overseas locations. One to Sigonella Naval Air Station in Italy and the other to the Pacific Command at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. Overall, the system continues to perform very well, and the program is on track for achieving its critical initial operational test and evaluation milestone, which we expect will lead a full rate production decision next spring.
Global Hawk affordability continues to be a key priority that we are working jointly with our customer. The air vehicle production costs has continued to decline across each production line. And for the payloads, we are utilizing combined buys and an economic order quantity approach to reduce cost.
As platform configurations continue to mature and affordability initiatives are implemented, we expect air vehicle and sensor costs will continue to decline. Driving production efficiencies is an ongoing focus for Aerospace Systems, not only for Global Hawk but for all of our key programs, including the F-35 and the F/A-18.
In Electronic Systems, sales rose about 2% for the quarter. Operating income increased 21%, and margin rate expanded more than 200 basis points to 13.9%. During the quarter, Electronic Systems received one of the three contracts for the technology development phase of the Navy's AMDR program, the next-generation radar capability from Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense. We also won a very important role on the Air Force's $2.3 billion ID/IQ program to provide new advanced targeting pods along with associated support equipment, spares and product support. Under the Air Force's new two-pod strategy, Northrop Grumman was awarded a 40% share of the program. This award was a tremendous win for the sector.
Information Systems sales were comparable to last year. IS operating income increased 13%, and as a percent of sales, improved 100 basis points to 8.9%. IS had some very important competitive wins in the quarter, including a role on the Social Security Administration's $2.8 billion ID/IQ contract for updated IT solutions. And shortly after the end of the quarter, IS was selected by the Centers for Disease Control to compete for task orders to provide information management and technology services under a $5 billion ID/IQ contract. These programs have multibillion-dollar potential over their respective performance periods but as ID/IQ contracts, they are not reflected in backlog until task orders are awarded. I would also note that IS won a $2.6 billion task order for the installation of a campus-wide information technology infrastructure for secure communications and operations at Saint Elizabeths, the Department of Homeland Security's new headquarters. This award has been protested, so there is a stay of performance in effect.
Sales at Shipbuilding increased 1%, and operating income totaled 6% of sales. Most of you are aware that we recently filed a Form 10 with the SEC for a potential Shipbuilding spin-off. We continue to weigh a potential separation of Shipbuilding, and as part of that evaluation, we continue to explore a potential sale or spin-off. The Form 10 filing was an initial step toward a potential spin-off of Shipbuilding, but a final decision regarding a separation has not been made.
In the meantime, our Shipbuilding team is keenly focused on performance and quality. We continue to work closely with the Navy and the Coast Guard to ensure we are delivering quality ships.
In the Technical Services, sales rose 26% during the third quarter. Operating income increased 37%, and margin rate expanded to 6.4%. The substantial sales growth in TS is being paced by the continued ramp up on new logistics programs like KC-10 and the C-20.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to touch briefly on our customer's affordability initiatives and other changes that we're seeing in the marketplace. Under Secretary, Dr. Ash Carter, has cleared articulated the DoD's plans to drive efficiency and increase affordability with guidelines that include 23 principal actions. The objective is consistent with what the department's leadership has been saying for some time. We don't believe these initiatives are intended to drive down industry profit margins or weaken the industrial base. Of course, the challenge in achieving the department's objectives will be in how the initiatives are implemented. It's clear that future success in our industry will require the ability to demonstrate sustained productivity, efficiency and performance improvement.
We also have to keep in mind that we continue to face an unparalleled dynamic range of national security threats. We in industry need to do all that we can to provide the most cost-effective systems and capabilities to our customers. At Northrop Grumman, we are focused on reducing overhead, managing our supply chain, streamlining organizations and processes and increasing productivity so that we can provide our customer with the best value possible. As we've demonstrated with our recent actions, we fully understand the challenges, and we'll continue to make the difficult decisions and take the actions necessary to position our company to create value for all of our stakeholders.
As we look ahead to next year, we would expect U.S. defense spending to be flat to low-single digit growth. However, there is more revenue uncertainty today than we've had in the recent past, given the budget pressures the U.S. government faces. And as we've said before, we believe that our greatest value creation opportunity lies in driving sustainable performance improvement, generating cash, deploying it effectively, optimizing our portfolio and effectively managing our balance sheet. We're making progress closing the performance gap with our peers, and we have opportunities for further improvement, especially as we reduce risk on some of our underperforming programs. We are also focused on future execution of a balanced cash deployment strategy that includes returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of the financials and a bit more color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Jim?

Let me just reiterate Wes' comments, which was a really, really good quarter, double-digit earnings per share growth and solid cash generation. Earnings per share from continuing operations grew 13%, even with the headwind of last year's $0.23 tax benefit. So adjusting for last year's tax settlement, earnings per share growth was 34%, with segment operating income, lower net pension expense and share buybacks being the principal earnings per share growth drivers.
Looking at the sectors through nine months, Aerospace System sales were up about 8%. Their year-to-date sales performance continues to reflect the overall strength of our unmanned and manned aircraft programs like Global Hawk, BAMS, F-35, B-2, EA-18G and Advanced Hawkeye. The positive trends for these programs were partially offset by declines in civil space and missile programs like the James Webb Space Telescope, NPOESS, KEI and ICBM. While we continue to work under the existing NPOESS contract, the DoD and the Department of Commerce will have separate roles going forward.
On the DoD side, we expect to be the prime integrating contract for the Defense Weather Satellite System or DWSS. We've been working closely with the Air Force to transition elements of NPOESS to DWSS. And we are beginning to see a decline in year-over-year NPOESS volume as we enter this transition phase. Staffing has recently been scaled back, and the government's plans and funding levels and schedules are still evolving, so we really can't fully quantify future impacts. But we do expect that sales for the balance of the year will reflect a lower spend profile.
We believe we have developed a compelling path forward for this effort, but the realization of that path will depend on the release of sufficient fiscal 2011 funding for the program. Aerospace third quarter sales, again, were accompanied by strong operating income. For the quarter, the margin rate expanded to 11.2% and through the nine months, our margin rate has expanded about 110 basis points to 11.3%.
Third quarter improvement was primarily driven by improved performance in our manned programs. As a result of the strong performance through nine months, we now expect the margin rate in Aerospace a slightly more than 11% for the year, with sales of about $11 billion.
Electronic Systems sales rose approximately 2% for the quarter and through nine months, sales are in line with our guidance of 2% to 4% growth for the year. ES generated a 13.9% margin rate for the quarter, which reflects improved performance in the period for postal automation and self protection systems. The Flats Sequencing System or FSS is the major driver of the postal automation results. FSS performance was stable this quarter, and last year's quarter included some negative team catch-up adjustments on that program. We now have received unconditional acceptance of the first article test for the U.S. Postal Service, with subsequent system acceptances underway. Through the nine months, ES has generated a margin rate of 13.1%, and we expect the 2010 margin rate to be in the high 12% to 13% range.
For Information Systems, third quarter sales reflect lower civil volume, consistent with our focus on higher quality opportunities in this marketplace and lower volume for intelligence program, which was more than offset by higher volume in defense programs. Through nine months, Information Systems are essentially flat, and based on year-to-date results, we now expect IS sales to range between $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion for the year. The IS team continues to do a good job in winning new quality business and retiring risk. This is reflected in their improvement in margin rate. Last quarter, we raised IS margin guidance to mid to high 8%. And based on this quarter, it's likely that they will hit 9% for the year.
Shipbuilding sales were up slightly this quarter and up nearly 10% through nine months. Growth for the quarter and for the year reflect higher volume for Expeditionary Warfare programs and aircraft carriers. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 6%, which reflects overall lower performance on Expeditionary Warfare programs, which included negotiation and recognition of milestone incentives on the LPD program. I should also point out that the lower performance on expeditionary warfare also includes a reduction on LPD's 23% and 25% margin rate related to our previously announced decision to consolidate our Gulf Coast shipyards. In addition, we also had a negative performance adjustment on the postdelivery work on LHD 8 that impacted this quarter. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect Shipbuilding sales of about $6.5 billion for the year, and our margin rate guidance is unchanged at 4% to 4.5%, reflecting the impact of last year's quarter's decision to consolidate our Gulf Coast facilities.
Turning to Technical Services, reported a 26% sales growth, operating income increased 37%, and margin rate expanded 50 basis points to 6.4%. Through nine months, sales were up 20%. Operating income is up 30%. Higher operating income and the rate reflect volume increases as well as a more favorable business mix with logistics representing an increasing share of sales.
While we continue to expect a low- to mid-6% range for margin, we expect sales to approach $3.2 billion for the year. The biggest variable in annual sales will be ID/IQ task order levels over the balance of the year. As expected, cash generation accelerated substantially during the quarter. Cash from operations before discretionary pension contributions totaled slightly over $1 billion for the quarter, with free cash flow of approximately $850 million.
Through nine months, before discretionary pension contributions, cash from operations totaled $1.4 billion, and free cash flow was just over $1 billion. We plan to accelerate a total of about $500 million of pension contributions into the second half of 2010, including the $60 million that was made in the third quarter. Timing on that $60 million third quarter contribution was driven by the opportunity to reduce PBGC premiums. And for all of 2010, we now expect discretionary contributions of about $830 million for the year.
We are also considering the possibility of another sizable discretionary pension contribution in the first part of 2011. The decision to accelerate pension funding reflects the compelling economics of low interest rates, improving investment returns, tax benefits associated with contributions and the opportunity to further reduce funding in our FAS expense obligations going forward.
I should remind you that for 2011 FAS pension expense, a 25 basis points change in our discount rate generates about a $75 million change in FAS pension expense, and that a 100 basis point change in our plan investment returns generate a $40 million change in FAS pension expense. Through the end of the third quarter, we estimate that the return on our plan assets was in the range of 9% to 9.5% compared with our 8.5% expected annual rate of return.
Regarding the discount rate, the current yield curve in our analysis of our appliance, to just 2011 discount rate in the range of 5% to 5.25% based on September 30 data compared with the 6% that we used for this year.
I would also note that while today's historically low interest rates have a negative impact on our future FAS pension expense, they also create a very attractive borrowing opportunity or environment for public companies. And we're currently looking at how we might take advantage of this lower rate environment. 
So in conclusion, I would, again, add it was a very good, strong quarter. We modestly increased our sales guidance to $34.9 billion, and our new guidance for earnings from continuing operations is $6.85 to $7 per share. Our guidance contemplates a fourth quarter impact of about $0.11 per share for deferred state taxes associated with our planned fourth quarter discretionary pension contributions, as well as higher unallowable costs associated with the exploration of strategic alternatives for the Shipbuilding business.
We are comfortable with our outlook for cash from operations and free cash flow guidance, both of which are before discretionary pension contributions. 
Paul, with that, I think we're ready to turn it over for Q&A.

And then in particular, in the civilian agencies area, in places where we thought we could really bring something that was differentiating for the long term. So the wins that we've announced are reflections of that strategy of being more focused on civilian agencies and then being, I would say, quite selective within the civilian agencies range of opportunities for those areas where we can bring things such as our Cyber Security capabilities to many other solutions or other substantial engineering content that reflects the type of value that we can deliver to customers. So we see that marketplace as an attractive marketplace. Again, we are selective in what we're pursuing. And part of that selection process goes to the second part of your question, which is the margin rate. We are pursuing those opportunities that we believe are consistent with our margin rate objectives that we've laid out for Information Systems in total. And so that typically reflects a little bit of more of the higher end, if you're okay with that description, of the civilian agencies marketplace than the parts of the marketplace that have been more commoditized.

We have, as you would recall over the last couple of years, taken our sectors from eight down to the five that we have today. And as we have taken each of those moves, we have used those as opportunities to take out substantial cost, which primarily has been focused around head count reduction to get to more optimized and streamlined organizational approaches. We have been a bit of that already at the corporate staff level. And as we relocate, we are shrinking the size of the corporate office as a part of that relocation. But I would say more broadly in the things that perhaps connect even more directly in terms of the affordability initiatives, we've also taken on, enterprise-wide, a variety of activities around Shared Services that are really paying dividends for our company. And we we're going to continue to push on those. But the day-to-day cost leverage, the things that really are driving the outcomes the department is looking for, are really happening at the program level. Program by programs, is where we have to take on the cost affordability challenges and demonstrate that we can, if necessary, re-architect how those programs are being done and in all cases, go and find the cost opportunities that will continue to bring down the cost curve. So I know there's a lot of play, a lot of focus that happens around head count reduction. But I would just point out that it is I think even more important the work is being done at the program levels to drive affordability.

As you mentioned, whether or not we are the best owners of the business and whether or not it makes the most sense to have that business in our portfolio versus leveraging an opportunity that might exist in the marketplace, we also look at it in the terms of synergy, how well the business is connected into the rest of the operations of our corporation, how well we're able to bring the pieces together to create more by virtue of the elements working together. And as I think we've been pretty explicit about, our exploration of alternatives around Shipbuilding, that's a case where we see a very good quality business with great opportunities for continued margin rate expansion, but a business where we've not been able to demonstrate very substantial synergies to the operations of Shipbuilding with other parts of our company. And that has led us down this path of exploring alternatives to see if there might be a way of enhancing overall value, both for our shareholders and for our customers and employees by having Shipbuilding operate as a separate entity. I think it is indicative of our thought process, and just would illuminate the way that we're looking at our company. But I do get the question sometimes, should the marketplace the actions we've taken on TASC and Shipbuilding as some sort of a signal that we're looking to figure out how to dismantle the company and sell the pieces for more than the whole? No, that is not what we're doing. We're not dismantling the company, but we are intent on being very active managers of our portfolio going forward.

The other variable is, as you pointed out, essentially what's going to happen with your CAS cost. In our view of CAS cost for 2011 essentially reflects an increase in those costs of about $250 million to $300 million, consistent with what we thought would happen at the beginning of the year. I really don't see much of a change occurring from that view of increased CAS cost that we had at the beginning of the year as we approach towards the end of 2010 here.

I don't know anyone that's described me that way of late. And so perhaps let me give you my kind of a broader view. I know I touched a little bit of this on my commentary, but just a broader view of where we see things going. It is clear to all of us that the budget pressures will certainly be a big factor in setting the top line environment for the DoD and the intelligence community, which represent the vast preponderance of our customer base. I don't think there's any debate out there. It's also clear that affordability and variety of initiatives that are connected to the affordability thrust are going to have some implications for the defense industry. We are very pleased by the engagement that the DoD has had with industry in reaching out and setting a course on affordability. But as I said in my remarks, the key to that is going to be in implementation and how all of that rolls out. I do look forward to that continued engagement with the department to shape it as we go forward, and I would say that we have a team at DoD today that has demonstrated a real connection to the importance of industrial base, both the strength of the industrial base and the future of the industrial base that I personally haven't seen for some time. And I really like that. And so perhaps that comes across as a little bit of a rosy outlook, but it's more intended to reflect my view of the interaction that we have with the department, very positive nature of that interaction. They are tough taskmasters. You've seen them hold us publicly accountable when they don't like the outcomes that they're seeing, but I think it's fair. And I think the message is that we need to be doing what the we need to do. And on the programs like Global Hawk, when we've gone and see them to talk about affordability, we've been able to have the two-way conversation about the things the department needs to do. And they've taken that on board. So I like that part of our environment today. I think it will be healthy for our industry over time to be aligned and supportive of that. But just let me be very clear about how I see all that adding up. We do not expect, and I would say nor are we dependent on significant top line growth to create value. And so many of the changes that we've been driving in the company over the course of this year had been focusing on the areas where we see those value creation opportunities, and that goes to program performance, and we've talked a lot about mitigating risk in the programs where we've had some challenges in the past, driving that risk out, generating a margin rates that we know we can demonstrate by focusing on core program performance and then being very good stewards of the cash that we generate. And our value equation is based largely around that improvement in margin rates, that intelligent deployment of cash and being proactive with our portfolio to make sure that we stay lined up actually a little bit ahead if we can with where our customers is going, and we feel good about how that looks in terms of portfolio. So I can't agree with you more. There are a lot of negative, if you will, issues out there surrounding the outlook of the top line, concerns about how the customers will react to that over time. But I would also tell you that, and you have as much or more experience than I do in this, Howard, that over time, we see our nation respond to the external threat profile. And I don't see that diminishing. In fact, I am increasingly concerned about some of the new aspects of the threat profile that we've all seen emerging over these last couple of years. And I do have confidence that our nation stands up and addresses those, and that doesn't translate to earnings or sales in any particular quarter. But it does drive the way we think about positioning this business for the long term, to be good stewards for both our shareholders and our customers and of course, our employees as well. Probably said a little more than you're asking for there, but I appreciated the opportunity to reflect on the environment.

We manage all of that under tight boundaries of confidentiality and it's just a matter of policy we don't comment on that aspect of our M&A. You did see, I think, hopefully everyone noticed that on October 15, we submitted a Form 10 registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission. And that was an important filing because that really gets the process started to provide us an alternative should we elect to go down the path of a spin-off.

But we are a good partner, I believe, with Lockheed. You'd have to ask them, and their perspective of that. But I believe we've been a very good partner with Lockheed on this program. I would say they've been a good prime on this program, and part of being a partner is being supportive of the affordability initiatives that are underway. We have to look at each of the three pieces of F-35, sometimes, a little bit differently because there are different risk return characteristics. By the three pieces, I mean, we do work on this program as a subcontractor, Lockheed, in Aerospace Systems, Information Systems and Electronic Systems. And so the approach that we might take while similar in most respects, might be tuned slightly differently given the individual characteristics of those areas. The one thing I would say about FPI and it always goes, of course, to the actual structure of airline geometry and target cost. But in general FPI can be a very good contract if you're in the LRIP phase, particularly after you get past the first view of the LRIPs where you have a very good cost base line, where you have a very comprehensive risk management approach and where you know what you're really producing and how the production lines are supposed to operate. And that's where we are in F-35. We've made tremendous progress on this program. I feel good about the products that we're delivering on F-35. And then, there's always elements of the program that require continued tuning and at the prime level, Lockheed continues to go through their overall test program. And so there is the SDD overlay to this and any of their recurring or the new issues that might occur get addressed through that concurrent SDD approach. But given all of that, I think that there's a reasonable contractual approach to be taken here to support what Lockheed's customer is asking of them. And as a partner, we are focused on supporting that.

But what's interesting about our business in Aero is we've worked so hard over these last few years on development programs to get those development programs transitioned into production so that we can do exactly what our customer is asking us to do today, which is manage the cost down over the course of production. And so I would say we've been getting ready for this. We've been preparing to be in an environment where we're focused probably a little bit more in production than development, although we, of course, are going to be out looking to win new development opportunities. But on those particular programs, we are driving on cost as we go through these earlier stages of production so that we can hit the lower targets that's should come with learning curve, both in the work we do and in what we expect of our supply base in going through this. And we are not at all interested in taking profitability down as we go through this. We've been working hard to get to the point in production where we're reducing cost and realizing the profitable returns that should come from the big investments we've made to get us here. So there is a big discussion around costs very appropriately. That's what we expected. That's what we've been working to get to. But we believe we should have good profitability opportunities in the production phase. Production is the lifeblood of our industry. That's where the industry gets its returns, and we're going to be pretty tough about holding to getting those returns because we've made the investment. Jim, anything to add on that?

But I wouldn't signal that we're trying to accomplish anything in particular with the level of pension contributions other than taking advantage of the possibility of increasing pension earnings going forward, the low interest rate environment, clearly, a tax advantage in making contributions today.

And it really does impact all of the businesses. The continuing resolution is kind of a tough thing for customers because they have to go through a rather difficult process of figuring out is something really a new award or not a new award? How was it funded or budgeted in prior years? And how does the specific language that was reflected in the CR relate to their individual programs? And so thinking your way all the way through that, even and getting the right approvals within the customer organizations, even if it turns out that you're okay to go out and grant the award, it simply causes delay. And we're kind of seeing it across the board. There's just a whole variety of things where we can see that the customer really, really wants to just get on with it, but they're having to work through those kind of processes. So that was more the intention of my statement. It is related to the continuing resolution environment. And we do have some concerns that, that could be an environment that sticks with us for a while depending on how things go in the election and the Congress' perspectives when it comes back from the election. Not clear when that resolves. So that's a concern.

This morning, I'll discuss our third quarter results, operational highlights and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. They demonstrate that across the entire enterprise, our team is focused on driving sustainable performance improvement.
Our efforts are generating positive results across our business, which is reflected in this quarter's double-digit EPS growth. Financial highlights for the quarter include 4% sales growth and a 14% increase in segment operating income.
Third quarter segment operating margin rate improved 80 basis points to 9.8%, which is the primary indicator of performance improvement at the sectors. Operating income also increased substantially reflecting the operational improvements and lower pension expense. In addition to operational improvements, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares of our common stock, bringing this year's repurchases to 17.8 million shares or approximately $1.1 billion.
Based on our performance for the first nine months of the year, we now expect 2010 earnings to range between $6.85 and $7 per share. We also have a strong quarter for cash. Cash from operations before discretionary pension contributions totaled more than $1 billion, and free cash flow, also before discretionary pension contributions, totaled approximately $850 million. Based on year-to-date results and again, before discretionary pension contributions, we continue to expect cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.8 billion and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
Through the first nine months, our pension contributions totaled $390 million. Jim will provide more detail on cash and pension trends later in the call.
At the end of the third quarter, total backlog was $64.6 billion, which reflects new awards of $7.4 billion in the quarter. The decline in backlog through the end of the third quarter is principally driven by Aerospace and Shipbuilding, our two large primarily platform businesses, where awards are typically large and occur periodically. In Electronics, Information Systems and Technical Services, our shorter-cycle businesses, the backlog trends are generally positive. Several major Aerospace and Shipbuilding awards are pending. And as these awards are finalized in the coming months, we expect an improvement in our book-to-bill rate. A prolonged period of continuing resolution could delay some awards, however.
Turning to sector highlights. Aerospace sales increased 7%. Operating income increased more than 14%, and margin rate improved 70 basis points to 11.2%. Sales trends in Aerospace continue to reflect higher volume for manned and unmanned aircraft platforms, which was partially offset by lower sales for missile defense and civil space programs. We achieved several milestones in the Global Hawk program this quarter. In addition to supporting in-theater operations 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Global Hawk recently achieved 35,000 combat hours and two Global Hawks were deployed to new overseas locations. One to Sigonella Naval Air Station in Italy and the other to the Pacific Command at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. Overall, the system continues to perform very well, and the program is on track for achieving its critical initial operational test and evaluation milestone, which we expect will lead a full rate production decision next spring.
Global Hawk affordability continues to be a key priority that we are working jointly with our customer. The air vehicle production costs has continued to decline across each production line. And for the payloads, we are utilizing combined buys and an economic order quantity approach to reduce cost.
As platform configurations continue to mature and affordability initiatives are implemented, we expect air vehicle and sensor costs will continue to decline. Driving production efficiencies is an ongoing focus for Aerospace Systems, not only for Global Hawk but for all of our key programs, including the F-35 and the F/A-18.
In Electronic Systems, sales rose about 2% for the quarter. Operating income increased 21%, and margin rate expanded more than 200 basis points to 13.9%. During the quarter, Electronic Systems received one of the three contracts for the technology development phase of the Navy's AMDR program, the next-generation radar capability from Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense. We also won a very important role on the Air Force's $2.3 billion ID/IQ program to provide new advanced targeting pods along with associated support equipment, spares and product support. Under the Air Force's new two-pod strategy, Northrop Grumman was awarded a 40% share of the program. This award was a tremendous win for the sector.
Information Systems sales were comparable to last year. IS operating income increased 13%, and as a percent of sales, improved 100 basis points to 8.9%. IS had some very important competitive wins in the quarter, including a role on the Social Security Administration's $2.8 billion ID/IQ contract for updated IT solutions. And shortly after the end of the quarter, IS was selected by the Centers for Disease Control to compete for task orders to provide information management and technology services under a $5 billion ID/IQ contract. These programs have multibillion-dollar potential over their respective performance periods but as ID/IQ contracts, they are not reflected in backlog until task orders are awarded. I would also note that IS won a $2.6 billion task order for the installation of a campus-wide information technology infrastructure for secure communications and operations at Saint Elizabeths, the Department of Homeland Security's new headquarters. This award has been protested, so there is a stay of performance in effect.
Sales at Shipbuilding increased 1%, and operating income totaled 6% of sales. Most of you are aware that we recently filed a Form 10 with the SEC for a potential Shipbuilding spin-off. We continue to weigh a potential separation of Shipbuilding, and as part of that evaluation, we continue to explore a potential sale or spin-off. The Form 10 filing was an initial step toward a potential spin-off of Shipbuilding, but a final decision regarding a separation has not been made.
In the meantime, our Shipbuilding team is keenly focused on performance and quality. We continue to work closely with the Navy and the Coast Guard to ensure we are delivering quality ships.
In the Technical Services, sales rose 26% during the third quarter. Operating income increased 37%, and margin rate expanded to 6.4%. The substantial sales growth in TS is being paced by the continued ramp up on new logistics programs like KC-10 and the C-20.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to touch briefly on our customer's affordability initiatives and other changes that we're seeing in the marketplace. Under Secretary, Dr. Ash Carter, has cleared articulated the DoD's plans to drive efficiency and increase affordability with guidelines that include 23 principal actions. The objective is consistent with what the department's leadership has been saying for some time. We don't believe these initiatives are intended to drive down industry profit margins or weaken the industrial base. Of course, the challenge in achieving the department's objectives will be in how the initiatives are implemented. It's clear that future success in our industry will require the ability to demonstrate sustained productivity, efficiency and performance improvement.
We also have to keep in mind that we continue to face an unparalleled dynamic range of national security threats. We in industry need to do all that we can to provide the most cost-effective systems and capabilities to our customers. At Northrop Grumman, we are focused on reducing overhead, managing our supply chain, streamlining organizations and processes and increasing productivity so that we can provide our customer with the best value possible. As we've demonstrated with our recent actions, we fully understand the challenges, and we'll continue to make the difficult decisions and take the actions necessary to position our company to create value for all of our stakeholders.
As we look ahead to next year, we would expect U.S. defense spending to be flat to low-single digit growth. However, there is more revenue uncertainty today than we've had in the recent past, given the budget pressures the U.S. government faces. And as we've said before, we believe that our greatest value creation opportunity lies in driving sustainable performance improvement, generating cash, deploying it effectively, optimizing our portfolio and effectively managing our balance sheet. We're making progress closing the performance gap with our peers, and we have opportunities for further improvement, especially as we reduce risk on some of our underperforming programs. We are also focused on future execution of a balanced cash deployment strategy that includes returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of the financials and a bit more color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Jim?"
97199,114361975,82481,"Northrop Grumman Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Northrop Grumman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Wes. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let me just reiterate Wes' comments, it was a really, really good quarter, double-digit earnings per share growth and solid cash generation. Earnings per share from continuing operations grew 13%, even",1349,"Thanks, Wes. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let me just reiterate Wes' comments, it was a really, really good quarter, double-digit earnings per share growth and solid cash generation. Earnings per share from continuing operations grew 13%, even with the headwind of last year's $0.23 tax benefit. So adjusting for last year's tax settlement, earnings per share growth was 34%, with segment operating income, lower net pension expense and share buybacks being the principal earnings per share growth drivers.
Looking at the sectors through nine months, Aerospace System sales were up about 8%. Their year-to-date sales performance continues to reflect the overall strength of our unmanned and manned aircraft programs like Global Hawk, BAMS, F-35, B-2, EA-18G and Advanced Hawkeye. The positive trends for these programs were partially offset by declines in civil space and missile programs like the James Webb Space Telescope, NPOESS, KEI and ICBM. While we continue to work under the existing NPOESS contract, the DoD and the Department of Commerce will have separate roles going forward.
On the DoD side, we expect to be the prime integrating contract for the Defense Weather Satellite System or DWSS. We've been working closely with the Air Force to transition elements of NPOESS to DWSS. And we are beginning to see a decline in year-over-year NPOESS volume as we enter this transition phase. Staffing has recently been scaled back, and the government's plans and funding levels and schedules are still evolving, so we really can't fully quantify future impacts. But we do expect that sales for the balance of the year will reflect a lower spend profile.
We believe we have developed a compelling path forward for this effort, but the realization of that path will depend on the release of sufficient fiscal 2011 funding for the program. Aerospace third quarter sales, again, were accompanied by strong operating income. For the quarter, the margin rate expanded to 11.2% and through the nine months, our margin rate has expanded about 110 basis points to 11.3%.
Third quarter improvement was primarily driven by improved performance in our manned programs. As a result of the strong performance through nine months, we now expect the margin rate in Aerospace at slightly more than 11% for the year, with sales of about $11 billion.
Electronic Systems sales rose approximately 2% for the quarter and through nine months, sales are in line with our guidance of 2% to 4% growth for the year. ES generated a 13.9% margin rate for the quarter, which reflects improved performance in the period for postal automation and self-protection systems. The Flats Sequencing System, or FSS, is the major driver of the postal automation results. FSS performance was stable this quarter, and last year's quarter included some negative team catch-up adjustments on that program. We now have received unconditional acceptance of the first article test for the U.S. Postal Service, with subsequent system acceptances underway. Through the nine months, ES has generated a margin rate of 13.1%, and we expect the 2010 margin rate to be in the high 12% to 13% range.
For Information Systems, third quarter sales reflect lower civil volume, consistent with our focus on higher quality opportunities in this marketplace and lower volume for intelligence program, which was more than offset by higher volume in defense programs. Through nine months, Information Systems are essentially flat, and based on year-to-date results, we now expect IS sales to range between $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion for the year. The IS team continues to do a good job in winning new quality business and retiring risk. This is reflected in their improvement in margin rate. Last quarter, we raised IS margin guidance to mid to high 8%. And based on this quarter, it's likely that they will hit 9% for the year.
Shipbuilding sales were up slightly this quarter and up nearly 10% through nine months. Growth for the quarter and for the year reflect higher volume for Expeditionary Warfare programs and aircraft carriers. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 6%, which reflects overall lower performance on Expeditionary Warfare programs, which included negotiation and recognition of milestone incentives on the LPD program. I should also point out that the lower performance on expeditionary warfare also includes a reduction on LPD's 23% and 25% margin rate related to our previously announced decision to consolidate our Gulf Coast shipyards. In addition, we also had a negative performance adjustment on the postdelivery work on LHD 8 that impacted this quarter. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect Shipbuilding sales of about $6.5 billion for the year, and our margin rate guidance is unchanged at 4% to 4.5%, reflecting the impact of last quarter's decision to consolidate our Gulf Coast facilities.
Turning to Technical Services, reported a 26% sales growth, operating income increased 37%, and margin rate expanded 50 basis points to 6.4%. Through nine months, sales were up 20%. Operating income is up 30%. Higher operating income and the rate reflect volume increases as well as a more favorable business mix with logistics representing an increasing share of sales.
While we continue to expect a low- to mid-6% range for margin, we expect sales to approach $3.2 billion for the year. The biggest variable in annual sales will be ID/IQ task order levels over the balance of the year. As expected, cash generation accelerated substantially during the quarter. Cash from operations before discretionary pension contributions totaled slightly over $1 billion for the quarter, with free cash flow of approximately $850 million.
Through nine months, before discretionary pension contributions, cash from operations totaled $1.4 billion, and free cash flow was just over $1 billion. We plan to accelerate a total of about $500 million of pension contributions into the second half of 2010, including the $60 million that was made in the third quarter. Timing on that $60 million third quarter contribution was driven by the opportunity to reduce PBGC premiums. And for all of 2010, we now expect discretionary contributions of about $830 million for the year.
We are also considering the possibility of another sizable discretionary pension contribution in the first part of 2011. The decision to accelerate pension funding reflects the compelling economics of low interest rates, improving investment returns, tax benefits associated with contributions and the opportunity to further reduce funding in our FAS expense obligations going forward.
I should remind you that for 2011 FAS pension expense, a 25 basis points change in our discount rate generates about a $75 million change in FAS pension expense, and that a 100 basis point change in our plan investment returns generate a $40 million change in FAS pension expense. Through the end of the third quarter, we estimate that the return on our plan assets was in the range of 9% to 9.5% compared with our 8.5% expected annual rate of return.
Regarding the discount rate, the current yield curve in our analysis of our plans suggest a 2011 discount rate in the range of 5% to 5.25% based on September 30 data compared with the 6% that we used for this year.
I would also note that while today's historically low interest rates have a negative impact on our future FAS pension expense, they also create a very attractive borrowing opportunity or environment for public companies. And we're currently looking at how we might take advantage of this lower rate environment. 
So in conclusion, I would again add, it was a very good, strong quarter. We modestly increased our sales guidance to $34.9 billion, and our new guidance for earnings from continuing operations is $6.85 to $7 per share. Our guidance contemplates a fourth quarter impact of about $0.11 per share for deferred state taxes associated with our planned fourth quarter discretionary pension contributions, as well as higher unallowable costs associated with the exploration of strategic alternatives for the Shipbuilding business.
We are comfortable with our outlook for cash from operations and free cash flow guidance, both of which are before discretionary pension contributions. 
Paul, with that, I think we're ready to turn it over for Q&A."

So the wins that we've announced are reflections of that strategy of being more focused on civilian agencies and then being, I would say, quite selective within the civilian agencies range of opportunities for those areas where we can bring things such as our Cyber Security capabilities to many other solutions or other substantial engineering content that reflects the type of value that we can deliver to customers. So we see that marketplace as an attractive marketplace. Again, we are selective in what we're pursuing. And part of that selection process goes to the second part of your question, which is the margin rate. We are pursuing those opportunities that we believe are consistent with our margin rate objectives that we've laid out for Information Systems in total.

But I would say more broadly in the things that perhaps connect even more directly in terms of the affordability initiatives, we've also taken on, enterprise-wide, a variety of activities around Shared Services that are really paying dividends for our company. And we're going to continue to push on those. But the day-to-day cost leverage, the things that really are driving the outcomes the department is looking for, are really happening at the program level. Program by program is where we have to take on the cost affordability challenges and demonstrate that we can, if necessary, re-architect how those programs are being done and in all cases, go and find the cost opportunities that will continue to bring down the cost curve. So I know there's a lot of play, a lot of focus that happens around head count reduction.

And that has led us down this path of exploring alternatives to see if there might be a way of enhancing overall value, both for our shareholders and for our customers and employees by having Shipbuilding operate as a separate entity. I think it is indicative of our thought process, and just would illuminate the way that we're looking at our company. But I do get the question sometimes, should the marketplace see the actions we've taken on TASC and Shipbuilding as some sort of a signal that we're looking to figure out how to dismantle the company and sell the pieces for more than the whole? No, that is not what we're doing. We're not dismantling the company, but we are intent on being very active managers of our portfolio going forward."

The other variable is, as you pointed out, essentially what's going to happen with your CAS cost. In our view of CAS cost for 2011 essentially reflects an increase in those costs of about $250 million to $300 million, consistent with what we thought would happen at the beginning of the year. I really don't see much of a change occurring from that view of increased CAS cost that we had at the beginning of the year as we approach towards the end of 2010 here. I'm looking for about a $250 million to $350 million in CAS cost that will serve to offset some of those potential increases in FAS cost that we referred to."

I don't know anyone that's described me that way of late. And so perhaps let me give you my kind of a broader view. I know I touched a little bit on this in my commentary, but just a broader view of where we see things going. It is clear to all of us that the budget pressures will certainly be a big factor in setting the top line environment for the DoD and the intelligence community, which represent the vast preponderance of our customer base. I don't think there's any debate out there. It's also clear that affordability and variety of initiatives that are connected to the affordability thrust are going to have some implications for the defense industry. We are very pleased by the engagement that the DoD has had with industry in reaching out and setting a course on affordability. But as I said in my remarks, the key to that is going to be in implementation and how all of that rolls out. I do look forward to that continued engagement with the department to shape it as we go forward, and I would say that we have a team at DoD today that has demonstrated a real connection to the importance of industrial base, both the strength of the industrial base and the future of the industrial base that I personally haven't seen for some time. And I really like that. And so perhaps that comes across as a little bit of a rosy outlook, but it's more intended to reflect my view of the interaction that we have with the department, very positive nature of that interaction. They are tough taskmasters. You've seen them hold us publicly accountable when they don't like the outcomes that they're seeing, but I think it's fair. And I think the message is that we need to be doing what we need to doing. And on the programs like Global Hawk, when we've gone in to see them to talk about affordability, we've been able to have the two-way conversation about the things the department needs to do. And they've taken that on board. So I like that part of our environment today. I think it will be healthy for our industry over time to be aligned and supportive of that. But just let me be very clear about how I see all that adding up. We do not expect, and I would say nor are we dependent on significant top line growth to create value. And so many of the changes that we've been driving in the company over the course of this year had been focusing on the areas where we see those value creation opportunities, and that goes to program performance, and we've talked a lot about mitigating risk in the programs where we've had some challenges in the past, driving that risk out, generating a margin rates that we know we can demonstrate by focusing on core program performance and then being very good stewards of the cash that we generate. And our value equation is based largely around that improvement in margin rates, that intelligent deployment of cash and being proactive with our portfolio to make sure that we stay lined up actually a little bit ahead if we can with where our customer is going, and we feel good about how that looks in terms of portfolio. So I can't agree with you more. There are a lot of negative, if you will, issues out there surrounding the outlook of the top line, concerns about how the customers will react to that over time. But I would also tell you that, and you have as much or more experience than I do in this, Howard, that over time, we see our nation respond to the external threat profile. And I don't see that diminishing. In fact, I am increasingly concerned about some of the new aspects of the threat profile that we've all seen emerging over these last couple of years. And I do have confidence that our nation stands up and addresses those, and that doesn't translate to earnings or sales in any particular quarter. But it does drive the way we think about positioning this business for the long term, to be good stewards for both our shareholders and our customers and of course, our employees as well. Probably said a little more than you're asking for there, but I appreciated the opportunity to reflect on the environment."

We manage all of that under tight boundaries of confidentiality and it's just a matter of policy we don't comment on that aspect of our M&A. You did see, I think, hopefully everyone noticed that on October 15, we submitted a Form 10 registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission. And that was an important filing because that really gets the process started to provide us an alternative should we elect to go down the path of a spin-off.

But we are a good partner, I believe, with Lockheed. You'd have to ask them, and their perspective of that. But I believe we've been a very good partner with Lockheed on this program. I would say they've been a good prime on this program, and part of being a partner is being supportive of the affordability initiatives that are underway. We have to look at each of the three pieces of F-35, sometimes, a little bit differently because there are different risk return characteristics. By the three pieces, I mean, we do work on this program as a subcontractor, Lockheed, in Aerospace Systems, Information Systems and Electronic Systems. And so the approach that we might take while similar in most respects, might be tuned slightly differently given the individual characteristics of those areas. The one thing I would say about FPI and it always goes, of course, to the actual structure of airline geometry and target cost. But in general FPI can be a very good contract if you're in the LRIP phase, particularly after you get past the first view of the LRIPs where you have a very good cost base line, where you have a very comprehensive risk management approach and where you know what you're really producing and how the production lines are supposed to operate. And that's where we are in F-35. We've made tremendous progress on this program. I feel good about the products that we're delivering on F-35. And then, there's always elements of the program that require continued tuning and at the prime level, Lockheed continues to go through their overall test program. And so there is the SDD overlay to this and any of their recurring or the new issues that might occur get addressed through that concurrent SDD approach. But given all of that, I think that there's a reasonable contractual approach to be taken here to support what Lockheed's customer is asking of them. And as a partner, we are focused on supporting that."

We've been preparing to be in an environment where we're focused probably a little bit more in production than development, although we, of course, are going to be out looking to win new development opportunities. But on those particular programs, we are driving on cost as we go through these earlier stages of production so that we can hit the lower targets that should come with learning curve, both in the work we do and in what we expect of our supply base in going through this.

And it really does impact all of the businesses. The continuing resolution is kind of a tough thing for customers because they have to go through a rather difficult process of figuring out is something really a new award or not a new award? How was it funded or budgeted in prior years? And how does the specific language that was reflected in the CR relate to their individual programs? And so thinking your way all the way through that, even if -- and getting the right approvals within the customer organizations, even if it turns out that you're okay to go out and grant the award, it simply causes delay. And we're kind of seeing it across the board. There's just a whole variety of things where we can see that the customer really, really wants to just get on with it, but they're having to work through those kind of processes. So that was more the intention of my statement. It is related to the continuing resolution environment. And we do have some concerns that, that could be an environment that sticks with us for a while depending on how things go in the election and the Congress' perspectives when it comes back from the election. Not clear when that resolves. So that's a concern."

Some examples, the F-18 multi-year, we are continuing negotiations with Boeing. We talked earlier about Joint Strike Fighter sort of around the company, three other sectors. And in Shipbuilding, both the Destroyer program and the LPD program, we are in active negotiations, as well. And so those certainly translate into meaningful metrics for driving the overall backlog. But I'd put those more in the category of working our way through them as opposed to substantial externalities like SCR. But we'd love to think it was only an October issue. But I'm worried it is going to be a multi-month problem that is more of an overlay to the overall contracting environment."
