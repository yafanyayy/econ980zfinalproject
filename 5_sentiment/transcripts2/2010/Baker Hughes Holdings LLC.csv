This morning, we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $84 million or $0.27 per share. This compares to $1.41 per share a year ago and $0.18 per share for the third quarter of 2009. Q4 revenue was $2.4 billion down 24% or",841,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning. This morning, we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $84 million or $0.27 per share. This compares to $1.41 per share a year ago and $0.18 per share for the third quarter of 2009. Q4 revenue was $2.4 billion down 24% or $758 million year-over-year and up 9% or $196 million sequentially.For the full year, net income on a U.S. GAAP basis was up $1.36 per share compared to $5.30 per share in 2008. 2009 full year revenue was $9.7 billion, down 19% from $11.9 billion in 2008.  North American revenue was down 31% compared to 2008 and non-North American revenue was down 9%.Looking at quarterly comparisons, North American revenue was $890 million in the fourth quarter, down 37% year-over-year but up 9% sequentially. Revenue outside of North America was $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, that was down 30% year-on-year, but up 9% sequentially also.Reorganizations, severance, acquisition-related charges and the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $74 million before tax or $0.16 per share in Q4. This was comprised of $20 million for reorganization costs, $16 million for severance, $16 million for acquisition-related cost, and $22 million for the increased in allowance for doubtful accounts. For the balance of our comments this morning, references to operating profit and operating profit margins will be on an adjusted basis, excluding these charges. On this adjusted basis, our oilfield operating margin for the fourth quarter was 12% down from 23% in the year-ago quarter but up 10% from the third quarter. Turning to the performance of our two segments, Drilling and Evaluation revenue was $1.1 billion in Q4, this was down 28% year-over-year, but up 8% sequentially. The Drilling and Evaluation segment's operating margin was 8% in Q4 that's down from 22% in the year ago quarter but up sequentially from 5% in Q3. Revenue for our completion of Production segment was $1.3 billion down 20% from the year-ago quarter and up 10% sequentially.CT's operating margin in Q4 was 16% and this compares to 23% in the fourth quarter 2008 and is up from 14% in the prior quarter. To help you evaluate our earnings per share in the fourth quarter, I'll review the significant items that bridge the sequential and year-ago quarters to fourth quarter EPS of $0.27. In Q3 2009, our U.S. GAAP net income per share was $0.18. From this $0.18, subtract $0.04 for higher acquisition-related charges, add $0.01 for gain on auction rate securities, add $0.09 for increased profits in North America and add $0.03 for increased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.27 we are reporting for the fourth quarter.Now bridging from the year-ago quarter, from the U.S. GAAP net income per share of $1.41 we reported in the fourth quarter of 2008, subtract $0.03 for higher acquisition related cost, subtract $0.07 as a result of higher corporate expense, add $0.06 for the net impairment of auction rate securities, subtract $0.06 for a higher tax rate and share count compared to the year-ago quarter, subtract $0.56 for decreased profits in North America and subtract $0.48 for a decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.27 we are reporting for the fourth quarter.  In Q4, our corporate costs were $66 million in line with our guidance for underlying corporate costs and in line with Q3. Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter end, our total debt was $1.8 billion and our long-term debt-to-cap ratio was 20%. Our net debt was $205 million. Our net debt-to-cap ratio was 2%. We had no maturities and long-term debt until November of 2013.We currently have $1 billion in undrawn, committed credit facilities. We have a $500 million facility, which is accessible through 2012. We also have a $500 million, 364-day facility, which is accessible through the end of March of 2010. We are currently reviewing our options to expand are extend or expand this second facility in light of the BJ Services acquisition.  At quarter end, we had cash and short-term investments of $1.6 billion. This totals $2.6 billion in available liquidity.  Sequentially, we released another $180 million in working capital primarily to our ongoing focus on supply chain and inventory reduction. Last for 2009 as a whole, our free cash flow before dividends and carry over tax payments was nearly $600 million, and this is after taking $250 million of non-recurring charges. Last, a few thoughts on guidance for 2010 and the first quarter. Capital spending for 2010 is expected to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Our tax rate is expected to increase to between 33% and 34%. Corporate spending, excluding reorganization and acquisition-related cost, is expected to be $65 million to $70 million per quarter. And finally, first quarter EPS, excluding acquisition-related cost and non-recurring charges, is expected to be roughly in line with the current consensus, which will be a challenge but is doable. I'll now turn the call over to Martin who will highlight our geographic results. Martin?"

I'll review our international operations first which improved significantly in the fourth quarter with revenue increases in all three international regions.In Latin America, year-on-year revenue was down 11% due to lower activity and revenu",1180,"Thanks, Peter. I'll review our international operations first which improved significantly in the fourth quarter with revenue increases in all three international regions.In Latin America, year-on-year revenue was down 11% due to lower activity and revenues in the Venezuela, Southern Cone and Andean geomarkets markets. These declines were partially offset by increased revenues in the Mexico, Central America and Brazil geomarkets. Revenue increased 15% sequentially with increased revenue in the Andean, Brazil, Venezuela and Souther Cone geomarkets more than offsetting lower revenues attributable to project delays on the Alma Marine project in the Mexico/Central America geomarket. As is usual for the fourth quarter, we had strong artificial lift and completions equipment sales throughout the region.The operating profit margin in Latin America for the fourth quarter was 9%, down from 21% in the fourth quarter of '08 and up from 5% in the prior quarter. Profitability in the fourth quarter was impacted by lower activity and utilization in Mexico/Central America geomarket in both our Alma Marine project and the ATG activity. Brazil remains one of the most important service plays in the world as we enter 2010. The pre-salt basin offshore Brazil continues to grow as a target of intensive planning and engineering design activities required to develop this basin into a premier producing region. Baker Hughes is well positioned to having committed the technical and operational resources necessary to continue helping our customer optimize their development plans.In the fourth quarter, our collaboration with our customer achieved a record for drilling the carbon inspection of the pre-salt Santos basin. A Tupi well was drilled using Baker Hughes' Quantec bits combined with our TruTrak directional drilling technology and delivered a 37% reduction in the cost per meter than the best previous well in the pre-salt section. The new Baker Hughes geographic organization is also allowing us to re-enter key markets around the world with product lines previously absent. One example is Colombia, where we reentered the market after a long wireline absence and logged an exploration wildcat for the NOC in partnership with an IOC. The well used a full suite of Baker Hughes wireline technologies including our BEACON Center for data management and realtime visualization. Geoscientist discovered pay zones that were previously undetectable with the basic standard issue wireline tools. In Mexico, we remain optimistic of the opportunities as PEMEX explores different approaches to improving the reserve base and the recovery factors. We continue our work on the Alma Marine project with good technical and operational successes. Unfortunately, customer spending constraints of limited near-term activity to three rig, short of the target seven rigs. Under utilization of assets deployed for this project continues to be a near-term drag on profitability.Turning to the Middle East Asia Pacific region, revenues decreased 16% from year-ago levels across all geomarkets with the exception of two. Strong completion system sales in Southeast Asia and artificial lift sales in North Asia supported improved results in these geomarkets compared to a year ago. Year-over-year revenue declines were greatest in the Saudi, Egypt and Indonesian geomarkets. Sequentially, revenues increased 2% as increased revenues in North Asia from artificial lift from completion systems in Southeast Asia and Egypt, and drilling fluid sales in Indonesia, offset lower revenues from the Saudi and India geomarket.Operating profit in the Middle East and Asia Pacific region was 12% in the fourth quarter compared to 23% in the year ago quarter and 12% in the third quarter. A Baker Hughes Centrilift ESP recently set a record in Egypt's Western Desert, completing 10 years of service. Over its life, the pump lifter over 360,000 barrels of oil. Saudi Aramco has awarded Baker Hughes a two-year contract for two fit-for-purpose under-balanced coil tubing drilling packages designed to re-enter existing wells in the gas fields of southern Saudi Arabia. We will provide project management oversight and downhole drilling and completion services including the industry leading CoilTrak, steerable drilling system deployed on coil tubing. Operations are set to begin in the second quarter of this year.Turning to Europe, Africa, Russia and the Caspian. Revenue declined 12% year-over-year in the region as higher revenues from directional drilling, drilling fluids and completions in Norway, directional drilling wirelining completions in Nigeria and strong directional drilling sales in the sub-Saharan geomarket were offset by lower activity in revenues from other geomarkets in the region. The largest year-on-year revenue declines occurred in the Russia, U.K. in Angola geomarkets. Sequentially, revenue was up 11% supported by increases in directional drilling and completion sales in Norway, improved wireline revenue and shipments of completions equipment in Nigeria, sales of bits and completions equipment in Libya and directional drilling and completion systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Our operating profit for the Europe, Africa, Russia and Caspian region was 16% in the fourth quarter down from 22% in the year ago quarter and up from 14% in the prior quarter.Statoil has awarded Baker Hughes' extensions on two contracts in Norway. The contracts are for the provision of drill bits, directional drilling, formation evaluation and related services on 10 to 12 rigs operating in multiple fields offshore Norway. Valued at approximately $270 million, the award extends the contracts through October 2012. In Russia, we awarded contracts for ESP deliveries in 2010 that exceed our total for 2009. Including all of [indiscernible] western ESP award for 2010 and for the third day running, all of Bancorp's ESP needs.Building on this success, we are looking forward to the launch of Ultra-R [ph], a new low-cost yet highly reliable motor, designed specifically for the Russian market. Baker Hughes [indiscernible] AzTrak combined with our third generation AutoTrak system is redefining what's possible in the North Sea. In the fourth quarter, this combination precisely geosteered the well bore through the reservoir all the while staying within six to eight feet from a steeply dipping shale formation.This technology enables Baker Hughes to achieve critical steering control at high build rates with minimum tortuosity and chalk formations while drilling sidetracks and avoiding a myriad of previously drilled wells. Now turning to North America, revenue in the fourth quarter was down 37% in comparison to the year ago quarter but increased 9% sequentially, on increased activity both on land and in the Gulf of Mexico. The North American profit margin was 10% in the fourth quarter down from 24% in the year-ago quarter and up from 7% in Q3 2009.Baker Hughes' drilling and evaluation technology is being used on critical wells throughout the North American basins. For example, in California, AzTrak was used in conjunction with AutoTrak to place a wellbore precisely in the reservoir's sweet spot, just a few feet from the cap rock in a mature oilfield resulting in a's tripling of expected production. And in the Gulf of Mexico, Baker Hughes provided a variety of technologies to enable McMoran to drill and evaluate the recent Davey Jones ultra-deep discovery. HPHT logging tools, Magna Tech drilling fluids, Long-life INTEQ motors, Quantec PDC bits and a Baker oil tools with stock liner system all contributed to the significant achievement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chad."

Overall I'm pleased with quarter four. We saw a significant improvement for both the North America and the International geomarkets, and we continue to make progress in many different fronts.Q4 was our second quarter of consecutive improvement in North America as we benefited from higher levels of activity. While the price environment did not change significantly from the third quarter, higher activity on the heels of aggressive cost cutting earlier in the year led to improved profitability and attracted incrementals. Internationally, we did see sequential improvement in our geomarket operations although we still have room for improvement. In the Latin America region, our revenues were down to strongly from Q3 levels and despite lower than anticipated activity levels in Mexico, our profitability improved as we expected it would. We also saw higher revenue in the Eastern Hemisphere geomarkets and a rebound in the profitability of our Europe, Africa, Russia and Caspian region. During the quarter, we continue to fine tune our new organization structure. I continue to be very encouraged by the feedback that I'm receiving from both our customers as well as from our employees. The new organization continued to mature in the fourth quarter, contributing to the improved results, and we expect this new organization to deliver on its promise of increased share and long-term profitable growth as we move through 2010.We're making significant progress towards closing the BJ acquisition and we still anticipate a first quarter closing. Integration teams of both companies have made excellent progress and will be ready upon closing so we can effectively integrate BJ Services into Baker Hughes and implement our operational plan.Looking forward, we are encouraged by the improving rig count in North America. Since the end of the third quarter, the gas rig count has increased to 123 rigs or 17%, with 80% of the activity related to the unconventional shale play. Similarly, the oil rig count is up 140 rigs or 47%, with 80% of activity in the Permian and Williston basins. In some areas of the U.S., where we are again starting to hire, strengthened as the result of strengthening demand for our products and services. And as this demand expands and leads to improved capacity utilization, we will be able to implement price increases.  Obviously, we'll keep our eye on North American gas supply and what this could mean in the second half of this year with regards to land and gas drilling. In the Gulf of Mexico, the lower tertiary play continues to look promising and the recent developments indicate strong potential in the deep gas plays such as McMoran Davey Jones prospects. During the fourth quarter, two new build deepwater rigs entered the market, and we expect an additional nine rigs to enter the Gulf of Mexico by year end 2010. Our product line and service capabilities are well suited to the deep gas and deepwater markets, and we've increased market share on new builds coming into the market.We have seen improvement in the Canadian rig count, and we're well positioned for both the emerging shale plays in the Montney and Horn River areas and the current oil sands activity with the recent openings of our new Fort McMurray and the Duke facilities. We see oil directed activity continuing as long as oil prices remain around current levels, thus supporting drilling in both North America and the international markets. Outside of North America, we look for overall overactivity to improve and for our customer spending to increase from 2009 levels. However, price realizations and profitability will continue to be impacted by contracts that were negotiated in 2009.In closing, 2009 was a year of significant change for the industry and for Baker Hughes as well. Our industry is faced with a significant decline in North American activity, and we reacted accordingly emerging with a leaner, more focused organization. We also set a new course for the company by implementing a new geomarket structure that is improving our market visibility, our efficiency and our customer intimacy. Our supply chain initiatives and outsourcing programs, we are driving efficiency throughout the organization, which will enhance our profitability. And last, by setting the motion in the acquisition of BJ Services, will add the portfolio breadth and capabilities that will make us a much stronger competitor in both the North America and international markets. Finally, I do know that many of our employees listen to these calls, I just want to take a minute and thank them for their efforts in Q4. I know that without a doubt, they put in a lot of hours, especially over the year end holiday season in order to get the orders booked and out the door prior to the year end close. So just a quick note of thanks to them. And Gary, let's go ahead and open up for questions."

So I think bits was typically used, reaction will be one of the ones to lead when it goes down. Our C&P side of the business continues to held up fairly well. They're not hit as hard as D&E so that will slowly come back in pricing as it tightens. Some on the D&E side, some of the directional drilling and WD-type work is becoming much more critical with these horizontal wells. So I think that we're going to start seeing that does kind of leave the big players with a better chance to start improving pricing as time goes on. I would say that's kind of the breakdown."

I think there are a lot of moving parts to look at, a lot of factors that play in to Q1. Typically, we usually have a stronger fourth quarter. We described that with the pull [ph] forward revenue in the press release, but there are a number of other things. We had a $0.01 of auction rate securities gain which won't repeat. The Venezuela devaluation, preliminarily, our estimates, that could cost us a $0.01. Not a big move, the good thing is we managed that pretty well. And then when you think about what's happening out in the international regions, we had a particularly strong Norway in Q4, and we wouldn't expect that to necessarily beaten Q1, so we see some season pullback in Norway. So in the Urk region, that's a driver. In the Middle East, you've got start-up costs. Mark mentioned the coil tubing contract in Saudi, and we're just getting that geared up, so we're certainly going to incur the cost and the revenues that follow. So typical pattern there with a new project. Also, we've got start-up cost in Iraq. We're making good progress there in getting people on the ground and getting facilities built and getting permits, and that's taking some money, and again, the revenues will follow later in the year. Heading south, Mexico, everybody's talked about the uncertainty in Mexico, and we have our own particular uncertainty in addition to ATG, which is just how many rigs we get on in Alma, and that can swing things quite a bit in Latin America. And then finally, you have the unpredictable weather that could hit you in Q1, particularly in Russia in the North Sea, which we haven't factored in to any of these.  And there's one more in there as well, Bill, is the year-on-year change in pricing international. A lot of those contracts negotiated in 2009, we're going to see the results of some of that in 2010, which I think is what our peers are saying as well."

So they're just a performance-driven organization looking at greater penetration, non-productive time they watch very closely. This recent well that Martin referred in his discussion was, I think it's 37% improvement in drilling time versus the previous well. So they just really build on -- and there's a lot of feedback that comes back and forth between our company and theirs regarding just continuous improvement. Martin mentioned the BEACON Center. So those are live, that's live data being sent back into their office and engineered working to try to just improve.

That's not to say though that on the C&P side we have anything to give up on. Geographically, we're happy with our present situation in Mexico. I think a small presence in the ATG work is turning out to not be a bad thing, and certainly where we are working there we're with the local companies. I don't foresee any rig reduction for the local companies and the ATG. And that is our client, if you will. And while the utilization offshore is not great, it's giving us good scale presence, which we didn't have before. And in North America, that's our bread and butter, we have a very strong brand.

And when I asked the question, well how much of that would you have -- and they talked to the bundled services. And I said, how much of that would you have had anyway? Hughes Christensen, or in INTEQ, or whatever would've won just because of the relationship with a client. And they knew the number, they said 71 million. The 29 additional million was awarded because we asked -- since when we got the debt, why don't we get the fluids too because they worked well together. So again, it's that opening comment when I said the sell teams, it's one of the exciting parts about this organization. They are really out there working together. People selling drilling fluids jobs and drilling fluids people selling INTEQ jobs and of course they can't answer all the technical questions but they get in the door and say, ""we can also do this for you.""

Q1 was a good quarter for Baker Hughes. We delivered strong results in North America, with the increase in drilling activity and the benefits of a lean organization drove the improvement in our operating margin",476,"Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was a good quarter for Baker Hughes. We delivered strong results in North America, with the increase in drilling activity and the benefits of a lean organization drove the improvement in our operating margins. And I have to say as a credit to our North America geomarket and management team that they delivered this margin improvement without significant price increases in the quarter. Their focus on individual basins rather than discrete product lines is beginning to deliver share gains in North America. International activity is showing signs of improvement. It's driven by steady oil prices and the need to offset declines and to meet the demand from China and India. And over the last several quarters, our geomarket organization has delivered what we call stable market share, laying the foundation for future market share gains. In many international markets, we continue to face price pressure, resulting from contract negotiations and tenders that were awarded in 2009. In addition, competition for market share is also contributing to lower pricing. However, we believe that our international operating margins reached a bottom in Q1. Margin improvement will be an important area of focus for our geomarkets in 2010. We expect margins to show very solid improvement in the second half of the year.
Last week, we closed on the acquisition of BJ Services and the integration of the two companies' international operations has already begun. For example, we are already beginning to mobilize coil tubing and C-manning units [ph] into our base in Iraq, which will be open by the end of June. As noted in the past, the acquisition of BJ Services is significant for Baker Hughes as it addresses a major gap in our product portfolio. It enhances our ability to deliver integrated operations and although it increases our exposure to North America, it also significantly enhances our international growth opportunities.
In conjunction with the acquisition, we have agreed to sell two vessels and related assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Until that sale is complete, we are required to operate Baker Hughes and BJ Services U.S. operations separately. We expect the sale of these vessels to be completed in the next few months when we've experienced a high-level interest in these assets. We look forward to realizing the full potential that will come from combination of the two companies.
To manage the standalone U.S. business during the divestiture period, and to help quickly integrate the international portion of BJ, we have appointed Andy O'Donnell as President of BJ Services. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Peter, for a financial review and then Martin, for an operational review and I'll come back later with some closing comments about what we see for future activity and then we’ll open it up later for Q&A. Peter?"

This morning, we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $129 million or $0.41 per share. This compares to $0.63 per share a year ago and $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Q1 revenue was $2.5 billion, down 5% or $129 millio",1051,"Thanks, Chad. This morning, we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $129 million or $0.41 per share. This compares to $0.63 per share a year ago and $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Q1 revenue was $2.5 billion, down 5% or $129 million year-over-year and up 5% or $110 million sequentially. Looking at quarterly comparisons, our North American revenue was $1 billion in the first quarter, down 5% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially. Revenue outside of North America was $1.5 billion in the first quarter, also down 5% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially.
In recent quarters, we have provided a breakdown of costs associated reorganization, severance and increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts, due to the magnitude of these event-driven charges. For the first quarter, these expenses were not significant. We don't believe it is necessary to highlight them as unusual in their magnitude. However, we will continue to highlight acquisition-related costs, as they will be significant in the second quarter.
Acquisition related costs in Q1 were $10 million or $0.02 per share. As has been our practice, for the balance of our comments this morning, references to operating profit and operating profit margins will be on this adjusted basis. So our oil field operating margin for the first quarter was 11%, down from 12% in the fourth quarter. North American margin was particularly strong, with a sequential incremental margin of 45%. Before I cover sequential and year-on-year bridges, I want to highlight a change that we have made in accounting for certain corporate costs. In the first quarter and in the future, we are reallocating certain costs from corporate to operations, who are most directly responsible for managing these costs. In Q1, our corporate costs were $49 million compared to $76 million recorded in Q4. Q2 corporate costs for Baker Hughes standalone, are expected to increase to about $55 million. To help you evaluate our earnings per share in the first quarter, I’ll review the significant items that bridges sequential and year-ago quarters to the first quarter EPS of $0.41. In Q4 2009, our U.S. GAAP net income per share was $0.27. From this $0.27, subtract $0.01 for the net impact of lower acquisition related charges, higher tax rate and higher share count compared to Q4 and to account for the non-recurrence of the gain on investments in the fourth quarter, add $0.02 for lower net interest expense. We had a favorable change in the fair value of one of our interest rate swaps, add $0.05 for lower recorded corporate expense, add $0.15 for increased profits in North America, subtract $0.08 for decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.41 we're reporting for the first quarter. 
Now bridging from the year-ago quarter, U.S. GAAP net income per share of $0.63 we reported in the first quarter of 2009, add $0.02 as a result of lower recorded corporate expense. The impact of acquisition-related costs this quarter compared to the year-ago quarter was offset by lower interest expense, subtract $0.03 for a higher tax rate and share count compared to the year-ago quarter, add $0.05 for increased profits in North America and subtract $0.26 for decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.41 we are recording for the first quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter end, our total debt was $2 billion. This was $200 million higher than year end because we issued commercial paper in advance of funding the BJ Services transaction. Our long-term debt-to-cap ratio was 20%. We had cash of $1.6 billion and our net debt was $406 million, and our net debt-to-cap ratio was 4%. After quarter-end, we used $480 million in cash and issued $320 million of commercial paper in total to fund the $800 million cash portion of the BJ transaction. We also issued 118 million shares of stock at $51.24 per share. Our current outstanding share count is 430 million shares and the average share count for Q2 is expected to be approximately 391 million shares. Our combined pro forma total debt is about $2.7 billion and our pro forma total debt-to-cap ratio is 17% immediately following the merger.
We inherited $500 million in debt from BJ Services, comprised of two $250 million bond issues, which mature in 2011 and 2018. Our long-term debt, including the two BJ bond issues, which we have guaranteed, is rated A by S&P and AA by Moody's. Having closed the acquisition of BJ Services last week, today we have $1.7 billion of committed credit facilities consisting of a new three-year $1.2 billion facility, accessible through March 2013 and our existing $500 million facility, accessible through July 2012.
Last, a few thoughts on guidance for the second quarter and the balance of the year. I'm sure there are lots of questions regarding the pro forma impacts and the earnings outlook of the combined company. BJ Services has informed us that their revenue for the quarter ended March 31, was approximately $1.1 billion and their pretax profit was approximately $59 million, excluding acquisition-related charges of $31 million, and equipment partnership liquidation of $60 million and a charge for the Venezuela devaluation of about $9 million. 
Looking forward to Q2, we believe that operating EPS on a combined basis will be in the low $0.40 range, including the impact of the spring break up in Canada, Gulf of Mexico issues, and the dilutive impact of a higher share count. This does not include incremental depreciation and amortization, which may result from purchase price accounting, which we are not yet in a position to quantify. We also feel very confident in our ability to achieve $75 million in cost synergies over the next four quarters and $150 million in cost synergies over the subsequent four quarters. We also expect that our combined CapEx spending for calendar 2010 will be in a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. We see no material impact to the combined company of the Gulf of Mexico asset package divestiture. Finally, we now expect about $225 million to $235 million in acquisition-related charges to be accrued in Q2, consisting of changing control payments and professional fees. I'll now turn the call over to Martin who will highlight our geographical results. Martin?"
19007,100002554,59357,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-04-2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Peter. I'll start with a review of our international operations. The Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian region exhibited good revenue performance, supported by increases in directional drilling and fluid sales in the North Sea, completions in wireline",1550,"Thanks, Peter. I'll start with a review of our international operations. The Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian region exhibited good revenue performance, supported by increases in directional drilling and fluid sales in the North Sea, completions in wireline activity in Sub-Sahara Africa, completion sales in Nigeria and wireline and completion sales in the North Africa geomarket. In addition, strong artificial list sales in Russia more than offset the impact of unfavorable weather during the quarter. As a result, revenue was up 3% sequentially. Operating profit margin for the Europe Africa Russia Caspian region was 11% in the first quarter, down from 16% in the prior quarter. In Denmark, Baker Hughes recently helped Maersk set a new Danish record by drilling a well through a measured depth of 31,140 feet. In conjunction with extended reach drilling in this challenging environment, Baker Hughes also supplied LWD evaluation services and tried cone and PDC drill bits. The well has been completed using a Baker Hughes reactive element packer, the first deployment of this application in Denmark.
Our technology is helping operators save valuable rig time as well. We enabled a North Sea operator to abandon a well in just one run, resulting in time savings of approximately six days over the previous test run. New cutter technology resulted in 150% improvement over conventional cutters and a Baker Hughes senteal [ph] 24:05 , which is a downhole data acquisition tool, provided real time data, allowing the operator to react to changes in downhole pressure during the milling process.
Turning to the Middle East Asia Pacific region, revenue increased in the Egypt and Australasia geomarkets. The increase in Egypt was led by the completion, directional drilling and drill bit product lines and by fluids and directional drilling in Australasia. In total, revenue was down 5% for the region. Operating profit in the Middle East Asia Pacific region was 7% in the first quarter, compared to 12% in the fourth quarter. Operating profit in the first quarter was negatively impacted by prices negotiated on tenders awarded earlier in 2009 and by competition for market share, which resulted in aggressive pricing across that region.
During the quarter, Baker Hughes won a contract in Iraq to supply ESPs for 162 wells in the Rumailah Field and we expect that our new base in Rumailah will be ready for occupancy by the end of the second quarter. In Saudi Arabia, Baker Hughes installed the Middle East region's first open-hole, multistage, Frac-Point completion in a Saudi Aramco gas field. The market for this technology is expected to expand in the region as our clients increasingly target lower permeability reservoirs. Also, in Saudi Arabia, we are now drilling the water ejection wells for the Manethra project. As we have previously highlighted, our proprietary technology is critical for the precise placement of these wells above the tarmap, which is in turn, critical for optimal pressure maintenance as the field is eventually produced. The first well was recently completed with the entire six inch section of over 5,000 feet being drilled in one single run. We offer the industry's only technical solution for the hole size being drilled and we expect our success will lead to additional opportunities for future injection wells Manethra.
And in Malaysia, Baker Hughes deployed the test track formation pressure-while-drilling tool for an operator in the Key Cay [ph] field, the first oil producing Deepwater filled in Malaysia. Integrated in an auto track rotary steerable bottomhole assembly, complemented by other formation evaluation tools, the test track obtained 31 pressure readings in Key Cay’s [ph] thin bedded sand shale reservoir.
Latin America revenue decreased 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 as revenue declined in all geomarkets with the exception of Mexico Central America, where revenue increased for the directional drilling wireline and artificial lift product lines. Sequential revenue declines reflect high levels of seasonal ESP sales in the fourth quarter, particularly in the Brazil and Andean geomarkets that did not reoccur in the first quarter. The operating profit margin in Latin America for the first quarter was a disappointing 3%, down from 9% in the prior quarter. Profitability in the quarter was impacted by a number of factors including a less favorable activity mix in Brazil, as rigs shifted from drilling to workover and by the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar, which had an $8 million pretax impact in Q1. In the first quarter, we operated on an average of two rigs in the Litoral Tabasco Marine project. We anticipate the award of additional offshore rigs in the second half of the year. This should lead to improved profitability, however we expected this contract will have a negative impact on earnings throughout Q2. Activity in the ATG fields, where we have been providing bundled services for local contractors, continued to slow in the first quarter. The pricing environment has turned negative due to excess capacity. However, during the quarter, we did execute our contract with PEMEX for our Koryo [ph] project, part of the ATG labs program. We have begun mobilizing under this integrated field development contract, which will enable Baker Hughes to showcase applications of leading edge technologies to improve production in the field. We had several technical achievements in Latin America during the quarter. Offshore Brazil, Baker Hughes successfully ran the industry's first large diameter sidewall coring tool in response to an operator's request to a sidewall core samples 1.5 inches in diameter and greater than 2 inches in length. The client requested 90 cores and our Baker Hughes MaxCor delivered 94 cores in four runs. In a subsequent run at another exploration area, MaxCor successfully delivered 52 core samples in only two runs. The larger diameter core gives you about three times the volume in each sample [audio gap] complex reservoir such as the pre-salt, a larger sample is critical for determining key reservoir properties.
In Columbia, Baker Hughes successfully drilled and completed the industry's first multi-lateral well drilled using our thru-tubing rotary drilling technology, using Baker Hughes' downhole motors, completions technology and hedgehog bits several re-entry wells were drilled with challenging directional drilling requirements including dog lake severities between 15 degrees and 46 degrees per 100 feet. Hedgehog bit performance included one successful run that replaced seven tri-cone runs.
Now turning to North America, revenue increased sequentially, driven by increased rig activity in all geomarkets. U.S. land revenue was up sequentially, driven by a 21% increase in rig count and a 28% sequential growth of horizontal drilling, which now accounts for nearly half of the rigs running today. Horizontal drilling activity is associated with higher service and technology intensity as laterals increase in length and the number of frac stages increased. Looking more closely at gas activity, 90% of the growth in the gas rig count from the June 2009 trough has been in the horizontal gas plays, with the Haynesville, the Anadarko, the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford accounting for over 87% of the total increase. As for oil activity, 76% of the increase in oil rig count upped the June 2009 bottom, has been in the Wollaston basin, in which complex horizontal wells are being drilled in the Permian Basin which has been primarily vertical. In the Wollaston basin, oil directed horizontal drilling increased 43% in the first quarter compared to fourth quarter and the use of horizontal wells to tap oil formation in the Permian Basin is also increased. This is driving continued demand for high-end completion technologies such as our Frac-Point completion systems and increased use of Rotary steerable systems.
The North American operating profit margin was 15% in the first quarter, up from 10% in the fourth quarter. While capacity is tightening across multiple product lines, overall pricing did not increase measurably in the quarter. Improved profitability was the result of higher activity levels and cost-cutting measures we implemented last year. During the quarter, VS Fusion, a bore hole seismic processing joint venture between Baker Hughes and CGGVeritas, completed one of the largest IntelliFrac micro seismic hydraulic fracturing monitor surveys ever undertaken. The survey for an operator in Canada's foreign River basin deployed Baker Hughes' geophone string simultaneously in two observation wells for over 30 days. Micro seismic events were recorded for hydraulic stimulations in 13 well bores adjacent to the observation wells. In all, over 75 separate BJ Service hydraulic stimulations were recorded. Real-time display of the micro seismic events at the well site and the customer’s offices was used to make real-time changes to the fracturing program. In Alaska, Baker Hughes has recently drilled and completed a well on the North Slope in Alaska that set several coiled tubing drilling records, with a total depth of 22,400 feet. This was the deepest open-hole sidetrack ever completed with coil-tubing drilling. And in the quarter Baker Hughes continued to expand its presence in technology offering in Canada's heavy oil projects. In the first quarter, Baker Hughes was awarded 32 SAGD ESP production wells for several operators. We are seeing expanded use of ESP systems in the SAGD market for applications such as pumping water to feed steam generation plants. We have captured over a third of the market for extreme temperature ESP systems and 70% of the SAGD chemical market. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad."

So as I stated earlier overall, we're pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter. Our North America operation delivered very strong results relative to competition and while our international markets were challenged by pricing pressures, we believe margins will improve in the second half of the year. Looking forward in the U.S., there are many positives. Oil activity has been robust. Last week, the oil rig count was 513 and that's up 23% from year end. We’re confident that oil directed drilling activity will continue at current price levels and are forecasting that the oil rig count will average about 570 rigs in the second half of the year. The oil directed drilling has been split between vertical drilling and the Permian and service intents of horizontal multi-laterals and multi-stage fracing in the Bakken. We see a possibility for more technologically sophisticated oil directed drilling in other areas as well, as operators are looking to develop new plays in the Eagle Ford and even the older plays in the Permian Basin.
The gas rig count has increased 26% from the year-end levels and last week stood at 958 rigs. Gas activity is ahead of where we thought it might have been in May. The mixed change to long horizontal and multi-stage fracing favors Baker Hughes in our new acquisition. Demand for natural gas could still surprise us. Summer isn’t here and industrial demand could react favorably to low natural gas prices thus far in demand. Looking forward, we expect the gas recount to peak in Q2 and show a modest decline in the second half of 2010, averaging 765 rigs for the second half of the year and 840 rigs for 2010, as a whole. So for the year, we see the gas rig count being up 5% year-on-year.
The increase in oil activity in the second half of the year will partially offset the decline in gas directed activity. For 2010 as a whole, we see the oil rig count up about 88%. So combine in total, we see the U.S. rig count up 26% or about 1,089 rigs to 1,370 or up 281 rigs. In Canada, the spring breakup is well underway and like our drilling in evaluation product lines, the BJ Services product lines are particularly impacted by the breakup. As in the past, we expect our chemicals and artificial lift product lines to remain fairly resilient. Outside North America, we expect international EMP spending will continue to increase, supported by high oil prices and the need to offset production declines and meet demand in China and India. In the Middle East Asia Pacific region, we look for a modest increase in rig activity in the second half of the year. Price pressures should ease and our focus will be on margin improvement. There has been much discussion recently about the outlook for Iraq, so I’m going to share our view. The long-term potential in Iraq is significant and we were well-positioned to address opportunities as they rise. As Martin mentioned earlier, our base in Rumailah will be open by the end of the second quarter and we have been awarded a significant contract for delivery of ESP systems. Pricing on recent industry contract awards for other services has been fairly aggressive, leading to what we consider below-average margins. As non-North America activity increases beginning the second half of this year, and accelerates into 2011, we would anticipate that Iraqi pricing for future contracts could firm as Service Company resources begin to become more stretched. Within our Europe Africa Russia Caspian region, we see activity in the North Sea being supported by strong activity in the Norwegian sector. We see stable activity in West Africa, growth in sub-Sahara Africa and a slow recovery in North Africa. Activity in the Russian Caspian region will increase, coming off a very seasonal low of the first quarter. And in Latin America, we expect activity to increase in Brazil and the Andean region. In Mexico, activity will increase, as Martin mentioned, in the back half of the year as the ATG lab work increases and the longer term in Mexico, we look for increased offshore activity. We do not expect near-term improvement in the outlook for Venezuela. So before we open it up for Q&A, I want to take this opportunity to welcome the former shareholders, as well as the employees of BJ Services and I think it’s obvious to say to that we've been anxiously waiting for this day for quite some time and also needless to say, we're pretty excited about getting started and being able to tackle some of the tremendous opportunities that we see in front of us in the second half of 2010.

So, that additional revenue that we will get out of BJ will help us work some of those costs and I think that's why we're feeling pretty good about the second half of the year and into 2011."

So the $75 million in the next four quarters, most of that is just coming out of some corporate expenses that you would expect, you don't have the Board of Directors anymore. We'll combine our insurance and things like that, things that are mainly corporate in nature and that's already baked into their forward forecasting. If anything, we'd hope to exceed that but right now, that's the number we're sticking to and it looks very solid. And the additional 75 that comes after that in the following year is really when you start looking at your operating bases around the world and consolidation of various offices and real estate that sort of thing and back-office functions. That takes a little bit more work. It doesn't start day one and we've got pretty concrete plans for that built in as well and again, the 75 to 150 doesn't include any revenue synergies at all, which those come contract by contract.

I think the region in the geomarket managers are just that much more focused on the customer, that much more aggressive in terms of winning contracts. So I would have to say, that because of the geomarket and region structure right now, we're just being more responsive in being there and we're starting to see, again more cross-product line contracts, where we've got the bit, where we've got the bottom hole assembly and now we get awarded the Drilling Fluids just because it's a Baker Hughes team going in to try to get the works. I think that's helped us in these last couple three quarters. One of the reasons why we're excited about getting BJ onboard, being able to throw in another significant part of the market there that works very closely with our guys."

Q1 was a good quarter for Baker Hughes. We delivered strong results in North America, with the increase in drilling activity and the benefits of a lean organization drove the improvement in our operating margins. And I have to say as a credit to our North America geomarket and management team that they delivered this margin improvement without significant price increases in the quarter. Their focus on individual basins rather than discrete product lines is beginning to deliver share gains in North America. International activity is showing signs of improvement. It's driven by steady oil prices and the need to offset declines and to meet the demand from China and India. And over the last several quarters, our geomarket organization has delivered what we call stable market share, laying the foundation for future market share gains. In many international markets, we continue to face price pressure, resulting from contract negotiations and tenders that were awarded in 2009. In addition, competition for market share is also contributing to lower pricing. However, we believe that our international operating margins reached a bottom in Q1. Margin improvement will be an important area of focus for our geomarkets in 2010. We expect margins to show very solid improvement in the second half of the year.
Last week, we closed on the acquisition of BJ Services and the integration of the two companies' international operations has already begun. For example, we are already beginning to mobilize coil tubing and C-manning units [ph] into our base in Iraq, which will be open by the end of June. As noted in the past, the acquisition of BJ Services is significant for Baker Hughes as it addresses a major gap in our product portfolio. It enhances our ability to deliver integrated operations and although it increases our exposure to North America, it also significantly enhances our international growth opportunities.
In conjunction with the acquisition, we have agreed to sell two vessels and related assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Until that sale is complete, we are required to operate Baker Hughes and BJ Services U.S. operations separately. We expect the sale of these vessels to be completed in the next few months when we've experienced a high-level interest in these assets. We look forward to realizing the full potential that will come from combination of the two companies.
To manage the standalone U.S. business during the divestiture period, and to help quickly integrate the international portion of BJ, we have appointed Andy O'Donnell as President of BJ Services. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Peter, for a financial review and then Martin, for an operational review and I'll come back later with some closing comments about what we see for future activity and then we’ll open it up later for Q&A.

This morning, we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $129 million or $0.41 per share. This compares to $0.63 per share a year ago and $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009.

This compares to $0.63 per share a year ago and $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Q1 revenue was $2.5 billion, down 5% or $129 million year-over-year and up 5% or $110 million sequentially. Looking at quarterly comparisons, our North American revenue was $1 billion in the first quarter, down 5% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially. Revenue outside of North America was $1.5 billion in the first quarter, also down 5% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially.
In recent quarters, we have provided a breakdown of costs associated reorganization, severance and increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts, due to the magnitude of these event-driven charges. For the first quarter, these expenses were not significant. We don't believe it is necessary to highlight them as unusual in their magnitude. However, we will continue to highlight acquisition-related costs, as they will be significant in the second quarter.
Acquisition related costs in Q1 were $10 million or $0.02 per share. As has been our practice, for the balance of our comments this morning, references to operating profit and operating profit margins will be on this adjusted basis. So our oil field operating margin for the first quarter was 11%, down from 12% in the fourth quarter. North American margin was particularly strong, with a sequential incremental margin of 45%. Before I cover sequential and year-on-year bridges, I want to highlight a change that we have made in accounting for certain corporate costs. In the first quarter and in the future, we are reallocating certain costs from corporate to operations, who are most directly responsible for managing these costs. In Q1, our corporate costs were $49 million compared to $76 million recorded in Q4. Q2 corporate costs for Baker Hughes standalone, are expected to increase to about $55 million. To help you evaluate our earnings per share in the first quarter, I’ll review the significant items that bridges sequential and year-ago quarters to the first quarter EPS of $0.41. In Q4 2009, our U.S. GAAP net income per share was $0.27. From this $0.27, subtract $0.01 for the net impact of lower acquisition related charges, higher tax rate and higher share count compared to Q4 and to account for the non-recurrence of the gain on investments in the fourth quarter, add $0.02 for lower net interest expense. We had a favorable change in the fair value of one of our interest rate swaps, add $0.05 for lower recorded corporate expense, add $0.15 for increased profits in North America, subtract $0.08 for decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.41 we're reporting for the first quarter. 
Now bridging from the year-ago quarter, U.S. GAAP net income per share of $0.63 we reported in the first quarter of 2009, add $0.02 as a result of lower recorded corporate expense. The impact of acquisition-related costs this quarter compared to the year-ago quarter was offset by lower interest expense, subtract $0.03 for a higher tax rate and share count compared to the year-ago quarter, add $0.05 for increased profits in North America and subtract $0.26 for decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.41 we are recording for the first quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter end, our total debt was $2 billion. This was $200 million higher than year end because we issued commercial paper in advance of funding the BJ Services transaction. Our long-term debt-to-cap ratio was 20%. We had cash of $1.6 billion and our net debt was $406 million, and our net debt-to-cap ratio was 4%. After quarter-end, we used $480 million in cash and issued $320 million of commercial paper in total to fund the $800 million cash portion of the BJ transaction. We also issued 118 million shares of stock at $51.24 per share. Our current outstanding share count is 430 million shares and the average share count for Q2 is expected to be approximately 391 million shares. Our combined pro forma total debt is about $2.7 billion and our pro forma total debt-to-cap ratio is 17% immediately following the merger.
We inherited $500 million in debt from BJ Services, comprised of two $250 million bond issues, which mature in 2011 and 2018. Our long-term debt, including the two BJ bond issues, which we have guaranteed, is rated A by S&P and AA by Moody's. Having closed the acquisition of BJ Services last week, today we have $1.7 billion of committed credit facilities consisting of a new three-year $1.2 billion facility, accessible through March 2013 and our existing $500 million facility, accessible through July 2012.
Last, a few thoughts on guidance for the second quarter and the balance of the year. I'm sure there are lots of questions regarding the pro forma impacts and the earnings outlook of the combined company. BJ Services has informed us that their revenue for the quarter ended March 31, was approximately $1.1 billion and their pretax profit was approximately $59 million, excluding acquisition-related charges of $31 million, and equipment partnership liquidation of $60 million and a charge for the Venezuela devaluation of about $9 million. 
Looking forward to Q2, we believe that operating EPS on a combined basis will be in the low $0.40 range, including the impact of the spring break up in Canada, Gulf of Mexico issues, and the dilutive impact of a higher share count. This does not include incremental depreciation and amortization, which may result from purchase price accounting, which we are not yet in a position to quantify. We also feel very confident in our ability to achieve $75 million in cost synergies over the next four quarters and $150 million in cost synergies over the subsequent four quarters. We also expect that our combined CapEx spending for calendar 2010 will be in a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. We see no material impact to the combined company of the Gulf of Mexico asset package divestiture. Finally, we now expect about $225 million to $235 million in acquisition-related charges to be accrued in Q2, consisting of changing control payments and professional fees. I'll now turn the call over to Martin who will highlight our geographical results. Martin?

I'll start with a review of our international operations. The Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian region exhibited good revenue performance, supported by increases in directional drilling and fluid sales in the North Sea, completions in wireline activity in Sub-Sahara Africa, completion sales in Nigeria and wireline and completion sales in the North Africa geomarket. In addition, strong artificial list sales in Russia more than offset the impact of unfavorable weather during the quarter. As a result, revenue was up 3% sequentially. Operating profit margin for the Europe Africa Russia Caspian region was 11% in the first quarter, down from 16% in the prior quarter. In Denmark, Baker Hughes recently helped Maersk set a new Danish record by drilling a well through a measured depth of 31,140 feet. In conjunction with extended reach drilling in this challenging environment, Baker Hughes also supplied LWD evaluation services and tried cone and PDC drill bits. The well has been completed using a Baker Hughes reactive element packer, the first deployment of this application in Denmark.
Our technology is helping operators save valuable rig time as well. We enabled a North Sea operator to abandon a well in just one run, resulting in time savings of approximately six days over the previous test run. New cutter technology resulted in 150% improvement over conventional cutters and a Baker Hughes senteal [ph] 24:05 , which is a downhole data acquisition tool, provided real time data, allowing the operator to react to changes in downhole pressure during the milling process.
Turning to the Middle East Asia Pacific region, revenue increased in the Egypt and Australasia geomarkets. The increase in Egypt was led by the completion, directional drilling and drill bit product lines and by fluids and directional drilling in Australasia. In total, revenue was down 5% for the region. Operating profit in the Middle East Asia Pacific region was 7% in the first quarter, compared to 12% in the fourth quarter. Operating profit in the first quarter was negatively impacted by prices negotiated on tenders awarded earlier in 2009 and by competition for market share, which resulted in aggressive pricing across that region.
During the quarter, Baker Hughes won a contract in Iraq to supply ESPs for 162 wells in the Rumailah Field and we expect that our new base in Rumailah will be ready for occupancy by the end of the second quarter. In Saudi Arabia, Baker Hughes installed the Middle East region's first open-hole, multistage, Frac-Point completion in a Saudi Aramco gas field. The market for this technology is expected to expand in the region as our clients increasingly target lower permeability reservoirs. Also, in Saudi Arabia, we are now drilling the water ejection wells for the Manethra project. As we have previously highlighted, our proprietary technology is critical for the precise placement of these wells above the tarmap, which is in turn, critical for optimal pressure maintenance as the field is eventually produced. The first well was recently completed with the entire six inch section of over 5,000 feet being drilled in one single run. We offer the industry's only technical solution for the hole size being drilled and we expect our success will lead to additional opportunities for future injection wells Manethra.
And in Malaysia, Baker Hughes deployed the test track formation pressure-while-drilling tool for an operator in the Key Cay [ph] field, the first oil producing Deepwater filled in Malaysia. Integrated in an auto track rotary steerable bottomhole assembly, complemented by other formation evaluation tools, the test track obtained 31 pressure readings in Key Cay’s [ph] thin bedded sand shale reservoir.
Latin America revenue decreased 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 as revenue declined in all geomarkets with the exception of Mexico Central America, where revenue increased for the directional drilling wireline and artificial lift product lines. Sequential revenue declines reflect high levels of seasonal ESP sales in the fourth quarter, particularly in the Brazil and Andean geomarkets that did not reoccur in the first quarter. The operating profit margin in Latin America for the first quarter was a disappointing 3%, down from 9% in the prior quarter. Profitability in the quarter was impacted by a number of factors including a less favorable activity mix in Brazil, as rigs shifted from drilling to workover and by the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar, which had an $8 million pretax impact in Q1. In the first quarter, we operated on an average of two rigs in the Litoral Tabasco Marine project. We anticipate the award of additional offshore rigs in the second half of the year. This should lead to improved profitability, however we expected this contract will have a negative impact on earnings throughout Q2. Activity in the ATG fields, where we have been providing bundled services for local contractors, continued to slow in the first quarter. The pricing environment has turned negative due to excess capacity. However, during the quarter, we did execute our contract with PEMEX for our Koryo [ph] project, part of the ATG labs program. We have begun mobilizing under this integrated field development contract, which will enable Baker Hughes to showcase applications of leading edge technologies to improve production in the field. We had several technical achievements in Latin America during the quarter. Offshore Brazil, Baker Hughes successfully ran the industry's first large diameter sidewall coring tool in response to an operator's request to a sidewall core samples 1.5 inches in diameter and greater than 2 inches in length. The client requested 90 cores and our Baker Hughes MaxCor delivered 94 cores in four runs. In a subsequent run at another exploration area, MaxCor successfully delivered 52 core samples in only two runs. The larger diameter core gives you about three times the volume in each sample [audio gap] complex reservoir such as the pre-salt, a larger sample is critical for determining key reservoir properties.
In Columbia, Baker Hughes successfully drilled and completed the industry's first multi-lateral well drilled using our thru-tubing rotary drilling technology, using Baker Hughes' downhole motors, completions technology and hedgehog bits several re-entry wells were drilled with challenging directional drilling requirements including dog lake severities between 15 degrees and 46 degrees per 100 feet. Hedgehog bit performance included one successful run that replaced seven tri-cone runs.
Now turning to North America, revenue increased sequentially, driven by increased rig activity in all geomarkets. U.S. land revenue was up sequentially, driven by a 21% increase in rig count and a 28% sequential growth of horizontal drilling, which now accounts for nearly half of the rigs running today. Horizontal drilling activity is associated with higher service and technology intensity as laterals increase in length and the number of frac stages increased. Looking more closely at gas activity, 90% of the growth in the gas rig count from the June 2009 trough has been in the horizontal gas plays, with the Haynesville, the Anadarko, the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford accounting for over 87% of the total increase. As for oil activity, 76% of the increase in oil rig count upped the June 2009 bottom, has been in the Wollaston basin, in which complex horizontal wells are being drilled in the Permian Basin which has been primarily vertical. In the Wollaston basin, oil directed horizontal drilling increased 43% in the first quarter compared to fourth quarter and the use of horizontal wells to tap oil formation in the Permian Basin is also increased. This is driving continued demand for high-end completion technologies such as our Frac-Point completion systems and increased use of Rotary steerable systems.
The North American operating profit margin was 15% in the first quarter, up from 10% in the fourth quarter. While capacity is tightening across multiple product lines, overall pricing did not increase measurably in the quarter. Improved profitability was the result of higher activity levels and cost-cutting measures we implemented last year. During the quarter, VS Fusion, a bore hole seismic processing joint venture between Baker Hughes and CGGVeritas, completed one of the largest IntelliFrac micro seismic hydraulic fracturing monitor surveys ever undertaken. The survey for an operator in Canada's foreign River basin deployed Baker Hughes' geophone string simultaneously in two observation wells for over 30 days. Micro seismic events were recorded for hydraulic stimulations in 13 well bores adjacent to the observation wells. In all, over 75 separate BJ Service hydraulic stimulations were recorded. Real-time display of the micro seismic events at the well site and the customer’s offices was used to make real-time changes to the fracturing program. In Alaska, Baker Hughes has recently drilled and completed a well on the North Slope in Alaska that set several coiled tubing drilling records, with a total depth of 22,400 feet. This was the deepest open-hole sidetrack ever completed with coil-tubing drilling. And in the quarter Baker Hughes continued to expand its presence in technology offering in Canada's heavy oil projects. In the first quarter, Baker Hughes was awarded 32 SAGD ESP production wells for several operators. We are seeing expanded use of ESP systems in the SAGD market for applications such as pumping water to feed steam generation plants. We have captured over a third of the market for extreme temperature ESP systems and 70% of the SAGD chemical market. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad.

So as I stated earlier overall, we're pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter. Our North America operation delivered very strong results relative to competition and while our international markets were challenged by pricing pressures, we believe margins will improve in the second half of the year. Looking forward in the U.S., there are many positives. Oil activity has been robust. Last week, the oil rig count was 513 and that's up 23% from year end. We’re confident that oil directed drilling activity will continue at current price levels and are forecasting that the oil rig count will average about 570 rigs in the second half of the year. The oil directed drilling has been split between vertical drilling and the Permian and service intents of horizontal multi-laterals and multi-stage fracing in the Bakken. We see a possibility for more technologically sophisticated oil directed drilling in other areas as well, as operators are looking to develop new plays in the Eagle Ford and even the older plays in the Permian Basin.
The gas rig count has increased 26% from the year-end levels and last week stood at 958 rigs. Gas activity is ahead of where we thought it might have been in May. The mixed change to long horizontal and multi-stage fracing favors Baker Hughes in our new acquisition. Demand for natural gas could still surprise us. Summer isn’t here and industrial demand could react favorably to low natural gas prices thus far in demand. Looking forward, we expect the gas recount to peak in Q2 and show a modest decline in the second half of 2010, averaging 765 rigs for the second half of the year and 840 rigs for 2010, as a whole. So for the year, we see the gas rig count being up 5% year-on-year.
The increase in oil activity in the second half of the year will partially offset the decline in gas directed activity. For 2010 as a whole, we see the oil rig count up about 88%. So combine in total, we see the U.S. rig count up 26% or about 1,089 rigs to 1,370 or up 281 rigs. In Canada, the spring breakup is well underway and like our drilling in evaluation product lines, the BJ Services product lines are particularly impacted by the breakup. As in the past, we expect our chemicals and artificial lift product lines to remain fairly resilient. Outside North America, we expect international EMP spending will continue to increase, supported by high oil prices and the need to offset production declines and meet demand in China and India. In the Middle East Asia Pacific region, we look for a modest increase in rig activity in the second half of the year. Price pressures should ease and our focus will be on margin improvement. There has been much discussion recently about the outlook for Iraq, so I’m going to share our view. The long-term potential in Iraq is significant and we were well-positioned to address opportunities as they rise. As Martin mentioned earlier, our base in Rumailah will be open by the end of the second quarter and we have been awarded a significant contract for delivery of ESP systems. Pricing on recent industry contract awards for other services has been fairly aggressive, leading to what we consider below-average margins. As non-North America activity increases beginning the second half of this year, and accelerates into 2011, we would anticipate that Iraqi pricing for future contracts could firm as Service Company resources begin to become more stretched. Within our Europe Africa Russia Caspian region, we see activity in the North Sea being supported by strong activity in the Norwegian sector. We see stable activity in West Africa, growth in sub-Sahara Africa and a slow recovery in North Africa. Activity in the Russian Caspian region will increase, coming off a very seasonal low of the first quarter. And in Latin America, we expect activity to increase in Brazil and the Andean region. In Mexico, activity will increase, as Martin mentioned, in the back half of the year as the ATG lab work increases and the longer term in Mexico, we look for increased offshore activity. We do not expect near-term improvement in the outlook for Venezuela. So before we open it up for Q&A, I want to take this opportunity to welcome the former shareholders, as well as the employees of BJ Services and I think it’s obvious to say to that we've been anxiously waiting for this day for quite some time and also needless to say, we're pretty excited about getting started and being able to tackle some of the tremendous opportunities that we see in front of us in the second half of 2010.
Okay, Gary. Let's open it up for questions.

I think one of the things we need to look at on the international margins, I think we still have some allocation issues as we moved from a Houston focused product line. Everybody's sitting in Houston to international and as we've allocated out some costs, I think that's been reflected in some of our margins internationally. I think the volume side, one thing that will help us going forward on the volume is the BJ acquisition. If you look at it, if you look at the two areas where we seem to have most of our issue right now on margin, are the two areas where we needed to be pretty aggressive in our infrastructure build out. That's Latin America and Mexico, Brazil etc. and then the Middle East Asia Pac. And when there is a little downturn and you have some pricing that hit you as well, that amplifies some of your challenges in those areas. So, that additional revenue that we will get out of BJ will help us work some of those costs and I think that's why we're feeling pretty good about the second half of the year and into 2011.

All we've been able to do is look at it from topside until you go in there and do the detail work, you can change dramatically so I really am not comfortable until that work is done.

Q1 was a good quarter for Baker Hughes. We delivered strong results in North America, where the increase in drilling activity and the benefits of a lean organization drove the improvement in our operating margins. And I have to say as a credit to our North America geomarket and management team that they delivered this margin improvement without significant price increases in the quarter. Their focus on individual basins rather than discrete product lines is beginning to deliver share gains in North America. International activity is showing signs of improvement. It's driven by steady oil prices and the need to offset declines and to meet the demand from China and India. And over the last several quarters, our geomarket organization has delivered what we call stable market share, laying the foundation for future market share gains. In many international markets, we continue to face price pressure, resulting from contract renegotiations and tenders that were awarded in 2009. In addition, competition for market share is also contributing to lower pricing. However, we believe that our international operating margins reached a bottom in Q1. Margin improvement will be an important area of focus for our geomarkets in 2010. We expect margins to show very solid improvement in the second half of the year.
Last week, we closed on the acquisition of BJ Services and the integration of the two companies' international operations has already begun. For example, we are already beginning to mobilize coil tubing and sea mining units into our base in Iraq, which will be open by the end of June. As noted in the past, the acquisition of BJ Services is significant for Baker Hughes as it addresses a major gap in our product portfolio. It enhances our ability to deliver integrated operations and although it increases our exposure to North America, it also significantly enhances our international growth opportunities.
In conjunction with the acquisition, we have agreed to sell two vessels and related assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Until that sale is complete, we are required to operate Baker Hughes’ and BJ Services’ U.S. operations separately. We expect the sale of these vessels to be completed in the next few months and we've experienced a high-level interest in these assets. We look forward to realizing the full potential that will come from combination of the two companies.
To manage the stand-alone U.S. business during the divestiture period, and to help quickly integrate the international portion of BJ, we have appointed Andy O'Donnell as President of BJ Services. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Peter for a financial review and then Martin for an operational review and I'll come back later with some closing comments about what we see for future activity and then we’ll open it up later for Q&A.

This morning, we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $129 million or $0.41 per share. This compares to $0.63 per share a year ago and $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009.

This compares to $0.63 per share a year ago and $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Q1 revenue was $2.5 billion, down 5% or $129 million year-over-year and up 5% or $110 million sequentially. Looking at quarterly comparisons, our North American revenue was $1 billion in the first quarter, down 5% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially. Revenue outside of North America was $1.5 billion in the first quarter, also down 5% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially.
In recent quarters, we have provided a breakdown of costs associated with reorganization, severance and increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts, due to the magnitude of these event-driven charges. For the first quarter, these expenses were not significant. We don't believe it is necessary to highlight them as unusual in their magnitude. However, we will continue to highlight acquisition-related costs, as they will be significant in the second quarter.
Acquisition-related costs in Q1 were $10 million or $0.02 per share. As has been our practice, for the balance of our comments this morning, references to operating profit and operating profit margins will be on this adjusted basis. So our oilfield operating margin for the first quarter was 11%, down from 12% in the fourth quarter. North American margin was particularly strong, with a sequential incremental margin of 45%. 
Before I cover sequential and year-on-year bridges, I want to highlight a change that we have made in accounting for certain corporate costs. In the first quarter and in the future, we are reallocating certain costs from corporate to operations, who are most directly responsible for managing these costs. In Q1, our corporate costs were $49 million compared to $76 million recorded in Q4. Q2 corporate costs for Baker Hughes stand-alone are expected to increase to about $55 million. To help you evaluate our earnings per share in the first quarter, I’ll review the significant items that bridge the sequential and year-ago quarters to the first quarter EPS of $0.41. In Q4 2009, our U.S. GAAP net income per share was $0.27. From this $0.27, subtract $0.01 for the net impact of lower acquisition-related charges, higher tax rate and higher share count compared to Q4, and to account for the non-recurrence of the gain on investments in the fourth quarter, add $0.02 for lower net interest expense. We had a favorable change in the fair value of one of our interest rate swaps, add $0.05 for lower recorded corporate expense, add $0.15 for increased profits in North America, subtract $0.08 for decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.41 we're reporting for the first quarter. 
Now bridging from the year-ago quarter, U.S. GAAP net income per share of $0.63 we reported in the first quarter of 2009, add $0.02 as a result of lower recorded corporate expense. The impact of acquisition-related costs this quarter compared to the year-ago quarter was offset by lower interest expense, subtract $0.03 for a higher tax rate and share count compared to the year-ago quarter, add $0.05 for increased profits in North America and subtract $0.26 for decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.41 we are recording for the first quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter end, our total debt was $2 billion. This was $200 million higher than year end because we issued commercial paper in advance of funding the BJ Services transaction. Our long-term debt-to-cap ratio was 20%. We had cash of $1.6 billion and our net debt was $406 million, and our net debt-to-cap ratio was 4%. After quarter-end, we used $480 million in cash and issued $320 million of commercial paper in total to fund the $800 million cash portion of the BJ transaction. We also issued 118 million shares of stock at $51.24 per share. Our current outstanding share count is 430 million shares and the average share count for Q2 is expected to be approximately 391 million shares. Our combined pro forma total debt is about $2.7 billion and our pro forma total debt-to-cap ratio is 17% immediately following the merger.
We inherited $500 million in debt from BJ Services, comprised of two $250 million bond issues, which mature in 2011 and 2018. Our long-term debt, including the two BJ bond issues, which we have guaranteed, is rated A by S&P and AA by Moody's. Having closed the acquisition of BJ Services last week, today we have $1.7 billion of committed credit facilities consisting of a new three-year $1.2 billion facility, accessible through March 2013 and our existing $500 million facility, accessible through July 2012.
Last, a few thoughts on guidance for the second quarter and the balance of the year. I'm sure there are lots of questions regarding the pro forma impacts and the earnings outlook of the combined company. BJ Services has informed us that their revenue for the quarter ended March 31, was approximately $1.1 billion and their pretax profit was approximately $59 million, excluding acquisition-related charges of $31 million, and equipment partnership liquidation of $60 million and a charge for the Venezuela devaluation of about $9 million. 
Looking forward to Q2, we believe that operating EPS on a combined basis will be in the low $0.40 range, including the impact of the spring break up in Canada, Gulf of Mexico issues, and the dilutive impact of a higher share count. This does not include incremental depreciation and amortization, which may result from purchase price accounting, which we are not yet in a position to quantify. We also feel very confident in our ability to achieve $75 million in cost synergies over the next four quarters and $150 million in cost synergies over the subsequent four quarters. We also expect that our combined CapEx spending for calendar 2010 will be in a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. We see no material impact to the combined company of the Gulf of Mexico asset package divestiture. Finally, we now expect about $225 million to $235 million in acquisition-related charges to be accrued in Q2, consisting of changing control payments and professional fees. I'll now turn the call over to Martin who will highlight our geographical results. Martin?"
19007,100002554,60745,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-04-2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Peter. I'll start with a review of our international operations. The Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian region exhibited good revenue performance, supported by increases in directional drilling and fluid sales in the North Sea, completions in wireline",1537,"Thanks, Peter. I'll start with a review of our international operations. The Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian region exhibited good revenue performance, supported by increases in directional drilling and fluid sales in the North Sea, completions in wireline activity in Sub-Sahara Africa, completion sales in Nigeria and wireline and completion sales in the North Africa geomarket. In addition, strong artificial list sales in Russia more than offset the impact of unfavorable weather during the quarter. As a result, revenue was up 3% sequentially. Operating profit margin for the Europe Africa Russia Caspian region was 11% in the first quarter, down from 16% in the prior quarter. In Denmark, Baker Hughes recently helped Maersk set a new Danish record by drilling a well through a measured depth of 31,140 feet. In conjunction with extended-reach drilling in this challenging environment, Baker Hughes also supplied LWD evaluation services and Tricone and PDC drill bits. The well has been completed using a Baker Hughes reactive element packer, the first deployment of this application in Denmark.
Our technology is helping operators save valuable rig time as well. We enabled a North Sea operator to abandon a well in just one run, resulting in time savings of approximately six days over the previous best run. New cutter technology resulted in 150% improvement over conventional cutters and a Baker Hughes SENTIO, which is a downhole data acquisition tool, provided realtime data, allowing the operator to react to changes in downhole pressure during the milling process.
Turning to the Middle East Asia Pacific region, revenue increased in the Egypt and Australasia geomarkets. The increase in Egypt was led by the completion, directional drilling and drill bit product lines and by fluids and directional drilling in Australasia. In total, revenue was down 5% for the region. Operating profit in the Middle East Asia Pacific region was 7% in the first quarter compared to 12% in the fourth quarter. Operating profit in the first quarter was negatively impacted by prices negotiated on tenders awarded earlier in 2009 and by competition for market share, which resulted in aggressive pricing across that region.
During the quarter, Baker Hughes won a contract in Iraq to supply ESPs for 162 wells in the Rumailah Field and we expect that our new base in Rumailah will be ready for occupancy by the end of the second quarter. In Saudi Arabia, Baker Hughes installed the Middle East region's first open-hole, multistage, Frac-Point completion in a Saudi Aramco gas field. The market for this technology is expected to expand in the region, as our clients increasingly target lower permeability reservoirs. Also, in Saudi Arabia, we are now drilling the water ejection wells for the Manethra project. As we have previously highlighted, our proprietary technology is critical for the precise placement of these wells above the TARMAP, which is in turn, critical for optimal pressure maintenance as the field is eventually produced. The first well was recently completed with the entire six-inch section of over 5,000 feet being drilled in one single run. We offer the industry's only technical solution for the hole size being drilled, and we expect our success will lead to additional opportunities for future injection wells Manethra.
And in Malaysia, Baker Hughes deployed the test track formation pressure-while- drilling tool for an operator in the Kikeh field, the first oil-producing Deepwater field in Malaysia. Integrated in an auto track rotary steerable bottomhole assembly and complemented by other formation evaluation tools, the test track obtained 31 pressure readings in Kikeh’s thin-bedded sand shale reservoir.
Latin America revenue decreased 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 as revenue declined in all geomarkets with the exception of Mexico Central America, where revenue increased for the directional drilling, wireline and artificial lift product lines. Sequential revenue declines reflect high levels of seasonal ESP sales in the fourth quarter, particularly in the Brazil and Andean geomarkets that did not reoccur in the first quarter. The operating profit margin in Latin America for the first quarter was a disappointing 3%, down from 9% in the prior quarter. Profitability in the quarter was impacted by a number of factors including a less favorable activity mix in Brazil, as rigs shifted from drilling to workover and by the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar, which had an $8 million pretax impact in Q1. In the first quarter, we operated on an average of two rigs in the Litoral Tabasco Marine project. We anticipate the award of additional offshore rigs in the second half of the year. This should lead to improved profitability; however, we expected this contract will have a negative impact on earnings throughout Q2. 
Activity in the ATG fields, where we have been providing bundled services for local contractors, continued to slow in the first quarter. The pricing environment has turned negative due to excess capacity. However, during the quarter, we did execute our contract with Pemex for our Correo [ph] project, part of the ATG labs program. We have begun mobilizing under this integrated field development contract, which will enable Baker Hughes to showcase applications of leading edge technologies to improve production in the field. 
We had several technical achievements in Latin America during the quarter. Offshore Brazil, Baker Hughes successfully ran the industry's first large diameter sidewall coring tool in response to an operator's request for sidewall core samples 1 1/2 inches in diameter and greater than 2 inches in length. The client requested 90 cores and our Baker Hughes MaxCor delivered 94 cores in four runs. In a subsequent run at another exploration area, MaxCor successfully delivered 52 core samples in only two runs. The larger diameter core gives you about three times the volume in each sample. In a complex reservoir such, as the pre-salt, a larger sample is critical for determining key reservoir properties.
In Columbia, Baker Hughes successfully drilled and completed the industry's first multi-lateral well drilled using our thru-tubing rotary drilling technology, using Baker Hughes' downhole motors, completions technology and hedgehog bits several re-entry wells were drilled with challenging directional drilling requirements including dog lake severities between 15 degrees and 46 degrees per 100 feet. Hedgehog bit performance included one successful run that replaced seven Tricone runs.
Now turning to North America, revenue increased sequentially, driven by increased rig activity in all geomarkets. U.S. land revenue was up sequentially, driven by a 21% increase in rig count and a 28% sequential growth of horizontal drilling, which now accounts for nearly half of the rigs running today. Horizontal drilling activity is associated with higher service and technology intensity as laterals increase in length and the number of frac stages increased. Looking more closely at gas activity, 90% of the growth in the gas rig count from the June 2009 trough has been in the horizontal gas plays, with the Haynesville, the Anadarko, the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford accounting for over 87% of the total increase. As for oil activity, 76% of the increase in oilrig count upped the June 2009 bottom, has been in the Wollaston basin, in which complex horizontal wells are being drilled in the Permian Basin which has been primarily vertical. In the Wollaston basin, oil directed horizontal drilling increased 43% in the first quarter compared to fourth quarter and the use of horizontal wells to tap oil formation in the Permian Basin is also increased. This is driving continued demand for high-end completion technologies such as our Frac-Point completion systems and increased use of Rotary steerable systems.
The North American operating profit margin was 15% in the first quarter, up from 10% in the fourth quarter. While capacity is tightening across multiple product lines, overall pricing did not increase measurably in the quarter. Improved profitability was the result of higher activity levels and cost-cutting measures we implemented last year. During the quarter, VS Fusion, a borehole seismic processing joint venture between Baker Hughes and CGGVeritas, completed one of the largest IntelliFrac micro seismic hydraulic fracturing monitor surveys ever undertaken. The survey for an operator in Canada's foreign River basin deployed Baker Hughes' geophone string simultaneously in two observation wells for over 30 days. Micro seismic events were recorded for hydraulic stimulations in 13 well bores adjacent to the observation wells. In all, over 75 separate BJ Service hydraulic stimulations were recorded. Real-time display of the micro seismic events at the well site and the customer’s offices was used to make real-time changes to the fracturing program. In Alaska, Baker Hughes has recently drilled and completed a well on the North Slope in Alaska that set several coiled tubing drilling records, with a total depth of 22,400 feet. This was the deepest open-hole sidetrack ever completed with coil-tubing drilling. And in the quarter, Baker Hughes continued to expand its presence in technology offering in Canada's heavy oil projects. In the first quarter, Baker Hughes was awarded 32 SAGD ESP production wells for several operators. We are seeing expanded use of ESP systems in the SAGD market for applications such as pumping water to feed steam generation plants. We have captured over a third of the market for extreme temperature ESP systems and 70% of the SAGD chemical market. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad."

So as I stated earlier overall, we're pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter. Our North America operation delivered very strong results relative to competition and while our international markets were challenged by pricing pressures, we believe margins will improve in the second half of the year. Looking forward in the U.S., there are many positives. Oil activity has been robust. Last week, the oilrig count was 513 and that's up 23% from year end. We’re confident that oil directed drilling activity will continue at current price levels and are forecasting that the oilrig count will average about 570 rigs in the second half of the year. The oil directed drilling has been split between vertical drilling and the Permian and service intents of horizontal multi-laterals and multi-stage frac-ing in the Bakken. We see a possibility for more technologically sophisticated oil directed drilling in other areas as well, as operators are looking to develop new plays in the Eagle Ford and even the older plays in the Permian Basin.
The gas rig count has increased 26% from the year-end levels and last week stood at 958 rigs. Gas activity is ahead of where we thought it might have been in May. The mixed change to long horizontal and multi-stage frac-ing favors Baker Hughes in our new acquisition. Demand for natural gas could still surprise us. Summer isn’t here and industrial demand could react favorably to low natural gas prices thus far in demand. Looking forward, we expect the gas recount to peak in Q2 and show a modest decline in the second half of 2010, averaging 765 rigs for the second half of the year and 840 rigs for 2010, as a whole. So for the year, we see the gas rig count being up 5% year-on-year.
The increase in oil activity in the second half of the year will partially offset the decline in gas directed activity. For 2010 as a whole, we see the oilrig count up about 88%. So combine in total, we see the U.S. rig count up 26% or about 1,089 rigs to 1,370 or up 281 rigs. In Canada, the spring breakup is well underway and like our drilling in evaluation product lines, the BJ Services product lines are particularly impacted by the breakup. As in the past, we expect our chemicals and artificial lift product lines to remain fairly resilient. Outside North America, we expect international EMP spending will continue to increase, supported by high oil prices and the need to offset production declines and meet demand in China and India. In the Middle East Asia Pacific region, we look for a modest increase in rig activity in the second half of the year. Price pressures should ease and our focus will be on margin improvement. There has been much discussion recently about the outlook for Iraq, so I’m going to share our view. The long-term potential in Iraq is significant and we were well positioned to address opportunities as they rise. As Martin mentioned earlier, our base in Rumailah will be open by the end of the second quarter and we have been awarded a significant contract for delivery of ESP systems. Pricing on recent industry contract awards for other services has been fairly aggressive, leading to what we consider below-average margins. As non-North America activity increases beginning the second half of this year, and accelerates into 2011, we would anticipate that Iraqi pricing for future contracts could firm as Service Company resources begin to become more stretched. Within our Europe Africa Russia Caspian region, we see activity in the North Sea being supported by strong activity in the Norwegian sector. We see stable activity in West Africa, growth in sub-Sahara Africa and a slow recovery in North Africa. Activity in the Russian Caspian region will increase, coming off a very seasonal low of the first quarter. And in Latin America, we expect activity to increase in Brazil and the Andean region. In Mexico, activity will increase, as Martin mentioned, in the back half of the year as the ATG lab work increases and the longer term in Mexico, we look for increased offshore activity. We do not expect near-term improvement in the outlook for Venezuela. So before we open it up for Q&A, I want to take this opportunity to welcome the former shareholders, as well as the employees of BJ Services and I think it’s obvious to say to that we've been anxiously waiting for this day for quite some time and also needless to say, we're pretty excited about getting started and being able to tackle some of the tremendous opportunities that we see in front of us in the second half of 2010.

Everybody's sitting in Houston to international and as we've allocated out some costs, I think that's been reflected in some of our margins internationally. I think the volume side, one thing that will help us going forward on the volume is the BJ acquisition. If you look at it, if you look at the two areas where we seem to have most of our issue right now on margin, are the two areas where we needed to be pretty aggressive in our infrastructure build out. That's Latin America and Mexico, Brazil etc. and then the Middle East Asia Pac. And when there is a little downturn and you have some pricing that hit you as well, that amplifies some of your challenges in those areas.

We'll combine our insurance and things like that, things that are mainly corporate in nature and that's already baked into their forward forecast, and if anything, we'd hope to exceed that, but right now, that's the number we're sticking to and it looks very solid.

Good morning, everyone. Q1 was a good quarter for Baker Hughes. We delivered strong results in North America, where the increase in drilling activity and the benefits of a lean organization drove the improvement in our operating margin. And I have to say it’s a credit to our North American geomarket and management team that they delivered this margin improvement without significant price increases in the quarter. Their focus on individual basins rather than discrete product lines is beginning to deliver share gains in North America. International activity is showing signs of improvement. It's driven by steady oil prices and the need to offset declines and to meet the demand from China and India. And over the last several quarters, our geomarket organization has delivered what we call stable market share, laying the foundation for future market share gains. In many international markets, we continue to face price pressure resulting from contract negotiations and tenders that were awarded in 2009. In addition, competition for market share is also contributing to lower pricing. However, we believe that our international operating margins reached a bottom in Q1. Margin improvement will be an important area of focus for our geomarkets in 2010. We expect margins to show very solid improvement in the second half of the year.
Last week, we closed on the acquisition of BJ Services and the integration of the two companies' international operations has already begun. For example, we are already beginning to mobilize coiled tubing and cementing units into our base in Iraq, which will be open by the end of June. As noted in the past, the acquisition of BJ Services is significant for Baker Hughes as it addresses a major gap in our product portfolio. It enhances our ability to deliver integrated operations, and although it increases our exposure to North America, it also significantly enhances our international growth opportunities.
In conjunction with the acquisition, we have agreed to sell two vessels and related assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Until that sale is complete, we are required to operate Baker Hughes’ and BJ Services’ U.S. operations separately. We expect the sale of these vessels to be completed in the next few months and we've experienced a high level of interest in these assets. We look forward to realizing the full potential that will come from combination of the two companies.
To manage the standalone U.S. business during the divestiture period and to help quickly integrate the international portion of BJ, we have appointed Andy O'Donnell as President of BJ Services. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Peter for a financial review and then Martin for an operational review, and I'll come back later with some closing comments about what we see for future activity, and I will open it up later for Q&A. Peter?"

This morning, we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $129 million or $0.41 per share. This compares to $0.63 per share a year ago and $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009.

This compares to $0.63 per share a year ago and $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Q1 revenue was $2.5 billion, down 5% or $129 million year-over-year and up 5% or $110 million sequentially. Looking at quarterly comparisons, our North American revenue was $1 billion in the first quarter, down 5% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially. Revenue outside of North America was $1.5 billion in the first quarter, also down 5% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially.
In recent quarters, we have provided a breakdown of costs associated with reorganization, severance and increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts due to the magnitude of these charges. For the first quarter, these expenses were not significant. We don't believe it is necessary to highlight them as unusual in their magnitude. However, we will continue to highlight acquisition-related costs as they will be significant in the second quarter.
Our costs in Q1 were $10 million or $0.02 per share. As has been our practice, for the balance of our comments this morning, references to operating profit and operating profit margins will be on this adjusted basis. So our oilfield operating margins for the first quarter was 11%, down from 12% in the fourth quarter. North American margin was particularly strong, with a sequential incremental margin of 45%. Before I cover sequential and year-on-year bridges, I want to highlight a change that we have made in accounting for certain corporate costs. In the first quarter and in the future, we are reallocating certain costs from corporate to operations who are most directly responsible for managing these costs. In Q1, our corporate costs were $49 million compared to $76 million recorded in Q4. Q2 corporate costs for Baker Hughes standalone are expected to increase to about $55 million. To help you evaluate our earnings per share in the first quarter, I’ll review the significant items that bridge the sequential and year-ago quarters to the first quarter EPS of $0.41. In Q4 2009, our U.S. GAAP net income per share was $0.27. From this $0.27, subtract $0.01 for the net impact of lower acquisition-related charges, higher tax rate and a higher share count compared to Q4 and to account for the non-recurrence of the gain on investments in the fourth quarter. Add $0.02 for lower net interest expense. We had a favorable change in the fair value of one of our interest rate swaps. Add $0.05 for lower recorded corporate expense. Add $0.16 for increased profits in North America. Subtract $0.08 for decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.41 we're reporting for the first quarter. 
Now bridging from the year-ago quarter. The U.S. GAAP net income per share of $0.63 we reported in the first quarter of 2009, add $0.02 as a result of lower recorded corporate expense. The impact of acquisition-related costs this quarter compared to the year-ago quarter was offset by lower interest expense. Subtract $0.03 for a higher tax rate and share count compared to the year-ago quarter. Add $0.05 for increased profits in North America and subtract $0.26 for decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.41 we are recording for the first quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our total debt was $2 billion. This was $200 million higher than year end because we issued commercial paper in advance of funding the BJ Services transaction. Our long-term debt-to-cap ratio was 20%. We had cash of $1.6 billion and our net debt was $406 million and our net debt-to-cap ratio was 4%. After quarter end, we used $480 million in cash and issued $320 million of commercial paper in total to fund the $800 million cash portion of the BJ transaction. We also issued 118 million shares of stock at $51.24 per share. Our current outstanding share count is 430 million shares and the average share count for Q2 is expected to be approximately 391 million shares. Our combined pro forma total debt is about $2.7 billion and our pro forma total debt-to-cap ratio is 17% immediately following the merger.
We inherited $500 million in debt from BJ Services comprised of two $250 million bond issues, which mature in 2011 and 2018. Our long-term debt, including the two BJ bond issues, which we have guaranteed, is rated A by S&P and A2 by Moody's. Having closed the acquisition of BJ Services last week, today we have $1.7 billion of committed credit facilities consisting of a new three-year $1.2 billion facility accessible through March 2013 and our existing $500 million facility accessible through July 2012.
Last, a few thoughts on guidance for the second quarter and the balance of the year. I'm sure there are lots of questions regarding the pro forma impacts and earnings outlook of the combined company. BJ Services has informed us that their revenue for the quarter ended March 31 was approximately $1.1 billion and their pretax profit was approximately $59 million, excluding acquisition-related charges of $31 million, and equipment partnership liquidation of $16 million and a charge for the Venezuela devaluation of about $9 million. 
Looking forward to Q2, we believe that operating EPS on a combined basis will be in the low $0.40 range, including the impact of the spring breakup in Canada, Gulf of Mexico issues and the dilutive impact of a higher share count. This does not include incremental depreciation and amortization, which may result from purchase price accounting, which we are not yet in a position to quantify. We also feel very confident in our ability to achieve $75 million in cost synergies over the next four quarters and $150 million in cost synergies over the subsequent four quarters. We also expect that our combined CapEx spending for calendar 2010 will be in a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. We see no material impact to the combined company of the Gulf of Mexico asset package divestiture. Finally, we now expect about $225 million to $235 million in acquisition-related charges to be accrued in Q2, consisting of changing control payments and professional fees. I'll now turn the call over to Martin who will highlight our geographic results. Martin?"

I'll start with a review of our international operations. The Europe Africa Russia Caspian region exhibited good revenue performance, supported by increases in directional drilling and fluid sales in the North Sea, completions in wireline activity in Sub-Sahara Africa, completion sales in Nigeria and wireline and completion sales in the North Africa geomarket. In addition, strong artificial lift sales in Russia more than offset the impact of unfavorable weather during the quarter. As a result, revenue was up 3% sequentially. Operating profit margin for the Europe Africa Russia Caspian region was 11% in the first quarter, down from 16% in the prior quarter. In Denmark, Baker Hughes recently helped Maersk set a new Danish record by drilling a well to a measured depth of 31,140 feet. In conjunction with extended-reach drilling in this challenging environment, Baker Hughes also supplied LWD evaluation services and Tricone and PDC drill bits. The well has been completed using a Baker Hughes Reactive Element Packer, the first deployment of this application in Denmark.
Our technology is helping operators save valuable rig time as well. We enabled a North Sea operator to abandon a well in just one run, resulting in time savings of approximately six days over the previous best run. New cutter technology resulted in 150% improvement over conventional cutters. And a Baker Hughes SENTIO, which is a downhole data acquisition tool, provided real-time data, allowing the operator to react to changes in downhole pressure during the milling process.
Turning to the Middle East Asia Pacific region. Revenue increased in the Egypt and Australasia geomarkets. The increase in Egypt was led by the completion, directional drilling and drill bit product lines and by fluids and directional drilling in Australasia. In total, revenue was down 5% for the region. Operating profit in the Middle East Asia Pacific region was 7% in the first quarter compared to 12% in the fourth quarter. Operating profit in the first quarter was negatively impacted by prices negotiated on tenders awarded earlier in 2009 and by competition for market share, which resulted in aggressive pricing across that region.
During the quarter, Baker Hughes won a contract in Iraq to supply ESPs for 162 wells in the Rumaila field and we expect that our new base in Rumaila will be ready for occupancy by the end of the second quarter. In Saudi Arabia, Baker Hughes installed the Middle East region's first open-hole multi-stage Frac-Point completion in the Saudi Aramco gas field. The market for this technology is expected to expand in the region as our clients increasingly target lower permeability reservoirs. Also in Saudi Arabia, we are now drilling the water injection wells for the Mineko project. As we have previously highlighted, our proprietary technology is critical for the precise placement of these wells above the tarmac, which is in turn critical for optimal pressure maintenance as the field is eventually produced. The first well was recently completed with the entire six-inch section of over 5,000 feet being drilled in one single run. We offer the industry's only technical solution for the hole size being drilled and we expect our success will lead to additional opportunities for future injection wells in Mineko.
And in Malaysia, Baker Hughes deployed the TesTrak formation pressure while drilling tool for an operator in the Kikeh field, the first oil-producing deepwater field in Malaysia. Integrated in an auto track rotary steerable bottomhole assembly complemented by other formation evaluation tools, the TesTrak obtained 31 pressure readings in Kikeh’s thin-bedded sand-shale reservoir.
Latin America revenue decreased 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 as revenue declined in all geomarkets with the exception of Mexico/Central America, where revenue increased for the directional drilling, wireline and artificial lift product lines. Sequential revenue declines reflect high levels of seasonal ESP sales in the fourth quarter, particularly in the Brazil and Andean geomarkets that did not re-occur in the first quarter. The operating profit margin in Latin America for the first quarter was a disappointing 3%, down from 9% in the prior quarter. Profitability in the quarter was impacted by a number of factors including a less favorable activity mix in Brazil, as rigs shifted from drilling to workover and by the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, which had an $8 million pretax impact in Q1. 
In the first quarter, we operated on an average of two rigs in the Litoral Tabasco Marine project. We anticipate the award of additional offshore rigs in the second half of the year. This should lead to improved profitability. However, we expect that this contract will have a negative impact on earnings throughout Q2. Activity in the ATG fields, where we have been providing bundled services for local contractors, continued to slow in the first quarter. The pricing environment has turned negative due to excess capacity. However, during the quarter, we did execute our contract with PEMEX for our Correo [ph] project, part of the ATG labs program. We have begun mobilizing under this integrated field development contract, which will enable Baker Hughes to showcase applications of leading edge technology to improve production in the field. 
We had several technical achievements in Latin America during the quarter. Offshore Brazil, Baker Hughes successfully ran the industry's first large diameter sidewalk boring tool in response to an operator's request for sidewalk core samples 1.5 inches in diameter and greater than two inches in length. The client requested 90 cores and our Baker Hughes MaxCOR delivered 94 cores in four runs. In a subsequent run at another exploration area, MaxCOR successfully delivered 52 core samples in only two runs. The larger diameter core gives you about three times the volume in each sample and in complex reservoirs such as the pre-salt, a larger sample is critical for determining key reservoir properties.
In Columbia, Baker Hughes successfully drilled and completed the industry's first multilateral well drilled using our through-tubing rotary drilling technology. Using Baker Hughes' downhole motors, completions technology and HedgeHog bits, several reentry wells were drilled with challenging directional drilling requirements including dogleg severities between 15 degrees and 46 degrees for 100 feet. HedgeHog bit performance included one successful run that replaced seven Tricone runs.
Now turning to North America. Revenue increased sequentially, driven by increased rig activity in all geomarkets. U.S. line revenue was up sequentially, driven by a 21% increase in rig count and a 28% sequential growth of horizontal drilling, which now accounts for nearly half of the rigs running today. Horizontal drilling activity is associated with higher service and technology intensity as laterals increase in length and the number of frac stages increase. Looking more closely at gas activity, 90% of the growth in the gas rig count from the June 2009 trough has been in the horizontal gas plays, with the Haynesville, the Anadarko, the Marcellus and the Able Ford accounting for 87% of the total increase. As for oil activity, 76% of the increase in oil rig count off the June 2009 bottom has been in the Wollaston basin, in which complex horizontal wells have been drilled in the Permian Basin which had been primarily vertical. In the Wollaston basin, oil directed horizontal drilling increased 43% in the first quarter compared to fourth quarter and the use of horizontal wells to tap oil formations in the Permian Basin has also increased. This is driving continued demand for high-end completion technologies such as our Frac-Point completion systems and increased use of rotary steerable systems.
The North American operating profit margin was 15% in the first quarter, up from 10% in the fourth quarter. While capacity is tightening across multiple product lines, overall pricing did not increase measurably in the quarter. Improved profitability was the result of higher activity levels and cost-cutting measures we implemented last year. During the quarter, VSFusion, a borehole seismic processing joint venture between Baker Hughes and CGGVeritas, completed one of the largest IntelliFrac microseismic hydraulic fracturing monitor surveys ever undertaken. 
The survey for an operator in Canada's Horn River basin deployed Baker Hughes' geophone strings simultaneously in two observation wells for over 30 days. Microseismic events were recorded for hydraulic simulations in 13 wellbores adjacent to the observation wells. In all, over 75 separate BJ Service hydraulic stimulations [sic] [simulations] were recorded. Real-time display of the microseismic events at the well site and the customer’s offices was used to make real-time changes to the fracturing program. 
In Alaska, Baker Hughes has recently drilled and completed a well on the North Slope in Alaska that set several coiled tubing drilling records with a total depth of 22,400 feet. This was the deepest open hole sidetrack ever completed with coiled tubing drilling. 
And in the quarter Baker Hughes continued to expand its presence in technology offering in Canada's heavy oil projects. In the first quarter, Baker Hughes was awarded 32 SAGD ESP production wells for several operators. We are seeing expanded use of ESP systems in the SAGD market for applications such as pumping water to feed steam generation plant. We have captured over a third of the market for extreme temperature ESP systems and 70% of the SAGD chemical market. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad."

So as I stated earlier, overall we're pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter. Our North America operation delivered very strong results relative to competition and while our international markets were challenged by pricing pressures, we believe margins will improve in the second half of the year. Looking forward in the U.S., there are many positives. Oil activity has been robust. Last week, the oil rig count was 513 and that's up 23% from year end. We’re confident that oil-directed drilling activity will continue at current price levels and are forecasting that the oil rig count will average about 570 rigs in the second half of the year. The oil directed drilling has been split between vertical drilling in the Permian and service-intensive horizontal multilaterals and multistage frac-ing in the Bakken. We see a possibility for more technologically sophisticated oil directed drilling in other areas as well, as operators are looking to develop new plays in the Eagle Ford and even the older plays in the Permian Basin.
The gas rig count has increased 26% from the year end levels and last week stood at 958 rigs. Gas activity is ahead of where we thought it might have been in May. The mix change to long horizontal and multistage frac-ing favors Baker Hughes in our new acquisition. Demand for natural gas could still surprise us. Summer isn’t here and industrial demand could react favorably to low natural gas prices, thus spurring demand. Looking forward, we expect the gas rig count to peak in Q2 and show a modest decline in the second half of 2010, averaging 765 rigs for the second half of the year and 840 rigs for 2010 as a whole. So for the year, we see the gas rig count being up 5% year-on-year.
The increase in oil activity in the second half of the year will partially offset the decline in gas directed activity. For 2010 as a whole, we see the oil rig count up about 88%. So combined in total, we see the U.S. rig count up 26% or about 1,089 rigs to 1,370 or up 281 rigs. In Canada, the spring breakup is well underway, and like our drilling and evaluation product lines, the BJ Services product lines are particularly impacted by the breakup. As in the past, we expect our chemicals and artificial lift product lines to remain fairly resilient. Outside North America, we expect international EMP spending will continue to increase supported by high oil prices and the need to offset production declines and meet demand in China and India. In the Middle East Asia Pacific region, we look for a modest increase in rig activity in the second half of the year. Price pressures should ease and our focus will be on margin improvement. There has been much discussion recently about the outlook for Iraq so I’m going to share our view. Our long-term potential in Iraq is significant and we are well positioned to address opportunities as they rise. As Martin mentioned earlier, our base in Rumaila will be open by the end of the second quarter and we have been awarded a significant contract for delivery of ESP systems. Pricing on recent industry contract awards for other services has been fairly aggressive, leading to what we’d consider below-average margins. As non-North America activity increases beginning the second half of this year and accelerates into 2011, we would anticipate that Iraqi pricing for future contracts could firm as service company resources begin to become more stretched. Within our Europe Africa Russia Caspian region, we see activity in the North Sea being supported by strong activity in the Norwegian sector. We see stable activity in West Africa, growth in Sub-Sahara Africa and a slow recovery in North Africa. Activity in the Russian Caspian region will increase, coming off a very low, seasonal low of the first quarter. In Latin America, we expect activity to increase in Brazil and the Andean region. In Mexico, activity will increase as Martin mentioned in the back half of the year as the ATG lab work increases, and longer term in Mexico, we look for increased offshore activity. We do not expect near-term improvement in the outlook for Venezuela. So before we open it up for Q&A, I want to take this opportunity to welcome the former shareholders, as well as the employees of BJ Services. I think it’s obvious to say we've been anxiously awaiting for this day for quite some time, and also needless to say, we're pretty excited about getting started and be able to tackle some of the tremendous opportunities that we see in front of us in the second half of 2010.

That's Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, et cetera and then the Middle East Asia Pac.

Other than that, we're not seeing deterioration in that activity.

So it's going to take us a couple of months to probably get that together, and sell it, get the approval from the DOJ. Once that's done, we will then go ahead and incorporate, and roll or integrate I should say the U.S. side of the BJ acquisition. It's not all bad because we've always said that the international side would go quickly and the U.S. side would take a little longer if you wanted to learn their people and understand and know who they are and give them some key roles, et cetera.

If anything, we’ve just got more confident because we've had sessions, a lot of sessions now, with our integration team and actually now that we've closed, we actually met with the BJ team the next day on the plans and forecast and so on. So the $75 million in the next four quarters, most of that’s just coming out of some corporate expenses that you would expect. You don’t have the board of directors anymore. We'll combine our insurance and things like that, things that are mainly corporate in nature and that's already baked into their forward forecast. And if anything, we hope to exceed that but right now, that's the number we're sticking to and it looks very solid. And the additional 75 that comes after that in the following year is really when you start looking at your operating bases around the world and consolidation of various offices and real estate and that sort of thing and back office functions. And that takes a little bit more work. It doesn't start day one and we've got pretty concrete plans for that built in as well and again, the 75 and 150 don’t include any revenue synergies at all, which, those come contract by contract.

Within that integration, there are, kind of, a two-pronged approach. As Peter mentioned, the cost synergies really can't happen until we understand what the support needs are. But the first and foremost priority is the commercial synergies and those would be first and foremost, the existing contracts that both companies currently hold. And looking for any opportunities where there is no contract bearers to where we can leverage each other's relationships and terms and conditions. And then any new opportunities that, for the first time, Baker Hughes will be solicited as a water provider.

I think Q3, Q4, you'll start seeing improvement and it will be a combination of some of these costs we’ve talked about, but also when the Brazilian rigs swing from drilling to completion, it makes a big difference because we do have a significant infrastructure in Brazil today.

Good morning, everyone. Q1 was a good quarter for Baker Hughes. We delivered strong results in North America, where the increase in drilling activity and the benefits of a lean organization drove the improvement in our operating margin. And I have to say it’s a credit to our North American geomarket and management team that they delivered this margin improvement without significant price increases in the quarter. Their focus on individual basins rather than discrete product lines is beginning to deliver share gains in North America. International activity is showing signs of improvement. It's driven by steady oil prices and the need to offset declines and to meet the demand from China and India. And over the last several quarters, our geomarket organization has delivered what we call stable market share, laying the foundation for future market share gains. In many international markets, we continue to face price pressure resulting from contract negotiations and tenders that were awarded in 2009. In addition, competition for market share is also contributing to lower pricing. However, we believe that our international operating margins reached a bottom in Q1. Margin improvement will be an important area of focus for our geomarkets in 2010. We expect margins to show very solid improvement in the second half of the year.
Last week, we closed on the acquisition of BJ Services and the integration of the two companies' international operations has already begun. For example, we are already beginning to mobilize coiled tubing and cementing units into our base in Iraq, which will be open by the end of June. As noted in the past, the acquisition of BJ Services is significant for Baker Hughes as it addresses a major gap in our product portfolio. It enhances our ability to deliver integrated operations, and although it increases our exposure to North America, it also significantly enhances our international growth opportunities.
In conjunction with the acquisition, we have agreed to sell two vessels and related assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Until that sale is complete, we are required to operate Baker Hughes’ and BJ Services’ U.S. operations separately. We expect the sale of these vessels to be completed in the next few months and we've experienced a high level of interest in these assets. We look forward to realizing the full potential that will come from combination of the two companies.
To manage the standalone U.S. business during the divestiture period and to help quickly integrate the international portion of BJ, we have appointed Andy O'Donnell as President of BJ Services. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Peter for a financial review and then Martin for an operational review, and I'll come back later with some closing comments about what we see for future activity, and I will open it up later for Q&A.

This morning, we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $129 million or $0.41 per share. This compares to $0.63 per share a year ago and $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Q1 revenue was $2.5 billion, down 5% or $129 millio",1051,"Thanks, Chad. This morning, we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $129 million or $0.41 per share. This compares to $0.63 per share a year ago and $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. Q1 revenue was $2.5 billion, down 5% or $129 million year-over-year and up 5% or $110 million sequentially. Looking at quarterly comparisons, our North American revenue was $1 billion in the first quarter, down 5% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially. Revenue outside of North America was $1.5 billion in the first quarter, also down 5% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially.
In recent quarters, we have provided a breakdown of costs associated with reorganization, severance and increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts due to the magnitude of these charges. For the first quarter, these expenses were not significant. We don't believe it is necessary to highlight them as unusual in their magnitude. However, we will continue to highlight acquisition-related costs as they will be significant in the second quarter.
Our costs in Q1 were $10 million or $0.02 per share. As has been our practice, for the balance of our comments this morning, references to operating profit and operating profit margins will be on this adjusted basis. So our oilfield operating margins for the first quarter was 11%, down from 12% in the fourth quarter. North American margin was particularly strong, with a sequential incremental margin of 45%. Before I cover sequential and year-on-year bridges, I want to highlight a change that we have made in accounting for certain corporate costs. In the first quarter and in the future, we are reallocating certain costs from corporate to operations who are most directly responsible for managing these costs. In Q1, our corporate costs were $49 million compared to $76 million recorded in Q4. Q2 corporate costs for Baker Hughes standalone are expected to increase to about $55 million. To help you evaluate our earnings per share in the first quarter, I’ll review the significant items that bridge the sequential and year-ago quarters to the first quarter EPS of $0.41. In Q4 2009, our U.S. GAAP net income per share was $0.27. From this $0.27, subtract $0.01 for the net impact of lower acquisition-related charges, higher tax rate and a higher share count compared to Q4 and to account for the non-recurrence of the gain on investments in the fourth quarter. Add $0.02 for lower net interest expense. We had a favorable change in the fair value of one of our interest rate swaps. Add $0.05 for lower recorded corporate expense. Add $0.16 for increased profits in North America. Subtract $0.08 for decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.41 we're reporting for the first quarter. 
Now bridging from the year-ago quarter. For the U.S. GAAP net income per share of $0.63 we reported in the first quarter of 2009, add $0.02 as a result of lower recorded corporate expense. The impact of acquisition-related costs this quarter compared to the year-ago quarter was offset by lower interest expense. Subtract $0.03 for a higher tax rate and share count compared to the year-ago quarter. Add $0.05 for increased profits in North America and subtract $0.26 for decreased profits outside of North America. This gets us to the $0.41 we are reporting for the first quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our total debt was $2 billion. This was $200 million higher than year end because we issued commercial paper in advance of funding the BJ Services transaction. Our long-term debt-to-cap ratio was 20%. We had cash of $1.6 billion and our net debt was $406 million and our net debt-to-cap ratio was 4%. After quarter end, we used $480 million in cash and issued $320 million of commercial paper in total to fund the $800 million cash portion of the BJ transaction. We also issued 118 million shares of stock at $51.24 per share. Our current outstanding share count is 430 million shares and the average share count for Q2 is expected to be approximately 391 million shares. Our combined pro forma total debt is about $2.7 billion and our pro forma total debt-to-cap ratio is 17% immediately following the merger.
We inherited $500 million in debt from BJ Services comprised of two $250 million bond issues, which mature in 2011 and 2018. Our long-term debt, including the two BJ bond issues, which we have guaranteed, is rated A by S&P and A2 by Moody's. Having closed the acquisition of BJ Services last week, today we have $1.7 billion of committed credit facilities consisting of a new three-year $1.2 billion facility accessible through March 2013 and our existing $500 million facility accessible through July 2012.
Last, a few thoughts on guidance for the second quarter and the balance of the year. I'm sure there are lots of questions regarding the pro forma impacts and earnings outlook of the combined company. BJ Services has informed us that their revenue for the quarter ended March 31 was approximately $1.1 billion and their pretax profit was approximately $59 million, excluding acquisition-related charges of $31 million, and equipment partnership liquidation of $16 million and a charge for the Venezuela devaluation of about $9 million. 
Looking forward to Q2, we believe that operating EPS on a combined basis will be in the low $0.40 range, including the impact of the spring breakup in Canada, Gulf of Mexico issues and the dilutive impact of a higher share count. This does not include incremental depreciation and amortization, which may result from purchase price accounting, which we are not yet in a position to quantify. We also feel very confident in our ability to achieve $75 million in cost synergies over the next four quarters and $150 million in cost synergies over the subsequent four quarters. We also expect that our combined CapEx spending for calendar 2010 will be in a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. We see no material impact to the combined company of the Gulf of Mexico asset package divestiture. Finally, we now expect about $225 million to $235 million in acquisition-related charges to be accrued in Q2, consisting of changing control payments and professional fees. I'll now turn the call over to Martin who will highlight our geographic results. Martin?"

I'll start with a review of our international operations.

I'll start with a review of our international operations. The Europe Africa Russia Caspian region exhibited good revenue performance, supported by increases in directional drilling and fluid sales in the North Sea, completions in wireline activity in Sub-Sahara Africa, completion sales in Nigeria and wireline and completion sales in the North Africa geomarket. In addition, strong artificial lift sales in Russia more than offset the impact of unfavorable weather during the quarter. As a result, revenue was up 3% sequentially. Operating profit margin for the Europe Africa Russia Caspian region was 11% in the first quarter, down from 16% in the prior quarter. In Denmark, Baker Hughes recently helped Maersk set a new Danish record by drilling a well to a measured depth of 31,140 feet. In conjunction with extended-reach drilling in this challenging environment, Baker Hughes also supplied LWD evaluation services and Tricone and PDC drill bits. The well has been completed using a Baker Hughes Reactive Element Packer, the first deployment of this application in Denmark.
Our technology is helping operators save valuable rig time as well. We enabled a North Sea operator to abandon a well in just one run, resulting in time savings of approximately six days over the previous best run. New cutter technology resulted in 150% improvement over conventional cutters. And a Baker Hughes SENTIO, which is a downhole data acquisition tool, provided real-time data, allowing the operator to react to changes in downhole pressure during the milling process.
Turning to the Middle East Asia Pacific region. Revenue increased in the Egypt and Australasia geomarkets. The increase in Egypt was led by the completion, directional drilling and drill bit product lines and by fluids and directional drilling in Australasia. In total, revenue was down 5% for the region. Operating profit in the Middle East Asia Pacific region was 7% in the first quarter compared to 12% in the fourth quarter. Operating profit in the first quarter was negatively impacted by prices negotiated on tenders awarded earlier in 2009 and by competition for market share, which resulted in aggressive pricing across that region.
During the quarter, Baker Hughes won a contract in Iraq to supply ESPs for 162 wells in the Rumaila field and we expect that our new base in Rumaila will be ready for occupancy by the end of the second quarter. In Saudi Arabia, Baker Hughes installed the Middle East region's first open-hole multi-stage Frac-Point completion in the Saudi Aramco gas field. The market for this technology is expected to expand in the region as our clients increasingly target lower permeability reservoirs. Also in Saudi Arabia, we are now drilling the water injection wells for the Mineko project. As we have previously highlighted, our proprietary technology is critical for the precise placement of these wells above the tarmac, which is in turn critical for optimal pressure maintenance as the field is eventually produced. The first well was recently completed with the entire six-inch section of over 5,000 feet being drilled in one single run. We offer the industry's only technical solution for the hole size being drilled and we expect our success will lead to additional opportunities for future injection wells in Mineko.
And in Malaysia, Baker Hughes deployed the TesTrak formation pressure while drilling tool for an operator in the Kikeh field, the first oil-producing deepwater field in Malaysia. Integrated in an auto track rotary steerable bottomhole assembly complemented by other formation evaluation tools, the TesTrak obtained 31 pressure readings in Kikeh’s thin-bedded sand-shale reservoir.
Latin America revenue decreased 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 as revenue declined in all geomarkets with the exception of Mexico/Central America, where revenue increased for the directional drilling, wireline and artificial lift product lines. Sequential revenue declines reflect high levels of seasonal ESP sales in the fourth quarter, particularly in the Brazil and Andean geomarkets that did not re-occur in the first quarter. The operating profit margin in Latin America for the first quarter was a disappointing 3%, down from 9% in the prior quarter. Profitability in the quarter was impacted by a number of factors including a less favorable activity mix in Brazil, as rigs shifted from drilling to workover and by the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, which had an $8 million pretax impact in Q1. 
In the first quarter, we operated on an average of two rigs in the Litoral Tabasco Marine project. We anticipate the award of additional offshore rigs in the second half of the year. This should lead to improved profitability. However, we expect that this contract will have a negative impact on earnings throughout Q2. Activity in the ATG fields, where we have been providing bundled services for local contractors, continued to slow in the first quarter. The pricing environment has turned negative due to excess capacity. However, during the quarter, we did execute our contract with PEMEX for our Correo [ph] project, part of the ATG labs program. We have begun mobilizing under this integrated field development contract, which will enable Baker Hughes to showcase applications of leading edge technology to improve production in the field. 
We had several technical achievements in Latin America during the quarter. Offshore Brazil, Baker Hughes successfully ran the industry's first large diameter sidewalk boring tool in response to an operator's request for sidewalk core samples 1.5 inches in diameter and greater than two inches in length. The client requested 90 cores and our Baker Hughes MaxCOR delivered 94 cores in four runs. In a subsequent run at another exploration area, MaxCOR successfully delivered 52 core samples in only two runs. The larger diameter core gives you about three times the volume in each sample and in complex reservoirs such as the pre-salt, a larger sample is critical for determining key reservoir properties.
In Columbia, Baker Hughes successfully drilled and completed the industry's first multilateral well drilled using our through-tubing rotary drilling technology. Using Baker Hughes' downhole motors, completions technology and HedgeHog bits, several reentry wells were drilled with challenging directional drilling requirements including dogleg severities between 15 degrees and 46 degrees for 100 feet. HedgeHog bit performance included one successful run that replaced seven Tricone runs.
Now turning to North America. Revenue increased sequentially, driven by increased rig activity in all geomarkets. U.S. line revenue was up sequentially, driven by a 21% increase in rig count and a 28% sequential growth of horizontal drilling, which now accounts for nearly half of the rigs running today. Horizontal drilling activity is associated with higher service and technology intensity as laterals increase in length and the number of frac stages increase. Looking more closely at gas activity, 90% of the growth in the gas rig count from the June 2009 trough has been in the horizontal gas plays, with the Haynesville, the Anadarko, the Marcellus and the Able Ford accounting for 87% of the total increase. As for oil activity, 76% of the increase in oil rig count off the June 2009 bottom has been in the Wollaston basin, in which complex horizontal wells have been drilled in the Permian Basin which had been primarily vertical. In the Wollaston basin, oil directed horizontal drilling increased 43% in the first quarter compared to fourth quarter and the use of horizontal wells to tap oil formations in the Permian Basin has also increased. This is driving continued demand for high-end completion technologies such as our Frac-Point completion systems and increased use of rotary steerable systems.
The North American operating profit margin was 15% in the first quarter, up from 10% in the fourth quarter. While capacity is tightening across multiple product lines, overall pricing did not increase measurably in the quarter. Improved profitability was the result of higher activity levels and cost-cutting measures we implemented last year. During the quarter, VSFusion, a borehole seismic processing joint venture between Baker Hughes and CGGVeritas, completed one of the largest IntelliFrac microseismic hydraulic fracturing monitor surveys ever undertaken. 
The survey for an operator in Canada's Horn River basin deployed Baker Hughes' geophone strings simultaneously in two observation wells for over 30 days. Microseismic events were recorded for hydraulic simulations in 13 wellbores adjacent to the observation wells. In all, over 75 separate BJ Service hydraulic stimulations [sic] [simulations] were recorded. Real-time display of the microseismic events at the well site and the customer’s offices was used to make real-time changes to the fracturing program. 
In Alaska, Baker Hughes has recently drilled and completed a well on the North Slope in Alaska that set several coiled tubing drilling records with a total depth of 22,400 feet. This was the deepest open hole sidetrack ever completed with coiled tubing drilling. 
And in the quarter Baker Hughes continued to expand its presence in technology offering in Canada's heavy oil projects. In the first quarter, Baker Hughes was awarded 32 SAGD ESP production wells for several operators. We are seeing expanded use of ESP systems in the SAGD market for applications such as pumping water to feed steam generation plant. We have captured over a third of the market for extreme temperature ESP systems and 70% of the SAGD chemical market. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad."

So as I stated earlier, overall we're pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter. Our North America operation delivered very strong results relative to competition and while our international markets were challenged by pricing pressures, we believe margins will improve in the second half of the year. Looking forward in the U.S., there are many positives. Oil activity has been robust. Last week, the oil rig count was 513 and that's up 23% from year end. We’re confident that oil-directed drilling activity will continue at current price levels and are forecasting that the oil rig count will average about 570 rigs in the second half of the year. The oil directed drilling has been split between vertical drilling in the Permian and service-intensive horizontal multilaterals and multistage fracing in the Bakken. We see a possibility for more technologically sophisticated oil directed drilling in other areas as well, as operators are looking to develop new plays in the Eagle Ford and even the older plays in the Permian Basin.
The gas rig count has increased 26% from year end levels and last week stood at 958 rigs. Gas activity is ahead of where we thought it might have been in May. The mix change to long horizontal and multistage fracing favors Baker Hughes in our new acquisition. Demand for natural gas could still surprise us. Summer isn’t here and industrial demand could react favorably to low natural gas prices, thus spurring demand. Looking forward, we expect the gas rig count to peak in Q2 and show a modest decline in the second half of 2010, averaging 765 rigs for the second half of the year and 840 rigs for 2010 as a whole. So for the year, we see the gas rig count being up 5% year-on-year.
The increase in oil activity in the second half of the year will partially offset the decline in gas directed activity. For 2010 as a whole, we see the oil rig count up about 88%. So combined in total, we see the U.S. rig count up 26% or about 1,089 rigs to 1,370 or up 281 rigs. In Canada, the spring breakup is well underway, and like our drilling and evaluation product lines, the BJ Services product lines are particularly impacted by the breakup. As in the past, we expect our chemicals and artificial lift product lines to remain fairly resilient. Outside North America, we expect international EMP spending will continue to increase supported by high oil prices and the need to offset production declines and meet demand in China and India. In the Middle East Asia-Pacific region, we look for a modest increase in rig activity in the second half of the year. Price pressure should ease and our focus will be on margin improvement. There has been much discussion recently about the outlook for Iraq so I’m going to share our view. The long-term potential in Iraq is significant and we are well positioned to address opportunities as they rise. As Martin mentioned earlier, our base in Rumaila will be open by the end of the second quarter and we have been awarded a significant contract for delivery of ESP systems. Pricing on recent industry contract awards for other services has been fairly aggressive, leading to what we’d consider below-average margins. As non-North America activity increases beginning the second half of this year and accelerates into 2011, we would anticipate that Iraqi pricing for future contracts could firm as service company resources begin to become more stretched. Within our Europe Africa Russia Caspian region, we see activity in the North Sea being supported by strong activity in the Norwegian sector. We see stable activity in West Africa, growth in Sub-Sahara Africa and a slow recovery in North Africa. Activity in the Russian Caspian region will increase, coming off a very low, seasonal low of the first quarter. In Latin America, we expect activity to increase in Brazil and the Andean region. In Mexico, activity will increase, as Martin mentioned, in the back half of the year as the ATG lab work increases, and longer term in Mexico, we look for increased offshore activity. We do not expect near-term improvement in the outlook for Venezuela. So before we open it up for Q&A, I want to take this opportunity to welcome the former shareholders, as well as the employees of BJ Services. I think it’s obvious to say we've been anxiously awaiting for this day for quite some time, and also needless to say, we're pretty excited about getting started and be able to tackle some of the tremendous opportunities that we see in front of us in the second half of 2010.

I think the volume side, one thing that will help us going forward on the volume is the BJ acquisition. If you look at it, if you look at the two areas where we seem to have most of our issue right now on margin are the two areas where we needed to be pretty aggressive in our infrastructure build out. That's Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, et cetera and then the Middle East Asia Pac.

And if anything, we hope to exceed that but right now, that's the number we're sticking to and it looks very solid. And the additional 75 that comes after that in the following year is really when you start looking at your operating bases around the world and consolidation of various offices and real estate and that sort of thing and back office functions. And that takes a little bit more work. It doesn't start day one and we've got pretty concrete plans for that built in as well and again, the 75 and 150 don’t include any revenue synergies at all, which, those come contract by contract. We'll start to pay those as soon as we can."

Let me follow up on a couple of comments Chad and Peter made. As Chad mentioned, we're already underway in terms of the integration, but specifically, there are task forces that have been assigned in each region. All the international regions have been bucketed into three buckets in terms of the first phase, the second phase and the third phase. Within that integration, there are, kind of, a two-pronged approach. As Peter mentioned, the cost synergies really can't happen until we understand what the support needs are. But the first and foremost priority is the commercial synergies and those would be first and foremost, the existing contracts that both companies currently hold. And looking for any opportunities where there is no contract bearers to where we can leverage each other's relationships and terms and conditions. And then any new opportunities that, for the first time, Baker Hughes will be solicited as a water provider. So we're feeling very good in terms of the way these guys have hit the ground running on both sides of -- BJ's side as well as Baker Hughes' side to get this thing moving quickly."

Following up on two pretty decent quarters, our great results this past quarter is mixed.

Following up on two pretty decent quarters, our great results this past quarter is mixed. On a positive side, operationally, we performed better than expected in North America, Russia and Asia Pacific, where we made some significant improvements sequentially.
In North America, we are now well positioned to benefit from the continued increase in our unconventional gas development. And as for our acquisition of BJ Services turned out to be pretty well timed. As a leader in completions, directional drilling, bits and now, pressure pumping, we have the full tool kit we need to compete in the unconventional shale plays. Sequentially, our U.S. Land business showed strong growth. However, the sequential improvement for North America as a whole was muted in Q2 by the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico, and of course, spring breakup in Canada. Now that we own BJ services, our revenue in the Canadian market has increased by about 80%, as both companies enjoy a very strong presence in the country. 
Revenues in Russia made significant improvement both year-over-year, as well as sequentially. Our acquisition of Oilpump Services has given us the uncontested number two position in the Russian ESP [electrical submersible pumping] market, which is the largest ESP market in the world. And in Asia, our new geomarket organization is beginning to deliver contract land wins and improved share. Aside from the temporary slowdown in the Norwegian drilling activity, our European region performed well during the quarter. And in the Middle East, we're winning some contracts and expanding our presence in Iraq. On the other hand, in Africa and Latin America, where we have invested heavily, revenue has lagged and our profit is below our expectations.
Africa is particularly difficult challenge for us right now. In North Africa, Libya has announced 30% budget cuts, spending in Algeria is recovering slowly following the change in the management of Sonotrack and Nigeria revenue is down following significant Q4 '09 and Q1 '10 deliveries for the Total Usan completion project. As a result, profits declined in the region and resulted in the temporary increase in our tax rates in some countries, which calculate tax as a percentage of revenue.
As for Latin America, we're disappointed with the progress we've made in Mexico. In the second quarter, we're on just two rigs on the ALMA Marine project and if you recall, this is to be a seven rig, 15 well contract. So despite strong operational performance and a significant investment to support larger scale operations, we have been unable to procure more activity. This contract is up for renewal during this quarter, and at this time we intend to let it lapse. 
Africa and Latin American regions do have some bright spots. Sub-Sahara Africa revenue was up strong year-over-year, and we're seeing strong year-over-year and sequential performance in our Andean and Brazilian geomarkets. Also in Brazil, we obtain a good contract for the second most active Brazilian operator that further diversify their customer base in the country. 
In the quarter, we completed our first year under our new geographical organization, and I'm pleased with our accomplishments in several different areas. We sought to improve our understanding of the market, moving from eight different product line views to a coherent view of each local market and the global market as a whole, and we've done that. We wanted to do a better job of setting R&D priorities for the organization, thus reflecting market priorities. And now, we have a process in place to do that.
We wanted to make sure that we didn't compromised our standards for field execution and safety. And today, we have maintained our high level of service quality, as well as our HSE standards. We decided to launch a multiyear effort to upgrade our supply chain and we're beginning to see the benefits of this transformation. We wanted to address the market share growth challenges of the past, and under the new organization we've made progress. Over the last several quarters, we have kept pace with our peers and we are achieving higher success rates on tenders.
We also said that the new business model would help us achieve long-term profitability and that is where additional work is required. International margins remain disappointing. I believe we are now about three to four months behind where we expected to be at this time. Now that the regional organizations have a year under their belt, we're increasing our focus on improving efficiency and returning our international margins to acceptable level.
On April 28, we closed on our acquisition of BJ Services and began integrating its international operations into those of Baker Hughes. We've established reporting relationships for both BJ and Baker Hughes international managers, and we've aligned operating territories in order to improve coordination between the product lines. Financially, BJ Service has already had a positive impact in our results, excluding the acquisition related costs, and it was slightly accretive to earnings per share in its first two months. Unfortunately, while the international integration is proceeding, we have not yet been able to engage the full power of BJ because of the whole separate order imposed on us by the Department of Justice, which has kept us from combining operations in the United States. As you may know, full integration of our business in the U.S. is predicated on our selling two simulations vessels on the Gulf of Mexico and related assets in order to create a fourth competitor and the same control of stimulation services in the Gulf. 
On July 6, we announced that we have reached agreement with a buyer on the sale of the vessels and the associated assets. We now look forward to the DOJ's approval of the grid sale, so we can integrate U.S. operations and take advantage of the opportunities of the combined company in what is our largest shared market.
I do want to take just a minute and comment on the Deepwater Horizon accident. This is clearly a tragedy and we cannot forget the fact that 11 lives were lost. A loss of life, the oil spill and the drilling moratorium will test all of us here in the Gulf coast. With so many rigs idled, Baker Hughes has redeployed over 300 people and also a substantial amount of equipment as we move to U.S. land and international offshore markets where deepwater drilling continues. We do remain committed to the deepwater drilling industry. While the loss of life and environmental damages are significant, we believe the industry will rebound. I was working in the U.K. in 1988 when the Piper Alpha disaster occurred. That accident left 165 people dead and resulted in significant improvements in operations in the North Sea and throughout the industry.
Operating procedures and safety standards were strengthened and enforced and accident rates have been substantially reduced. The Deepwater Horizon accident likely will result in a similar process and technology improvements that will reduce the risks of deepwater development. Already, customers from around the world were asking service companies to certify that their employees have the right competencies to work offshore. Many are asking us to help train their people, and they're demanding quality programs to verify that equipment does the job that it's told to do. 
Financially, the Gulf of Mexico moratorium has negatively impacting our business on the shelf and in the deepwater, with a potential impact of $0.08 to $0.11 per share per quarter in the second half of the year. As was the case with Piper Alpha in the North Sea some 20 years ago, government and the industry must worked together to find the answers and to begin moving forward.
As to our outlook, we expect our North America Land business to continue its solid performance as unconventional gas and oil directed drilling in U.S. continues to grow and as the Canada market rebound seasonally. We look forward to completing our integration with BJ Services and attacking this market with our full suite of products and services, and we believe international markets will continue to improve. Deepwater activity outside the United States will continue to be strong. And finally, we expect our emphasis on operational efficiency to help us improve our international margins significantly by year end. 
So at this point, I'm going to turn it over to Peter to go through the financials, and then he's going to hand it off to Martin for a review of some operations. Peter?"

This morning, we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $93 million or $0.23 per share. Adding back the impact of a $0.13 charge for acquisition-related cost, our earnings were $0.36 per share.

Adding back the impact of a $0.13 charge for acquisition-related cost, our earnings were $0.36 per share. This compares to $0.28 per share a year ago and $0.41 per share for the first quarter of 2010. 
Q2 was a very complicated quarter, with a number of factors that impacted results and our disclosure. Last quarter, we gave guidance that our earnings would have been in the low 40s, excluding the impact of the acquisition-related cost, purchase price adjustments for BJ Services and a tax rate between 33% and 34%. So excluding the merger-related cost of $0.13, step up in depreciation and amortization of $0.05 and about a $0.03 impact from the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium, underlying operating earnings would have been about $0.44.  This also excludes the impact of the change in tax rate of about $0.07.
You will notice this morning that we changed our reporting segments from Drilling and Evaluation and Completion and Production to five new segments: North America, Latin America, Europe Africa Russia Caspian, Middle East Asia-Pacific, which are all the same names we used before but they've been replotted slightly, and a new segment called, Industrial and Other. The new Industrial and Other segment consists of our Global Downstream Chemicals, Pipeline Inspection and Reservoir Technology and Consulting businesses. BJ Services historical segments have also been remapped into this five new segments. This was a natural outcome of the organization began last May and recognizes that the transition period, product line management to geographic management has ended, and that our primary process for evaluating performance and allocating resources is now on geographic lines.
Many significant changes were related to our acquisition of BJ Services in April 28. Acquisition-related costs, expense in the current quarter were $56 million before tax, $51 million after-tax or $0.13 per share. We acquired BJ mid-quarter, so Q2 only includes results for May and June. U.S. GAAP results from BJ for prior periods are not included in our prior periods.
We issued 118 million shares, representing 27.6% of the company, which brought our total share count to a little over 430 million shares. The average share count for the second quarter was 399 million shares. During Q2, our purchase price allocation process for BJ services progress to the point, where we can now provide a reasonable estimate of the fair value adjustments relating to inventory, PP&E and intangibles. As it currently stands, we're ending up with about $1.8 billion in intangibles and a PP&E step up of about $475 million.
In addition, as part of the ongoing purchase price allocation analysis, we identified certain transaction cost of approximately $196 million, that we have included as part of the purchase price consideration and then included the amount as part of goodwill. 
The preliminary incremental non-cash charge for D&A, depreciation and amortization, is about $172 million annually or about $43 million per quarter. These D&A amounts are offset somewhat by reduced interest expense of $4 million a quarter resulting from a debt reevaluation. This of course is subject to change as we complete our valuation work.
Since Q2 includes only two months of BJ, the net impact in this quarter was about $26 million before tax, $18 million after-tax or about $0.05 per share. This charge impacts our reported operating margins, it is allocated to the segments based on where BJ's assets are, mostly North America, Latin America and Asia.
As Chad said, for the short two months, BJ Services has contributed to our earnings, it is already accretive on an earnings per share basis and accounted for about 1/3 of the company's EBITDA. This morning, we also provided supplemental information for Q1 2008 through Q2 2010 by quarter. This schedule, which is available on our website as an Excel spreadsheet, shows revenue and operating income for our new segments for Baker Hughes and BJ Services on a pro forma combined basis, including the D&A charges and excluding synergies.
Our tax rate in the quarter was 44%. Significantly higher than our previous guidance, reflecting a 39% rate for the first half of 2010. So Q2 reflects this rate along with a true up for the first quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to profits below expectations in certain African countries. This results in unbenefited tax losses in some foreign jurisdictions, where tax losses in countries that impose taxes on revenues were deemed profit. In addition, profits are well over plan in North America at marginal rates between 35% and 37%, and the BJ Services tax rate is planned at 36.5%.
After operations. Q2 revenue was $3.4 billion, up 44% or $1.04 billion year-over-year and up 33% or $835 million sequentially, primarily due to the addition of BJ Services for two months. 
Looking at quarterly comparisons by segment. North American revenue was $1.5 billion in the second quarter, up 115% year-over-year and up 62% sequentially. Revenue outside of North America is $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 13% year-on-year and up 16% sequentially. Industrial and Other revenue was $223 million in the first quarter, up 34% year-on-year and up 18% sequentially.
As outlined on Table 3 of the earnings release, on a combined pro forma basis, combining BJ Services' and Baker Hughes' results for all prior periods and adding in just the month of April 2010 results for BJ Services, Q2 revenue would have been $3.75 billion, an increase of $629 million or 20% compared to the same period a year ago, and an increase of $88 million or 2% sequentially. Q2 North America revenue would have been $1.73 billion, up $658 million or 61% year-over-year and up $87 million or 5% sequentially. 
Outside North America, revenue would have been $1.77 billion, down 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. And Industrial and Other revenue would have been $247 million, up 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Referencing again Table 3 on a pro forma combined basis, our oilfield operating margin for the second quarter was 10%, up 100 basis points from 9% in the first quarter.
International margins were flat sequentially at 7%, including the BJ Services businesses. And North America margins increased 300 basis points despite the spring breakup in Canada and the impact of the drilling moratorium. In Q2, our combined corporate costs were $56 million compared to $49 million in Q1 for Baker Hughes stand alone. 
Turning to balance sheet. At quarter end, our total debt was $2.9 billion. In the second quarter, we used $480 million in cash and issued $320 million of Commercial Paper in total to fund the $800 million cash portion of the BJ transaction. We also assumed $500 million in debt from BJ Services. Our total debt-to-cap ratio was 18%. We had cash of $900 million and our net debt was $2 billion and our net debt cap ratio was 12%. We also completed two other acquisitions in the quarter for $154 million. 
Following the BJ Services transaction, we met with the rating agencies to review our financial condition and our long-term plan. The rating agencies reaffirmed our debt ratings, A by S&P and A2 by Moody's. Today, we have $1.7 billion of committed credit facilities consisting of a three-year $1.2 billion facility accessible through March 2013, and our existing $500 million facility accessible through July 2012.
Last, a few thoughts on guidance for the third quarter and the balance of the year. We expect to have a tax rate of 37% to 38%. As mentioned previously, the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium will have an impact of $0.08 to $0.11 per share per quarter, we expect corporate cost of $60 million in Q3. And we are on track to meet our first year synergy targets. Finally, CapEx for the combination on a pro forma basis is unchanged at $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.

And as I look back over that year, I'm pleased with the progress we've made and the short timeframe in which we did it, and I look forward to capitalizing on the enormous potential of this combined organization.
North America had a good quarter. The U.S. rig count averaged 1,506 rigs in the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 571 rigs or 61% from the second quarter of '09, and an increase of 161 rigs or 12% compared to the previous quarter. The horizontal rig count for the second quarter of 2010 increased 102% year-over-year and increased 18% sequentially, reflecting the increase in drilling activity in the unconventional reservoirs. At least 90% of the growth in the U.S. rig count was concentrated in six active plays. 
Horizontal Drilling and hydraulic fracturing are prominent in all of these plays and as such, we saw high differential growth in fracturing and related products including our growing Frac-Point multistage completion system. Our AddFRAC frac-fluid treatment service and our extremely successful line of composite plugs. Our ability to ramp up to meet demand for these plug systems is one recent tangible benefit of our new supply chain organization. We've reviewed and overhauled the manufacturing processes, enabling us to double production in less than 12 months and capitalize on this near-term market opportunity.
Another couple of highlights for U.S. Land operations this quarter, Hess Corporation awarded Baker Hughes a five-year contract for directional drilling services, drill bits, drilling fluids, pressure pumping, cased hole wireline, logging, packers and completion systems in North Dakota's Bakken Shale play. Also in the Bakken, Baker Hughes installed the first Frac-Point multistage frac system to be instrumented with downhaul fiber optics and electronic monitoring sensors and a 20,000 foot horizontal well, so the customer can acquire realtime downhaul data during the fracturing operations.
In the Gulf of Mexico, our business had built up strong sequential momentum prior to the moratorium. We're taking the actions necessary to properly manage the downturn, yet insure we retain our market-leading position once the activity recovers. As Chad mentioned, we remain committed to providing differentiated technology for deepwater applications in the Gulf. During the quarter, for example, Baker Hughes installed electrical submersible pumping systems in two vertical subsea boosting stations located on the seabeds at Shell's deepwater Perdido Field in the Gulf of Mexico. These pumping systems have the capacity to boost up to 125,000 barrels of fluid per day.
Canada has had a seasonal spring breakup, yet I'm happy to report that Canada is rebounding quickly, and we sense that Q3 will be a strong quarter for us. The BJ merger has given us an especially strong franchise position in Canada, and the teams are integrating at a great pace and sharing ideas and opportunities to leverage the synergies there. For example, one of the largest SAGD producers in Canada awarded us the contract to complete all of their 50 SAGD heavy  oil wells in 2010.
Latin America has a very diverse mix of geomarkets. We are experiencing strong performance in the Andean and Brazil geomarkets. In Brazil, for example, we were awarded and offshore multiproduct contract for a Brazilian independent, the second most active operator in the country. The award includes directional drilling, logging while drilling, wireline and surface logging and realtime monitoring services. Not much has changed in either Venezuela, which remains difficult because of the payment issues or in the Southern Cone, which is dominated by high operating cost particularly labor cost in Argentina. Mexico is, however, the most disappointing. Budget cuts have idled industry capacity and flooded nearby markets, creating incremental pricing pressure in what was already a low-priced market.
In Europe, revenues declined in the quarter, primarily due to a dramatic but temporary shift in activity from drilling and evaluation in Norway in the first quarter to completions in Q2, and the impact of a stronger dollar on our local currency service revenues in the U.K. compared to the first quarter. In June, we open our Eco-Centre Waste Management Facility in Peterhead, Scotland, to serve the North sea with environmentally compliant waste processing services from the rig site to final disposal. And as Chad mentioned, our results in Africa were disappointing and won't show meaningful improvement until Q4. Activity in Africa had been strong in the last couple of quarters, however, projects in four countries finished during the quarter for us. Operations in Angola are down to a rig dispute that halted work on a major project of ours. And in North Africa, Q2 revenues were impacted by project delays in Algeria and severe budget cuts by our customers in Libya. In Russia, activity improved in the second quarter, over a weak Q1 and as long as oil prices remain above $70, we believe our customers will continue to invest.
Our Middle East performance was driven by the Saudi Arabia and Gulf geomarkets, as key product deliveries of screen, ESPs and safety valves were completed. In Saudi Arabia, the mobilization of our coiled tubing drilling rig was delayed for the entire quarter, but the project is now underway. A second hybrid rig is in the country and will be mobilized next quarter. Our Saudi Arabia geomarket, received a purchase order for 30 permanent downhaul monitoring systems to be used in conjunction with intelligent well systems, and we achieved the milestone of completing and controlling more than 1 million feet of reservoir section with EQUALIZER technology.
Our operation in Iraq is up and running. We will install our first ESP this months, and I'm pleased to announce that we signed a three-year technical services agreement with the Iraqi South Oil Co. for the deployment of wireline data acquisition and logging services. 
We saw growth across the broad region of Asia Pacific, specifically in the completion, artificial lift and fluids product lines and growth was strongest in Australia and Indonesia. During the quarter, we were awarded upper completion contracts in Australia and drilling and evaluation service contracts in Indonesia and China. PetroChina awarded Baker Hughes a contract to supply 77 multistage open hole Frac-Point completions systems for horizontal wells in China's second largest onshore oil and gas field. We also signed a strategic two-year framework agreement with PetroChina Tarim Oilfield Co. to supply directional and vertical drilling systems, formation evaluation services, completion services, artificial lift technology and electrical submersible pump systems in the Tarim field in Northwest China.
Some final words on our merger with BJ Services. From an international perspective, the BJ Services acquisition is fundamentally complete and the international teams from both organizations have been meeting to develop joint approaches to customers and to exploit the co-location opportunities. We've also begun to see some benefits in our international operations. In Indonesia, Baker Hughes is getting chemical treatment business based on BJ Services' ongoing coiled tubing operations in that country.
In the UAE, Baker Hughes and BJ Services obtained a joint contract to work on seven offshore rigs together. And in Iraq, we're moving BJ Services coiled tubing and cementing units onto the Baker Hughes base that's already established in country. 
We're 14 months into our geographic organization, the structure has improved our ability to understand our market and better serve our customers. It has enabled us to standardize numerous functional processes and procedures and implement our supply chain strategy. All of which were impossible on the previous structure. Today we're focused on leveraging the benefits of the international geomarkets to improve productivity and efficiency and to fine tune our overhead and support cost at our geomarket, region, product line and corporate functions. We will be making adjustments focused on international margins.
Finally, I want to let you know that our supply chain initiatives are proceeding full steam ahead. We are consolidating vendors and leveraging our purchasing power. We have trimmed our manufacturing footprint and adopted lean manufacturing processes to deliver more output from the same fixed cost base. We're also reviewing labor costs globally and working to geographically align our manufacturing capacity to more efficiently supply customers in our geomarkets. Again, all of this made possible by last year's reorganization. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad."

Africa and Q4, Q1 of last year and this last quarter is very strong, but fell off for various regions in North Africa and parts of West Africa in Q2, and that will carry through into Q3. And we see Africa, kind of, back in Q4. Also, we see in Europe, Norway, which has been very strong for us and a shift mainly from drilling to completions. But that already is moving back into the drilling sides, so we see Norway return in Q3 and Q4. U.K. is picking up. I mean, the rig count is forecast to be up around 20% for the second half of the year versus first half, so we see that improving there with the strength in Europe. Both Middle East and Asia by Q4, again, I think Q3 is going to be, kind of, a quarter similar probably to Q2. But I think by Q4, we're starting to see different activity from Iraq to these contracts in the Emirates, there's some work in Oman, Egypt's picking up.

In terms of, how do we see the margins progressing and why, I will make a follow-up on some of the comments Chad made. Across all product lines and across all of the key basins in U.S., we've begun to see price movement. And obviously, in some of the product lines, directional drilling, as well as some of the key completion technologies, like our Frac-Point and our composite plugs, there's differential pricing movement there. I think we're also seeing in some of those key basins, our customers' prepared, besides just a supply tightening, there was a strong focus on the customers to improve their efficiency, improve the recoverable numbers. Some of the drilling is getting tougher, not easier, even though we're drilling further in more concentrated profiles. So we're seeing a willingness like never before to pay for technology in certain debates. And certainly, it's not across all customers yet, but that's gaining some traction. And then, we are very anxious, more so than anybody out there listening to get this whole separate off of us. And the numbers we're presenting today are really just an accounting exercise of adding BJ for two months in us. And that's not why we bought BJ. And you know that, Marshall, there's a whole lot of synergy that a couple of our competitors are able to enjoy. And it's not just on the cost side, more importantly in this market, it's in the solutions that we're able to bring forward to the customer. And we were probably less able to do that now since the announcement of the acquisition than before. So, we're running it separately as we're supposed to. So working together, being very selective on the prize, but more aggressive than in the past, and by no means as U.S. land dried up when it comes to technology, so I'd say that's the three main areas, if that answers your question."

Now I do think that by the end of the year and into next year, that we'll probably resume. Algeria was a big place where there was a lot of work going on, on project management. I don't think that stopped because of a concern about project management. It stopped because of the change of management in Sonatrach. And we are seeing -- the guys sat down, as Martin said, internationally between the BJ and Baker Hughes folks and identified some $2.3 billion worth of opportunity over the next 12 months of going in together to tender on projects. Some of those should win without pressure pumping. In some cases, you're able to get pull through, so it's hard to break it up. I think without a doubt, we see the future internationally, with the sea mane[ph], the coiled tubing and the pressure pumping, a lot of pull through in opportunity."

Following up on two pretty decent quarters, our great results this past quarter is mixed.

Following up on two pretty decent quarters, our great results this past quarter is mixed. On a positive side, operationally, we performed better than expected in North America, Russia and Asia Pacific, where we made some significant improvements sequentially.
In North America, we are now well positioned to benefit from the continued increase in our unconventional gas development. And as for our acquisition of BJ Services turned out to be pretty well timed. As a leader in completions, directional drilling, bits and now, pressure pumping, we have the full tool kit we need to compete in the unconventional shale plays. Sequentially, our U.S. Land business showed strong growth. However, the sequential improvement for North America as a whole was muted in Q2 by the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico, and of course, spring breakup in Canada. Now that we own BJ services, our revenue in the Canadian market has increased by about 80%, as both companies enjoy a very strong presence in the country. 
Revenues in Russia made significant improvement both year-over-year, as well as sequentially. Our acquisition of Oilpump Services has given us the uncontested number two position in the Russian ESP [electrical submersible pumping] market, which is the largest ESP market in the world. And in Asia, our new geomarket organization is beginning to deliver contract land wins and improved share. Aside from the temporary slowdown in the Norwegian drilling activity, our European region performed well during the quarter. And in the Middle East, we're winning some contracts and expanding our presence in Iraq. On the other hand, in Africa and Latin America, where we have invested heavily, revenue has lagged and our profit is below our expectations.
Africa is particularly difficult challenge for us right now. In North Africa, Libya has announced 30% budget cuts, spending in Algeria is recovering slowly following the change in the management of Sonotrack and Nigeria revenue is down following significant Q4 '09 and Q1 '10 deliveries for the Total Usan completion project. As a result, profits declined in the region and resulted in the temporary increase in our tax rates in some countries, which calculate tax as a percentage of revenue.
As for Latin America, we're disappointed with the progress we've made in Mexico. In the second quarter, we're on just two rigs on the ALMA Marine project and if you recall, this is to be a seven rig, 15 well contract. So despite strong operational performance and a significant investment to support larger scale operations, we have been unable to procure more activity. This contract is up for renewal during this quarter, and at this time we intend to let it lapse. 
Africa and Latin American regions do have some bright spots. Sub-Sahara Africa revenue was up strong year-over-year, and we're seeing strong year-over-year and sequential performance in our Andean and Brazilian geomarkets. Also in Brazil, we obtain a good contract for the second most active Brazilian operator that further diversify their customer base in the country. 
In the quarter, we completed our first year under our new geographical organization, and I'm pleased with our accomplishments in several different areas. We sought to improve our understanding of the market, moving from eight different product line views to a coherent view of each local market and the global market as a whole, and we've done that. We wanted to do a better job of setting R&D priorities for the organization, thus reflecting market priorities. And now, we have a process in place to do that.
We wanted to make sure that we didn't compromised our standards for field execution and safety. And today, we have maintained our high level of service quality, as well as our HSE standards. We decided to launch a multiyear effort to upgrade our supply chain and we're beginning to see the benefits of this transformation. We wanted to address the market share growth challenges of the past, and under the new organization we've made progress. Over the last several quarters, we have kept pace with our peers and we are achieving higher success rates on tenders.
We also said that the new business model would help us achieve long-term profitability and that is where additional work is required. International margins remain disappointing. I believe we are now about three to four months behind where we expected to be at this time. Now that the regional organizations have a year under their belt, we're increasing our focus on improving efficiency and returning our international margins to acceptable level.
On April 28, we closed on our acquisition of BJ Services and began integrating its international operations into those of Baker Hughes. We've established reporting relationships for both BJ and Baker Hughes international managers, and we've aligned operating territories in order to improve coordination between the product lines. Financially, BJ Service has already had a positive impact in our results, excluding the acquisition related costs, and it was slightly accretive to earnings per share in its first two months. Unfortunately, while the international integration is proceeding, we have not yet been able to engage the full power of BJ because of the whole separate order imposed on us by the Department of Justice, which has kept us from combining operations in the United States. As you may know, full integration of our business in the U.S. is predicated on our selling two simulations vessels on the Gulf of Mexico and related assets in order to create a fourth competitor and the same control of stimulation services in the Gulf. 
On July 6, we announced that we have reached agreement with a buyer on the sale of the vessels and the associated assets. We now look forward to the DOJ's approval of the grid sale, so we can integrate U.S. operations and take advantage of the opportunities of the combined company in what is our largest shared market.
I do want to take just a minute and comment on the Deepwater Horizon accident. This is clearly a tragedy and we cannot forget the fact that 11 lives were lost. A loss of life, the oil spill and the drilling moratorium will test all of us here in the Gulf coast. With so many rigs idled, Baker Hughes has redeployed over 300 people and also a substantial amount of equipment as we move to U.S. land and international offshore markets where deepwater drilling continues. We do remain committed to the deepwater drilling industry. While the loss of life and environmental damages are significant, we believe the industry will rebound. I was working in the U.K. in 1988 when the Piper Alpha disaster occurred. That accident left 165 people dead and resulted in significant improvements in operations in the North Sea and throughout the industry.
Operating procedures and safety standards were strengthened and enforced and accident rates have been substantially reduced. The Deepwater Horizon accident likely will result in a similar process and technology improvements that will reduce the risks of deepwater development. Already, customers from around the world were asking service companies to certify that their employees have the right competencies to work offshore. Many are asking us to help train their people, and they're demanding quality programs to verify that equipment does the job that it's told to do. 
Financially, the Gulf of Mexico moratorium has negatively impacting our business on the shelf and in the deepwater, with a potential impact of $0.08 to $0.11 per share per quarter in the second half of the year. As was the case with Piper Alpha in the North Sea some 20 years ago, government and the industry must worked together to find the answers and to begin moving forward.
As to our outlook, we expect our North America Land business to continue its solid performance as unconventional gas and oil directed drilling in U.S. continues to grow and as the Canada market rebound seasonally. We look forward to completing our integration with BJ Services and attacking this market with our full suite of products and services, and we believe international markets will continue to improve. Deepwater activity outside the United States will continue to be strong. And finally, we expect our emphasis on operational efficiency to help us improve our international margins significantly by year end. 
So at this point, I'm going to turn it over to Peter to go through the financials, and then he's going to hand it off to Martin for a review of some operations. Peter?"

This morning, we reported net income on a U.S. GAAP basis of $93 million or $0.23 per share. Adding back the impact of a $0.13 charge for acquisition-related cost, our earnings were $0.36 per share.

Adding back the impact of a $0.13 charge for acquisition-related cost, our earnings were $0.36 per share. This compares to $0.28 per share a year ago and $0.41 per share for the first quarter of 2010. 
Q2 was a very complicated quarter, with a number of factors that impacted results and our disclosure. Last quarter, we gave guidance that our earnings would have been in the low 40s, excluding the impact of the acquisition-related cost, purchase price adjustments for BJ Services and a tax rate between 33% and 34%. So excluding the merger-related cost of $0.13, step up in depreciation and amortization of $0.05 and about a $0.03 impact from the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium, underlying operating earnings would have been about $0.44.  This also excludes the impact of the change in tax rate of about $0.07.
You will notice this morning that we changed our reporting segments from Drilling and Evaluation and Completion and Production to five new segments: North America, Latin America, Europe Africa Russia Caspian, Middle East Asia-Pacific, which are all the same names we used before but they've been replotted slightly, and a new segment called, Industrial and Other. The new Industrial and Other segment consists of our Global Downstream Chemicals, Pipeline Inspection and Reservoir Technology and Consulting businesses. BJ Services historical segments have also been remapped into this five new segments. This was a natural outcome of the organization began last May and recognizes that the transition period, product line management to geographic management has ended, and that our primary process for evaluating performance and allocating resources is now on geographic lines.
Many significant changes were related to our acquisition of BJ Services in April 28. Acquisition-related costs, expense in the current quarter were $56 million before tax, $51 million after-tax or $0.13 per share. We acquired BJ mid-quarter, so Q2 only includes results for May and June. U.S. GAAP results from BJ for prior periods are not included in our prior periods.
We issued 118 million shares, representing 27.6% of the company, which brought our total share count to a little over 430 million shares. The average share count for the second quarter was 399 million shares. During Q2, our purchase price allocation process for BJ services progress to the point, where we can now provide a reasonable estimate of the fair value adjustments relating to inventory, PP&E and intangibles. As it currently stands, we're ending up with about $1.8 billion in intangibles and a PP&E step up of about $475 million.
In addition, as part of the ongoing purchase price allocation analysis, we identified certain transaction cost of approximately $196 million, that we have included as part of the purchase price consideration and then included the amount as part of goodwill. 
The preliminary incremental non-cash charge for D&A, depreciation and amortization, is about $172 million annually or about $43 million per quarter. These D&A amounts are offset somewhat by reduced interest expense of $4 million a quarter resulting from a debt reevaluation. This of course is subject to change as we complete our valuation work.
Since Q2 includes only two months of BJ, the net impact in this quarter was about $26 million before tax, $18 million after-tax or about $0.05 per share. This charge impacts our reported operating margins, it is allocated to the segments based on where BJ's assets are, mostly North America, Latin America and Asia.
As Chad said, for the short two months, BJ Services has contributed to our earnings, it is already accretive on an earnings per share basis and accounted for about 1/3 of the company's EBITDA. This morning, we also provided supplemental information for Q1 2008 through Q2 2010 by quarter. This schedule, which is available on our website as an Excel spreadsheet, shows revenue and operating income for our new segments for Baker Hughes and BJ Services on a pro forma combined basis, including the D&A charges and excluding synergies.
Our tax rate in the quarter was 44%. Significantly higher than our previous guidance, reflecting a 39% rate for the first half of 2010. So Q2 reflects this rate along with a true up for the first quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to profits below expectations in certain African countries. This results in unbenefited tax losses in some foreign jurisdictions, where tax losses in countries that impose taxes on revenues were deemed profit. In addition, profits are well over plan in North America at marginal rates between 35% and 37%, and the BJ Services tax rate is planned at 36.5%.
After operations. Q2 revenue was $3.4 billion, up 44% or $1.04 billion year-over-year and up 33% or $835 million sequentially, primarily due to the addition of BJ Services for two months. 
Looking at quarterly comparisons by segment. North American revenue was $1.5 billion in the second quarter, up 115% year-over-year and up 62% sequentially. Revenue outside of North America is $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 13% year-on-year and up 16% sequentially. Industrial and Other revenue was $223 million in the first quarter, up 34% year-on-year and up 18% sequentially.
As outlined on Table 3 of the earnings release, on a combined pro forma basis, combining BJ Services' and Baker Hughes' results for all prior periods and adding in just the month of April 2010 results for BJ Services, Q2 revenue would have been $3.75 billion, an increase of $629 million or 20% compared to the same period a year ago, and an increase of $88 million or 2% sequentially. Q2 North America revenue would have been $1.73 billion, up $658 million or 61% year-over-year and up $87 million or 5% sequentially. 
Outside North America, revenue would have been $1.77 billion, down 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. And Industrial and Other revenue would have been $247 million, up 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Referencing again Table 3 on a pro forma combined basis, our oilfield operating margin for the second quarter was 10%, up 100 basis points from 9% in the first quarter.
International margins were flat sequentially at 7%, including the BJ Services businesses. And North America margins increased 300 basis points despite the spring breakup in Canada and the impact of the drilling moratorium. In Q2, our combined corporate costs were $56 million compared to $49 million in Q1 for Baker Hughes stand alone. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, our total debt was $2.9 billion. In the second quarter, we used $480 million in cash and issued $320 million of Commercial Paper in total to fund the $800 million cash portion of the BJ transaction. We also assumed $500 million in debt from BJ Services. Our total debt-to-cap ratio was 18%. We had cash of $900 million and our net debt was $2 billion and our net debt to cap ratio was 12%. We also completed two other acquisitions in the quarter for $154 million. 
Following the BJ Services transaction, we met with the rating agencies to review our financial condition and our long-term plan. The rating agencies reaffirmed our debt ratings, A by S&P and A2 by Moody's. Today, we have $1.7 billion of committed credit facilities consisting of a three-year $1.2 billion facility accessible through March 2013, and our existing $500 million facility accessible through July 2012.
Last, a few thoughts on guidance for the third quarter and the balance for the year. We expect to have a tax rate of 37% to 38%. As mentioned previously, the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium will have an impact of $0.08 to $0.11 per share per quarter. We expect corporate cost of $60 million in Q3. And we are on track to meet our first year synergy targets. Finally, CapEx for the combination on a pro forma basis is unchanged at $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.
I'll now turn the call over to Martin, who will highlight our geographic results. Martin?"

As Chad mentioned, this quarter marks the first year for our new organization. And as I look back over that year, I'm pleased with the progress we've made and the short timeframe in which we did it, and I look forward to capitalizing on the enormous potential of this combined organization.
North America had a good quarter. The U.S. rig count averaged 1,506 rigs in the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 571 rigs or 61% from the second quarter of '09, and an increase of 161 rigs or 12% compared to the previous quarter. The horizontal rig count for the second quarter of 2010 increased 102% year-over-year and increased 18% sequentially, reflecting the increase in drilling activity in the unconventional reservoirs. At least 90% of the growth in the U.S. rig count was concentrated in six active plays. 
Horizontal Drilling and hydraulic fracturing are prominent in all of these plays and as such, we saw high differential growth in fracturing and related products including our growing Frac-Point multistage completion system. Our AddFRAC frac-fluid treatment service and our extremely successful line of composite plugs. Our ability to ramp up to meet demand for these plug systems is one recent tangible benefit of our new supply chain organization. We've reviewed and overhauled the manufacturing processes, enabling us to double production in less than 12 months and capitalize on this near-term market opportunity.
Another couple of highlights for U.S. Land operations this quarter, Hess Corporation awarded Baker Hughes a five-year contract for directional drilling services, drill bits, drilling fluids, pressure pumping, cased hole wireline, logging, packers and completion systems in North Dakota's Bakken Shale play. Also in the Bakken, Baker Hughes installed the first Frac-Point multistage frac system to be instrumented with downhaul fiber optics and electronic monitoring sensors and a 20,000 foot horizontal well, so the customer can acquire realtime downhaul data during the fracturing operations.
In the Gulf of Mexico, our business had built up strong sequential momentum prior to the moratorium. We're taking the actions necessary to properly manage the downturn, yet insure we retain our market-leading position once the activity recovers. And Chad mentioned, we remain committed to providing differentiated technology for deepwater applications in the Gulf. During the quarter, for example, Baker Hughes installed electrical submersible pumping systems in two vertical subsea boosting stations located on the seabed at Shell's deepwater Perdido Field in the Gulf of Mexico. These pumping systems have the capacity to boost up to 125,000 barrels of fluid per day.
Canada has had a seasonal spring breakup, yet I'm happy to report that Canada is rebounding quickly, and we sense that Q3 will be a strong quarter for us. The BJ merger has given us an especially strong franchise position in Canada, and the teams are integrating at a great pace and sharing ideas and opportunities to leverage the synergies there. For example, one of the largest SAGD producers in Canada awarded us the contract to complete all of their 50 SAGD heavy  oil wells in 2010.
Latin America has a very diverse mix of geomarkets. We are experiencing strong performance in the Andean and Brazil geomarkets. In Brazil, for example, we were awarded and offshore multiproduct contract for a Brazilian independent, the second most active operator in the country. The award includes directional drilling, logging while drilling, wireline and surface logging and realtime monitoring services. Not much has changed in either Venezuela, which remains difficult because of the payment issues or in the Southern Cone, which is dominated by high operating cost particularly labor cost in Argentina. Mexico is however, the most disappointing. Budget cuts have idled industry capacity and flooded nearby markets, creating incremental pricing pressure in what was already a low-priced market.
In Europe, revenues declined in the quarter, primarily due to a dramatic but temporary shift in activity from drilling and evaluation in Norway in the first quarter to completions in Q2, and the impact of a stronger dollar on our local currency service revenues in the U.K. compared to the first quarter. In June, we open our Eco-Centre Waste Management Facility in Peterhead, Scotland, to serve the North sea with environmentally compliant waste processing services from the rig site to final disposal. And as Chad mentioned, our results in Africa were disappointing and won't show meaningful improvement until Q4. Activity in Africa had been strong in the last couple of quarters, however, projects in four countries finished during the quarter for us. Operations in Angola are down to a rig dispute that halted work on a major project of ours. And in North Africa, Q2 revenues were impacted by project delays in Algeria and severe budget cuts by our customers in Libya. In Russia, activity improved in the second quarter, over a weak Q1 and as long as oil prices remain above $70, we believe our customers will continue to invest.
Our Middle East performance was driven by the Saudi Arabia and Gulf geomarkets, as key product deliveries of screen, ESPs and safety valves were completed. In Saudi Arabia, the mobilization of our coiled tubing drilling rig was delayed for the entire quarter, but the project is now underway. A second hybrid rig is in the country and will be mobilized next quarter. Our Saudi Arabia geomarket, received a purchase order for 30 permanent downhaul monitoring systems to be used in conjunction with intelligent well systems, and we achieved the milestone of completing and controlling more than 1 million feet of reservoir section with EQUALIZER technology.
Our operation in Iraq is up and running. We will install our first ESPs this month, and I'm pleased to announce that we signed a three-year technical services agreement with the Iraqi South Oil Co. for the deployment of wireline data acquisition and logging services. 
We saw growth across the broad region of Asia Pacific, especially in the completion, artificial lift and fluids product lines and growth was strongest in Australia and Indonesia. During the quarter, we were awarded upper completion contracts in Australia and drilling and evaluation service contracts in Indonesia and China. PetroChina awarded Baker Hughes a contract to supply 77 multistage open hole Frac-Point completions systems for horizontal wells in China's second largest onshore oil and gas field. We also signed a strategic two-year framework agreement with PetroChina Tarim Oilfield Co. to supply directional and vertical drilling systems, formation evaluation services, completion services, artificial lift technology and electrical submersible pump systems in the Tarim field in Northwest China.
Some final words on our merger with BJ Services. From an international perspective, the BJ Services acquisition is fundamentally complete and the international teams from both organizations have been meeting to develop joint approaches to customers and to exploit the collocation opportunities. We've also begun to see some benefits in our international operations. In Indonesia, Baker Hughes is getting chemical treatment business based on BJ Services' ongoing coiled tubing operations in that country.
In the UAE, Baker Hughes and BJ Services obtained a joint contract to work on seven offshore rigs together. And in Iraq, we're moving BJ Services coiled tubing and cementing units onto the Baker Hughes base that's already established in country. 
We're 14 months into our geographic organization, the structure has improved our ability to understand our market and better serve our customers. It has enabled us to standardize numerous functional processes and procedures and implement our supply chain strategy. All of which were impossible on the previous structure. Today we're focused on leveraging the benefits of the international geomarkets to improve productivity and efficiency and to fine tune our overhead and support cost at our geomarket, region, product line and corporate functions. We will be making adjustments focused on international margins.
Finally, I want to let you know that our supply chain initiatives are proceeding full steam ahead. We are consolidating vendors and leveraging our purchasing power. We have trimmed our manufacturing footprint and adopted lean manufacturing processes to deliver more output from the same fixed cost base. We're also reviewing labor costs globally and working to geographically align our manufacturing capacity to more efficiently supply customers in our geomarkets. Again, all of this made possible by last year's reorganization. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad."

But that already is moving back into the drilling sides, so we see Norway return in Q3 and Q4. U.K. is picking up. I mean, the rig count is forecast to be up around 20% for the second half of the year versus first half, so we see that improving there with the strength in Europe. Both Middle East and Asia by Q4, again, I think Q3 is going to be, kind of, a quarter similar probably to Q2. But I think by Q4, we're starting to see different activity from Iraq to these contracts in the Emirates, there's some work in Oman, Egypt's picking up.

I think we're also seeing in some of those key basins, our customers' prepared, besides just a supply tightening, there was a strong focus on the customers to improve their efficiency, improve the recoverable numbers. Some of the drilling is getting tougher, not easier, even though we're drilling further in more concentrated profiles. So we're seeing a willingness like never before to pay for technology in certain debates. And certainly, it's not across all customers yet, but that's gaining some traction. And then, we are very anxious, more so than anybody out there listening to get this whole separate off of us. And the numbers we're presenting today are really just an accounting exercise of adding BJ for two months in us. And that's not why we bought BJ. And you know that, Marshall, there's a whole lot of synergy that a couple of our competitors are able to enjoy. And it's not just on the cost side, more importantly in this market, it's in the solutions that we're able to bring forward to the customer. And we were probably less able to do that now since the announcement of the acquisition than before. So, we're running it separately as we're supposed to. So working together, being very selective on the prize, but more aggressive than in the past, and by no means as U.S. land dried up when it comes to technology, so I'd say that's the three main areas, if that answers your question."

And then Of course, what's happened in Mexico has not turned out to be the best projects for anybody who have geared up for it, so I think that slowed down a little bit. Now I do think that by the end of the year and into next year, that we'll probably resume. Algeria was a big place where there was a lot of work going on, on project management. I don't think that stopped because of a concern about project management. It stopped because of the change of management in Sonatrach. And we are seeing -- the guys sat down, as Martin said, internationally between the BJ and Baker Hughes folks and identified some $2.3 billion worth of opportunity over the next 12 months of going in together to tender on projects. Some of those should win without pressure pumping. In some cases, you're able to get pull through, so it's hard to break it up. I think without a doubt, we see the future internationally, with the sea mane[ph], the coiled tubing and the pressure pumping, a lot of pull through in opportunity."

19007,114084289,83908,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Gary. Good morning. This morning, we reported net income on a GAAP basis of $255 million, or $0.59 per share. Earnings per share were up $0.41 compared to a year ago, and up $0.36 from last quarter. Revenue was $4.1 billion, up 83%, or almost $1.9",986,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning. This morning, we reported net income on a GAAP basis of $255 million, or $0.59 per share. Earnings per share were up $0.41 compared to a year ago, and up $0.36 from last quarter. Revenue was $4.1 billion, up 83%, or almost $1.9 billion compared to a year ago, and up 21% or $700 million sequentially.  And EBITDA per share was $1.64, which was up $0.71 or 76% compared to a year ago and up $0.26 or 19% from last quarter.
There were a couple of adjustments that should be made to compare results to our previous guidance. First, our tax rate before acquisition-related costs was 32.5%. Let me just point something out, that we had $12 million in tax benefits from acquisition-related costs in addition to the $12 million pretax charge, so the net result was about zero on the acquisition cost on a per share basis.
The overall decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to the actions we took in the third quarter to repatriate certain foreign earnings, ultimately resulting in a reduction of current and future U.S. taxes. The Federal tax rate in the middle of our 37% to 38% guidance, the favorable impact of the lower actual tax rate was approximately $0.04 per share.
Second, we've revised our estimate with the amortization associated with the BJ Services acquisition. This calculation will not be final until the end of the year. However, our best estimate is that the incremental amortization charge will now be $120 million per year, or approximately $30 million per quarter. As a result, the amortization expense associated with the step-up was $9 million lower than our guidance for the third quarter, approximately $0.01 a share.
So from the GAAP EPS of $0.59, subtract $0.04 from the impact of lower tax rate, subtract $0.01 for the impact of lower quarterly amortization charges, that brings you to $0.54.
To help you in understanding the moving pieces, I'll bridge the Q3 '09 EPS to Q3 '10 EPS. GAAP EPS for Q3 '09 was $0.18 per share, add $0.03 for lower corporate cost, subtract $0.02 for higher net interest cost, subtract $0.05 for the impact of the higher share count, offset partially by the effect of the lower effective tax rate, subtract $0.03 for the impact of the incremental amortization costs and last, to get to EPS this quarter, add $0.48 from operations, including the acquisition of BJ Services to arrive at $0.59 per share.
Bridging the sequential quarters, GAAP EPS for Q2 2010 was $0.23 per share, add back second quarter acquisition-related costs of $56 million before tax, $51 million after tax, or $0.13 per share. The impact of the lower tax rate, offset partially by the higher average share count, added about $0.04 per share, subtract $0.01 per share for higher net interest expense. Last, to get to EPS this quarter, add about $0.20 per share from operations, including the impact of having BJ Services on-board for the entire quarter to arrive at $0.59 per share.
In Table 3 of our earnings release, we provide financial information on a pro forma combined basis, with revenue and profit before tax of BJ Services included into the prior period's results to allow meaningful comparisons between quarters. Because of the reduction in amortization, this morning, we also provide a revision to the pro forma supplemental information for Q1 2008 to Q3 2010 by quarter. This schedule is available on our website.
From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin refer explicitly to Table 3.
Revenue in North America was $2 billion, up 71% compared to a year ago, and up 16% sequentially. North America operating profits were $340 million, up $356 million year-over-year, and up 52% sequentially.
International revenue was $1.8 billion, up 6% compared to a year ago, and up 1% compared to the previous quarter. International operating profit margin was 5% compared to 11% a year ago, and 7% last quarter.
Our industrial and other segment revenue was $278 million, up 10% compared to last year, and up 13% compared to last quarter. Operating profit was $36 million, up 29% compared to a year ago and up 80% sequentially.
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter end, our total debt was $3.8 billion. During the quarter, we sold $1.5 billion of 5 1/8% senior notes due 2040. We used a portion of the net proceeds to pay back approximately $500 million of our outstanding commercial paper, and we intentionally paid $250 million of BJ Services outstanding 5.75% bonds in June 2011 the company will use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
Our capital expenditures in the third quarter were $466 million, which is in line with our earlier guidance for 2010 annual capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and short-term investments, plus we had $1.7 billion available under our committed credit facilities. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%, our net debt was $2 billion and our net debt-to-capital ratio was 11%.
Last, I want to share a few thoughts on guidance for Q4. Net interest expense in Q4 should be about $52 million, which includes a full quarter of the $1.5 billion notes. Corporate spending should be within a $50 million to $55 million range. Taxes should be between 36% and 37%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $305 million and $350 million. We expect capital expenditures in Q4 to be between $550 million and $600 million, which will put total 2010 CapEx around $1.7 billion.
We do not expect a major pickup of activity in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter, and stand by our earlier estimate of $0.08 to $0.11 per share impact below normal operating conditions. I'll now turn the call over to Martin, who will highlight our geographic results. Martin?"

Let me start with North America. Revenue increased to 71% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, matching the 71% and 19% increases in the North American rig count, a solid achievement given the negative impact of the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater",1752,"Thanks, Peter. Let me start with North America. Revenue increased to 71% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, matching the 71% and 19% increases in the North American rig count, a solid achievement given the negative impact of the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater drilling moratorium on activity, revenue and profit.
The overall service and technology intensity of North American land drilling continues to increase. In the United States, horizontal drilling, primarily in the unconventional oil and gas plays, has more than doubled year-over-year and increased 13% sequentially.
The unconventional reservoirs are demanding our best technology to deliver longer horizontals, complex completions, increasing frac horse power and more frac stages. This demand for advanced technology is in turn, driving the business and supporting both higher revenue per rig and associated higher prices. 
Operating margins increased 1,800 basis points year-over-year, and 400 basis points sequentially to 17%. Incremental margins were in excess of 40%, both year-over-year and sequentially, despite the lower activity in the Gulf this quarter.
Before I turn to our International segments, I need to address the current situation in the Gulf of Mexico. The impact of the moratorium and the pause in drilling permit approval was about as we guided in our last conference call at $0.09. While we are encouraged that the deepwater moratorium was lifted a few weeks ago, we did not expect a significant increase in drilling in the fourth quarter.
In the longer term, Baker Hughes is very well-positioned for the return of activity in the Gulf. With our two new pressure pumping vessels, the Blue Dolphin and the Blue Tarpon, we were able to offer best-in-class pressure pumping capabilities, exceeding the delivery capability of the nearest competitor by over 50%.
Our current tank control vessel utilization has been high, supporting frac, gravel pack and stimulation activities on the shelf. And in fact, our backlog is at an all-time record high.
Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year led by the Andean and Brazi geomarkets. Revenue increased 2% sequentially, led by the Brazil geomarket. Both year-over-year and sequential growth rates exceeded market growth rates this quarter. The only geomarket to report revenue declines year-over-year or sequentially, was the Venezuela Mexico geomarket.
Profit margins were flat sequentially. Latin America continues to be a series of contrasting stories. Performance is strong in Brazil and in the Andean geomarket, driven by national oil companies push-driving to increase their production. The Southern Cone and Venezuela Mexico geomarkets continue to be the most challenging.
We're continuing to react to our customers' budget cuts in Mexico by redeploying equipment to more attractive markets, and where required, reducing our staffing levels. We finished drilling operations on the final Alma Marine well, and expect to run this completion assembly in the next few weeks.
In Brazil, we continue to build on our strong relationship with Petrobras, and are expanding our business with other foreign and Brazilian operators. Technology continues to be key to performance in Brazil, both offshore and increasingly, on land. 
In the third quarter, we successfully deployed a 12 1/4 inch primary drill bit for the first time in a northeast Brazil land application. This hybrid bit combines the most attractive features of both roller cone and fixed-cutter bits in a single product.
We've made over 90 runs, and have drilled a total of more than 100,000 feet worldwide with this bit. The primary bit has been running in the United States, Canada, Ecuador, Oman, Saudi Arabia and now, on land in Brazil. In this particular application, the bit was able to drill 20% further and 90% faster than standard Tricone Bits.
The Andean geomarket continues to be one of our best performing geomarkets on any continent. All of our product lines are well-represented. In the quarter, we won a $137 million eight-year contract extension from Repsol for the exclusive supply and maintenance of ESP Systems and were awarded a two-year contract by an independent for full-service well construction solution that includes drilling and evaluation systems, fluids and to many pumping services.
Turning to the Eastern Hemisphere. First, in the Europe Africa Russia Caspian segment, revenue increased 6% compared to a year ago, led by directional drilling and artificial lift. Growth was led by the Russia Caspian and U.K. geomarket, offset partially by lower revenue from Africa. Sequentially, revenues were down 1% as revenue declined in Africa and Norway, offset increases in other geomarkets.
Improvements in profits in the U.K. and Continental Europe geomarkets were offset by lower profits in Norway, Russia Caspian and in Africa. The weakness in the Norway market was temporary. Driven by a more extensive than anticipated summer rig maintenance program, activity has returned to normal levels in October and should remain relatively solid through the winter.
U.K. and Continental Europe activity has been strong and is expected to stay strong this winter. In Norway, we secured a multimillion-dollar integrated project for the Borgland Dolphin Consortium to provide service integration and planning, including directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, mud logging, fluids, wireline logging and coring services. The contract covers an initial three-year period for full exploration program on the Norwegian continental shelf, encompassing 15 wells.
Activity in Africa remains weak. North Africa is soft as activity has not improved in either Libya nor Algeria. In the North Africa geomarket, we have been awarded a tender for directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, coring liner-hanger spits [ph] (18:52), and cementing by Occidental to drill 22 onshore exploration wells on six separate concessions in Libya. The two-year program starts in the first quarter of 2011.
In the Sub-Saharan African geomarket, our local joint venture there won a 10-year offshore production chemicals contract with a super major in Angola. 
Now turning to the Middle East Asia Pacific segment, revenue was up 6% compared to a year ago, led by sales of chemicals, artificial lift and completion systems in Southeast Asia and Egypt geomarkets.  Sequential growth was 5% led by increased sales of directional drilling and oilfield chemicals. 
Revenues were up significantly in the Southeast Asia geomarket. With relatively modest growth in the market, the preponderance of long-term contracts and ample equipment, pricing has not improved yet. Improvements in profitability in the near future will be dependent on market growth and share gains that help us absorb fixed overhead, and the success of our ability to improve operational efficiency.
In Saudi Arabia, the customers focused on increasing gas production from tight reservoirs. We're introducing technology developed for the North American tight gas plays into the kingdom. We recently installed Frac-Point multizone completion equipment in five wells with tight gas reservoirs. This solution allows a client to selectively stimulate individual sections in long horizontal well to optimize the production and recovery rate. We also are providing technical expertise on formation evaluation and geomechanics.
And in Iraq, the South Oil company has run it's first wireline job using Baker Hughes' equipment under the three-year technical services agreement signed last quarter.
In the South East Asia geomarket, we secured a major contract in the Philippines. We will be providing cementing, directional drilling and drilling fluid services on five rigs as part of a two-year contract with a 50-well work scope. Our robust product and services offering for the HPHT [high-pressure, high-temperature] industry, in conjunction with the established presence of BJ Services in the Philippines were critical factors in the award.
In the Indonesia geomarket, we completed a two multizone single trip completion system, or MST gravel pack, in a single well, isolating two differentially pressured zones. This completion builds on the success of BJ's MST, which has had over 35 successful runs to date, with documented savings of 70% of rig count from approximately 20 days to 3.5 days.
Looking at our International operations in total, I'm pleased with our revenue performance. Revenue grew 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, exceeding that of the market. This is a positive sign that our new geographic organization is making a difference. And we're pleased with our geomarket management teams, as they are demonstrating a more holistic view of the market, developing closer relations with our customers, communicating clear market-driven priorities to our products and technology organization. They're executing and delivering high-quality products and services to our customers and they've maintained high levels of HSE performance.
International margins did not improve sequentially, as we indicated in our last conference call. While I remain disappointed, we've not been idle this quarter. Let me briefly review the actions we've taken. 
We believe that our organizational change resulted in some redundancies and inefficiencies in our overhead. We aggressively addressed this issue in the third quarter, and we incurred about $15 million in severance costs. The benefits of our cost-cutting should become visible next quarter and have full impact in 2011.
We indicated that we could make our organization more efficient and reduce additional overhead costs in the longer-term. We began that process this quarter and eliminated four geomarkets and the redundant management by combining Venezuela and Mexico, Sub-Sahara Africa along with Angola, North Africa coupled to Libya, and combining Russia and Caspian geomarkets.
Third, we revalidated our supply chain cost savings goals of $300 million over three years so we're on track. We committed to cost synergies with BJ Services of $75 million in year one and an additional $75 million in year one and an additional $75 million in year two. These savings are in progress and will occur as projected. Revenue synergies will also contribute to improving our profitability. 
Finally and most importantly, we've put this organization together to gain share and promote long term profitable growth. As demonstrated in the last several quarters, revenues have either tracked or exceeded the market. My focus now is to deliver acceptable margins.
Before I turn this over to Chad, let me cover our Industrial segment. This segment is composed principally of our industrial chemicals, process and pipeline technology businesses. Revenue increased 10% year-on-year, and was up 13% sequentially in the seasonally strong third quarter. The segment posted a 13% profit margin in the quarter compared to an 11% margin a year ago, and 8% last quarter. 
This quarter, Baker Hughes formed an alliance with a global cargo inspection and certification company to provide cargo treatment added as services to the petroleum industry. The alliance offers a fast and effective spectrum of services for fuel and bulk cargos to meet trade specifications using our partner's testing and inspection infrastructure and Baker Hughes' P2R or PREPARED TO RESPOND fuel additives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad."
19007,114084289,83908,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","All right. Thank you, Martin. As Martin and Peter both highlighted, our results this quarter were dominated by our performance in North America. With oil prices holding in the $75 to $80 range, we experienced strong growth in all direct drilling in both u",980,"All right. Thank you, Martin. As Martin and Peter both highlighted, our results this quarter were dominated by our performance in North America. With oil prices holding in the $75 to $80 range, we experienced strong growth in all direct drilling in both unconventional and conventional areas, and we do expect that this trend is going to continue into 2011.
Drilling for natural gas has stabilized with a high percentage of the rigs drilling in the unconventional plays and increasingly on the wetter side of these plays. Together, the demand for drilling and unconventional reservoirs, whether it's for oil or for natural gas, is driving strong demand for directional drilling, complex completions and pressure pumping.
Currently, we believe the increase in drilling for either oil or wet gas will offset any drilling weakness in dry gas. It is important to note that pressure pumping is a key technology for developing both types of these reservoirs. And while we have owned BJ Services since April, we really had full access to BJ in only the last month of the third quarter. So the restrictions of the whole separate quarter now removed, we can finally act on the opportunities we have to leverage our newly acquired pressure pumping capabilities in North America.
Since the order was lifted, the U.S. sales teams have been working together to pull through products and services when possible. And on some cases, people and equipment are already committed, and as they roll off of the contract, we can then leverage our pressure pumping resources.
A good example of what our combined company is now able to deliver to our customers is a case in Canada for a large independent. Our AutoTrak Rotary Steerable system and drill bits were used to drill a horizontal well on the Horn River unconventional gas play. The well was completed with a 10-stage Frac-Point open-whole fracturing system, with a Baker Hughes integrated insight fiber optic monitoring system. BJ supplied all the cementing and all the hydraulic fracturing services. 
And in West Texas, the strength of the BJ Services relationship with an independent, resulted in them being able to pull through our wireline and perforating services on up to two frac jobs per week for our Permian Basin customer.
Another recent award was on the West Coast when the Baker Hughes and the BJ Services team bid together and were awarded a 30-well perforating and pressure pumping contract by a super major. And a final example on the Northeast, BJ leveraged the relationship with an independent to pull through other Baker Hughes products and services. The pull-through value will total nearly $10 million a year in new incremental revenue.
Now all this being said, the frac market is tight. Backlogs for pressure pumping remains strong and vary between regions from anywhere from 90 to 180 days. We're investing an incremental frac capacity to service both the growing intensity and the growing volume of the North American frac market.
Part of our long-term strategic plan call for filling some gaps that we had in our portfolio in order to make us more competitive. Of course, one of those gaps was pressure pumping, which I just addressed. The other was to build out our reservoir capability. 
Over the last couple of years, we have acquired several reservoir engineering companies, beginning with gap decline [ph] (27:32), GMI [GeoMechanics International] and most recently, Meyer & Associates. This has resulted in our achieving the critical mass needed to be recognized by our customers as a serious player in reservoir consultancy.
Beginning in Q4, continuing on into 2011, we're going to work to improve our customers' economics by using the full spectrum of our products and services, from geological and geomechanical analysis, to drilling, perforating, hydraulic fracturing and completing conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells. 
We can now engage with our customers from exploration appraisals to development, production and ultimately, rejuvenation of mature fields.  These recent acquisitions result in our being well-positioned not only in North America but other markets worldwide. 
Looking outside North America to the rest of the world, the International market continues to grow albeit slowly, and with $75-plus oil price in an expanding global economy, it should continue to grow in 2011 and in time, support higher pricing. For now, low pricing improvement is elusive. And while the rig count is above its previous highs in Asia Pacific and Africa, it lags in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.
In fact, if you look at the change in the rig count for the individual countries since September 2008, you'll find that land rigs in India, Syria and Kuwait has increased by more than 40. And unfortunately, these rigs simply aren't driving the same premium as the rigs in Australia, Oman or Saudi Arabia that they replaced.
In closing, our new organization, to me, is going through a period of adaptation. On the positive side, we are much closer to our client. And as we've mentioned before, our customers, they like this new organization and that's not a bad thing when you're a serious company. As a result, we are winning work. Revenue growth versus our peers, as Martin mentioned, has remained strong over the last several quarters. 
On the other hand, we have to work, we have some work to do on the International margin front. Martin  outlined our plans for improving our margins performance internationally. This is the number one priority for the entire management team at Baker Hughes. We need to fine-tune the operation, consolidate areas of redundancy, realize the benefits from the new supply chain organization, determine the optimum geomarket structure and continue to grow the top line.
These steps have all been addressed and it will result in improved margins beginning this quarter, Q4, and carrying into 2011. Okay. Gary, why don't we open it up for some questions?"

Europe has not changed much, really, if you look at the margins, down a little bit. Africa has been where our challenge has been, and that's offsetting everything in Europe to defect all of work. And then the other area clearly is Latin America, where we've got another focus. Martin mentioned about some consolidation we're doing in that area to bring that -- some of the costs down in that area. We're happy with the way we're seeing Far East going. We've seen some nice gains there, both on a revenue side and some improvement on the bottom line side there. And the Middle East, we think will come back next year. So that's our target right now."

And therefore, from a year-on-year type basis, we should see improved margins on North America. And of course, hopefully, we're looking at what's going on with the Gulf of Mexico. And if we can see some rational thinking back there again, and get back to some drilling and other things then that will be a huge swing for us.

If we thought that the market was kind of better defined in terms of what the scope was going to be, what the risk profile is going to be. But I think as you've heard from a couple of our peers, the bidding activity there is very high and there's a lot of work to be done. And this is both from the national oil company, as well as the foreign participants. Let me put it this way, we've participated in every IPM bid, to use that term. We've obviously submitted prices but we've been on the sidelines in terms of getting on the field when the pricing environment is so unattractive. Again, given the fact that, if you see what happened in Mexico, if you see what's happened in some of these other high-profile IPM bids, the opportunity to make a profit is very limited. So I think the industry, our side of the industry, needs to rethink the way it approaches it. That aside, you're right, the reason that we reorganized into the geomarket organization was to grow the top line at  faster rates that what we were experiencing before. And as I said in my comments, that's happening. But the best way to further grow those margins is to continue to grow that top line. We're taking actions that we can most -- near-term control in terms of the cost, in getting those down and particularly, in the overhead functions where we experienced some redundancy. Now in terms of trying to get other business, as I said in the comments, there's an incredible response by the customer community, which I think is being rewarded already with the work we're getting. We see the BJ organization stimulating even further, working together. And I can tell you that whether it's Vietnam, whether it's Australia, whether it's the big award we just got in the Philippines, whether it's bringing BJ more solidly into our business in Norway, we're seeing a lot of nice projects come our way. But the final point I'll make here, Scott, is that unlike North America which is a transactional market, we reorganized 18 months. Officially, we had all of our people in place, probably about a year ago. And the international market is not transactional, there's contracts there that are years in the making. And by that, I mean it takes months for the tender to come out, it takes months for the tender to be awarded, it takes months sometimes to mobilize. And it can take months for the customer to actually start spending. So you put that on top of contracts that already ran three to five years. It's not surprising that it takes a while to rebuild the revenue. But in terms of the mechanics, the way we're executing out there, I'm very happy with the job the guys are doing in terms of building their share."

That, plus the fact that, as Martin went through, we've made some consolidation and tweaking, if you call it that, for the geomarket structure. This is normal.

Now if we start to see some things softening or whatever as we go into 2011, doesn't mean that we still won't continue to build out some fluid ends, power ends, engines.

We're putting equipment in there, there's that startup cost but there's also just the infrastructure buildout cost, the facilities etc., which we know are going to be there for the next 30 years. One thing, Robin, I want to clarify, that 15% exit rate that we talked about isn't just going to come just all internally. We are expecting that we will see some improvement in the International activity. We said that it would be modest in growing. But we do expect some of that to benefit the margin side as well and, of course, we also feel from the steps that we're taking on the cost side and organization side, that it will contribute quite a bit itself. I think we're pretty well-positioned. If 2011 is a surprise and the second half comes on strong, we have spent a lot of money over these last five years, both in the solid facility infrastructure side, bricks and mortars, you might say, but also on the human capital side. We have a much stronger International management team based in these key markets, again, much closer to the customer, which I think is one of the reasons why we're seeing some success on the revenue side now. So we'll be able to respond. We're in much, much stronger position today than we were a few years ago to handle International growth. And that's why we did all this, that's what we're counting on."

19007,114084289,83923,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Gary. Good morning. This morning, we reported net income on a GAAP basis of $255 million, or $0.59 per share. Earnings per share were up $0.41 compared to a year ago, and up $0.36 from last quarter. Revenue was $4.1 billion, up 83%, or almost $1.9",986,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning. This morning, we reported net income on a GAAP basis of $255 million, or $0.59 per share. Earnings per share were up $0.41 compared to a year ago, and up $0.36 from last quarter. Revenue was $4.1 billion, up 83%, or almost $1.9 billion compared to a year ago, and up 21% or $700 million sequentially.  And EBITDA per share was $1.64, which was up $0.71 or 76% compared to a year ago and up $0.26 or 19% from last quarter.
There were a couple of adjustments that should be made to compare results to our previous guidance. First, our tax rate before acquisition-related costs was 32.5%. Let me just point something out, that we had $12 million in tax benefits from acquisition-related costs in addition to the $12 million pretax charge, so the net result was about zero on the acquisition cost on a per share basis.
The overall decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to the actions we took in the third quarter to repatriate certain foreign earnings, ultimately resulting in a reduction of current and future U.S. taxes. The Federal tax rate in the middle of our 37% to 38% guidance, the favorable impact of the lower actual tax rate was approximately $0.04 per share.
Second, we've revised our estimate with the amortization associated with the BJ Services acquisition. This calculation will not be final until the end of the year. However, our best estimate is that the incremental amortization charge will now be $120 million per year, or approximately $30 million per quarter. As a result, the amortization expense associated with the step-up was $9 million lower than our guidance for the third quarter, approximately $0.01 a share.
So from the GAAP EPS of $0.59, subtract $0.04 from the impact of lower tax rate, subtract $0.01 for the impact of lower quarterly amortization charges, that brings you to $0.54.
To help you in understanding the moving pieces, I'll bridge the Q3 '09 EPS to Q3 '10 EPS. GAAP EPS for Q3 '09 was $0.18 per share, add $0.03 for lower corporate cost, subtract $0.02 for higher net interest cost, subtract $0.05 for the impact of the higher share count, offset partially by the effect of the lower effective tax rate, subtract $0.03 for the impact of the incremental amortization costs and last, to get to EPS this quarter, add $0.48 from operations, including the acquisition of BJ Services to arrive at $0.59 per share.
Bridging the sequential quarters, GAAP EPS for Q2 2010 was $0.23 per share, add back second quarter acquisition-related costs of $56 million before tax, $51 million after tax, or $0.13 per share. The impact of the lower tax rate, offset partially by the higher average share count, added about $0.04 per share, subtract $0.01 per share for higher net interest expense. Last, to get to EPS this quarter, add about $0.20 per share from operations, including the impact of having BJ Services on-board for the entire quarter to arrive at $0.59 per share.
In Table 3 of our earnings release, we provide financial information on a pro forma combined basis, with revenue and profit before tax of BJ Services included into the prior period's results to allow meaningful comparisons between quarters. Because of the reduction in amortization, this morning, we also provide a revision to the pro forma supplemental information for Q1 2008 to Q3 2010 by quarter. This schedule is available on our website.
From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin refer explicitly to Table 3.
Revenue in North America was $2 billion, up 71% compared to a year ago, and up 16% sequentially. North America operating profits were $340 million, up $356 million year-over-year, and up 52% sequentially.
International revenue was $1.8 billion, up 6% compared to a year ago, and up 1% compared to the previous quarter. International operating profit margin was 5% compared to 11% a year ago, and 7% last quarter.
Our industrial and other segment revenue was $278 million, up 10% compared to last year, and up 13% compared to last quarter. Operating profit was $36 million, up 29% compared to a year ago and up 80% sequentially.
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter end, our total debt was $3.8 billion. During the quarter, we sold $1.5 billion of 5 1/8% senior notes due 2040. We used a portion of the net proceeds to pay back approximately $500 million of our outstanding commercial paper, and we intentionally paid $250 million of BJ Services outstanding 5.75% bonds in June 2011 the company will use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
Our capital expenditures in the third quarter were $466 million, which is in line with our earlier guidance for 2010 annual capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and short-term investments, plus we had $1.7 billion available under our committed credit facilities. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%, our net debt was $2 billion and our net debt-to-capital ratio was 11%.
Last, I want to share a few thoughts on guidance for Q4. Net interest expense in Q4 should be about $52 million, which includes a full quarter of the $1.5 billion notes. Corporate spending should be within a $50 million to $55 million range. Taxes should be between 36% and 37%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $305 million and $350 million. We expect capital expenditures in Q4 to be between $550 million and $600 million, which will put total 2010 CapEx around $1.7 billion.
We do not expect a major pickup of activity in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter, and stand by our earlier estimate of $0.08 to $0.11 per share impact below normal operating conditions. I'll now turn the call over to Martin, who will highlight our geographic results. Martin?

Let me start with North America.

Let me start with North America. Revenue increased to 71% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, matching the 71% and 19% increases in the North American rig count, a solid achievement given the negative impact of the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater drilling moratorium on activity, revenue and profit.
The overall service and technology intensity of North American land drilling continues to increase. In the United States, horizontal drilling, primarily in the unconventional oil and gas plays, has more than doubled year-over-year and increased 13% sequentially.
The unconventional reservoirs are demanding our best technology to deliver longer horizontals, complex completions, increasing frac horse power and more frac stages. This demand for advanced technology is in turn, driving the business and supporting both higher revenue per rig and associated higher prices. 
Operating margins increased 1,800 basis points year-over-year, and 400 basis points sequentially to 17%. Incremental margins were in excess of 40%, both year-over-year and sequentially, despite the lower activity in the Gulf this quarter.
Before I turn to our International segments, I need to address the current situation in the Gulf of Mexico. The impact of the moratorium and the pause in drilling permit approval was about as we guided in our last conference call at $0.09. While we are encouraged that the deepwater moratorium was lifted a few weeks ago, we did not expect a significant increase in drilling in the fourth quarter.
In the longer term, Baker Hughes is very well-positioned for the return of activity in the Gulf. With our two new pressure pumping vessels, the Blue Dolphin and the Blue Tarpon, we were able to offer best-in-class pressure pumping capabilities, exceeding the delivery capability of the nearest competitor by over 50%.
Our current tank control vessel utilization has been high, supporting frac, gravel pack and stimulation activities on the shelf. And in fact, our backlog is at an all-time record high.
Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year led by the Andean and Brazi geomarkets. Revenue increased 2% sequentially, led by the Brazil geomarket. Both year-over-year and sequential growth rates exceeded market growth rates this quarter. The only geomarket to report revenue declines year-over-year or sequentially, was the Venezuela Mexico geomarket.
Profit margins were flat sequentially. Latin America continues to be a series of contrasting stories. Performance is strong in Brazil and in the Andean geomarket, driven by national oil companies push-driving to increase their production. The Southern Cone and Venezuela Mexico geomarkets continue to be the most challenging.
We're continuing to react to our customers' budget cuts in Mexico by redeploying equipment to more attractive markets, and where required, reducing our staffing levels. We finished drilling operations on the final Alma Marine well, and expect to run this completion assembly in the next few weeks.
In Brazil, we continue to build on our strong relationship with Petrobras, and are expanding our business with other foreign and Brazilian operators. Technology continues to be key to performance in Brazil, both offshore and increasingly, on land. 
In the third quarter, we successfully deployed a 12 1/4 inch primary drill bit for the first time in a northeast Brazil land application. This hybrid bit combines the most attractive features of both roller cone and fixed-cutter bits in a single product.
We've made over 90 runs, and have drilled a total of more than 100,000 feet worldwide with this bit. The primary bit has been running in the United States, Canada, Ecuador, Oman, Saudi Arabia and now, on land in Brazil. In this particular application, the bit was able to drill 20% further and 90% faster than standard Tricone Bits.
The Andean geomarket continues to be one of our best performing geomarkets on any continent. All of our product lines are well-represented. In the quarter, we won a $137 million eight-year contract extension from Repsol for the exclusive supply and maintenance of ESP Systems and were awarded a two-year contract by an independent for full-service well construction solution that includes drilling and evaluation systems, fluids and to many pumping services.
Turning to the Eastern Hemisphere. First, in the Europe Africa Russia Caspian segment, revenue increased 6% compared to a year ago, led by directional drilling and artificial lift. Growth was led by the Russia Caspian and U.K. geomarket, offset partially by lower revenue from Africa. Sequentially, revenues were down 1% as revenue declined in Africa and Norway, offset increases in other geomarkets.
Improvements in profits in the U.K. and Continental Europe geomarkets were offset by lower profits in Norway, Russia Caspian and in Africa. The weakness in the Norway market was temporary. Driven by a more extensive than anticipated summer rig maintenance program, activity has returned to normal levels in October and should remain relatively solid through the winter.
U.K. and Continental Europe activity has been strong and is expected to stay strong this winter. In Norway, we secured a multimillion-dollar integrated project for the Borgland Dolphin Consortium to provide service integration and planning, including directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, mud logging, fluids, wireline logging and coring services. The contract covers an initial three-year period for full exploration program on the Norwegian continental shelf, encompassing 15 wells.
Activity in Africa remains weak. North Africa is soft as activity has not improved in either Libya nor Algeria. In the North Africa geomarket, we have been awarded a tender for directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, coring liner-hanger spits [ph] (18:52), and cementing by Occidental to drill 22 onshore exploration wells on six separate concessions in Libya. The two-year program starts in the first quarter of 2011.
In the Sub-Saharan African geomarket, our local joint venture there won a 10-year offshore production chemicals contract with a super major in Angola. 
Now turning to the Middle East Asia Pacific segment, revenue was up 6% compared to a year ago, led by sales of chemicals, artificial lift and completion systems in Southeast Asia and Egypt geomarkets.  Sequential growth was 5% led by increased sales of directional drilling and oilfield chemicals. 
Revenues were up significantly in the Southeast Asia geomarket. With relatively modest growth in the market, the preponderance of long-term contracts and ample equipment, pricing has not improved yet. Improvements in profitability in the near future will be dependent on market growth and share gains that help us absorb fixed overhead, and the success of our ability to improve operational efficiency.
In Saudi Arabia, the customers focused on increasing gas production from tight reservoirs. We're introducing technology developed for the North American tight gas plays into the kingdom. We recently installed Frac-Point multizone completion equipment in five wells with tight gas reservoirs. This solution allows a client to selectively stimulate individual sections in long horizontal well to optimize the production and recovery rate. We also are providing technical expertise on formation evaluation and geomechanics.
And in Iraq, the South Oil company has run it's first wireline job using Baker Hughes' equipment under the three-year technical services agreement signed last quarter.
In the South East Asia geomarket, we secured a major contract in the Philippines. We will be providing cementing, directional drilling and drilling fluid services on five rigs as part of a two-year contract with a 50-well work scope. Our robust product and services offering for the HPHT [high-pressure, high-temperature] industry, in conjunction with the established presence of BJ Services in the Philippines were critical factors in the award.
In the Indonesia geomarket, we completed a two multizone single trip completion system, or MST gravel pack, in a single well, isolating two differentially pressured zones. This completion builds on the success of BJ's MST, which has had over 35 successful runs to date, with documented savings of 70% of rig count from approximately 20 days to 3.5 days.
Looking at our International operations in total, I'm pleased with our revenue performance. Revenue grew 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, exceeding that of the market. This is a positive sign that our new geographic organization is making a difference. And we're pleased with our geomarket management teams, as they are demonstrating a more holistic view of the market, developing closer relations with our customers, communicating clear market-driven priorities to our products and technology organization. They're executing and delivering high-quality products and services to our customers and they've maintained high levels of HSE performance.
International margins did not improve sequentially, as we indicated in our last conference call. While I remain disappointed, we've not been idle this quarter. Let me briefly review the actions we've taken. 
We believe that our organizational change resulted in some redundancies and inefficiencies in our overhead. We aggressively addressed this issue in the third quarter, and we incurred about $15 million in severance costs. The benefits of our cost-cutting should become visible next quarter and have full impact in 2011.
We indicated that we could make our organization more efficient and reduce additional overhead costs in the longer-term. We began that process this quarter and eliminated four geomarkets and the redundant management by combining Venezuela and Mexico, Sub-Sahara Africa along with Angola, North Africa coupled to Libya, and combining Russia and Caspian geomarkets.
Third, we revalidated our supply chain cost savings goals of $300 million over three years so we're on track. We committed to cost synergies with BJ Services of $75 million in year one and an additional $75 million in year one and an additional $75 million in year two. These savings are in progress and will occur as projected. Revenue synergies will also contribute to improving our profitability. 
Finally and most importantly, we've put this organization together to gain share and promote long term profitable growth. As demonstrated in the last several quarters, revenues have either tracked or exceeded the market. My focus now is to deliver acceptable margins.
Before I turn this over to Chad, let me cover our Industrial segment. This segment is composed principally of our industrial chemicals, process and pipeline technology businesses. Revenue increased 10% year-on-year, and was up 13% sequentially in the seasonally strong third quarter. The segment posted a 13% profit margin in the quarter compared to an 11% margin a year ago, and 8% last quarter. 
This quarter, Baker Hughes formed an alliance with a global cargo inspection and certification company to provide cargo treatment added as services to the petroleum industry. The alliance offers a fast and effective spectrum of services for fuel and bulk cargos to meet trade specifications using our partner's testing and inspection infrastructure and Baker Hughes' P2R or PREPARED TO RESPOND fuel additives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad.

19007,114084289,83923,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","All right. Thank you, Martin. As Martin and Peter both highlighted, our results this quarter were dominated by our performance in North America. With oil prices holding in the $75 to $80 range, we experienced strong growth in all direct drilling in both u",980,"All right. Thank you, Martin. As Martin and Peter both highlighted, our results this quarter were dominated by our performance in North America. With oil prices holding in the $75 to $80 range, we experienced strong growth in all direct drilling in both unconventional and conventional areas, and we do expect that this trend is going to continue into 2011.
Drilling for natural gas has stabilized with a high percentage of the rigs drilling in the unconventional plays and increasingly on the wetter side of these plays. Together, the demand for drilling and unconventional reservoirs, whether it's for oil or for natural gas, is driving strong demand for directional drilling, complex completions and pressure pumping.
Currently, we believe the increase in drilling for either oil or wet gas will offset any drilling weakness in dry gas. It is important to note that pressure pumping is a key technology for developing both types of these reservoirs. And while we have owned BJ Services since April, we really had full access to BJ in only the last month of the third quarter. So the restrictions of the whole separate quarter now removed, we can finally act on the opportunities we have to leverage our newly acquired pressure pumping capabilities in North America.
Since the order was lifted, the U.S. sales teams have been working together to pull through products and services when possible. And on some cases, people and equipment are already committed, and as they roll off of the contract, we can then leverage our pressure pumping resources.
A good example of what our combined company is now able to deliver to our customers is a case in Canada for a large independent. Our AutoTrak Rotary Steerable system and drill bits were used to drill a horizontal well on the Horn River unconventional gas play. The well was completed with a 10-stage Frac-Point open-whole fracturing system, with a Baker Hughes integrated insight fiber optic monitoring system. BJ supplied all the cementing and all the hydraulic fracturing services. 
And in West Texas, the strength of the BJ Services relationship with an independent, resulted in them being able to pull through our wireline and perforating services on up to two frac jobs per week for our Permian Basin customer.
Another recent award was on the West Coast when the Baker Hughes and the BJ Services team bid together and were awarded a 30-well perforating and pressure pumping contract by a super major. And a final example on the Northeast, BJ leveraged the relationship with an independent to pull through other Baker Hughes products and services. The pull-through value will total nearly $10 million a year in new incremental revenue.
Now all this being said, the frac market is tight. Backlogs for pressure pumping remains strong and vary between regions from anywhere from 90 to 180 days. We're investing an incremental frac capacity to service both the growing intensity and the growing volume of the North American frac market.
Part of our long-term strategic plan call for filling some gaps that we had in our portfolio in order to make us more competitive. Of course, one of those gaps was pressure pumping, which I just addressed. The other was to build out our reservoir capability. 
Over the last couple of years, we have acquired several reservoir engineering companies, beginning with gap decline [ph] (27:32), GMI [GeoMechanics International] and most recently, Meyer & Associates. This has resulted in our achieving the critical mass needed to be recognized by our customers as a serious player in reservoir consultancy.
Beginning in Q4, continuing on into 2011, we're going to work to improve our customers' economics by using the full spectrum of our products and services, from geological and geomechanical analysis, to drilling, perforating, hydraulic fracturing and completing conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells. 
We can now engage with our customers from exploration appraisals to development, production and ultimately, rejuvenation of mature fields.  These recent acquisitions result in our being well-positioned not only in North America but other markets worldwide. 
Looking outside North America to the rest of the world, the International market continues to grow albeit slowly, and with $75-plus oil price in an expanding global economy, it should continue to grow in 2011 and in time, support higher pricing. For now, low pricing improvement is elusive. And while the rig count is above its previous highs in Asia Pacific and Africa, it lags in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.
In fact, if you look at the change in the rig count for the individual countries since September 2008, you'll find that land rigs in India, Syria and Kuwait has increased by more than 40. And unfortunately, these rigs simply aren't driving the same premium as the rigs in Australia, Oman or Saudi Arabia that they replaced.
In closing, our new organization, to me, is going through a period of adaptation. On the positive side, we are much closer to our client. And as we've mentioned before, our customers, they like this new organization and that's not a bad thing when you're a serious company. As a result, we are winning work. Revenue growth versus our peers, as Martin mentioned, has remained strong over the last several quarters. 
On the other hand, we have to work, we have some work to do on the International margin front. Martin  outlined our plans for improving our margins performance internationally. This is the number one priority for the entire management team at Baker Hughes. We need to fine-tune the operation, consolidate areas of redundancy, realize the benefits from the new supply chain organization, determine the optimum geomarket structure and continue to grow the top line.
These steps have all been addressed and it will result in improved margins beginning this quarter, Q4, and carrying into 2011. Okay. Gary, why don't we open it up for some questions?

Because we're big in the Gulf and we wanted to hold ourselves strong there with our people, because we believe this thing will end. And when it does, we want to be ready for it.

If we thought that the market was kind of better defined in terms of what the scope was going to be, what the risk profile is going to be. But I think as you've heard from a couple of our peers, the bidding activity there is very high and there's a lot of work to be done. And this is both from the national oil company, as well as the foreign participants. Let me put it this way, we've participated in every IPM bid, to use that term. We've obviously submitted prices but we've been on the sidelines in terms of getting on the field when the pricing environment is so unattractive. Again, given the fact that, if you see what happened in Mexico, if you see what's happened in some of these other high-profile IPM bids, the opportunity to make a profit is very limited. So I think the industry, our side of the industry, needs to rethink the way it approaches it. That aside, you're right, the reason that we reorganized into the geomarket organization was to grow the top line at  faster rates that what we were experiencing before. And as I said in my comments, that's happening. But the best way to further grow those margins is to continue to grow that top line. We're taking actions that we can most -- near-term control in terms of the cost, in getting those down and particularly, in the overhead functions where we experienced some redundancy. Now in terms of trying to get other business, as I said in the comments, there's an incredible response by the customer community, which I think is being rewarded already with the work we're getting. We see the BJ organization stimulating even further, working together. And I can tell you that whether it's Vietnam, whether it's Australia, whether it's the big award we just got in the Philippines, whether it's bringing BJ more solidly into our business in Norway, we're seeing a lot of nice projects come our way. But the final point I'll make here, Scott, is that unlike North America which is a transactional market, we reorganized 18 months. Officially, we had all of our people in place, probably about a year ago. And the international market is not transactional, there's contracts there that are years in the making. And by that, I mean it takes months for the tender to come out, it takes months for the tender to be awarded, it takes months sometimes to mobilize. And it can take months for the customer to actually start spending. So you put that on top of contracts that already ran three to five years. It's not surprising that it takes a while to rebuild the revenue.

That, plus the fact that, as Martin went through, we've made some consolidation and tweaking, if you call it that, for the geomarket structure. This is normal. We did it years ago when I was with another company. And I know one of our rig competitors did the same thing when they reorganized and had to do it a couple of times to get it right.

It's the power end, the fluid end and the engine, the chassis, the tractor, those type things. You can get those three, four months out.

Like I've mentioned, BJ had backed up considerably on the building of equipment during the negotiations and other things, rightly so. So we had to kind of rebuild that supply chain link beginning earlier this year. But we're looked at as a major player in this area and so the major suppliers in those points know that Baker Hughes is going to be in this business for a long time, so they jump through hoops to make sure that we get our equipment. I'd say you got to be looking at around six months. Now if we start to see some things softening or whatever as we go into 2011, doesn't mean that we still won't continue to build out some fluid ends, power ends, engines. Those things can go on a shelf and replace existing equipment or problems as we go through these equipment. So we have some flexibility there.

We're putting equipment in there, there's that startup cost but there's also just the infrastructure buildout cost, the facilities etc., which we know are going to be there for the next 30 years. One thing, Robin, I want to clarify, that 15% exit rate that we talked about isn't just going to come just all internally. We are expecting that we will see some improvement in the International activity. We said that it would be modest in growing. But we do expect some of that to benefit the margin side as well and, of course, we also feel from the steps that we're taking on the cost side and organization side, that it will contribute quite a bit itself. I think we're pretty well-positioned. If 2011 is a surprise and the second half comes on strong, we have spent a lot of money over these last five years, both in the solid facility infrastructure side, bricks and mortars, you might say, but also on the human capital side. We have a much stronger International management team based in these key markets, again, much closer to the customer, which I think is one of the reasons why we're seeing some success on the revenue side now. So we'll be able to respond. We're in much, much stronger position today than we were a few years ago to handle International growth. And that's why we did all this, that's what we're counting on.

We're talking a lot to our customers right now, the majors as well as the larger independents, trying to get a feel for when they think they'll get back to work. Right now, we've got quite a bit of activity lined up if they can go back and drill. We think we're in a pretty darn good position to do well in the Gulf once the activity returns. Now that being said, by the end of this quarter, if we don't see a seasonal return or some positive signs then obviously, we're going to have to take the next step in terms of our cost structure in the Gulf and do something about it. But as Martin said, from a vessel side, you look at it, vessel business is doing fairly well even in the downturn because of reworks and some laterals and things like that on the shelf. And it's the best backlog we've seen in that area. So we think there's enough optimism or enough lift right now that is going to strengthen a little bit, starting in Q1, that we're going to hold on a little longer where we have to do anything.

Now that being said, there's a few factors of why we're adding this much horsepower. One, as I mentioned earlier, the attrition rate is very high for the industry, about twice of what it used to run years ago. And the second area is again, we can look at some equipment, every service company ages their equipment, looks at the life of the equipment and so on. And there's a 10-, 11-, 12-year-old equipment out there in the BJ ranks that we want to be able to replace in time anyway.

For a complete and full discussion of these risk factors, please refer to our annual report, 10-K, 10-Q, and in particular, the Forward-looking Disclosure in this morning's news release.
With that, I'll conclude our discussion of the administrative details and turn the call over to Peter Ragauss. Peter?"
19007,114084289,83945,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Gary. Good morning. This morning, we reported net income on a GAAP basis of $255 million, or $0.59 per share. Earnings per share were up $0.41 compared to a year ago, and up $0.36 from last quarter. Revenue was $4.1 billion, up 83%, or almost $1.9",986,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning. This morning, we reported net income on a GAAP basis of $255 million, or $0.59 per share. Earnings per share were up $0.41 compared to a year ago, and up $0.36 from last quarter. Revenue was $4.1 billion, up 83%, or almost $1.9 billion compared to a year ago, and up 21% or $700 million sequentially. And EBITDA per share was $1.64, which was up $0.71 or 76% compared to a year ago and up $0.26 or 19% from last quarter.
There were a couple of adjustments that should be made to compare results to our previous guidance. First, our tax rate before acquisition-related costs was 32.5%. Let me just point something out, that we had $12 million in tax benefits from acquisition-related costs in addition to the $12 million pretax charge, so the net result was about zero on the acquisition cost on a per share basis.
The overall decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to the actions we took in the third quarter to repatriate certain foreign earnings, ultimately resulting in a reduction of current and future U.S. taxes. The Federal [ph] tax rate in the middle of our 37% to 38% guidance, the favorable impact of the lower actual tax rate was approximately $0.04 per share.
Second, we've revised our estimate with the amortization associated with the BJ Services acquisition. This calculation will not be final until the end of the year. However, our best estimate is that the incremental amortization charge will now be $120 million per year, or approximately $30 million per quarter. As a result, the amortization expense associated with the step-up was $9 million lower than our guidance for the third quarter, approximately $0.01 a share.
So from the GAAP EPS of $0.59, subtract $0.04 for the impact of lower tax rate, subtract $0.01 for the impact of lower quarterly amortization charges, that brings you to $0.54.
To help you in understanding the moving pieces, I'll bridge the Q3 '09 EPS to Q3 '10 EPS. GAAP EPS for Q3 '09 was $0.18 per share, add $0.03 for lower corporate cost, subtract $0.02 for higher net interest cost, subtract $0.05 for the impact of the higher share count, offset partially by the effect of the lower effective tax rate, subtract $0.03 for the impact of the incremental amortization costs and last, to get to EPS this quarter, add $0.48 from operations, including the acquisition of BJ Services, to arrive at $0.59 per share.
Bridging the sequential quarters, GAAP EPS for Q2 2010 was $0.23 per share, add back second quarter acquisition-related costs of $56 million before tax, $51 million after tax, or $0.13 per share. The impact of the lower tax rate, offset partially by the higher average share count, added about $0.04 per share, subtract $0.01 per share for higher net interest expense. Last, to get to EPS this quarter, add about $0.20 per share from operations, including the impact of having BJ Services on-board for the entire quarter to arrive at $0.59 per share.
In Table 3 of our earnings release, we provide financial information on a pro forma combined basis, with revenue and profits before tax, BJ Services included into the prior period's results to allow meaningful comparisons between quarters. Because of the reduction in amortization, this morning we also provide a revision to the pro forma supplemental information for Q1 2008 to Q3 2010 by quarter. This schedule is available on our website.
From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin refer explicitly to Table 3.
Revenue in North America was $2 billion, up 71% compared to a year ago, and up 16% sequentially. North America operating profits were $340 million, up $356 million year-over-year, and up 52% sequentially.
International revenue was $1.8 billion, up 6% compared to a year ago, and up 1% compared to the previous quarter. International operating profit margin was 5% compared to 11% a year ago, and 7% last quarter.
Our industrial and other segment revenue was $278 million, up 10% compared to last year, and up 13% compared to last quarter. Operating profit was $36 million, up 29% compared to a year ago and up 80% sequentially.
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter end, our total debt was $3.8 billion. During the quarter, we sold $1.5 billion of 5 1/8% senior notes due 2040. We used a portion of the net proceeds to pay back approximately $500 million of our outstanding commercial paper, and we intentionally paid $250 million of BJ Services' outstanding 5.75% bonds in June 2011. The company will use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
Our capital expenditures in the third quarter were $466 million, which is in line with our earlier guidance for 2010 annual capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and short-term investments, plus we had $1.7 billion available under our committed credit facilities. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%, our net debt was $2 billion and our net debt-to-capital ratio was 11%.
Last, I want to share a few thoughts on guidance for Q4. Net interest expense in Q4 should be about $52 million, which includes a full quarter of the $1.5 billion notes. Corporate spending should be within a $50 million to $55 million range. Taxes should be between 36% and 37%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $305 million and $350 million. We expect capital expenditures in Q4 to be between $550 million and $600 million, which will put total 2010 CapEx around $1.7 billion.
We do not expect a major pickup of activity in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter, and stand by our earlier estimate of $0.08 to $0.11 per share impact below normal operating conditions. I'll now turn the call over to Martin, who will highlight our geographic results. Martin?"
19007,114084289,83945,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Peter. Let me start with North America.

Let me start with North America. Revenue increased 71% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, matching the 71% and 19% increases in the North American rig count, a solid achievement given the negative impact of the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater drilling moratorium on activity, revenue and profit.
The overall service and technology intensity of North American land drilling continues to increase. In the United States, horizontal drilling, primarily in the unconventional oil and gas plays, has more than doubled year-over-year and increased 13% sequentially.
The unconventional reservoirs are demanding our best technology to deliver longer horizontals, complex completions, increasing frac horse power and more frac stages. This demand for advanced technology is in turn, driving the business and supporting both higher revenue per rig and associated higher prices. 
Operating margins increased 1,800 basis points year-over-year, and 400 basis points sequentially to 17%. Incremental margins were in excess of 40%, both year-over-year and sequentially, despite the lower activity in the Gulf this quarter.
Before I turn to our International segments, I need to address the current situation in the Gulf of Mexico. The impact of the moratorium and the pause in drilling permit approval was about as we guided in our last conference call at $0.09. While we are encouraged that the deepwater moratorium was lifted a few weeks ago, we do not expect a significant increase in drilling in the fourth quarter.
In the longer term, Baker Hughes is very well-positioned for the return of activity in the Gulf. With our two new pressure pumping vessels, the Blue Dolphin and the Blue Tarpon, we were able to offer best-in-class pressure pumping capabilities, exceeding the delivery capability of the nearest competitor by over 50%.
Our current tank control vessel utilization has been high, supporting frac, gravel pack and stimulation activities on the shelf. And in fact, our backlog is at an all-time record high.
Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year led by the Andean and Brazil geomarkets. Revenue increased 2% sequentially, led by the Brazil geomarket. Both year-over-year and sequential growth rates exceeded market growth rates this quarter. The only geomarket to report revenue declines year-over-year or sequentially, was the Venezuela Mexico geomarket.
Profit margins were flat sequentially. Latin America continues to be a series of contrasting stories. Performance is strong in Brazil and in the Andean geomarket, driven by national oil companies push-driving to increase their production. The Southern Cone and Venezuela Mexico geomarkets continue to be the most challenging.
We're continuing to react to our customers' budget cuts in Mexico by redeploying equipment to more attractive markets, and where required, reducing our staffing levels. We finished drilling operations on the final Alma Marine well, and expect to run this completion assembly in the next few weeks.
In Brazil, we continue to build on our strong relationship with Petrobras, and are expanding our business with other foreign and Brazilian operators. Technology continues to be key to performance in Brazil, both offshore and increasingly, on land. 
In the third quarter, we successfully deployed a 12 1/4 inch primary drill bit for the first time in a northeast Brazil land application. This hybrid bit combines the most attractive features of both roller cone and fixed-cutter bits in a single product.
We've made over 90 runs, and have drilled a total of more than 100,000 feet worldwide with this bit. The primary bit has been running in the United States, Canada, Ecuador, Oman, Saudi Arabia and now, on land in Brazil. In this particular application, the bit was able to drill 20% further and 90% faster than standard Tricone Bits.
The Andean geomarket continues to be one of our best performing geomarkets on any continent. All of our product lines are well-represented. In the quarter, we won a $137 million eight-year contract extension from Repsol for the exclusive supply and maintenance of ESP Systems and were awarded a two-year contract by an independent for full-service well construction solution that includes drilling and evaluation systems, fluids and to many pumping services.
Turning to the Eastern Hemisphere. First, in the Europe Africa Russia Caspian segment, revenue increased 6% compared to a year ago, led by directional drilling and artificial lift. Growth was led by the Russia Caspian and U.K. geomarket, offset partially by lower revenue from Africa. Sequentially, revenues were down 1% as revenue declines in Africa and Norway, offset increases in other geomarkets.
Improvements in profits in the U.K. and Continental Europe geomarkets were offset by lower profits in Norway, Russia Caspian and in Africa. The weakness in the Norway market was temporary. Driven by a more extensive than anticipated summer rig maintenance program, activity has returned to normal levels in October and should remain relatively solid through the winter.
U.K. and Continental Europe activity has been strong and is expected to stay strong this winter. In Norway, we secured a multimillion-dollar integrated project for the Borgland Dolphin Consortium to provide service integration and planning, including directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, mud logging, fluids, wireline logging and coring services. The contract covers an initial three-year period for full exploration program on the Norwegian continental shelf, encompassing 15 wells.
Activity in Africa remains weak. North Africa is soft as activity has not improved in either Libya nor Algeria. In the North Africa geomarket, we have been awarded a tender for directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, coring liner-hanger spits [ph] (18:52), and cementing by Occidental to drill 22 onshore exploration wells on six separate concessions in Libya. The two-year program starts in the first quarter of 2011.
In the Sub-Saharan African geomarket, our local joint venture there won a 10-year offshore production chemicals contract with a super major in Angola. 
Now turning to the Middle East Asia Pacific segment. Revenue was up 6% compared to a year ago, led by sales of chemicals, artificial lift and completion systems in Southeast Asia and Egypt geomarkets. Sequential growth was 5% led by increased sales of directional drilling and oilfield chemicals. 
Revenues were up significantly in the Southeast Asia geomarket. With relatively modest growth in the market, the preponderance of long-term contracts and ample equipment, pricing has not improved yet. Improvements in profitability in the near future will be dependent on market growth and share gains that help us absorb fixed overhead, and the success of our ability to improve operational efficiency.
In Saudi Arabia, the customers focused on increasing gas production from tight reservoirs. We're introducing technology developed for the North American tight gas plays into the kingdom. We recently installed Frac-Point multizone completion equipment in five wells with tight gas reservoirs. This solution allows a client to selectively stimulate individual sections in long horizontal wells to optimize the production and recovery rate. We also are providing technical expertise on formation evaluation and geomechanics.
And in Iraq, the South Oil company has run its first wireline job using Baker Hughes' equipment under the three-year technical services agreement signed last quarter.
In the South East Asia geomarket, we secured a major contract in the Philippines. We will be providing cementing, directional drilling and drilling fluid services on five rigs as part of a two-year contract with a 50-well work scope. Our robust product and services offering for the HPHT [high-pressure, high-temperature] industry, in conjunction with the established presence of BJ Services in the Philippines were critical factors in the award.
In the Indonesia geomarket, we completed a two multizone single trip completion system, or MST gravel pack, in a single well, isolating two differentially pressured zones. This completion builds on the success of BJ's MST, which has had over 35 successful runs to date, with documented savings of 70% of rig count from approximately 20 days to 3.5 days.
Looking at our International operations in total, I'm pleased with our revenue performance. Revenue grew 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, exceeding that of the market. This is a positive sign that our new geographic organization is making a difference. And we're pleased with our geomarket management teams, as they are demonstrating a more holistic view of the market, developing closer relations with our customers, and communicating clear market-driven priorities to our products and technology organization. They're executing and delivering high-quality products and services to our customers and they've maintained high levels of HSE performance.
International margins did not improve sequentially, as we indicated in our last conference call. While I remain disappointed, we've not been idle this quarter. Let me briefly review the actions we've taken. 
We believe that our organizational change resulted in some redundancies and inefficiencies in our overhead. We aggressively addressed this issue in the third quarter, and we incurred about $15 million in severance costs. The benefits of our cost-cutting should become visible next quarter and have full impact in 2011.
We indicated that we could make our organization more efficient and reduce additional overhead costs in the longer-term. We began that process this quarter and eliminated four geomarkets and the redundant management by combining Venezuela and Mexico, Sub-Sahara Africa along with Angola, North Africa coupled to Libya, and combining Russia and Caspian geomarkets.
Third, we revalidated our supply chain cost savings goals of $300 million over three years so we're on track. We committed to cost synergies with BJ Services of $75 million in year one and an additional $75 million in year two. These savings are in progress and will occur as projected. Revenue synergies will also contribute to improving our profitability. 
Finally and most importantly, we've put this organization together to gain share and promote long term profitable growth. As demonstrated in the last several quarters, revenues have either tracked or exceeded the market. My focus now is to deliver acceptable margins.
Before I turn this over to Chad, let me cover our Industrial segment. This segment is composed principally of our industrial chemicals, process and pipeline technology businesses. Revenue increased 10% year-on-year, and was up 13% sequentially in the seasonally strong third quarter. The segment posted a 13% profit margin in the quarter compared to an 11% margin a year ago, and 8% last quarter. 
This quarter, Baker Hughes formed an alliance with a global cargo inspection and certification company to provide cargo treatment added as services to the petroleum industry. The alliance offers a fast and effective spectrum of services for fuel and bulk cargos to meet trade specifications using our partner's testing and inspection infrastructure and Baker Hughes' P2R or PREPARED TO RESPOND fuel additives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad."
19007,114084289,83945,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","All right. Thank you, Martin. As Martin and Peter both highlighted, our results this quarter were dominated by our performance in North America.

As Martin and Peter both highlighted, our results this quarter were dominated by our performance in North America. With oil prices holding in the $75 to $80 range, we experienced strong growth in oil direct drilling in both unconventional and conventional areas, and we do expect that this trend is going to continue into 2011.
Drilling for natural gas has stabilized with a high percentage of the rigs drilling in the unconventional plays and increasingly on the wetter side of these plays. Together, the demand for drilling and unconventional reservoirs, whether it's for oil or for natural gas, is driving strong demand for directional drilling, complex completions and pressure pumping.
Currently, we believe the increase in drilling for either oil or wet gas will offset any drilling weakness in dry gas. It is important to note that pressure pumping is a key technology for developing both types of these reservoirs. And while we have owned BJ Services since April, we really had full access to BJ in only the last month of the third quarter. With the restrictions of the whole separate quarter now removed, we can finally act on the opportunities we have to leverage our newly acquired pressure pumping capabilities in North America.
Since the order was lifted, the U.S. sales teams have been working together to pull through products and services when possible. And in some cases, people and equipment are already committed, and as they roll off of the contract, we can then leverage our pressure pumping resources.
A good example of what our combined company is now able to deliver to our customers is a case in Canada for a large independent. Our AutoTrak Rotary Steerable system and drill bits were used to drill a horizontal well on the Horn River unconventional gas play. The well was completed with a 10-stage Frac-Point open-whole fracturing system, with a Baker Hughes integrated insight fiber optic monitoring system. BJ supplied all the cementing and all the hydraulic fracturing services. 
And in West Texas, the strength of the BJ Services relationship with an independent, resulted in them being able to pull through our wireline and perforating services on up to two frac jobs per week for our Permian Basin customer.
Another recent award was on the West Coast when the Baker Hughes and the BJ Services team bid together and were awarded a 30-well perforating and pressure pumping contract by a super major. And a final example in the Northeast, BJ leveraged the relationship with an independent to pull through other Baker Hughes products and services. The pull-through value will total nearly $10 million a year in new incremental revenue.
Now all this being said, the frac market is tight. Backlogs for pressure pumping remains strong and vary between regions from anywhere from 90 to 180 days. We're investing an incremental frac capacity to service both the growing intensity and the growing volume of the North American frac market.
Part of our long-term strategic plan call for filling some gaps that we had in our portfolio in order to make us more competitive. Of course, one of those gaps was pressure pumping, which I just addressed. The other was to build out our reservoir capability. 
Over the last couple of years, we have acquired several reservoir engineering companies, beginning with gap decline [ph] (27:32), GMI [GeoMechanics International] and most recently, Meyer & Associates. This has resulted in our achieving the critical mass needed to be recognized by our customers as a serious player in reservoir consultancy.
Beginning in Q4, continuing on into 2011, we're going to work to improve our customers' economics by using the full spectrum of our products and services, from geological and geomechanical analysis, to drilling, perforating, hydraulic fracturing and completing conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells. 
We can now engage with our customers from exploration appraisals to development, production and ultimately, rejuvenation of mature fields. These recent acquisitions result in our being well-positioned not only in North America but other markets worldwide. 
Looking outside North America to the rest of the world, the International market continues to grow albeit slowly, and with $75-plus oil price in an expanding global economy, it should continue to grow in 2011 and in time, support higher pricing. For now, low pricing improvement is elusive. And while the rig count is above its previous highs in Asia Pacific and Africa, it lags in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.
In fact, if you look at the change in the rig count for the individual countries since September 2008, you'll find that land rigs in India, Syria and Kuwait increased by more than 40. And unfortunately, these rigs simply aren't driving the same premium as the rigs in Australia, Oman or Saudi Arabia that they replaced.
In closing, our new organization, to me, is going through a period of adaptation. On the positive side, we are much closer to our client. And as we've mentioned before, our customers, they like this new organization and that's not a bad thing when you're a service company. As a result, we are winning work. Revenue growth versus our peers, as Martin mentioned, has remained strong over the last several quarters. 
On the other hand, we have to work, we have some work to do on the International margin front. Martin outlined our plans for improving our margins performance internationally. This is the number one priority for the entire management team at Baker Hughes. We need to fine-tune the operation, consolidate areas of redundancy, realize the benefits from the new supply chain organization, determine the optimum geomarket structure and continue to grow the top line.
These steps are all being addressed and it will result in improved margins beginning this quarter, Q4, and carrying into 2011. Okay. Gary, why don't we open it up for some questions?"

So that pretty much was the management team that has continued to run through this entire last 12 to 18 months period. So I think they're showing a lot of stability, and they had a very good quarter.

If we thought that the market was kind of better defined in terms of what the scope was going to be, what the risk profile is going to be. But I think as you've heard from a couple of our peers, the bidding activity there is very high and there's a lot of work to be done. And this is both from the national oil company, as well as the foreign participants. Let me put it this way, we've participated in every IPM bid, to use that term. We've obviously submitted prices but we've been on the sidelines in terms of getting on the field when the pricing environment is so unattractive. Again, given the fact that, if you see what happened in Mexico, if you see what's happened in some of these other high-profile IPM bids, the opportunity to make a profit is very limited. So I think the industry, our side of the industry, needs to rethink the way it approaches it. That aside, you're right, the reason that we reorganized into the geomarket organization was to grow the top line at faster rates than what we were experiencing before. And as I said in my comments, that's happening. But the best way to further grow those margins is to continue to grow that top line. We're taking actions that we can most -- near-term control in terms of the cost, in getting those down and particularly, in the overhead functions where we experienced some redundancy. Now in terms of trying to get other business, as I said in the comments, there's an incredible response by the customer community, which I think is being rewarded already with the work we're getting. We see the BJ organization stimulating even further, working together. And I can tell you that whether it's Vietnam, whether it's Australia, whether it's the big award we just got in the Philippines, whether it's bringing BJ more solidly into our business in Norway, we're seeing a lot of nice projects come our way. But the final point I'll make here, Scott, is that unlike North America which is a transactional market, we reorganized 18 months ago. Officially, we had all of our people in place, probably about a year ago. And the international market is not transactional, there's contracts there that are years in the making. And by that, I mean it takes months for the tender to come out, it takes months for the tender to be awarded, it takes months sometimes to mobilize. And it can take months for the customer to actually start spending. So you put that on top of contracts that already ran three to five years. It's not surprising that it takes a while to rebuild the revenue. But in terms of the mechanics, the way we're executing out there, I'm very happy with the job the guys are doing in terms of building their share."

And one of the reasons why was to gain our revenue growth back, which we've done. Now you have to question, are some of those contracts a little aggressive? Yes, probably. And some of them, as they wind off, we will replace them with better margin contracts. That, plus the fact that, as Martin went through, we've made some consolidation and tweaking, if you call it that, for the geomarket structure. This is normal. We did it years ago when I was with another company. And I know one of our rig competitors did the same thing when they reorganized and had to do it a couple of times to get it right.

We're putting equipment in there, there's that startup cost but there's also just the infrastructure buildout cost, the facilities etc., which we know are going to be there for the next 30 years. One thing, Robin, I want to clarify, that 15% exit rate that we talked about isn't just going to come just all internally. We are expecting that we will see some improvement in the International activity. We said that it would be modest in growing. But we do expect some of that to benefit the margin side as well and, of course, we also feel from the steps that we're taking on the cost side and organization side, that it will contribute quite a bit itself. I think we're pretty well-positioned. If 2011 is a surprise and the second half comes on strong, we have spent a lot of money over these last five years, both in the solid facility infrastructure side, bricks and mortars, you might say, but also on the human capital side. We have a much stronger International management team based in these key markets, again, much closer to the customer, which I think is one of the reasons why we're seeing some success on the revenue side now. So we'll be able to respond. We're in much, much stronger position today than we were a few years ago to handle International growth. And that's why we did all this, that's what we're counting on."

One, as I mentioned earlier, the attrition rate is very high for the industry, about twice of what it used to run years ago. And the second area is again, we can look at some equipment, every service company ages their equipment, looks at the life of the equipment and so on. And there's a 10-, 11-, 12-year-old equipment out there in the BJ ranks that we want to be able to replace in time anyway.

This morning, we reported net income on a GAAP basis of $255 million, or $0.59 per share. Earnings per share were up $0.41 compared to a year ago, and up $0.36 from last quarter. Revenue was $4.1 billion, up 83%, or almost $1.",986," Thanks, Gary. Good morning. This morning, we reported net income on a GAAP basis of $255 million, or $0.59 per share. Earnings per share were up $0.41 compared to a year ago, and up $0.36 from last quarter. Revenue was $4.1 billion, up 83%, or almost $1.9 billion compared to a year ago, and up 21% or $700 million sequentially.  And EBITDA per share was $1.64, which was up $0.71 or 76% compared to a year ago and up $0.26 or 19% from last quarter.
 There were a couple of adjustments that should be made to compare results to our previous guidance. First, our tax rate before acquisition-related costs was 32.5%. Let me just point something out, that we had $12 million in tax benefits from acquisition-related costs in addition to the $12 million pretax charge, so the net result was about zero on the acquisition cost on a per share basis.
 The overall decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to the actions we took in the third quarter to repatriate certain foreign earnings, ultimately resulting in a reduction of current and future U.S. taxes. The Federal tax rate in the middle of our 37% to 38% guidance, the favorable impact of the lower actual tax rate was approximately $0.04 per share.
 Second, we've revised our estimate with the amortization associated with the BJ Services acquisition. This calculation will not be final until the end of the year. However, our best estimate is that the incremental amortization charge will now be $120 million per year, or approximately $30 million per quarter. As a result, the amortization expense associated with the step-up was $9 million lower than our guidance for the third quarter, approximately $0.01 a share.
 So from the GAAP EPS of $0.59, subtract $0.04 from the impact of lower tax rate, subtract $0.01 for the impact of lower quarterly amortization charges, that brings you to $0.54.
 To help you in understanding the moving pieces, I'll bridge the Q3 '09 EPS to Q3 '10 EPS. GAAP EPS for Q3 '09 was $0.18 per share, add $0.03 for lower corporate cost, subtract $0.02 for higher net interest cost, subtract $0.05 for the impact of the higher share count, offset partially by the effect of the lower effective tax rate, subtract $0.03 for the impact of the incremental amortization costs and last, to get to EPS this quarter, add $0.48 from operations, including the acquisition of BJ Services to arrive at $0.59 per share.
 Bridging the sequential quarters, GAAP EPS for Q2 2010 was $0.23 per share, add back second quarter acquisition-related costs of $56 million before tax, $51 million after tax, or $0.13 per share. The impact of the lower tax rate, offset partially by the higher average share count, added about $0.04 per share, subtract $0.01 per share for higher net interest expense. Last, to get to EPS this quarter, add about $0.20 per share from operations, including the impact of having BJ Services on-board for the entire quarter to arrive at $0.59 per share.
 In Table 3 of our earnings release, we provide financial information on a pro forma combined basis, with revenue and profit before tax of BJ Services included into the prior period's results to allow meaningful comparisons between quarters. Because of the reduction in amortization, this morning, we also provide a revision to the pro forma supplemental information for Q1 2008 to Q3 2010 by quarter. This schedule is available on our website.
 From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin refer explicitly to Table 3.
 Revenue in North America was $2 billion, up 71% compared to a year ago, and up 16% sequentially. North America operating profits were $340 million, up $356 million year-over-year, and up 52% sequentially.
 International revenue was $1.8 billion, up 6% compared to a year ago, and up 1% compared to the previous quarter. International operating profit margin was 5% compared to 11% a year ago, and 7% last quarter.
 Our industrial and other segment revenue was $278 million, up 10% compared to last year, and up 13% compared to last quarter. Operating profit was $36 million, up 29% compared to a year ago and up 80% sequentially.
 Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter end, our total debt was $3.8 billion. During the quarter, we sold $1.5 billion of 5 1/8% senior notes due 2040. We used a portion of the net proceeds to pay back approximately $500 million of our outstanding commercial paper, and we intentionally paid $250 million of BJ Services outstanding 5.75% bonds in June 2011 the company will use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes.
 Our capital expenditures in the third quarter were $466 million, which is in line with our earlier guidance for 2010 annual capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and short-term investments, plus we had $1.7 billion available under our committed credit facilities. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%, our net debt was $2 billion and our net debt-to-capital ratio was 11%.
 Last, I want to share a few thoughts on guidance for Q4. Net interest expense in Q4 should be about $52 million, which includes a full quarter of the $1.5 billion notes. Corporate spending should be within a $50 million to $55 million range. Taxes should be between 36% and 37%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be between $305 million and $350 million. We expect capital expenditures in Q4 to be between $550 million and $600 million, which will put total 2010 CapEx around $1.7 billion.
 We do not expect a major pickup of activity in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter, and stand by our earlier estimate of $0.08 to $0.11 per share impact below normal operating conditions. I'll now turn the call over to Martin, who will highlight our geographic results. Martin?

Let me start with North America. Revenue increased to 71% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, matching the 71% and 19% increases in the North American rig count, a solid achievement given the negative impact of the Gulf of Mexico Deepwate",1752," Thanks, Peter. Let me start with North America. Revenue increased to 71% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, matching the 71% and 19% increases in the North American rig count, a solid achievement given the negative impact of the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater drilling moratorium on activity, revenue and profit.
 The overall service and technology intensity of North American land drilling continues to increase. In the United States, horizontal drilling, primarily in the unconventional oil and gas plays, has more than doubled year-over-year and increased 13% sequentially.
 The unconventional reservoirs are demanding our best technology to deliver longer horizontals, complex completions, increasing frac horse power and more frac stages. This demand for advanced technology is in turn, driving the business and supporting both higher revenue per rig and associated higher prices.
 Operating margins increased 1,800 basis points year-over-year, and 400 basis points sequentially to 17%. Incremental margins were in excess of 40%, both year-over-year and sequentially, despite the lower activity in the Gulf this quarter.
 Before I turn to our International segments, I need to address the current situation in the Gulf of Mexico. The impact of the moratorium and the pause in drilling permit approval was about as we guided in our last conference call at $0.09. While we are encouraged that the deepwater moratorium was lifted a few weeks ago, we did not expect a significant increase in drilling in the fourth quarter.
 In the longer term, Baker Hughes is very well-positioned for the return of activity in the Gulf. With our two new pressure pumping vessels, the Blue Dolphin and the Blue Tarpon, we were able to offer best-in-class pressure pumping capabilities, exceeding the delivery capability of the nearest competitor by over 50%.
 Our current tank control vessel utilization has been high, supporting frac, gravel pack and stimulation activities on the shelf. And in fact, our backlog is at an all-time record high.
 Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year led by the Andean and Brazi geomarkets. Revenue increased 2% sequentially, led by the Brazil geomarket. Both year-over-year and sequential growth rates exceeded market growth rates this quarter. The only geomarket to report revenue declines year-over-year or sequentially, was the Venezuela Mexico geomarket.
 Profit margins were flat sequentially. Latin America continues to be a series of contrasting stories. Performance is strong in Brazil and in the Andean geomarket, driven by national oil companies push-driving to increase their production. The Southern Cone and Venezuela Mexico geomarkets continue to be the most challenging.
 We're continuing to react to our customers' budget cuts in Mexico by redeploying equipment to more attractive markets, and where required, reducing our staffing levels. We finished drilling operations on the final Alma Marine well, and expect to run this completion assembly in the next few weeks.
 In Brazil, we continue to build on our strong relationship with Petrobras, and are expanding our business with other foreign and Brazilian operators. Technology continues to be key to performance in Brazil, both offshore and increasingly, on land.
 In the third quarter, we successfully deployed a 12 1/4 inch primary drill bit for the first time in a northeast Brazil land application. This hybrid bit combines the most attractive features of both roller cone and fixed-cutter bits in a single product.
 We've made over 90 runs, and have drilled a total of more than 100,000 feet worldwide with this bit. The primary bit has been running in the United States, Canada, Ecuador, Oman, Saudi Arabia and now, on land in Brazil. In this particular application, the bit was able to drill 20% further and 90% faster than standard Tricone Bits.
 The Andean geomarket continues to be one of our best performing geomarkets on any continent. All of our product lines are well-represented. In the quarter, we won a $137 million eight-year contract extension from Repsol for the exclusive supply and maintenance of ESP Systems and were awarded a two-year contract by an independent for full-service well construction solution that includes drilling and evaluation systems, fluids and to many pumping services.
 Turning to the Eastern Hemisphere. First, in the Europe Africa Russia Caspian segment, revenue increased 6% compared to a year ago, led by directional drilling and artificial lift. Growth was led by the Russia Caspian and U.K. geomarket, offset partially by lower revenue from Africa. Sequentially, revenues were down 1% as revenue declined in Africa and Norway, offset increases in other geomarkets.
 Improvements in profits in the U.K. and Continental Europe geomarkets were offset by lower profits in Norway, Russia Caspian and in Africa. The weakness in the Norway market was temporary. Driven by a more extensive than anticipated summer rig maintenance program, activity has returned to normal levels in October and should remain relatively solid through the winter.
 U.K. and Continental Europe activity has been strong and is expected to stay strong this winter. In Norway, we secured a multimillion-dollar integrated project for the Borgland Dolphin Consortium to provide service integration and planning, including directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, mud logging, fluids, wireline logging and coring services. The contract covers an initial three-year period for full exploration program on the Norwegian continental shelf, encompassing 15 wells.
 Activity in Africa remains weak. North Africa is soft as activity has not improved in either Libya nor Algeria. In the North Africa geomarket, we have been awarded a tender for directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, coring liner-hanger spits [ph] (18:52), and cementing by Occidental to drill 22 onshore exploration wells on six separate concessions in Libya. The two-year program starts in the first quarter of 2011.
 In the Sub-Saharan African geomarket, our local joint venture there won a 10-year offshore production chemicals contract with a super major in Angola.
 Now turning to the Middle East Asia Pacific segment, revenue was up 6% compared to a year ago, led by sales of chemicals, artificial lift and completion systems in Southeast Asia and Egypt geomarkets.  Sequential growth was 5% led by increased sales of directional drilling and oilfield chemicals.
 Revenues were up significantly in the Southeast Asia geomarket. With relatively modest growth in the market, the preponderance of long-term contracts and ample equipment, pricing has not improved yet. Improvements in profitability in the near future will be dependent on market growth and share gains that help us absorb fixed overhead, and the success of our ability to improve operational efficiency.
 In Saudi Arabia, the customers focused on increasing gas production from tight reservoirs. We're introducing technology developed for the North American tight gas plays into the kingdom. We recently installed Frac-Point multizone completion equipment in five wells with tight gas reservoirs. This solution allows a client to selectively stimulate individual sections in long horizontal well to optimize the production and recovery rate. We also are providing technical expertise on formation evaluation and geomechanics.
 And in Iraq, the South Oil company has run it's first wireline job using Baker Hughes' equipment under the three-year technical services agreement signed last quarter.
 In the South East Asia geomarket, we secured a major contract in the Philippines. We will be providing cementing, directional drilling and drilling fluid services on five rigs as part of a two-year contract with a 50-well work scope. Our robust product and services offering for the HPHT [high-pressure, high-temperature] industry, in conjunction with the established presence of BJ Services in the Philippines were critical factors in the award.
 In the Indonesia geomarket, we completed a two multizone single trip completion system, or MST gravel pack, in a single well, isolating two differentially pressured zones. This completion builds on the success of BJ's MST, which has had over 35 successful runs to date, with documented savings of 70% of rig count from approximately 20 days to 3.5 days.
 Looking at our International operations in total, I'm pleased with our revenue performance. Revenue grew 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, exceeding that of the market. This is a positive sign that our new geographic organization is making a difference. And we're pleased with our geomarket management teams, as they are demonstrating a more holistic view of the market, developing closer relations with our customers, communicating clear market-driven priorities to our products and technology organization. They're executing and delivering high-quality products and services to our customers and they've maintained high levels of HSE performance.
 International margins did not improve sequentially, as we indicated in our last conference call. While I remain disappointed, we've not been idle this quarter. Let me briefly review the actions we've taken.
 We believe that our organizational change resulted in some redundancies and inefficiencies in our overhead. We aggressively addressed this issue in the third quarter, and we incurred about $15 million in severance costs. The benefits of our cost-cutting should become visible next quarter and have full impact in 2011.
 We indicated that we could make our organization more efficient and reduce additional overhead costs in the longer-term. We began that process this quarter and eliminated four geomarkets and the redundant management by combining Venezuela and Mexico, Sub-Sahara Africa along with Angola, North Africa coupled to Libya, and combining Russia and Caspian geomarkets.
 Third, we revalidated our supply chain cost savings goals of $300 million over three years so we're on track. We committed to cost synergies with BJ Services of $75 million in year one and an additional $75 million in year one and an additional $75 million in year two. These savings are in progress and will occur as projected. Revenue synergies will also contribute to improving our profitability.
 Finally and most importantly, we've put this organization together to gain share and promote long term profitable growth. As demonstrated in the last several quarters, revenues have either tracked or exceeded the market. My focus now is to deliver acceptable margins.
 Before I turn this over to Chad, let me cover our Industrial segment. This segment is composed principally of our industrial chemicals, process and pipeline technology businesses. Revenue increased 10% year-on-year, and was up 13% sequentially in the seasonally strong third quarter. The segment posted a 13% profit margin in the quarter compared to an 11% margin a year ago, and 8% last quarter.
 This quarter, Baker Hughes formed an alliance with a global cargo inspection and certification company to provide cargo treatment added as services to the petroleum industry. The alliance offers a fast and effective spectrum of services for fuel and bulk cargos to meet trade specifications using our partner's testing and inspection infrastructure and Baker Hughes' P2R or PREPARED TO RESPOND fuel additives.
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chad.

19007,114084289,86592,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives"," All right. Thank you, Martin. As Martin and Peter both highlighted, our results this quarter were dominated by our performance in North America. With oil prices holding in the $75 to $80 range, we experienced strong growth in all direct drilling in both",980," All right. Thank you, Martin. As Martin and Peter both highlighted, our results this quarter were dominated by our performance in North America. With oil prices holding in the $75 to $80 range, we experienced strong growth in all direct drilling in both unconventional and conventional areas, and we do expect that this trend is going to continue into 2011.
 Drilling for natural gas has stabilized with a high percentage of the rigs drilling in the unconventional plays and increasingly on the wetter side of these plays. Together, the demand for drilling and unconventional reservoirs, whether it's for oil or for natural gas, is driving strong demand for directional drilling, complex completions and pressure pumping.
 Currently, we believe the increase in drilling for either oil or wet gas will offset any drilling weakness in dry gas. It is important to note that pressure pumping is a key technology for developing both types of these reservoirs. And while we have owned BJ Services since April, we really had full access to BJ in only the last month of the third quarter. So the restrictions of the whole separate quarter now removed, we can finally act on the opportunities we have to leverage our newly acquired pressure pumping capabilities in North America.
 Since the order was lifted, the U.S. sales teams have been working together to pull through products and services when possible. And on some cases, people and equipment are already committed, and as they roll off of the contract, we can then leverage our pressure pumping resources.
 A good example of what our combined company is now able to deliver to our customers is a case in Canada for a large independent. Our AutoTrak Rotary Steerable system and drill bits were used to drill a horizontal well on the Horn River unconventional gas play. The well was completed with a 10-stage Frac-Point open-whole fracturing system, with a Baker Hughes integrated insight fiber optic monitoring system. BJ supplied all the cementing and all the hydraulic fracturing services.
 And in West Texas, the strength of the BJ Services relationship with an independent, resulted in them being able to pull through our wireline and perforating services on up to two frac jobs per week for our Permian Basin customer.
 Another recent award was on the West Coast when the Baker Hughes and the BJ Services team bid together and were awarded a 30-well perforating and pressure pumping contract by a super major. And a final example on the Northeast, BJ leveraged the relationship with an independent to pull through other Baker Hughes products and services. The pull-through value will total nearly $10 million a year in new incremental revenue.
 Now all this being said, the frac market is tight. Backlogs for pressure pumping remains strong and vary between regions from anywhere from 90 to 180 days. We're investing an incremental frac capacity to service both the growing intensity and the growing volume of the North American frac market.
 Part of our long-term strategic plan call for filling some gaps that we had in our portfolio in order to make us more competitive. Of course, one of those gaps was pressure pumping, which I just addressed. The other was to build out our reservoir capability.
 Over the last couple of years, we have acquired several reservoir engineering companies, beginning with gap decline [ph] (27:32), GMI [GeoMechanics International] and most recently, Meyer & Associates. This has resulted in our achieving the critical mass needed to be recognized by our customers as a serious player in reservoir consultancy.
 Beginning in Q4, continuing on into 2011, we're going to work to improve our customers' economics by using the full spectrum of our products and services, from geological and geomechanical analysis, to drilling, perforating, hydraulic fracturing and completing conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells.
 We can now engage with our customers from exploration appraisals to development, production and ultimately, rejuvenation of mature fields.  These recent acquisitions result in our being well-positioned not only in North America but other markets worldwide.
 Looking outside North America to the rest of the world, the International market continues to grow albeit slowly, and with $75-plus oil price in an expanding global economy, it should continue to grow in 2011 and in time, support higher pricing. For now, low pricing improvement is elusive. And while the rig count is above its previous highs in Asia Pacific and Africa, it lags in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.
 In fact, if you look at the change in the rig count for the individual countries since September 2008, you'll find that land rigs in India, Syria and Kuwait has increased by more than 40. And unfortunately, these rigs simply aren't driving the same premium as the rigs in Australia, Oman or Saudi Arabia that they replaced.
 In closing, our new organization, to me, is going through a period of adaptation. On the positive side, we are much closer to our client. And as we've mentioned before, our customers, they like this new organization and that's not a bad thing when you're a serious company. As a result, we are winning work. Revenue growth versus our peers, as Martin mentioned, has remained strong over the last several quarters.
 On the other hand, we have to work, we have some work to do on the International margin front. Martin  outlined our plans for improving our margins performance internationally. This is the number one priority for the entire management team at Baker Hughes. We need to fine-tune the operation, consolidate areas of redundancy, realize the benefits from the new supply chain organization, determine the optimum geomarket structure and continue to grow the top line.
 These steps have all been addressed and it will result in improved margins beginning this quarter, Q4, and carrying into 2011. Okay. Gary, why don't we open it up for some questions?

And therefore, from a year-on-year type basis, we should see improved margins on North America. And of course, hopefully, we're looking at what's going on with the Gulf of Mexico. And if we can see some rational thinking back there again, and get back to some drilling and other things then that will be a huge swing for us. Because we're big in the Gulf and we wanted to hold ourselves strong there with our people, because we believe this thing will end. And when it does, we want to be ready for it.

Let me start with the one you bring up Iraq. If we thought that the market was kind of better defined in terms of what the scope was going to be, what the risk profile is going to be.

If we thought that the market was kind of better defined in terms of what the scope was going to be, what the risk profile is going to be. But I think as you've heard from a couple of our peers, the bidding activity there is very high and there's a lot of work to be done. And this is both from the national oil company, as well as the foreign participants. Let me put it this way, we've participated in every IPM bid, to use that term. We've obviously submitted prices but we've been on the sidelines in terms of getting on the field when the pricing environment is so unattractive. Again, given the fact that, if you see what happened in Mexico, if you see what's happened in some of these other high-profile IPM bids, the opportunity to make a profit is very limited. So I think the industry, our side of the industry, needs to rethink the way it approaches it. That aside, you're right, the reason that we reorganized into the geomarket organization was to grow the top line at  faster rates that what we were experiencing before. And as I said in my comments, that's happening. But the best way to further grow those margins is to continue to grow that top line. We're taking actions that we can most -- near-term control in terms of the cost, in getting those down and particularly, in the overhead functions where we experienced some redundancy. Now in terms of trying to get other business, as I said in the comments, there's an incredible response by the customer community, which I think is being rewarded already with the work we're getting. We see the BJ organization stimulating even further, working together. And I can tell you that whether it's Vietnam, whether it's Australia, whether it's the big award we just got in the Philippines, whether it's bringing BJ more solidly into our business in Norway, we're seeing a lot of nice projects come our way. But the final point I'll make here, Scott, is that unlike North America which is a transactional market, we reorganized 18 months. Officially, we had all of our people in place, probably about a year ago. And the international market is not transactional, there's contracts there that are years in the making. And by that, I mean it takes months for the tender to come out, it takes months for the tender to be awarded, it takes months sometimes to mobilize. And it can take months for the customer to actually start spending. So you put that on top of contracts that already ran three to five years. It's not surprising that it takes a while to rebuild the revenue. But in terms of the mechanics, the way we're executing out there, I'm very happy with the job the guys are doing in terms of building their share.

It's the power end, the fluid end and the engine, the chassis, the tractor, those type things. You can get those three, four months out. The bigger lead items, you're kind of looking for more like six months. Like I've mentioned, BJ had backed up considerably on the building of equipment during the negotiations and other things, rightly so. So we had to kind of rebuild that supply chain link beginning earlier this year. But we're looked at as a major player in this area and so the major suppliers in those points know that Baker Hughes is going to be in this business for a long time, so they jump through hoops to make sure that we get our equipment. I'd say you got to be looking at around six months. Now if we start to see some things softening or whatever as we go into 2011, doesn't mean that we still won't continue to build out some fluid ends, power ends, engines. Those things can go on a shelf and replace existing equipment or problems as we go through these equipment. So we have some flexibility there.

A couple of years ago, the margins were hit a bit by the startup costs in some key international markets. Now here more recently, it seems to be reorganization type of cost, geomarket framework and so forth. And I take that your guidance here is that, the 15% level could be achieved, principally without help from the market. But if the market does rebound more strongly than expected, how are you positioned relative, internationally, relative to the infrastructure that you put in place a few years ago to capture that opportunity? Or was part of that startup process left somewhat unfinished?

We're putting equipment in there, there's that startup cost but there's also just the infrastructure buildout cost, the facilities etc., which we know are going to be there for the next 30 years. One thing, Robin, I want to clarify, that 15% exit rate that we talked about isn't just going to come just all internally. We are expecting that we will see some improvement in the International activity. We said that it would be modest in growing. But we do expect some of that to benefit the margin side as well and, of course, we also feel from the steps that we're taking on the cost side and organization side, that it will contribute quite a bit itself. I think we're pretty well-positioned. If 2011 is a surprise and the second half comes on strong, we have spent a lot of money over these last five years, both in the solid facility infrastructure side, bricks and mortars, you might say, but also on the human capital side. We have a much stronger International management team based in these key markets, again, much closer to the customer, which I think is one of the reasons why we're seeing some success on the revenue side now. So we'll be able to respond. We're in much, much stronger position today than we were a few years ago to handle International growth. And that's why we did all this, that's what we're counting on.

We have about 350 people that, right now, out of the Gulf group that are based in temporary assignments around the world. We wanted to get -- these are some of our major competitors. These are people that have 20 years of experience and can go anywhere on the world to drill or run a bid or whatever. We don't want to lose those people. So we will watch this. We're talking a lot to our customers right now, the majors as well as the larger independents, trying to get a feel for when they think they'll get back to work. Right now, we've got quite a bit of activity lined up if they can go back and drill. We think we're in a pretty darn good position to do well in the Gulf once the activity returns. Now that being said, by the end of this quarter, if we don't see a seasonal return or some positive signs then obviously, we're going to have to take the next step in terms of our cost structure in the Gulf and do something about it. But as Martin said, from a vessel side, you look at it, vessel business is doing fairly well even in the downturn because of reworks and some laterals and things like that on the shelf. And it's the best backlog we've seen in that area. So we think there's enough optimism or enough lift right now that is going to strengthen a little bit, starting in Q1, that we're going to hold on a little longer where we have to do anything.

I will tell you we are adding a frac fleet every six weeks and have been for the last little while and for the next little while. So that gives you some upside in terms of what we have coming. Now that being said, there's a few factors of why we're adding this much horsepower. One, as I mentioned earlier, the attrition rate is very high for the industry, about twice of what it used to run years ago. And the second area is again, we can look at some equipment, every service company ages their equipment, looks at the life of the equipment and so on. And there's a 10-, 11-, 12-year-old equipment out there in the BJ ranks that we want to be able to replace in time anyway. So we're adding this horsepower now and if we do see it slow down then we'll get rid of some of the older stuff. I hope that answers your question, Marshall.
