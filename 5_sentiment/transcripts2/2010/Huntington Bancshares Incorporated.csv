First, a word of introduction, I'm pleased to introduce Randy Stickler to you. He joined us in March of last year. He came to us from Charter One Bank where he was the state of Ohio President. He has over 25 years of commercial banking experience. Most of it in commercial real estate businesses at various banks. He's been very busy this past year, has been instrumental of the significant progress we've made in reviewing and addressing the issues in our commercial real estate portfolio. So welcome, Randy.At 2009, we go down as one of most challenging years facing the industry at Huntington in decades, so a lot of difficult decisions needed to be made. And as a result, our performance was disappointing from our credit quality and earnings performance standpoint. However, I'm convinced that we're entering a brand new year in 2010 in many respect, to a much stronger company with underlying momentum that will result in significantly improved performance. There are recent signs that the economic department is stabilizing, yet it remains uncertain and even fragile. Nevertheless, sometime during 2010 we expect to return to quarterly profitability. Our colleagues are working hard to make that happen with the objective of getting there as soon as possible. Decisions in the fourth quarter were important to this end and I hope that our remarks today will give you the same confidence that we have in achieving this goal. I'll begin with a review of our fourth quarter performance highlights. Don will follow with a detailed review of our financial performance. Tim will provide an update on credit and a review of our commercial real estate portfolio. I'll then return with some 2010 outlook comments in what I hope our investors will take away from today's presentation.Let's begin. Turning to Slide 8, reported a net loss of $369.7 million or $0.56 of common share, the driver of the loss was an $894 million provision for credit losses. This was $419 million higher than in the third quarter and more than double the fourth quarter's net charge-offs. Contributing to this increase were certain credit actions that we'll talk about in more detail in a moment. Yet, we continued to make good progress in improving our pre-tax pre-provisioned income. It's totaled $242 million, up just under $5 million or 2% from the third quarter and represented the fourth consecutive quarterly improvement. It's also important to note that this level was 24% higher than in the year-ago quarter. This demonstrates the progress we're making in positioning Huntington for a stronger financial performance once this credit cycle ends.The linked quarter improvement was driven by a 3% increase in net interest income, our largest revenue contributor. But the big story for the quarter was the large provisions, so let me review what drove this. Now as you'll recall from earlier earnings calls and investor communication, since the first quarter, we've been deeply involved in understanding and addressing the risks in our credit and loan portfolio. The first nine months were spent in a series of detailed portfolio reviews and implementation of enhanced portfolio management processes. This permitted us to proactively identify and address risks in our portfolio.  Charge-offs remained elevated and we continue to build our loan loss reserves, again through the first nine months. We reported last quarter that the growth rate in criticized loans have slowed but our customers remained under pressure from the weak economy. As a result, during the fourth quarter, there was a continued increase in the absolute level of criticized loans though at the third quarter's slower pace.Given the uncertain economic picture in 2010 and a trend line of growing pre-losses throughout 2009, during the fourth quarter, we reviewed our loan loss reserves assumptions portfolio-by-portfolio. And as a result, we've felt a significant increase in our loan loss reserves was warranted. We wanted to assure that we had sufficient reserves to continue to address the resolution of problem credits, existing credits inherent in our portfolios, in what is likely to remain a fragile economy. Our period end allowance for credit losses represents 4.16% of total loans and leases and our non-accrual loan coverage improved 80% from 50% at the end of the third quarter. Yet we're seeing signs that are very encouraging. Total nonperforming assets declined 12% from the end of the third quarter, and there was a 45% decline in new nonperforming assets compared with the third quarter.As noted earlier, the rate of increase in criticized and classified loans is slowing. Early-stage delinquencies also improved. So as we've stated since January of last year, the area of most credit concern has been our commercial real estate portfolio and specifically, our exposures to single-family homebuilders and our retail segment. As we enter 2010, I think it's important that our investors know that as the result of the actions taken this past year, we have substantially addressed the single-family homebuilders segments. This is not a major concern going forward.The portfolio management focused over the course of the year, combined with the reserved actions and dividing our commercial real estate portfolio into core and non-core segments, positions us better to deal with this exposure going forward. And Tim will provide details."

Our period end Tier 1 and total risk base capital ratios were 12.05% and 14.43%, respectively.  These are $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion above respective regulatory well-capitalized 6% and 10% thresholds. We continue to believe we have sufficient capital to weather a stressed economic scenario. I'll say it again, we continue to believe we have sufficient capital to weather a stressed economic scenario. Our tangible common equity ratio was 5.92%. A year ago at the end of 2008, we were at 4.04%. Liquidity, which have seen quarterly improvements for the first three quarters stressed [ph] (23:29) in further. Again, this past quarter, a key driver was the strong 16% annualized growth rate in core deposits. Our loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of December was 91%, improved from 94% at the end of September and significantly improved from 108% at the end of 2008. Our deposit growth permitted us to reduce non-core funding by $1.8 billion during the quarter.Turning to governance and management, we continued to build the strength of our Board of Directors with the employment of Rick Neu. Rick was the former CFO and Treasurer of Charter One Financial and prior to that, he was in First Federal of Michigan. He's got extensive hands on and experience in Detroit and Cleveland markets and other markets, and he's a CPA by way of training. He's a tremendous addition to the board.Slide 10, a key element of growing Huntington is investing in resources and talent, especially in those areas that we'll grow revenue. The slide lists selected new management team members hired over the last several months. As you can see, some are in positions to take what we have and make it better like those in retail and business banking and commercial banking business segments. Other new hires are leaders in teams aimed to developing critical mass in existing businesses, such as currency risk management or to expand existing businesses into new markets like brokered sales. And we've initiated a new business with the national settlement's team.  These investments reflect the early stages of implementing our strategic plan. With that, I'd like to turn this over to Don for a financial performance review. Don?"

As noted on Slide 11, our net loss for the fourth quarter was $369.7 million or $0.56 a share. Two significant items impact to the quarter's results. First, we recognized a $73.6 million or $0.07 per share of gain from the redemption of subordinated notes. We completed a tender offer primarily [ph] (25:29) in the fourth quarter, redeeming $371 million of our then outstanding subordinated debt. The gain represents the discount paid on the tender and the impact of closing out the related interests rate swap.Second, we had a $12 million or $0.02 per share of benefit from the recognition on certain previously deferred tax valuation allowances. Slide 12 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trend. Many of the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation so let's move on. On Slide 13, we provided an overview of our pretax, pre-provisioned income performance. We believe this metric is useful in something [ph] (26:03) the underlying operating performance. Calculate this metric by starting with the pretax earnings then excluding three items: Provisions for credit losses, security gains and losses and amortization of intangibles.  We also adjusted, for a certain significant items including the gain resulting this quarter's subordinated debt tender offer. On this basis, our pretax pre-provisioned income for the third quarter was $242.1 million, up $4.9 million or 2% from the prior quarter. This improvement clearly reflects the management actions taken during the year and we continue to look for additional opportunities to improve our core operating performance.Slide 14 provides a trend of our net interest income and our margin. During the fourth quarter, our full tax equivalent net interest income increased by $9.6 million, reflecting a one basis point decrease in our net interest margin and a $1.3 billion increase in our average earnings asset base. The margin chain [ph] (27:00) reflected a favorable impact of our improved deposit mix and loan pricing, offset by the negative impacts of our stronger liquidity position but deposit growth resulted in increases to our investment securities portfolio.Also impacting the margin was a swap in effect [ph] (27:15) that's occurring at the end of the third quarter, producing the current quarter's net interest income. On the Slide 15, we show the change in mix our investment portfolio. With the growth in our deposits, we've invested the funds primarily in shorter duration and variable rate securities, such as agencies, agency CMO and certain asset-backed securities. The short-term nature of these investments provides a flexibility to reposition the portfolio. If the yield curve starts to steepen, forward [ph] (27:40) if we decide to utilize upon future loan growth.Continue on to Slide 16, we show the linked quarter of loan lease trends. Total commercial loans were down $0.8 billion or 4%, reflecting the impact of lower-lying utilization for our commericial borrowers. The decline also reflects the planned lower real estate balances from the pay downs and charge offs occurring there in the quarter. Total consumer loans were flat with the prior quarter, despite a 31% increase in the origination volume for automobile loans. This increased origination volume was offset by the impact of our continued run off of the auto leased portfolio and lower residential real estate balances. Turning to Slide 17, our strong core deposit growth continued into the fourth quarter. Total quarter core deposits grew in annualized 16% rate, and the growth came from demand deposit and money market categories. The Warren Bank acquisition added $260 million of core deposits an average. Even after adjusting for this impact, core deposits were up 13% on an annualized basis. Slide 18 shows the trends in our noninterest income category. Our noninterest income declined by $11.5 million from the prior quarter. Other income declined by $7.5 million, reflecting a $16.4 million lower benefit from the change in the fair value of our derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting. This was offset by $7.5 million of losses on loans held for sale in the third quarter.  Our service charges on deposit accounts declined $4.1 million from the third quarter levels, primarily due to lower NSF/OD-related fees.  Mortgage income was up $3.2 million, reflecting the stronger origination volume and a $2.2 million gain from the MSR hedging activity for the current quarter. The next slide is a summary of our expense trends. Total expenses were down $78.5 million from the prior quarter. This reduction was primarily due to the $73.6 million gain on the debt redemption.  OREO and foreclosure expenses were down $20.4 million as the prior quarter reflected a $14 million loss on loan commercial OREO properties.Core sale costs were up $8.5 million from the previous quarter. This increase included a $4.7 million increase in incentive-related costs. Core salaries were up about 2% from the third quarter, reflecting the increase of 81 FTE, primarily for specific strategic initiatives.Slide 20 is a summary of our capital trends. We completed a series of capital actions over the last year. The most recent action was the completion of a tender offer for our subordinated debt, resulting in a $73.6 million of pretax gains. This transaction reflected the utilization of proceeds from our earlier common stock issuance. Our capital ratio throughout the year have improved and with our TCE ratio increasing from 4.04% a year ago to 5.92% at the end of this year. Most importantly, we think these actions positions well to weather further economic challenges. We do not have any current plans to issue additional capital.Let me turn the presentation back over to Tim Barber for credit review."

Turning to Slide 21, our total net charge-offs were $88.8 million or 25% higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, with substantial changes in the composition. Total commercial net charge-offs were $129.8 million higher in t",2206,"Thanks, Don. Turning to Slide 21, our total net charge-offs were $88.8 million or 25% higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, with substantial changes in the composition. Total commercial net charge-offs were $129.8 million higher in the quarter as both the C&I and commercial real estate portfolio showed increases. In the consumer portfolio, there were no portfolio actions this quarter contributing to the significant decrease from the prior quarter.We saw elevated levels of losses as a result of the economic conditions. However, it is important to note that we continue to see a reduction in early-stage delinquencies despite historically difficult fourth quarter timeframe. As we consider our asset quality trends and drivers, the commercial real estate portfolio remains the most stressed and our primary concern. Within the commercial real estate portfolio, the single-family homebuilders and the retail projects remained the two highest risk segments, generating the bulk of the credit losses. Of the $268 million of commercial real estate charge-offs in the quarter, 73% were associated with these two segments. The retail portfolio alone comprised nearly 50% of the commercial real estate charge-offs. Both of these portfolio segments continued to show stress as we worked with the borrowers in resolving the credit issues.While historically, we have viewed the single-family builder portfolio at the highest risk segment, we believe that we have substantially addressed that exposure at this point. Based on the sum total of our activity over the last two and a half years, we do not expect any material future credit impact from this portfolio of segments.The $41 million increase in C&I net charge-offs was primarily associated with losses on four large C&I relationships. The four borrowers represent different industries but all were significantly impacted by the difficult economic environment over the past year.Aside from the impact of these loans, the quarter looked much the same as prior quarter. Given the difficult economic environment, we expect that there will be some continuing challenges in the C&I portfolio as we obtain and analyze that stated financial information throughout the next year. But we feel comfortable regarding the overall performance of the C&I block. A particular note is the continued strengthening of our business banking portfolio performance over the past couple of quarters. We continue to feel very good about the C&I loans in our Auto Finance and Dealer Services portfolio. We do not anticipate any material dealer-related losses in the portfolio even in the face of the market disruption over the past year. It has clearly been a positive for our portfolio. Our first [ph] (33:26) selection criteria with a focus on multi-dealership groups has proven itself in this environment. While the outstandings have declined in this portfolio as the utilization on floor plan lines has decreased, we continue to pursue and win new relationships that meet our credit profile. In a seasonally difficult quarter, the consumer portfolio performed consistent with our expectations. The auto loans and leases continued their strong performance while the increased net charge-offs and some equity loans continue to be driven by our loss mitigation activities. There are fewer accounts in our loss mitigation queues today, as we continue to proactively work our way through our portfolio. Residential mortgages and the other consumer loan category were consistent with the prior quarter on an adjusted basis.  In the residential portfolio, our loss from mitigation queues are down 50% from midyear 2009. We were generally pleased with the results across our consumer portfolio during the quarter. There has been some industry discussion recently regarding the loss recognition on bankrupt accounts. We've taken a really conservative stance on recognizing losses on customers who have filed for bankruptcy protection across the consumer portfolio.  Slide 22 represents the net charge off ratios associated with the portfolios. Turning to Slide 23, we were very pleased with the reduction in nonperforming assets in the quarter. A $286 million or 12% reduction was centered in a substantially reduced inflow with significant payment and sales activity. The reduction was evident across all of the individual portfolio that was particularly strong in the commercial real estate portfolio. The accruing of restructured loans shown at the bottom of the page reflect the impact of our continued efforts, particularly in the residential secured portfolio of segments.While the portfolio continued to be affected by the fragile economic environment across our footprint, our commitment to the enhanced portfolio management processes and problem loan resolution activity over the course of 2009 became more evident in this quarter.Slide 24 provides a reconciliations of the quarterly changes in the nonperforming asset balances. You can see the dramatic decrease in the additions line from $900 million last year to under $500 million this quarter. Please note that we continue to be focused on the early recognition of non-accruals. As with the prior quarter, 35% of the total C&I and commercial real estate non-accrual loans were current from a payment standpoint.Auto loan losses represents the next largest reduction in the quarter. It's important to focus on the impact of each of the other line items. As you have heard us say over the last year, we have made a significant commitment to the size and expertise of our commercial workout group. Payments, return to accrual status and sales activities are all a function of this group's impact. Each of these line items represent a high watermark to date.As we view this slide, it's important to include some comments regarding the underlying migration we are seeing in the portfolio. Although non-accruing loans decreased by a net 12% in the quarter, we did see a continued increase in the level of criticized loans, although at less than a 4% range. This rate of increase is slightly lower than the third quarter results, an indication of some stabilization evident in the portfolio. As you may recall, in using Slide 68 in the appendix as a reference, there was a substantial migration of outstandings into the criticized category, a combination of the OLEM and classified segments in the second quarter, as a result of that quarter's broad-based review activity.The third and fourth quarter increases were manageable given the economic environment. The commercial real estate portfolio continues to be the primary source of the increases in criticized loan outstandings. We were encouraged by the low level of net change in criticized loan levels growth for both the C&I and business banking segments. This is consistent with our view that the commercial real estate portfolio is the primary driver of the asset quality performance.Slide 25 provides an overview of the asset quality trends, particularly in relation to our reserve levels. We have discussed the reduction in non-accruing loans and the basis for the increase in the charge-off ratio in the fourth quarter. The 90 plus days past due in accruing line represents the continued focus on asset portfolio management and non-accrual treatment decisions.Steve provided an overview with a change in reserve levels for the quarter and the bottom half of this slide provides you with some historical context for the resulting ratios. Since we view the entire allowance for credit losses as available to cover loan losses, I will focus on the ACL ratios in my discussion.The 4.16% of outstandings and 80% coverage of non-accruing loans are in line with where we believe the industry will be as of the fourth quarter. The 96% coverage of adjusted non-accruing loans excludes the Franklin exposure. We have established to set a allowance for credit loss benchmarks to provide a basis of assessing the adequacy of the reserve. And it was within this framework that we determine the level of increase appropriate for the portfolio.In conjunction with our asset quality trends, the general economic conditions and a forward-looking view of the commercial real estate market, we use these benchmarks in determining the $450 million increase to the reserves. There was a $200 million increase in the judgmental component, including an enhancement to the economic reserve portion. There was also an incremental $200 million allocated primarily to the commercial real estate portfolio, addressing the severity of commercial real estate loss given default percentages and a longer-term view of the loss emergence time period. Lastly, approximately $50 million was a function of our normal annual process of adjusting the reserve factors on our consumer portfolios, allocated specifically to the residential and home equity portfolio of segments.We continue to be pleased with the steady reduction in the 30-day accruing delinquency ratio for the total loan portfolio as shown on Slide 26. This is a result of the focus and attention of our relationship managers and the enhanced portfolio management process we put into place over the course of the past 12 months. As expected, we had no accruing loans over 90 days past due.On Slide 27, our early-stage consumer delinquency trends are also positive, led by the significant reduction in the residential portfolio. This decrease represents a core decline as the portfolio of sale and timing of loss recognition adjustments in the third quarter did not impact this segment. The 90-plus days past due results were up slightly for the residential portfolio. It should be noted that the residential presentation excludes the government-guaranteed and Franklin-related loans. The auto and home equity portfolio has performed much as expected.The next four slides provide additional disclosure around our commercial real estate portfolio, specifically the reconciliation of the balance reductions and the introduction of the core versus non-core concepts. You will be able to find the product type, the maturity schedules from the prior quarter on Slid 82 through 84 in the appendix.Slide 28 shows the material decrease in the level of commercial real estate outstandings since the year-ago quarter. While the net reduction of $2.4 billion is significant, an analysis of the specific component is important. We originated only $255 million of new commercial real estate credit, but did have over $1 billion of takedowns on existing projects. The remaining non-funded commitments associated with commercial real estate projects is not material.The $1.7 billion of payments is a very significant number and is a function of our commitment to reduce the commercial real estate concentration via portfolio of management activity, such rightsizing loans with our borrowers. The increased expertise in our commercial workout area and the ramp-up in payments over the course of the past two quarters reflect this commitment.As we have previously indicated, this past year, we embarked on an exercise to properly classify our loans. In the first quarter, we made an initial series of changes, primarily centered on moving owner-occupied loans from commercial real estate to C&I based on the cash flow underwriting of the credits. We made similar adjustments in the fourth quarter, primarily associated with loans to healthcare entities and colleges and universities. We believe that loans underwritten based on cash flow from operations should be considered as commercial loans secured by real estate and not housed in the commercial real estate portfolio, which is a real estate project-oriented portfolio.The final portion of the reduction was associated with the charge-off activity. Slide 29 provides a summary of the credit quality metrics for the commercial real estate portfolio, including the breakout of the single-family homebuilder and retail project portfolio of segments. Including the impact of the fourth quarter reserve build, we have taken a 31% grossed up credit mark on the remaining $857 million a single-family home builder portfolio.As I indicated earlier, we do not expect any material credit issues from the homebuilder segment going forward. The retail portfolio has a 20% credit mark, which we also believe is an appropriate mark given our current assessment of the projects within the portfolio. The overall increase in the reserve level to 9.94% of loans represents a proactive assessment of the portfolio and the market tightening [ph] (43:39) that is likely to exist in the coming quarters.Slide 30 provides the basis for distinguishing between the core and non-core portions of our commercial real estate portfolio. The key to the core designation is the meaningful relationship, Midwest footprint projects and adequate returns on capital. This segregation gives our investors increased transparency as it allows us to provide ongoing performance metrics.Slide 31 provides the breakdown of the commercial real estate portfolio as of the end of the quarter with the September balances and credit metrics provided to facilitate comparisons. You can see the breakdown between the designations with core comprising 53% of the total. This borrowers we intend to support, grow and develop.Our core portfolio as of December is very clean. We have maintained a 4% reserve given the economic environment and commercial real estate market conditions. But the non-core portfolio, we have established very substantial reserves and calculated the credit mark. This 27% ratio indicates the aggregate credit mark incorporating both prior charge-offs and existing reserves associated with the loans in the portfolio. It does not include any full balance charge-offs or charge-offs taken on loans that have been paid off. The 27% mark includes a 40% factor on loans managed within the Special Assets division.We believe that this level of credit action puts us in a strong position of a flexibility to continue to deal proactively with future credit issues. Let me turn the presentation back to Steve for wrap up."

First, we still do not believe there'll be any significant economic turnaround this year. We do see signs of stabilization and a key assumption for our current outlook comment is that the economy stabilizes at near the current level throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect net charge-offs and provision expense parts will be meaningfully below 2009 levels. For us, 2009 is the peak year, our allowance for credit losses is expected to decline on an absolute basis from its year-end level, reflecting the utilization of existing reserves for elevated inherent losses. We expect our net interest margin will improve from 3.19% level in the fourth quarter. We anticipate strong growth in core deposits as we grow our retail and business customer bases, as well as increased cross-sell performance to existing customers. Loan growth is expected to be flat to up slightly. From one hand, we expect increases in C&I and certain consumer segments as customer confidence improves. However, commercial real estate loans are expected to continue to decline. Fee income will continue to be flat to slightly down, however, we expect growth in asset management, as well as brokerage and insurance revenues offset in part by declines NSF overdraft fees. Expenses are expected to increase, reflecting the investment of growth and implementation of key strategic initiatives. We believe these set of expectations will return us to quarterly profitable performance sometime during the year.Let me use the next slide to provide some perspective. On slide 33, we showed the quarterly improvement in pretax pre-provision performance. It also shows we're targeting the continued improvements to $275 million in the third quarter. And this is on aggressive target, for sure, but one we feel is achievable, it will be dependent primarily on our ability to increase net interest income, control our expense growth by offsetting the cost of investments with improved efficiencies. The growth in net interest income is expected to reflect a combination of factors, including loan and investment securities growth. Continued growth in lower cost core deposits and the resulting improved funding mix and a higher net interest margin reflecting approved loan and deposit spreads.Let me use the next two slides to review key messages that I hope that come to our comments today. Throughout 2009, we reviewed all assets on the balance sheet. We specifically commented frequently about the in-depth review of our loan portfolios, as well as the strengthening of our credit management and review processes begun last January. These reviews are completed.Second, our loan loss reserves are strong and we're better positioned to continue to address the resolutions of problem credits. The rate of increasing criticize from classified loans, as well as the inflow into NPAs is flowing. Net charge-offs and provision expense reached their high water mark in 2009. The core, non-core segmentation of our commercial real estate portfolio provides greater transparency and facilitate its further reduction. This will result in improved loan mix over time. We made significant progress in addressing key commercial loan portfolio concerned, specially Franklin in the Single Family Homebuilder segment of our commercial real estate portfolio. Our C&I and consumer loan portfolios continued to perform within expectation given the state of economy. We continue to believe our consumer loan portfolio performance will outperform many of our peers on a relative basis.But I think its also important to remember that we're not yet out of this economic cycle. Negative credit migration is expected to continue though at a slower rate than we saw in 2009. ON Slide 35 and continuing, our liquidity position has a built to very strong level. The strongest in many years. Our funding mix is much stronger and balance given the increase in core deposits. We're growing households and business relationships. Our capital is sufficient to weather a stressed economic scenario. We have no current plan to raise new capital. We're better positioned to eventually repay the $1.4 billion TARP capital.We're continuing to make progress in growing pretax pre-provision earnings and our goal of $275 million by the third quarter is aggressive but we believe it's achievable. We're continuing to stress that our management team and the depth of expertise at all levels. We've shifted to offense as reflected in our new hirings and the implementation of our strategic plan. And we'll continue to make investments targeted to grow key fee businesses. We enjoyed one of the better fee incomes of the revenue ratios amongst our regional peer events [ph] . Lastly, when we put it all together, we believe we'll return to quarterly profitability during 2010.They said at the beginning, 2009 was very difficult. We're all excited about the possibilities for 2010. We still have credit challenges but we're much better prepared to deal with them today than a year ago. And I think those challenges, going forward, will be much more manageable. We're getting stronger every day at Huntington.  So thank you for your interest. Operator, we'll now take questions. Courtney back to you."

First, a word of introduction, I'm pleased to introduce Randy Stickler to you. He joined us in March of last year. He came to us from Charter One Bank, where he was the State of Ohio President. He has over 25 years of commercial banking experience. Most of it in commercial real estate businesses at various banks. He's been very busy this past year, has been instrumental of the significant progress we've made in reviewing and addressing the issues in our commercial real estate portfolio. So welcome, Randy.At 2009, will go down as one of most challenging years facing the industry at Huntington in decades, so a lot of difficult decisions needed to be made. And as a result, our performance was disappointing from our credit quality and earnings performance standpoint. However, I'm convinced that we're entering a brand new year in 2010 in many respect, so much stronger company with underlying momentum that will result in significantly-improved performance. There are recent signs that the economic department is stabilizing, yet it remains uncertain and even fragile. Nevertheless, sometime during 2010 we expect to return to quarterly profitability. Our colleagues are working hard to make that happen with the objective of getting there as soon as possible. Decisions in the fourth quarter were important to this end and I hope that our remarks today will give you the same confidence that we have in achieving this goal. I'll begin with a review of our fourth quarter performance highlights. Don will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. Tim will provide an update on credit and a review of our commercial real estate portfolio. I'll then return with some 2010 outlook comments in what I hope our investors will take away from today's presentation.Let's begin. Turning to Slide 8, reported a net loss of $369.7 million or $0.56 of common share, the driver of the loss was an $894 million provision for credit losses. This was $419 million higher than in the third quarter and more than double the fourth quarter's net charge-offs. Contributing to this increase were certain credit actions that we'll talk about in more detail in a moment. Yet, we continued to make good progress in improving our pre-tax, pre-provisioned income. This totaled $242 million, up just under $5 million or 2% from the third quarter and represented the fourth consecutive quarterly improvement. It's also important to note that this level was 24% higher than in the year-ago quarter. This demonstrates the progress we're making in positioning Huntington for a stronger financial performance once this credit cycle ends.The linked quarter improvement was driven by a 3% increase in net interest income, our largest revenue contributor. But the big story for the quarter was the large provisions, so let me review what drove this. Now as you'll recall from earlier earnings calls and investor communication, since the first quarter, we've been deeply involved in understanding and addressing the risks in our credit and loan portfolio. The first nine months were spent in a series of detailed portfolio reviews and the implementation of enhanced portfolio management processes. This permitted us to proactively identify and address the risks in our portfolio.  Charge-offs remained elevated and we continue to build our loan loss reserves, again through the first nine months. We reported last quarter that the growth rate in criticized loans have slowed but that our customers remained under pressure from the weak economy. As a result, during the fourth quarter, there was a continued increase in the absolute level of criticized loans, though, at the third quarter's slower pace.Given the uncertain economic picture in 2010 and a trend line of growing pre-losses throughout 2009, during the fourth quarter, we reviewed our loan loss reserves assumptions portfolio by portfolio. And as a result, we've felt a significant increase in our loan loss reserves was warranted. We wanted to assure that we had sufficient reserves to continue to address the resolution of problem credits, existing credits inherent in our portfolios, in what is likely to remain a fragile economy. Our period end allowance for credit losses represents 4.16% of total loans and leases and our non-accrual loan coverage improved 80% from 50% at the end of the third quarter. Yet we're seeing signs that are very encouraging. Total nonperforming assets declined 12% from the end of the third quarter, and there was a 45% decline in new nonperforming assets compared with the third quarter.As noted earlier, the rate of increase in criticized and classified loans is slowing. Early-stage delinquencies also improved. So as we've stated since January of last year, the area of most credit concern has been our commercial real estate portfolio and specifically, our exposures to Single-Family Homebuilders and our Retail segment. As we enter 2010, I think it's important that our investors know that as the result of the actions taken this past year, we have substantially addressed the Single-Family Homebuilders segment. This is not a major concern going forward.The portfolio management focused over the course of the year, combined with the reserved actions and dividing our commercial real estate portfolio into core and non-core segments, positions us better to deal with this exposure going forward. And Tim will provide details. Our C&I and consumer portfolios are experiencing higher than normal charge-offs given the weak economy, but we believe these will remain manageable with our consumer loan portfolio particularly performing better relative to peers.Now turning to Slide 9, despite a reduction due to the fourth quarter's loss, as expected our capital position remains a positive story. Our period end Tier 1 and total risk base capital ratios were 12.05% and 14.43%, respectively.  These are $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion above respective regulatory well-capitalized 6% and 10% thresholds. We continue to believe we have sufficient capital to weather a stressed economic scenario. I'll say it again, we continue to believe we have sufficient capital to weather a stressed economic scenario. Our tangible common equity ratio was 5.92%. A year ago at the end of 2008, we were at 4.04%. Liquidity, which have seen quarterly improvements for the first three quarters stressed [ph] (23:29) in further. Again, this past quarter, a key driver was the strong 16% annualized growth rate in core deposits. Our loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of December was 91%, improved from 94% at the end of September and significantly improved from 108% at the end of 2008. Our deposit growth permitted us to reduce non-core funding by $1.8 billion during the quarter.Turning to governance and management, we continue to build the strength of our Board of Directors with the employment of Rick Neu [Neumeyer]. Rick was the former CFO and Treasurer of Charter One Financial and prior to that, he was in First Federal of Michigan. He's got extensive hands on and experience in Detroit and Cleveland markets and other markets, and he's a CPA by way of training. He's a tremendous addition to the board.Slide 10, a key element of growing Huntington is investing in resources and talent, especially in those areas that we'll grow revenue. The slide lists selected new management team members hired over the last several months. As you can see, some are in positions to take what we have and make it better like those in retail and business banking and commercial banking business segments. Other new hires are leaders in teams aimed to developing critical mass in existing businesses, such as currency risk management or to expand existing businesses into new markets like brokered sales. And we've initiated a new business with the national settlement's team.  These investments reflect the early stages of implementing our strategic plan. With that, I'd like to turn this over to Don for a financial performance review. Don?"

As noted on Slide 11, our net loss for the fourth quarter was $369.7 million or $0.56 a share. Two significant items impact to the quarter's results.

As noted on Slide 11, our net loss for the fourth quarter was $369.7 million or $0.56 a share. Two significant items impact to the quarter's results. First, we recognized a $73.6 million or $0.07 per share of gain from the redemption of subordinated notes. We completed a tender offer primarily [ph] (25:29) in the fourth quarter, redeeming $371 million of our then outstanding subordinated debt. The gain represents the discount paid on the tender and the impact of closing out the related interests rate swap.Second, we had a $12 million or $0.02 per share of benefit from the recognition on certain previously deferred tax valuation allowances. Slide 12 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trend. Many of the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation so let's move on. On Slide 13, we provided an overview of our pretax, pre-provisioned income performance. We believe this metric is useful in something [ph] (26:03) the underlying operating performance. Calculate this metric by starting with the pretax earnings then excluding three items: Provisions for credit losses, security gains and losses and amortization of intangibles.  We also adjusted, for a certain significant items including the gain resulting this quarter's subordinated debt tender offer. On this basis, our pretax pre-provisioned income for the third quarter was $242.1 million, up $4.9 million or 2% from the prior quarter. This improvement clearly reflects the management actions taken during the year and we continue to look for additional opportunities to improve our core operating performance.Slide 14 provides a trend of our net interest income and our margin. During the fourth quarter, our full tax equivalent net interest income increased by $9.6 million, reflecting a one basis point decrease in our net interest margin and a $1.3 billion increase in our average earnings asset base. The margin chain [ph] (27:00) reflected a favorable impact of our improved deposit mix and loan pricing, offset by the negative impacts of our stronger liquidity position but deposit growth resulted in increases to our investment securities portfolio.Also impacting the margin was a swap in effect [ph] (27:15) that's occurring at the end of the third quarter, producing the current quarter's net interest income. On the Slide 15, we show the change in mix our investment portfolio. With the growth in our deposits, we've invested the funds primarily in shorter duration and variable rate securities, such as agencies, agency CMO and certain asset-backed securities. The short-term nature of these investments provides a flexibility to reposition the portfolio. If the yield curve starts to steepen, forward [ph] (27:40) if we decide to utilize upon future loan growth.Continue on to Slide 16, we show the linked quarter of loan lease trends. Total commercial loans were down $0.8 billion or 4%, reflecting the impact of lower-lying utilization for our commericial borrowers. The decline also reflects the planned lower real estate balances from the pay downs and charge offs occurring there in the quarter. Total consumer loans were flat with the prior quarter, despite a 31% increase in the origination volume for automobile loans. This increased origination volume was offset by the impact of our continued run off of the auto leased portfolio and lower residential real estate balances. Turning to Slide 17, our strong core deposit growth continued into the fourth quarter. Total quarter core deposits grew in annualized 16% rate, and the growth came from demand deposit and money market categories. The Warren Bank acquisition added $260 million of core deposits an average. Even after adjusting for this impact, core deposits were up 13% on an annualized basis. Slide 18 shows the trends in our noninterest income category. Our noninterest income declined by $11.5 million from the prior quarter. Other income declined by $7.5 million, reflecting a $16.4 million lower benefit from the change in the fair value of our derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting. This was offset by $7.5 million of losses on loans held for sale in the third quarter.  Our service charges on deposit accounts declined $4.1 million from the third quarter levels, primarily due to lower NSF/OD-related fees.  Mortgage income was up $3.2 million, reflecting the stronger origination volume and a $2.2 million gain from the MSR hedging activity for the current quarter. The next slide is a summary of our expense trends. Total expenses were down $78.5 million from the prior quarter. This reduction was primarily due to the $73.6 million gain on the debt redemption.  OREO and foreclosure expenses were down $20.4 million as the prior quarter reflected a $14 million loss on loan commercial OREO properties.Core sale costs were up $8.5 million from the previous quarter. This increase included a $4.7 million increase in incentive-related costs. Core salaries were up about 2% from the third quarter, reflecting the increase of 81 FTE, primarily for specific strategic initiatives.Slide 20 is a summary of our capital trends. We completed a series of capital actions over the last year. The most recent action was the completion of a tender offer for our subordinated debt, resulting in a $73.6 million of pretax gains. This transaction reflected the utilization of proceeds from our earlier common stock issuance. Our capital ratio throughout the year have improved and with our TCE ratio increasing from 4.04% a year ago to 5.92% at the end of this year. Most importantly, we think these actions positions well to weather further economic challenges. We do not have any current plans to issue additional capital.Let me turn the presentation back over to Tim Barber for credit review."

Turning to Slide 21, our total net charge-offs were $88.8 million or 25% higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, with substantial changes in the composition. Total commercial net charge-offs were $129.8 million higher in the quarter as both the C&I and commercial real estate portfolio showed increases. In the consumer portfolio, there were no portfolio actions this quarter contributing to the significant decrease from the prior quarter.We saw elevated levels of losses as a result of the economic conditions. However, it is important to note that we continue to see a reduction in early-stage delinquencies despite historically difficult fourth quarter timeframe. As we consider our asset quality trends and drivers, the commercial real estate portfolio remains the most stressed and our primary concern. Within the commercial real estate portfolio, the single-family homebuilders and the retail projects remained the two highest risk segments, generating the bulk of the credit losses. Of the $268 million of commercial real estate charge-offs in the quarter, 73% were associated with these two segments. The retail portfolio alone comprised nearly 50% of the commercial real estate charge-offs. Both of these portfolio segments continued to show stress as we worked with the borrowers in resolving the credit issues.While historically, we have viewed the single-family builder portfolio at the highest risk segment, we believe that we have substantially addressed that exposure at this point. Based on the sum total of our activity over the last two and a half years, we do not expect any material future credit impact from this portfolio of segments.The $41 million increase in C&I net charge-offs was primarily associated with losses on four large C&I relationships. The four borrowers represent different industries but all were significantly impacted by the difficult economic environment over the past year.Aside from the impact of these loans, the quarter looked much the same as prior quarter. Given the difficult economic environment, we expect that there will be some continuing challenges in the C&I portfolio as we obtain and analyze that stated financial information throughout the next year. But we feel comfortable regarding the overall performance of the C&I block. A particular note is the continued strengthening of our business banking portfolio performance over the past couple of quarters. We continue to feel very good about the C&I loans in our Auto Finance and Dealer Services portfolio. We do not anticipate any material dealer-related losses in the portfolio even in the face of the market disruption over the past year. It has clearly been a positive for our portfolio. Our first [ph] (33:26) selection criteria with a focus on multi-dealership groups has proven itself in this environment. While the outstandings have declined in this portfolio as the utilization on floor plan lines has decreased, we continue to pursue and win new relationships that meet our credit profile. In a seasonally difficult quarter, the consumer portfolio performed consistent with our expectations. The auto loans and leases continued their strong performance while the increased net charge-offs and some equity loans continue to be driven by our loss mitigation activities. There are fewer accounts in our loss mitigation queues today, as we continue to proactively work our way through our portfolio. Residential mortgages and the other consumer loan category were consistent with the prior quarter on an adjusted basis.  In the residential portfolio, our loss from mitigation queues are down 50% from midyear 2009. We were generally pleased with the results across our consumer portfolio during the quarter. There has been some industry discussion recently regarding the loss recognition on bankrupt accounts. We've taken a really conservative stance on recognizing losses on customers who have filed for bankruptcy protection across the consumer portfolio.  Slide 22 represents the net charge off ratios associated with the portfolios. Turning to Slide 23, we were very pleased with the reduction in nonperforming assets in the quarter. A $286 million or 12% reduction was centered in a substantially reduced inflow with significant payment and sales activity. The reduction was evident across all of the individual portfolio that was particularly strong in the commercial real estate portfolio. The accruing of restructured loans shown at the bottom of the page reflect the impact of our continued efforts, particularly in the residential secured portfolio of segments.While the portfolio continued to be affected by the fragile economic environment across our footprint, our commitment to the enhanced portfolio management processes and problem loan resolution activity over the course of 2009 became more evident in this quarter.Slide 24 provides a reconciliations of the quarterly changes in the nonperforming asset balances. You can see the dramatic decrease in the additions line from $900 million last year to under $500 million this quarter. Please note that we continue to be focused on the early recognition of non-accruals. As with the prior quarter, 35% of the total C&I and commercial real estate non-accrual loans were current from a payment standpoint.Auto loan losses represents the next largest reduction in the quarter. It's important to focus on the impact of each of the other line items. As you have heard us say over the last year, we have made a significant commitment to the size and expertise of our commercial workout group. Payments, return to accrual status and sales activities are all a function of this group's impact. Each of these line items represent a high watermark to date.As we view this slide, it's important to include some comments regarding the underlying migration we are seeing in the portfolio. Although non-accruing loans decreased by a net 12% in the quarter, we did see a continued increase in the level of criticized loans, although at less than a 4% range. This rate of increase is slightly lower than the third quarter results, an indication of some stabilization evident in the portfolio. As you may recall, in using Slide 68 in the appendix as a reference, there was a substantial migration of outstandings into the criticized category, a combination of the OLEM and classified segments in the second quarter, as a result of that quarter's broad-based review activity.The third and fourth quarter increases were manageable given the economic environment. The commercial real estate portfolio continues to be the primary source of the increases in criticized loan outstandings. We were encouraged by the low level of net change in criticized loan levels growth for both the C&I and business banking segments. This is consistent with our view that the commercial real estate portfolio is the primary driver of the asset quality performance.Slide 25 provides an overview of the asset quality trends, particularly in relation to our reserve levels. We have discussed the reduction in non-accruing loans and the basis for the increase in the charge-off ratio in the fourth quarter. The 90 plus days past due in accruing line represents the continued focus on asset portfolio management and non-accrual treatment decisions.Steve provided an overview with a change in reserve levels for the quarter and the bottom half of this slide provides you with some historical context for the resulting ratios. Since we view the entire allowance for credit losses as available to cover loan losses, I will focus on the ACL ratios in my discussion.The 4.16% of outstandings and 80% coverage of non-accruing loans are in line with where we believe the industry will be as of the fourth quarter. The 96% coverage of adjusted non-accruing loans excludes the Franklin exposure. We have established to set a allowance for credit loss benchmarks to provide a basis of assessing the adequacy of the reserve. And it was within this framework that we determine the level of increase appropriate for the portfolio.In conjunction with our asset quality trends, the general economic conditions and a forward-looking view of the commercial real estate market, we use these benchmarks in determining the $450 million increase to the reserves. There was a $200 million increase in the judgmental component, including an enhancement to the economic reserve portion. There was also an incremental $200 million allocated primarily to the commercial real estate portfolio, addressing the severity of commercial real estate loss given default percentages and a longer-term view of the loss emergence time period. Lastly, approximately $50 million was a function of our normal annual process of adjusting the reserve factors on our consumer portfolios, allocated specifically to the residential and home equity portfolio of segments.We continue to be pleased with the steady reduction in the 30-day accruing delinquency ratio for the total loan portfolio as shown on Slide 26. This is a result of the focus and attention of our relationship managers and the enhanced portfolio management process we put into place over the course of the past 12 months. As expected, we had no accruing loans over 90 days past due.On Slide 27, our early-stage consumer delinquency trends are also positive, led by the significant reduction in the residential portfolio. This decrease represents a core decline as the portfolio of sale and timing of loss recognition adjustments in the third quarter did not impact this segment. The 90-plus days past due results were up slightly for the residential portfolio. It should be noted that the residential presentation excludes the government-guaranteed and Franklin-related loans. The auto and home equity portfolio has performed much as expected.The next four slides provide additional disclosure around our commercial real estate portfolio, specifically the reconciliation of the balance reductions and the introduction of the core versus non-core concepts. You will be able to find the product type, the maturity schedules from the prior quarter on Slid 82 through 84 in the appendix.Slide 28 shows the material decrease in the level of commercial real estate outstandings since the year-ago quarter. While the net reduction of $2.4 billion is significant, an analysis of the specific component is important. We originated only $255 million of new commercial real estate credit, but did have over $1 billion of takedowns on existing projects. The remaining non-funded commitments associated with commercial real estate projects is not material.The $1.7 billion of payments is a very significant number and is a function of our commitment to reduce the commercial real estate concentration via portfolio of management activity, such rightsizing loans with our borrowers. The increased expertise in our commercial workout area and the ramp-up in payments over the course of the past two quarters reflect this commitment.As we have previously indicated, this past year, we embarked on an exercise to properly classify our loans. In the first quarter, we made an initial series of changes, primarily centered on moving owner-occupied loans from commercial real estate to C&I based on the cash flow underwriting of the credits. We made similar adjustments in the fourth quarter, primarily associated with loans to healthcare entities and colleges and universities. We believe that loans underwritten based on cash flow from operations should be considered as commercial loans secured by real estate and not housed in the commercial real estate portfolio, which is a real estate project-oriented portfolio.The final portion of the reduction was associated with the charge-off activity. Slide 29 provides a summary of the credit quality metrics for the commercial real estate portfolio, including the breakout of the single-family homebuilder and retail project portfolio of segments. Including the impact of the fourth quarter reserve build, we have taken a 31% grossed up credit mark on the remaining $857 million a single-family home builder portfolio.As I indicated earlier, we do not expect any material credit issues from the homebuilder segment going forward. The retail portfolio has a 20% credit mark, which we also believe is an appropriate mark given our current assessment of the projects within the portfolio. The overall increase in the reserve level to 9.94% of loans represents a proactive assessment of the portfolio and the market tightening [ph] (43:39) that is likely to exist in the coming quarters.Slide 30 provides the basis for distinguishing between the core and non-core portions of our commercial real estate portfolio. The key to the core designation is the meaningful relationship, Midwest footprint projects and adequate returns on capital. This segregation gives our investors increased transparency as it allows us to provide ongoing performance metrics.Slide 31 provides the breakdown of the commercial real estate portfolio as of the end of the quarter with the September balances and credit metrics provided to facilitate comparisons. You can see the breakdown between the designations with core comprising 53% of the total. This borrowers we intend to support, grow and develop.Our core portfolio as of December is very clean. We have maintained a 4% reserve given the economic environment and commercial real estate market conditions. But the non-core portfolio, we have established very substantial reserves and calculated the credit mark. This 27% ratio indicates the aggregate credit mark incorporating both prior charge-offs and existing reserves associated with the loans in the portfolio. It does not include any full balance charge-offs or charge-offs taken on loans that have been paid off. The 27% mark includes a 40% factor on loans managed within the Special Assets division.We believe that this level of credit action puts us in a strong position of a flexibility to continue to deal proactively with future credit issues. Let me turn the presentation back to Steve for wrap up."

First, we still do not believe there'll be any significant economic turnaround this year. We do see signs of stabilization and a key assumption for our current outlook comment is that the economy stabilizes at near the current level throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect net charge-offs and provision expense parts will be meaningfully below 2009 levels. For us, 2009 is the peak year, our allowance for credit losses is expected to decline on an absolute basis from its year-end level, reflecting the utilization of existing reserves for elevated inherent losses. We expect our net interest margin will improve from 3.19% level in the fourth quarter. We anticipate strong growth in core deposits as we grow our retail and business customer bases, as well as increased cross-sell performance to existing customers. Loan growth is expected to be flat to up slightly. From one hand, we expect increases in C&I and certain consumer segments as customer confidence improves. However, commercial real estate loans are expected to continue to decline. Fee income will continue to be flat to slightly down, however, we expect growth in asset management, as well as brokerage and insurance revenues offset in part by declines NSF overdraft fees. Expenses are expected to increase, reflecting the investment of growth and implementation of key strategic initiatives. We believe these set of expectations will return us to quarterly profitable performance sometime during the year.Let me use the next slide to provide some perspective. On slide 33, we showed the quarterly improvement in pretax pre-provision performance. It also shows we're targeting the continued improvements to $275 million in the third quarter. And this is on aggressive target, for sure, but one we feel is achievable, it will be dependent primarily on our ability to increase net interest income, control our expense growth by offsetting the cost of investments with improved efficiencies. The growth in net interest income is expected to reflect a combination of factors, including loan and investment securities growth. Continued growth in lower cost core deposits and the resulting improved funding mix and a higher net interest margin reflecting approved loan and deposit spreads.Let me use the next two slides to review key messages that I hope that come to our comments today. Throughout 2009, we reviewed all assets on the balance sheet. We specifically commented frequently about the in-depth review of our loan portfolios, as well as the strengthening of our credit management and review processes begun last January. These reviews are completed.Second, our loan loss reserves are strong and we're better positioned to continue to address the resolutions of problem credits. The rate of increasing criticize from classified loans, as well as the inflow into NPAs is flowing. Net charge-offs and provision expense reached their high water mark in 2009. The core, non-core segmentation of our commercial real estate portfolio provides greater transparency and facilitate its further reduction. This will result in improved loan mix over time. We made significant progress in addressing key commercial loan portfolio concerned, specially Franklin in the Single Family Homebuilder segment of our commercial real estate portfolio. Our C&I and consumer loan portfolios continued to perform within expectation given the state of economy. We continue to believe our consumer loan portfolio performance will outperform many of our peers on a relative basis.But I think its also important to remember that we're not yet out of this economic cycle. Negative credit migration is expected to continue though at a slower rate than we saw in 2009. ON Slide 35 and continuing, our liquidity position has a built to very strong level. The strongest in many years. Our funding mix is much stronger and balance given the increase in core deposits. We're growing households and business relationships. Our capital is sufficient to weather a stressed economic scenario. We have no current plan to raise new capital. We're better positioned to eventually repay the $1.4 billion TARP capital.We're continuing to make progress in growing pretax pre-provision earnings and our goal of $275 million by the third quarter is aggressive but we believe it's achievable. We're continuing to stress that our management team and the depth of expertise at all levels. We've shifted to offense as reflected in our new hirings and the implementation of our strategic plan. And we'll continue to make investments targeted to grow key fee businesses. We enjoyed one of the better fee incomes of the revenue ratios amongst our regional peer events [ph] . Lastly, when we put it all together, we believe we'll return to quarterly profitability during 2010.They said at the beginning, 2009 was very difficult. We're all excited about the possibilities for 2010. We still have credit challenges but we're much better prepared to deal with them today than a year ago. And I think those challenges, going forward, will be much more manageable. We're getting stronger every day at Huntington.  So thank you for your interest. Operator, we'll now take questions. Courtney back to you."

Our criticized loan levels continue to increase albeit at a slower rate. So as we thought about all of those factors combined, we felt that it was prudent to increase the reserve. I've provided a breakdown in the comments and I'm happy to go back through that if you like. A fair amount of it had to do with commercial real estate. Both in terms of the severity side of the equation, as well as the time frame over which we're seeing losses. We also incorporated a more substantial judgmental portion to the reserve, specifically enhanced our economic reserve modeling portion of that.

First, a word of introduction, I'm pleased to introduce Randy Stickler to you. He joined us in March of last year. He came to us from Charter One Bank, where he was the State of Ohio President. He has over 25 years of commercial banking experience. Most of it in commercial real estate businesses at various banks. He's been very busy this past year, has been instrumental of the significant progress we've made in reviewing and addressing the issues in our commercial real estate portfolio. So welcome, Randy.At 2009, will go down as one of most challenging years facing the industry at Huntington in decades, so a lot of difficult decisions needed to be made. And as a result, our performance was disappointing from our credit quality and earnings performance standpoint. However, I'm convinced that we're entering a brand new year in 2010 in many respect, so much stronger company with underlying momentum that will result in significantly-improved performance. There are recent signs that the economic department is stabilizing, yet it remains uncertain and even fragile. Nevertheless, sometime during 2010 we expect to return to quarterly profitability. Our colleagues are working hard to make that happen with the objective of getting there as soon as possible. Decisions in the fourth quarter were important to this end and I hope that our remarks today will give you the same confidence that we have in achieving this goal. I'll begin with a review of our fourth quarter performance highlights. Don will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. Tim will provide an update on credit and a review of our commercial real estate portfolio. I'll then return with some 2010 outlook comments in what I hope our investors will take away from today's presentation.Let's begin. Turning to Slide 8, reported a net loss of $369.7 million or $0.56 of common share, the driver of the loss was an $894 million provision for credit losses. This was $419 million higher than in the third quarter and more than double the fourth quarter's net charge-offs. Contributing to this increase were certain credit actions that we'll talk about in more detail in a moment. Yet, we continued to make good progress in improving our pre-tax, pre-provisioned income. This totaled $242 million, up just under $5 million or 2% from the third quarter and represented the fourth consecutive quarterly improvement. It's also important to note that this level was 24% higher than in the year-ago quarter. This demonstrates the progress we're making in positioning Huntington for a stronger financial performance once this credit cycle ends.The linked quarter improvement was driven by a 3% increase in net interest income, our largest revenue contributor. But the big story for the quarter was the large provisions, so let me review what drove this. Now as you'll recall from earlier earnings calls and investor communication, since the first quarter, we've been deeply involved in understanding and addressing the risks in our credit and loan portfolio. The first nine months were spent in a series of detailed portfolio reviews and the implementation of enhanced portfolio management processes. This permitted us to proactively identify and address the risks in our portfolio.  Charge-offs remained elevated and we continue to build our loan loss reserves, again through the first nine months. We reported last quarter that the growth rate in criticized loans have slowed but that our customers remained under pressure from the weak economy. As a result, during the fourth quarter, there was a continued increase in the absolute level of criticized loans, though, at the third quarter's slower pace.Given the uncertain economic picture in 2010 and a trend line of growing pre-losses throughout 2009, during the fourth quarter, we reviewed our loan loss reserves assumptions portfolio by portfolio. And as a result, we've felt a significant increase in our loan loss reserves was warranted. We wanted to assure that we had sufficient reserves to continue to address the resolution of problem credits, existing credits inherent in our portfolios, in what is likely to remain a fragile economy. Our period end allowance for credit losses represents 4.16% of total loans and leases and our non-accrual loan coverage improved 80% from 50% at the end of the third quarter. Yet we're seeing signs that are very encouraging. Total nonperforming assets declined 12% from the end of the third quarter, and there was a 45% decline in new nonperforming assets compared with the third quarter.As noted earlier, the rate of increase in criticized and classified loans is slowing. Early-stage delinquencies also improved. So as we've stated since January of last year, the area of most credit concern has been our commercial real estate portfolio and specifically, our exposures to Single-Family Homebuilders and our Retail segment. As we enter 2010, I think it's important that our investors know that as the result of the actions taken this past year, we have substantially addressed the Single-Family Homebuilders segment. This is not a major concern going forward.The portfolio management focused over the course of the year, combined with the reserved actions and dividing our commercial real estate portfolio into core and non-core segments, positions us better to deal with this exposure going forward. And Tim will provide details. Our C&I and consumer portfolios are experiencing higher than normal charge-offs given the weak economy, but we believe these will remain manageable with our consumer loan portfolio particularly performing better relative to peers.Now turning to Slide 9, despite a reduction due to the fourth quarter's loss, as expected our capital position remains a positive story. Our period end Tier 1 and total risk base capital ratios were 12.05% and 14.43%, respectively.  These are $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion above respective regulatory well-capitalized 6% and 10% thresholds. We continue to believe we have sufficient capital to weather a stressed economic scenario. I'll say it again, we continue to believe we have sufficient capital to weather a stressed economic scenario. Our tangible common equity ratio was 5.92%. A year ago at the end of 2008, we were at 4.04%. Liquidity, which have seen quarterly improvements for the first three quarters stressed [ph] (23:29) in further. Again, this past quarter, a key driver was the strong 16% annualized growth rate in core deposits. Our loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of December was 91%, improved from 94% at the end of September and significantly improved from 108% at the end of 2008. Our deposit growth permitted us to reduce non-core funding by $1.8 billion during the quarter.Turning to governance and management, we continue to build the strength of our Board of Directors with the employment of Rick Neu [Neumeyer]. Rick was the former CFO and Treasurer of Charter One Financial and prior to that, he was in First Federal of Michigan. He's got extensive hands on and experience in Detroit and Cleveland markets and other markets, and he's a CPA by way of training. He's a tremendous addition to the board.Slide 10, a key element of growing Huntington is investing in resources and talent, especially in those areas that we'll grow revenue. The slide lists selected new management team members hired over the last several months. As you can see, some are in positions to take what we have and make it better like those in retail and business banking and commercial banking business segments. Other new hires are leaders in teams aimed to developing critical mass in existing businesses, such as currency risk management or to expand existing businesses into new markets like brokered sales. And we've initiated a new business with the national settlement's team.  These investments reflect the early stages of implementing our strategic plan. With that, I'd like to turn this over to Don for a financial performance review. Don?"

As noted on Slide 11, our net loss for the fourth quarter was $369.7 million or $0.56 a share. Two significant items impact to the quarter's results.

As noted on Slide 11, our net loss for the fourth quarter was $369.7 million or $0.56 a share. Two significant items impact to the quarter's results. First, we recognized a $73.6 million or $0.07 per share of gain from the redemption of subordinated notes. We completed a tender offer primarily [ph] (25:29) in the fourth quarter, redeeming $371 million of our then outstanding subordinated debt. The gain represents the discount paid on the tender and the impact of closing out the related interests rate swap.Second, we had a $12 million or $0.02 per share of benefit from the recognition on certain previously deferred tax valuation allowances. Slide 12 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trend. Many of the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation so let's move on. On Slide 13, we provided an overview of our pretax, pre-provisioned income performance. We believe this metric is useful in something [ph] (26:03) the underlying operating performance. Calculate this metric by starting with the pretax earnings then excluding three items: Provisions for credit losses, security gains and losses and amortization of intangibles.  We also adjusted, for a certain significant items including the gain resulting this quarter's subordinated debt tender offer. On this basis, our pretax pre-provisioned income for the third quarter was $242.1 million, up $4.9 million or 2% from the prior quarter. This improvement clearly reflects the management actions taken during the year and we continue to look for additional opportunities to improve our core operating performance.Slide 14 provides a trend of our net interest income and our margin. During the fourth quarter, our full tax equivalent net interest income increased by $9.6 million, reflecting a one basis point decrease in our net interest margin and a $1.3 billion increase in our average earnings asset base. The margin chain [ph] (27:00) reflected a favorable impact of our improved deposit mix and loan pricing, offset by the negative impacts of our stronger liquidity position but deposit growth resulted in increases to our investment securities portfolio.Also impacting the margin was a swap in effect [ph] (27:15) that's occurring at the end of the third quarter, producing the current quarter's net interest income. On the Slide 15, we show the change in mix our investment portfolio. With the growth in our deposits, we've invested the funds primarily in shorter duration and variable rate securities, such as agencies, agency CMO and certain asset-backed securities. The short-term nature of these investments provides a flexibility to reposition the portfolio. If the yield curve starts to steepen, forward [ph] (27:40) if we decide to utilize upon future loan growth.Continue on to Slide 16, we show the linked quarter of loan lease trends. Total commercial loans were down $0.8 billion or 4%, reflecting the impact of lower-lying utilization for our commericial borrowers. The decline also reflects the planned lower real estate balances from the pay downs and charge offs occurring there in the quarter. Total consumer loans were flat with the prior quarter, despite a 31% increase in the origination volume for automobile loans. This increased origination volume was offset by the impact of our continued run off of the auto leased portfolio and lower residential real estate balances. Turning to Slide 17, our strong core deposit growth continued into the fourth quarter. Total quarter core deposits grew in annualized 16% rate, and the growth came from demand deposit and money market categories. The Warren Bank acquisition added $260 million of core deposits an average. Even after adjusting for this impact, core deposits were up 13% on an annualized basis. Slide 18 shows the trends in our noninterest income category. Our noninterest income declined by $11.5 million from the prior quarter. Other income declined by $7.5 million, reflecting a $16.4 million lower benefit from the change in the fair value of our derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting. This was offset by $7.5 million of losses on loans held for sale in the third quarter.  Our service charges on deposit accounts declined $4.1 million from the third quarter levels, primarily due to lower NSF/OD-related fees.  Mortgage income was up $3.2 million, reflecting the stronger origination volume and a $2.2 million gain from the MSR hedging activity for the current quarter. The next slide is a summary of our expense trends. Total expenses were down $78.5 million from the prior quarter. This reduction was primarily due to the $73.6 million gain on the debt redemption.  OREO and foreclosure expenses were down $20.4 million as the prior quarter reflected a $14 million loss on loan commercial OREO properties.Core sale costs were up $8.5 million from the previous quarter. This increase included a $4.7 million increase in incentive-related costs. Core salaries were up about 2% from the third quarter, reflecting the increase of 81 FTE, primarily for specific strategic initiatives.Slide 20 is a summary of our capital trends. We completed a series of capital actions over the last year. The most recent action was the completion of a tender offer for our subordinated debt, resulting in a $73.6 million of pretax gains. This transaction reflected the utilization of proceeds from our earlier common stock issuance. Our capital ratio throughout the year have improved and with our TCE ratio increasing from 4.04% a year ago to 5.92% at the end of this year. Most importantly, we think these actions positions well to weather further economic challenges. We do not have any current plans to issue additional capital.Let me turn the presentation back over to Tim Barber for credit review."
278614,84136927,46657,"Huntington Bancshares Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2010",2010-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Don. Turning to Slide 21, our total net charge-offs were $88.8 million or 25% higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, with substantial changes in the composition. Total commercial net charge-offs were $129.8 million higher in t",2206,"Thanks, Don. Turning to Slide 21, our total net charge-offs were $88.8 million or 25% higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, with substantial changes in the composition. Total commercial net charge-offs were $129.8 million higher in the quarter as both the C&I and commercial real estate portfolio showed increases. In the consumer portfolio, there were no portfolio actions this quarter contributing to the significant decrease from the prior quarter.We saw elevated levels of losses as a result of the economic conditions. However, it is important to note that we continue to see a reduction in early-stage delinquencies despite historically difficult fourth quarter timeframe. As we consider our asset quality trends and drivers, the commercial real estate portfolio remains the most stressed and our primary concern. Within the commercial real estate portfolio, the single-family homebuilders and the retail projects remained the two highest risk segments, generating the bulk of the credit losses. Of the $268 million of commercial real estate charge-offs in the quarter, 73% were associated with these two segments. The retail portfolio alone comprised nearly 50% of the commercial real estate charge-offs. Both of these portfolio segments continued to show stress as we worked with the borrowers in resolving the credit issues.While historically, we have viewed the single-family builder portfolio at the highest risk segment, we believe that we have substantially addressed that exposure at this point. Based on the sum total of our activity over the last two and a half years, we do not expect any material future credit impact from this portfolio of segments.The $41 million increase in C&I net charge-offs was primarily associated with losses on four large C&I relationships. The four borrowers represent different industries but all were significantly impacted by the difficult economic environment over the past year.Aside from the impact of these loans, the quarter looked much the same as prior quarter. Given the difficult economic environment, we expect that there will be some continuing challenges in the C&I portfolio as we obtain and analyze that stated financial information throughout the next year. But we feel comfortable regarding the overall performance of the C&I block. A particular note is the continued strengthening of our business banking portfolio performance over the past couple of quarters. We continue to feel very good about the C&I loans in our Auto Finance and Dealer Services portfolio. We do not anticipate any material dealer-related losses in the portfolio even in the face of the market disruption over the past year. It has clearly been a positive for our portfolio. Our first [ph] (33:26) selection criteria with a focus on multi-dealership groups has proven itself in this environment. While the outstandings have declined in this portfolio as the utilization on floor plan lines has decreased, we continue to pursue and win new relationships that meet our credit profile. In a seasonally difficult quarter, the consumer portfolio performed consistent with our expectations. The auto loans and leases continued their strong performance while the increased net charge-offs and some equity loans continue to be driven by our loss mitigation activities. There are fewer accounts in our loss mitigation queues today, as we continue to proactively work our way through our portfolio. Residential mortgages and the other consumer loan category were consistent with the prior quarter on an adjusted basis.  In the residential portfolio, our loss from mitigation queues are down 50% from midyear 2009. We were generally pleased with the results across our consumer portfolio during the quarter. There has been some industry discussion recently regarding the loss recognition on bankrupt accounts. We've taken a really conservative stance on recognizing losses on customers who have filed for bankruptcy protection across the consumer portfolio.  Slide 22 represents the net charge off ratios associated with the portfolios. Turning to Slide 23, we were very pleased with the reduction in nonperforming assets in the quarter. A $286 million or 12% reduction was centered in a substantially reduced inflow with significant payment and sales activity. The reduction was evident across all of the individual portfolio that was particularly strong in the commercial real estate portfolio. The accruing of restructured loans shown at the bottom of the page reflect the impact of our continued efforts, particularly in the residential secured portfolio of segments.While the portfolio continued to be affected by the fragile economic environment across our footprint, our commitment to the enhanced portfolio management processes and problem loan resolution activity over the course of 2009 became more evident in this quarter.Slide 24 provides a reconciliations of the quarterly changes in the nonperforming asset balances. You can see the dramatic decrease in the additions line from $900 million last year to under $500 million this quarter. Please note that we continue to be focused on the early recognition of non-accruals. As with the prior quarter, 35% of the total C&I and commercial real estate non-accrual loans were current from a payment standpoint.Auto loan losses represents the next largest reduction in the quarter. It's important to focus on the impact of each of the other line items. As you have heard us say over the last year, we have made a significant commitment to the size and expertise of our commercial workout group. Payments, return to accrual status and sales activities are all a function of this group's impact. Each of these line items represent a high watermark to date.As we view this slide, it's important to include some comments regarding the underlying migration we are seeing in the portfolio. Although non-accruing loans decreased by a net 12% in the quarter, we did see a continued increase in the level of criticized loans, although at less than a 4% range. This rate of increase is slightly lower than the third quarter results, an indication of some stabilization evident in the portfolio. As you may recall, in using Slide 68 in the appendix as a reference, there was a substantial migration of outstandings into the criticized category, a combination of the OLEM and classified segments in the second quarter, as a result of that quarter's broad-based review activity.The third and fourth quarter increases were manageable given the economic environment. The commercial real estate portfolio continues to be the primary source of the increases in criticized loan outstandings. We were encouraged by the low level of net change in criticized loan levels growth for both the C&I and business banking segments. This is consistent with our view that the commercial real estate portfolio is the primary driver of the asset quality performance.Slide 25 provides an overview of the asset quality trends, particularly in relation to our reserve levels. We have discussed the reduction in non-accruing loans and the basis for the increase in the charge-off ratio in the fourth quarter. The 90 plus days past due in accruing line represents the continued focus on asset portfolio management and non-accrual treatment decisions.Steve provided an overview with a change in reserve levels for the quarter and the bottom half of this slide provides you with some historical context for the resulting ratios. Since we view the entire allowance for credit losses as available to cover loan losses, I will focus on the ACL ratios in my discussion.The 4.16% of outstandings and 80% coverage of non-accruing loans are in line with where we believe the industry will be as of the fourth quarter. The 96% coverage of adjusted non-accruing loans excludes the Franklin exposure. We have established to set a allowance for credit loss benchmarks to provide a basis of assessing the adequacy of the reserve. And it was within this framework that we determine the level of increase appropriate for the portfolio.In conjunction with our asset quality trends, the general economic conditions and a forward-looking view of the commercial real estate market, we use these benchmarks in determining the $450 million increase to the reserves. There was a $200 million increase in the judgmental component, including an enhancement to the economic reserve portion. There was also an incremental $200 million allocated primarily to the commercial real estate portfolio, addressing the severity of commercial real estate loss given default percentages and a longer-term view of the loss emergence time period. Lastly, approximately $50 million was a function of our normal annual process of adjusting the reserve factors on our consumer portfolios, allocated specifically to the residential and home equity portfolio of segments.We continue to be pleased with the steady reduction in the 30-day accruing delinquency ratio for the total loan portfolio as shown on Slide 26. This is a result of the focus and attention of our relationship managers and the enhanced portfolio management process we put into place over the course of the past 12 months. As expected, we had no accruing loans over 90 days past due.On Slide 27, our early-stage consumer delinquency trends are also positive, led by the significant reduction in the residential portfolio. This decrease represents a core decline as the portfolio of sale and timing of loss recognition adjustments in the third quarter did not impact this segment. The 90-plus days past due results were up slightly for the residential portfolio. It should be noted that the residential presentation excludes the government-guaranteed and Franklin-related loans. The auto and home equity portfolio has performed much as expected.The next four slides provide additional disclosure around our commercial real estate portfolio, specifically the reconciliation of the balance reductions and the introduction of the core versus non-core concepts. You will be able to find the product type, the maturity schedules from the prior quarter on Slid 82 through 84 in the appendix.Slide 28 shows the material decrease in the level of commercial real estate outstandings since the year-ago quarter. While the net reduction of $2.4 billion is significant, an analysis of the specific component is important. We originated only $255 million of new commercial real estate credit, but did have over $1 billion of takedowns on existing projects. The remaining non-funded commitments associated with commercial real estate projects is not material.The $1.7 billion of payments is a very significant number and is a function of our commitment to reduce the commercial real estate concentration via portfolio of management activity, such rightsizing loans with our borrowers. The increased expertise in our commercial workout area and the ramp-up in payments over the course of the past two quarters reflect this commitment.As we have previously indicated, this past year, we embarked on an exercise to properly classify our loans. In the first quarter, we made an initial series of changes, primarily centered on moving owner-occupied loans from commercial real estate to C&I based on the cash flow underwriting of the credits. We made similar adjustments in the fourth quarter, primarily associated with loans to healthcare entities and colleges and universities. We believe that loans underwritten based on cash flow from operations should be considered as commercial loans secured by real estate and not housed in the commercial real estate portfolio, which is a real estate project-oriented portfolio.The final portion of the reduction was associated with the charge-off activity. Slide 29 provides a summary of the credit quality metrics for the commercial real estate portfolio, including the breakout of the single-family homebuilder and retail project portfolio of segments. Including the impact of the fourth quarter reserve build, we have taken a 31% grossed up credit mark on the remaining $857 million a single-family home builder portfolio.As I indicated earlier, we do not expect any material credit issues from the homebuilder segment going forward. The retail portfolio has a 20% credit mark, which we also believe is an appropriate mark given our current assessment of the projects within the portfolio. The overall increase in the reserve level to 9.94% of loans represents a proactive assessment of the portfolio and the market tightening [ph] (43:39) that is likely to exist in the coming quarters.Slide 30 provides the basis for distinguishing between the core and non-core portions of our commercial real estate portfolio. The key to the core designation is the meaningful relationship, Midwest footprint projects and adequate returns on capital. This segregation gives our investors increased transparency as it allows us to provide ongoing performance metrics.Slide 31 provides the breakdown of the commercial real estate portfolio as of the end of the quarter with the September balances and credit metrics provided to facilitate comparisons. You can see the breakdown between the designations with core comprising 53% of the total. This borrowers we intend to support, grow and develop.Our core portfolio as of December is very clean. We have maintained a 4% reserve given the economic environment and commercial real estate market conditions. But the non-core portfolio, we have established very substantial reserves and calculated the credit mark. This 27% ratio indicates the aggregate credit mark incorporating both prior charge-offs and existing reserves associated with the loans in the portfolio. It does not include any full balance charge-offs or charge-offs taken on loans that have been paid off. The 27% mark includes a 40% factor on loans managed within the Special Assets division.We believe that this level of credit action puts us in a strong position of a flexibility to continue to deal proactively with future credit issues. Let me turn the presentation back to Steve for wrap up."

First, we still do not believe there'll be any significant economic turnaround this year. We do see signs of stabilization and a key assumption for our current outlook comment is that the economy stabilizes at near the current level throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect net charge-offs and provision expense parts will be meaningfully below 2009 levels. For us, 2009 is the peak year, our allowance for credit losses is expected to decline on an absolute basis from its year-end level, reflecting the utilization of existing reserves for elevated inherent losses. We expect our net interest margin will improve from 3.19% level in the fourth quarter. We anticipate strong growth in core deposits as we grow our retail and business customer bases, as well as increased cross-sell performance to existing customers. Loan growth is expected to be flat to up slightly. From one hand, we expect increases in C&I and certain consumer segments as customer confidence improves. However, commercial real estate loans are expected to continue to decline. Fee income will continue to be flat to slightly down, however, we expect growth in asset management, as well as brokerage and insurance revenues offset in part by declines NSF overdraft fees. Expenses are expected to increase, reflecting the investment of growth and implementation of key strategic initiatives. We believe these set of expectations will return us to quarterly profitable performance sometime during the year.Let me use the next slide to provide some perspective. On slide 33, we showed the quarterly improvement in pretax pre-provision performance. It also shows we're targeting the continued improvements to $275 million in the third quarter. And this is on aggressive target, for sure, but one we feel is achievable, it will be dependent primarily on our ability to increase net interest income, control our expense growth by offsetting the cost of investments with improved efficiencies. The growth in net interest income is expected to reflect a combination of factors, including loan and investment securities growth. Continued growth in lower cost core deposits and the resulting improved funding mix and a higher net interest margin reflecting approved loan and deposit spreads.Let me use the next two slides to review key messages that I hope that come to our comments today. Throughout 2009, we reviewed all assets on the balance sheet. We specifically commented frequently about the in-depth review of our loan portfolios, as well as the strengthening of our credit management and review processes begun last January. These reviews are completed.Second, our loan loss reserves are strong and we're better positioned to continue to address the resolutions of problem credits. The rate of increasing criticize from classified loans, as well as the inflow into NPAs is flowing. Net charge-offs and provision expense reached their high water mark in 2009. The core, non-core segmentation of our commercial real estate portfolio provides greater transparency and facilitate its further reduction. This will result in improved loan mix over time. We made significant progress in addressing key commercial loan portfolio concerned, specially Franklin in the Single Family Homebuilder segment of our commercial real estate portfolio. Our C&I and consumer loan portfolios continued to perform within expectation given the state of economy. We continue to believe our consumer loan portfolio performance will outperform many of our peers on a relative basis.But I think its also important to remember that we're not yet out of this economic cycle. Negative credit migration is expected to continue though at a slower rate than we saw in 2009. ON Slide 35 and continuing, our liquidity position has a built to very strong level. The strongest in many years. Our funding mix is much stronger and balance given the increase in core deposits. We're growing households and business relationships. Our capital is sufficient to weather a stressed economic scenario. We have no current plan to raise new capital. We're better positioned to eventually repay the $1.4 billion TARP capital.We're continuing to make progress in growing pretax pre-provision earnings and our goal of $275 million by the third quarter is aggressive but we believe it's achievable. We're continuing to stress that our management team and the depth of expertise at all levels. We've shifted to offense as reflected in our new hirings and the implementation of our strategic plan. And we'll continue to make investments targeted to grow key fee businesses. We enjoyed one of the better fee incomes of the revenue ratios amongst our regional peer events [ph] . Lastly, when we put it all together, we believe we'll return to quarterly profitability during 2010.They said at the beginning, 2009 was very difficult. We're all excited about the possibilities for 2010. We still have credit challenges but we're much better prepared to deal with them today than a year ago. And I think those challenges, going forward, will be much more manageable. We're getting stronger every day at Huntington.  So thank you for your interest. Operator, we'll now take questions.

First, a word of introduction, I'm pleased to introduce Randy Stickler to you. He joined us in March of last year. He came to us from Charter One Bank, where he was the State of Ohio President. He has over 25 years of commercial banking experience. Most of it in commercial real estate businesses at various banks. He's been very busy this past year, has been instrumental of the significant progress we've made in reviewing and addressing the issues in our commercial real estate portfolio. So welcome, Randy.At 2009, will go down as one of most challenging years facing the industry at Huntington in decades, so a lot of difficult decisions needed to be made. And as a result, our performance was disappointing from our credit quality and earnings performance standpoint. However, I'm convinced that we're entering a brand new year in 2010 in many respect, so much stronger company with underlying momentum that will result in significantly-improved performance. There are recent signs that the economic department is stabilizing, yet it remains uncertain and even fragile. Nevertheless, sometime during 2010 we expect to return to quarterly profitability. Our colleagues are working hard to make that happen with the objective of getting there as soon as possible. Decisions in the fourth quarter were important to this end and I hope that our remarks today will give you the same confidence that we have in achieving this goal. I'll begin with a review of our fourth quarter performance highlights. Don will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. Tim will provide an update on credit and a review of our commercial real estate portfolio. I'll then return with some 2010 outlook comments in what I hope our investors will take away from today's presentation.Let's begin. Turning to Slide 8, reported a net loss of $369.7 million or $0.56 of common share, the driver of the loss was an $894 million provision for credit losses. This was $419 million higher than in the third quarter and more than double the fourth quarter's net charge-offs. Contributing to this increase were certain credit actions that we'll talk about in more detail in a moment. Yet, we continued to make good progress in improving our pre-tax, pre-provisioned income. This totaled $242 million, up just under $5 million or 2% from the third quarter and represented the fourth consecutive quarterly improvement. It's also important to note that this level was 24% higher than in the year-ago quarter. This demonstrates the progress we're making in positioning Huntington for a stronger financial performance once this credit cycle ends.The linked quarter improvement was driven by a 3% increase in net interest income, our largest revenue contributor. But the big story for the quarter was the large provisions, so let me review what drove this. Now as you'll recall from earlier earnings calls and investor communication, since the first quarter, we've been deeply involved in understanding and addressing the risks in our credit and loan portfolio. The first nine months were spent in a series of detailed portfolio reviews and the implementation of enhanced portfolio management processes. This permitted us to proactively identify and address the risks in our portfolio.  Charge-offs remained elevated and we continue to build our loan loss reserves, again through the first nine months. We reported last quarter that the growth rate in criticized loans have slowed but that our customers remained under pressure from the weak economy. As a result, during the fourth quarter, there was a continued increase in the absolute level of criticized loans, though, at the third quarter's slower pace.Given the uncertain economic picture in 2010 and a trend line of growing pre-losses throughout 2009, during the fourth quarter, we reviewed our loan loss reserves assumptions portfolio by portfolio. And as a result, we've felt a significant increase in our loan loss reserves was warranted. We wanted to assure that we had sufficient reserves to continue to address the resolution of problem credits, existing credits inherent in our portfolios, in what is likely to remain a fragile economy. Our period end allowance for credit losses represents 4.16% of total loans and leases and our non-accrual loan coverage improved 80% from 50% at the end of the third quarter. Yet we're seeing signs that are very encouraging. Total nonperforming assets declined 12% from the end of the third quarter, and there was a 45% decline in new nonperforming assets compared with the third quarter.As noted earlier, the rate of increase in criticized and classified loans is slowing. Early-stage delinquencies also improved. So as we've stated since January of last year, the area of most credit concern has been our commercial real estate portfolio and specifically, our exposures to Single-Family Homebuilders and our Retail segment. As we enter 2010, I think it's important that our investors know that as the result of the actions taken this past year, we have substantially addressed the Single-Family Homebuilders segment. This is not a major concern going forward.The portfolio management focused over the course of the year, combined with the reserved actions and dividing our commercial real estate portfolio into core and non-core segments, positions us better to deal with this exposure going forward. And Tim will provide details. Our C&I and consumer portfolios are experiencing higher than normal charge-offs given the weak economy, but we believe these will remain manageable with our consumer loan portfolio particularly performing better relative to peers.Now turning to Slide 9, despite a reduction due to the fourth quarter's loss, as expected our capital position remains a positive story. Our period end Tier 1 and total risk base capital ratios were 12.05% and 14.43%, respectively.  These are $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion above respective regulatory well-capitalized 6% and 10% thresholds. We continue to believe we have sufficient capital to weather a stressed economic scenario. I'll say it again, we continue to believe we have sufficient capital to weather a stressed economic scenario. Our tangible common equity ratio was 5.92%. A year ago at the end of 2008, we were at 4.04%. Liquidity, which has seen quarterly improvements for the first three quarters strengthened further. Again, this past quarter, a key driver was the strong 16% annualized growth rate in core deposits. Our loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of December was 91%, improved from 94% at the end of September and significantly improved from 108% at the end of 2008. Our deposit growth permitted us to reduce non-core funding by $1.8 billion during the quarter.Turning to governance and management, we continue to build the strength of our Board of Directors with the employment of Rick Neu [Neumeyer]. Rick was the former CFO and Treasurer of Charter One Financial and prior to that, he was in First Federal of Michigan. He's got extensive hands-on experience in Detroit and Cleveland markets and other markets, and he's a CPA by way of training. He's a tremendous addition to the board.Slide 10, a key element of growing Huntington is investing in resources and talent, especially in those areas that will grow revenue. The slides lists selected new management team members hired over the last several months. As you can see, some are in positions to take what we have and make it better like those in retail and business banking and commercial banking business segments. Other new hires are leaders and teams aimed at developing critical mass in existing businesses, such as currency risk management or to expand existing businesses into new markets like brokerage sales. And we've initiated a new business with the National Settlement's Team. These investments reflect the early stages of implementing our strategic plan. With that, I'd like to turn this over to Don for a financial performance review. Don?"

As noted on Slide 11, our net loss for the fourth quarter was $369.7 million or $0.56 a share. Two significant items impacted the quarter's result.

As noted on Slide 11, our net loss for the fourth quarter was $369.7 million or $0.56 a share. Two significant items impacted the quarter's result. First, we recognized a $73.6 million or $0.07 per share of gain from the redemption of subordinated notes. We completed a tender offer primarily in the fourth quarter, redeeming $371 million of our then outstanding subordinated debt. The gain represents the discount paid on the tender and the impact of closing out the related interests rate swap. Second, we had a $12 million or $0.02 per share of benefit from the recognition of certain previously deferred tax valuation allowances. Slide 12 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trend. Many of the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation so let's move on. On Slide 13, we provided an overview of our pre-tax, pre-provisioned income performance. We believe this metric is useful in assessing the underlying operating performance. We calculate this metric by starting with the pre-tax earnings then excluding three items: provisions for credit losses, security gains and losses and amortization of intangibles. We also adjusted for a certain significant items including the gain resulting from this quarter's subordinated debt tender offer. On this basis, our pre-tax, pre-provisioned income for the third quarter was $242.1 million, up $4.9 million or 2% from the prior quarter. This improvement clearly reflected management actions taken during the year and we'll continue to look for additional opportunities to improve our core operating performance.Slide 14 provides a trend of our net interest income and our margin. During the fourth quarter, our fully taxed equivalent net interest income increased by $9.6 million, reflecting a one basis point decrease in our net interest margin and a $1.3 billion increase in our average earning asset base. The margin change [ph] (27:00) reflected a favorable impact of our improved deposit mix and loan pricing, offset by the negative impacts of our stronger liquidity position. The deposit growth resulting in increases to our investment security portfolio. Also impacting the margin was a swap in effectiveness occurring at the end of the third quarter, producing the current quarter's net interest income. On Slide 15, we show the change in the mix of our investment portfolio. With the growth in our deposits, we've invested the funds primarily in shorter duration and variable rate securities, such as agencies, agency CMO and certain asset-backed securities. The short-term nature of these investments provides a flexibility to reposition the portfolio if the yield curve starts to steepen, or if we decide to utilize the bond future loan growth.Continue on to Slide 16, we show the linked quarter of loan lease trend. Total commercial loans were down $0.8 billion or 4%, reflecting the impact of lower-lying utilization for our commercial borrowers. The decline also reflects the planned lower commercial real estate balances from the pay downs and charge-offs occurring during the quarter.  Total consumer loans were flat with the prior quarter, despite a 31% increase in the origination volume for automobile loans. This increased origination volume was offset by the impact of our continued run off of the auto leased portfolio and lower residential real estate balances. Turning to Slide 17, our strong core deposit growth continued into the fourth quarter. Total core deposits grew an annualized 16% rate, and the growth came from demand deposit and money market category. The Warren Bank acquisition added $260 million of core deposits an average. Even after adjusting for this impact, core deposits were up 13% on an annualized basis. Slide 18 shows the trends in our non-interest income category. Our non-interest income declined by $11.5 million from the prior quarter. Other income declined by $7.5 million, reflecting a $16.4 million lower benefit from the change in the fair value of our derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting. This was offset by $7.5 million of losses on loans held for sale in the third quarter.  Our service charges on deposit accounts declined $4.1 million from the third quarter levels, primarily due to lower NSF/OD-related fees.  Mortgage income was up $3.2 million, reflecting the stronger origination volume and a $2.2 million gain from the MSR hedging activity for the current quarter. The next slide is a summary of our expense trends. Total expenses were down $78.5 million from the prior quarter. This reduction was primarily due to the $73.6 million gain on the debt redemption. OREO and foreclosure expenses were down $20.4 million, as the prior quarter reflected a $14 million loss on one commercial OREO property. Personnel costs were up $8.5 million from the previous quarter. This increase included a $4.7 million increase from incentive-related costs. Core salaries were up about 2% from the third quarter, reflecting the increase of 81 FTE, primarily for specific strategic initiatives.Slide 20 is a summary of our capital trends. We completed a series of capital actions over the last year. The most recent action was the completion of a tender offer for our subordinated debt resulting in a $73.6 million of pre-tax gain. This transaction reflected the utilization of proceeds from our earlier common stock issuance. Our capital ratios throughout the year have improved, and with our TCE ratio increasing from 4.04% a year ago to 5.92% at the end of this year. Most importantly, we think these actions position as well to weather further economic challenges. We do not have any current plans to issue additional capital. Let me turn the presentation back over to Tim Barber for credit reviews."

Turning to Slide 21, our total net charge-offs were $88.8 million or 25% higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, with substantial changes in the composition. Total commercial net charge-offs were $129.8 million higher in t",2207,"Thanks, Don. Turning to Slide 21, our total net charge-offs were $88.8 million or 25% higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, with substantial changes in the composition. Total commercial net charge-offs were $129.8 million higher in the quarter as both the C&I and commercial real estate portfolio showed increases. In the consumer portfolio, there were no portfolio actions this quarter contributing to the significant decrease from the prior quarter. We saw elevated levels of losses as a result of the economic conditions. However, it is important to note that we continue to see a reduction in early-stage delinquencies despite the historically difficult fourth quarter time frame. As we consider our asset quality trends and drivers, the commercial real estate portfolio remains the most stressed and our primary concern. Within the commercial real estate portfolio, the Single-Family Homebuilders and the Retail projects remained the two highest risk segments, generating the bulk of the credit losses. Of the $258 million of commercial real estate charge-offs in the quarter, 73% were associated with these two segments. The retail portfolio alone comprised nearly 50% of the commercial real estate charge-offs. Both of these portfolio segments continued to show stress as we worked with the borrowers in resolving the credit issues.While historically, we have viewed the Single-Family Builder portfolio as the highest risk segment, we believe that we have substantially addressed that exposure at this point. Based on the sum total of our activity over the last two and a half years, we do not expect any material future credit impact from this portfolio segment. The $41 million increase in C&I net charge-offs was primarily associated with losses on four large C&I relationships. The four borrowers represent different industries but all were significantly impacted by the difficult economic environment over the past year.Aside from the impact of these loans, the quarter looked much the same as prior quarter. Given the difficult economic environment, we expect that there will be some continuing challenges in the C&I portfolio as we obtain and analyze updated financial information throughout the next year. But we feel comfortable regarding the overall performance of the C&I block. Of particular note is the continued strengthening of our business banking portfolio performance over the past couple of quarters. We continue to feel very good about the C&I loans in our Auto Finance and Dealer Services portfolio. We do not anticipate any material dealer-related losses in the portfolio even in the face of the market disruption over the past year. It has clearly been a positive for our portfolio. Our dealer selection criteria with the focus on multi-dealership groups has proven itself in this environment. While the outstandings have declined in this portfolio as the utilization on floor plan lines has decreased, we continue to pursue and win new relationships that meet our credit profile. In a seasonally difficult quarter, the consumer portfolio performed consistent with our expectations. The auto loans and leases continued their strong performance while the increased net charge-offs and home equity loans continue to be driven by our loss mitigation activities. There are fewer accounts in our loss mitigation queues today, as we continue to proactively work our way through the portfolio. Residential mortgages and the other consumer loan category were consistent with the prior quarter on an adjusted basis. In the residential portfolio, our loss from mitigation queues are down 50% from mid-year 2009. We were generally pleased with the results across our consumer portfolio during the quarter. There has been some industry discussion recently regarding the loss recognition on bankrupt accounts. We take an appropriately conservative stance on recognizing losses on customers who have filed for bankruptcy protection across the consumer portfolio. Slide 22 represents the net charge-off ratios associated with the portfolios. Turning to Slide 23, we were very pleased with the reduction in non-performing assets in the quarter. A $286 million or 12% reduction was centered in a substantially reduced inflow with significant payment and sales activity. The reduction was evident across all of the individual portfolios but was particularly strong in the commercial real estate portfolio. The accruing restructured loans shown at the bottom of the page reflect the impact of our continued efforts, particularly in the residential secured portfolio of segments. While the portfolio continued to be affected by the fragile economic environment across our footprint, our commitment to the enhanced portfolio management processes and problem loan resolution activity over the course of 2009 became more evident in this quarter.Slide 24 provides the reconciliation of the quarterly changes in the non-performing asset balances. You can see the dramatic decrease in the additions line from $900 million last quarter to under $500 million this quarter. Please note that we continue to be focused on the early recognition of non-accruals. As with the prior quarter, 35% of the total C&I and commercial real estate non-accrual loans were current from a payment standpoint.Auto loan losses represent the next largest reduction in the quarter. It is important to focus on the impact of each of the other line items. As you have heard us say over the last year, we have made a significant commitment to the size and expertise of our commercial workout group. Payments, return to accrual status and sales activities are all a function of this group's impact. Each of these line items represent a high watermark to date.As we view this slide, it is important to include some comments regarding the underlying migration we are seeing in the portfolio. Although non-accruing loans decreased by a net 12% in the quarter, we did see a continued increase in the level of criticized loans, although at less than a 4% range. This rate of increase is slightly lower than the third quarter results, one indication of some stabilization evident in the portfolio. As you may recall, in using Slide 68 in the appendix as a reference, there was a substantial migration of outstandings into the criticized category, a combination of the OLEM and classified segments in the second quarter, as a result of that quarter's broad-based review activity.The third and fourth quarter increases were manageable given the economic environment. The commercial real estate portfolio continues to be the primary source of the increases in criticized loan outstandings. We were encouraged by the low level of net change in criticized loan levels for both the C&I and business banking segments. This is consistent with our view that the commercial real estate portfolio is the primary driver of the asset quality performance.Slide 25 provides an overview of the asset quality trends, particularly in relation to our reserve levels. We have discussed the reduction in non-accruing loans and the basis for the increase in the charge-off ratio in the fourth quarter. The 90 plus days past due in accruing line represents a continued focus on asset portfolio management and non-accrual treatment decisions. Steve's provided an overview with a change in reserve levels for the quarter and the bottom half of this slide provides you with some historical context for the resulting ratios. Since we view the entire allowance for credit losses as available to cover loan losses, I will focus on the ACL ratios in my discussion.The 4.16% of outstandings and 80% coverage of non-accruing loans are in line with where we believe the industry will be as of the fourth quarter. The 96% coverage of adjusted non-accruing loans excludes the Franklin exposure. We have established to set of allowance for credit loss benchmarks to provide a basis of assessing the adequacy of the reserve. And it was within this framework that we determine the level of increase appropriate for the portfolio.In conjunction with our asset quality trends, the general economic conditions and a forward-looking view of the commercial real estate market, we use these benchmarks in determining the $450 million increase to the reserve. That with the $200 million increase in the judgmental component, including an enhancement to the economic reserve portion. There was also an incremental $200 million allocated primarily to the commercial real estate portfolio, addressing the severity of commercial real estate loss given default percentages and a longer-term view of the loss emergence time period. Lastly, approximately $50 million was a function of our normal annual process of adjusting the reserve factors on our consumer portfolios, allocated specifically to the residential and home equity portfolio of segments.We continue to be pleased with the steady reduction in the 30-day accruing delinquency ratio for the total commercial loan portfolio, as shown on Slide 26. This is a result of the focus and attention of our relationship managers and the enhanced portfolio management process we put into place over the course of the past 12 months. As expected, we had no accruing loans over 90 days past due.On Slide 27, our early-stage consumer delinquency trends are also positive, led by the significant reduction in the residential portfolio. This decrease represents a core decline as the portfolio of sale and timing of loss recognition adjustments in the third quarter did not impact this segment. The 90-plus days past due results were up slightly for the residential portfolio. It should be noted that the residential presentation excludes the government-guaranteed and Franklin-related loans. The auto and home equity portfolio has performed much as expected.The next four slides provide additional disclosure around our commercial real estate portfolio, specifically the reconciliation of the balance reductions and the introduction of the core versus non-core concept. You will be able to find the product type, the maturity schedules from the prior quarter on Slide 82 through 84 in the appendix.Slide 28 shows the material decrease in the level of commercial real estate outstandings since the year-ago quarter. While the net reduction of $2.4 billion is significant, an analysis of the specific component is important. We originated only $255 million of new commercial real estate credit, but did have over $1 billion of takedowns on existing projects. The remaining non-funded commitments associated with commercial real estate projects is not material. The $1.7 billion of payments is a very significant number and is a function of our commitment to reduce the commercial real estate concentration via portfolio of management activity, such rightsizing loans with our borrowers. The increased expertise in our commercial workout area and the ramp-up in payments over the course of the past two quarters reflect this commitment.As we have previously indicated, this past year we embarked on an exercise to properly classify our loans. In the first quarter, we made an initial series of changes, primarily centered on moving owner-occupied loans from commercial real estate to C&I based on the cash flow underwriting of the credits. We made similar adjustments in the fourth quarter, primarily associated with loans to healthcare entities and colleges and universities. We believe that loans underwritten based on cash flow from operations should be considered as commercial loans secured by real estate and not housed in the commercial real estate portfolio, which is a real estate project-oriented portfolio.The final portion of the reduction was associated with the charge-off activity. Slide 29 provides a summary of the credit quality metrics for the commercial real estate portfolio, including the breakout of the Single-Family Homebuilder and Retail project portfolio segments. Including the impact of the fourth quarter reserve build, we have taken a 31% grossed up credit mark on the remaining $857 million a single-family home builder portfolio. As I indicated earlier, we do not expect any material credit issues from the Homebuilder segment going forward. The retail portfolio has a 20% credit mark, which we also believe is an appropriate mark given our current assessment of the projects within the portfolio. The overall increase in the reserve level to 9.94% of loans represents a proactive assessment of the portfolio and the market dynamics likely to exist in the coming quarters.Slide 30 provides the basis for distinguishing between the core and non-core portions of our commercial real estate portfolio. The key to the core designation is the meaningful relationship, Midwest footprint projects and adequate returns on capital. This segregation gives our investors increased transparency as it allows us to provide ongoing performance metrics.Slide 31 provides the breakdown of the commercial real estate portfolio as of the end of the quarter with the September balances and credit metrics provided to facilitate comparisons. You can see the breakdown between the designations with core comprising 53% of the total. These borrowers we intend to support, grow and develop. While the core portfolio as of December is very clean, we have maintained a 4% reserve given the economic environment and commercial real estate market conditions. For the non-core portfolio, we have established very substantial reserves and calculated the credit mark. This 27% ratio indicates the aggregate credit mark incorporating both prior charge-offs and existing reserves associated with the loans in the portfolio. It does not include any full balance charge-offs or charge-offs taken on loans that have been paid off. The 27% mark includes a 40% factor on loans managed within the Special Assets division. We believe that this level of credit action puts us in a strong position of flexibility to continue to deal proactively with future credit issues. Let me turn the presentation back to Steve for wrap up."

First, we still do not believe there'll be any significant economic turnaround this year. We do see signs of stabilization and a key assumption for our current outlook comment is that the economy stabilizes at near the current level throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect net charge-offs and provision expense part will be meaningfully below 2009 levels. For us, 2009 is the peak year, our allowance for credit losses is expected to decline on an absolute basis from its year-end level, reflecting the utilization of existing reserves for elevated inherent losses. We expect our net interest margin will improve from the 3.19% level in the fourth quarter. We anticipate strong growth in core deposits as we grow our retail and business customer bases, as well as increase cross-sell performance to existing customers. Loan growth is expected to be flat to up slightly. From one hand, we expect increases in C&I and certain consumer segments as customer confidence improves. However, commercial real estate loans are expected to continue to decline. Fee income will continue to be flat and slightly down, however, we expect growth in asset management, as well as brokerage and insurance revenues offset in part by declines in NSF overdraft fees. Expenses are expected to increase, reflecting the investment of growth and implementation of key strategic initiatives. We believe these set of expectations will return us to quarterly profitable performance sometime during the year.Let me use the next slide to provide some perspective. On Slide 33, we showed that quarterly improvement in pre-tax, pre-provision performance. It also shows we're targeting the continued improvement $275 million in the third quarter. And this is an aggressive target, for sure, but one we feel is achievable, it will be dependent primarily on our ability to increase net interest income, control our expense growth by offsetting the cost of investments with improved efficiencies. The growth in net interest income is expected to reflect a combination of factors, including loan and investment securities growth. Continued growth in lower cost core deposits and the resulting improved funding mix and a higher net interest margin reflecting improved loan and deposit spreads.Let me use the next two slides to review key messages that I hope that come to our comments today. Throughout 2009, we reviewed all assets on the balance sheet. We specifically commented frequently about the in-depth review of our loan portfolios, as well as the strengthening of our credit management and review processes begun last January. These reviews are completed.Second, our loan loss reserves are strong and we're better positioned to continue to address the resolutions of problem credits. The rate of increase in criticized and classified loans, as well as the inflow into NPAs is slowing. Net charge-offs and provision expense reached their high watermark in 2009. The core and non-core segmentation of our commercial real estate portfolio provides greater transparency and facilitate its further reduction. This will result in an improved loan mix over time. We've made significant progress in addressing key commercial loan portfolio concerns, especially Franklin and the Single-Family Homebuilder segment of our commercial real estate portfolio. Our C&I and consumer loan portfolios continued to perform within expectations given the state of the economy. We continue to believe our consumer loan portfolio performance will outperform many of our peers on a relative basis. But I think its also important to remember that we're not yet out of this economic cycle. Negative credit migration is expected to continue though at a slower rate than we saw in 2009. On Slide 35 and continuing, our liquidity position has been built to very strong level, the strongest in many years. Our funding mix is much stronger and balance given the increase in core deposit. We're growing household and business relationships. Our capital is sufficient to weather a stressed economic scenario. We have no current plan to raise new capital. We're better positioned to eventually repay the $1.4 billion TARP capital.We're continuing to make progress in growing pre-tax, pre-provision earnings and our goal of $275 million by the third quarter is aggressive but we believe it's achievable. We're continuing to stress that our management team and the depth of expertise at all levels. We've shifted to offense as reflected in our new hirings and the implementation of our strategic plan. And we'll continue to make investments targeted to grow key fee businesses. We enjoyed one of the better fee income to revenue ratios amongst our regional peer banks. Lastly, when we put it all together, we believe we'll return a quarterly profitability during 2010.They said at the beginning, 2009 was a very difficult year. We're all excited about the possibilities for 2010. We still have credit challenges but we're much better prepared to deal with them today than a year ago. And I think those challenges, going forward, will be much more manageable. We're getting stronger every day at Huntington. So thank you for your interest. Operator, we'll now take questions. Courtney back to you."

I think that we're trying to position the balance sheet in such a way that right now, so that we're investing the proceeds from our deposit growth and fairly short dated or variable rate security, so that as rate do start to tick up, we're better positioned to be able to leverage that increasing rate. We got a thing that we do have available at some point in time. We are going to start to see that the loan side of the balance sheet start to pick up again. We saw a little bit of that of with the indirect auto, our pipeline's very strong on the commercial and the C&I book. And so we think that will also provide incremental lift compared to what we're seeing now, as far as a 230 type of investment yield on new asset purchases there."

This presentation contains both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, where we believe it is helpful to understanding Huntington’s results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found on the slide presentation, in as appendix, in the press release, in the quarterly financial review supplement to today’s earnings press release or in the related 8-K filed today, all of which are on our website.
Turning to slide five, today’s discussion including the Q&A period may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements.
For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide and material information filed with the SEC including our most recent Forms 10-K and 8-K filings. 
Now, turning to today’s presentation. As noted on slide six, participating today are Steve Steinour, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Don Kimble, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Tim Barber, Senior Vice President of Credit Risk Management. Also present for the Q&A session is Dan Neumeyer, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer.

278614,99877365,56887,"Huntington Bancshares Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Jay. Welcome everyone.

Welcome everyone. I will begin with review of our first quarter performance highlights, Don will follow with the detailed overview of our financial performance, Tim will provide an update on credit, and then I will return with some 2010 outlook comments what I hope you and other investors take away from today’s presentation.
Let me begin the presentation turning to slide eight. We entered 2010 as a stronger company with underlying momentum and said we expected to return to profitability sometime in 2010. I am very pleased to report that sometime is now.
We reported net income of $39.7 million or $0.01 a share this morning. This is a very significant step forward and represents a reset of expectations for the year. But we now expect to report a profit for the full year 2010.
The results included a $38.2 million net tax benefit that Don will detail for you. As you think about the performance for the rest of the year, it's important to note that we continue to report very good improvement in pre-tax, pre-provision income. This was up 4% for the quarter and 16% annualized from the fourth quarter level and represented the fifth consecutive quarterly improvement. This is 12% higher than a year ago.
We believe this positive performance momentum will increasingly differentiate us from number of our peers over coming quarters. Primary driver was a 5% linked quarter increase in net interest income as our net interest margin expanded to 3.47% from 3.19% in the fourth quarter.
As we mentioned last quarter, the growth in investment securities in the fourth quarter was in short duration securities about 2.4-year duration. During the quarter, we modestly repositioned our interest rate risk position for more asset sensitivity for 2011. Don will provide details.
We now believe our net interest margin for the rest of the year will remain around a 3.5% level. Average loans declined slightly as decreases in total commercial loans were partially offset by growth in average total consumer loans.
Non-interest income was down due primarily to seasonal factors, though we saw good revenue growth in some key activities. The increases in expenses reflected a combination of seasonal factors, but also investments as well.
Credit quality trends continue to improve as expected across the board, NPAs declined 7%. Importantly, new NPAs for the quarter declined 52% and charge-offs declined for the quarter 46%, and we saw early stage delinquencies or commercial loans down 13% and consumer loans down 4%.
Turning to slide nine, while there are some signs of increasing economic stability in some of our markets, the economy remains challenging, and as such we thought it is important to maintain our reserve level essentially unchanged from where they were at the end of last year.
Our provision for credit loss is $235 million, essentially matching the $238 million in net charge-offs. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of period loans and leases was 4.14%, this was down 2 bps from the prior quarter.
Relative to non-accrual loans, our reserve coverage ratio increased to 87% from 80%.
Our capital position is strong. Our tangible capital equity ratio improved 4 basis points to 5.96 during the last quarter. And in contrast our regulatory Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital ratios declined slightly due to an increase in the disallowed deferred tax assets. Nevertheless the ratios are still strong and are $2.5 billion and $1.8 billion respectively above well-capitalized regulatory thresholds.
Lastly, our liquidity position remained strong. We [fell] 5% annualized core deposit growth, and the period loan-to-deposit ratio was 92%. Period-end cash and investment securities were in excess of $10 billion.
As shown on slide 10, in addition to some well deserved recognition of the hard work and success of our colleagues in delivering high quality and value-added services in the area of automobile, finance and treasury management customers, we also continued to move forward with the implementation of strategic initiatives designed to grow revenue.
These included during the quarter, initiating 7-day banking in our Cleveland market, the first bank to do so; the addition of the team of seasoned commercial bankers in Michigan; the announcement of a 3-year $4 billion commitment to small business lending; the opening of two new Huntington Investment Company offices in central Ohio; and the hiring of nationally recognized mutual fund wholesaler to open up the distribution of our Huntington Funds through third-party channels.
Each of these initiatives is specifically targeted to grow revenues. We are very excited about the opportunities these represent. With that in mind, let me now turn the presentation over to Don for financial performance details. Don?

As noted on slide 11, our net income for the first quarter was $39.7 million or $0.01 per share. One significant item impacted the quarter's results. We recognized the $38.2 million or $0.05 per share net benefit from an increase in the deferred tax asset related to loans acquired from Franklin in 2009. This benefit was partially offset by the charge related to certain provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.
Slide 12 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trend. The performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation. So, let’s move on.
On slide 13, we provide an overview of our pre-tax, pre-provision income performance. We believe this metric is useful in assessing underlying operating performance. We calculate this metric by starting out with pre-tax earnings and then excluding three items, provision for credit losses, security gains and losses and amortization of intangibles. We also adjusted certain significant items where applicable.
On this basis, our pre-tax, pre-provision income for the first quarter was $252 million, up $10 million or 4% from last quarter and 12% higher than a year ago. This improvement clearly reflected the management actions taken over the last year and we continue to look for additional opportunities to improve our operating results.
The most significant contributor to the improvement was our increased net interest income. This improvement will be detailed on the next slide.
Slide 14 depicts the trends of our net interest income and margin. During the first quarter, our fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $19.6 million reflecting a 28 basis point increase in our net interest margin of 3.47% and a $0.6 billion decrease to our average earning asset.
The margin change reflected several favorable impacts; first, with the favorable impact of our asset/liability management strategies. This impact primarily reflected two components.
First, in the third and fourth quarter of 2009, certain interest rate swaps were identified as ineffective. During the 2010 first quarter, we terminated most of these swaps and rebooked similar new swaps, resulting a positive impact on net interest income.
Second, we also entered into new swaps during the quarter to reduce our current asset sensitivity. The new swaps entered during the quarter were short in duration, an average of 1.7 years. While we are maintaining a very neutral interest rate position throughout all of 2010, we are positioned to become more asset-sensitive beginning in 2011. We have approximately $6 billion of interest rate swaps maturing in 2011.
Second, we also continue to see our margin benefit and a shift in our deposit mix as well as continued loan and deposit pricing efforts.
It is interesting to see that our margins have improved 50 basis points from a year ago. This improvement has occurred despite a shift in our overall asset mix, from loans to security, significantly improved liquidity position, maintaining a neutral interest rate risk position and a continued high level of non-performing assets.
Continuing on the slide 15, we show the linked-quarter loan and lease trends. Total commercial loans were down $1 billion or 5%. The decline reflected the anticipated decline in commercial real estate balances from pay-downs and charge-offs.
The $0.03 billion decline in C&I loans reflected the impact of a reclass of certain variable rate demand notes from commercial loans in prior periods to municipal securities. This reclass accounted for the entire decline in this linked-quarter balance.
Total consumer loans were up by $0.9 billion or 6% from the prior quarter. The $0.9 billion increase in average automobile loans and leases, primarily reflected the $0.8 billion impact of adopting new accounting standards to consolidate the previous off balance sheet automobile loan securitization transaction. These balances are recorded at fair value.
Also, during the quarter, our other loan originations remained strong.
Turning to slide 16, we continue to generate strong core deposit growth. Total core deposits grew at an annualized 5% rate despite a $0.9 billion decline in core time deposits.
We continue to be pleased with the shift in the mix of our deposit base to more transaction account. As noted earlier, this continued to drive the improvement in our net interest margin.
Slide 17 shows the trends in our non-interest income category. Our non-interest income declined $3.7 million from the prior quarter. Deposit service charges were down reflecting both normal seasonal trends and the continued change in consumer behavior to reduce the underlying NSF/OD activity.
Other income declined by $5.4 million as much as the prior quarter's benefit from derivatives ineffectiveness was recorded in other non-interest income. Our brokerage and insurance revenues were up $3.6 million, reflecting the impact of seasonally higher contingent insurance income and a stronger sales volume.
The next slide is a summary of our expense trends. Total expenses were up $75.5 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to the fourth quarter $73.6 million gain on the debt redemption.
Personnel costs were up $3 million reflecting the seasonal impact of higher employment taxes and high debt increases related to our strategic initiatives. We are encouraged to see the $7 million decline in the OREO foreclosure expense.
Slide 19 is a summary of our capital trend. The current quarter's profit resulted in a slight increase to our TCE ratio from 5.92% to 5.96%. In contrast, regulatory capital ratio has declined slightly, reflecting a disallowance of a greater portion of our deferred tax assets.
At March 31, we had $557 million of deferred tax assets, out of which only $167 million qualified for inclusion in the regulatory capital.
Regulations require that we deduct from Q1 capital any deferred tax amount that we cannot demonstrate the ability to recover within the next twelve months period. This adjustment for regulatory capital calculation has no impact on our assessment of the realized ability for deferred tax assets.
Based on the level of our forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment in our deferred tax asset as of March 31, 2010. We remain very comfortable with our current capital level, even if we were to experience a more stressed economic environment. We do not have any current plans to issue additional capital. Let me turn the presentation over to Tim Barber to review credit trends. Tim?

We continued to see declines in C&I book as line utilization remains low and businesses continue to limit capital expenditures. As commercial real estate balances continue to decline as a result of our overall strategy to reduce the level of commercial real estate exposure. The bulk of the decrease occurred in the non-core portfolio based on both charge offs and payoffs. We were pleased with the performance of the core portfolio in the quarter as the asset quality metrics held steady.
In the consumer portfolio, the only material change is the inclusion of the auto loan securitization in the balance as of March 31. These securitized loans were originated consistent with our high quality focus and will not have an impact on the ongoing credit quality performance.
I would like to start the asset quality performance discussion with a couple of slides that provide a quantitative basis for our belief that our credit risk issues peaked in 2009. Slide, 21 is new to our disclosure and provides additional clarity on the underlying asset quality trends in the commercial portfolio.
We have detailed the growth in criticized loan levels over the course of 2009 in prior discussions but we have now added a slide to provide the specific trends that have driven the changes over time. The 7% decline evident in the first quarter was the direct result of the significant reduction in new criticized loans.
From a credit risk management perspective the reduced inflow is more predictive of future trends than an increase in resolutions the upgrades and pay downs. The trends are also directly connected to the non-accruing loan trends that we will discuss on a later slide. In summary, the decreased flow of loans into the criticized category is a qualitative indicator that there has been a change in the asset quality trends in the portfolio.
Slide 22 demonstrates the improved credit quality associated with the consumer portfolios. Declining trends are evident across all of our portfolios in both the 30 day and 90 day past due category. The decline in the 30 day bucket has been steady since the second quarter of 2009 indicating that it's not simply seasonality or other time issue. All of the sub-segments reflect the same trends albeit at to different degrees.
The 90 day past due loans are compromised primarily of real estate secured loans that have been written down to a realizable value, and only half of the 90 plus day past due loans are GNMA loans with full government guarantees. On the overall, downward trend is not as significant as the 30 day trend. We did not use the 90 plus category as a predictor of losses due to the write-down policies we have in place. All our markets continued to be impacted by the economic conditions, the declining delinquency rates represent tangible evidence that there are signs of improvement in our portfolios.
Turning to slide 23. The commercial net charge-off on the left side of the slide shows a generally declining trend since the fourth quarter of 2008 with two notable exceptions. The outsized 2008 fourth quarter charge-offs included $128 million associated with Franklin Credit relationship. The fourth quarter of 2009 included a number of significant size relationships as discussed last quarter. The 2010 first quarter was consistent with our expectations based on our asset portfolio management throughout 2009.
The graph on the right side of the slide shows consumer loan charge-off trend. The generally upward trend reflects our proactive loss recognition policies, including aggressive actions on bankrupt borrowers.
The third quarter of 2009 included a non-performing residential loan sale as well as $32 million associated with the policy change to accelerate loss recognition. We were pleased that total consumer net charge-offs in the quarter were essentially flat with the prior quarter, combined with the declining delinquency rates noted earlier, we are confident the portfolio will perform within our expectations in the coming quarters.
Turning to slide 24, I will walk everyone through the non-performing loan and non-performing asset trends. As shown on the graph on the left, non-performing assets declined 12% in the fourth quarter and we are pleased with the additional 7% decline in the first quarter. Our non-accruing loan ratio has fallen to 4.78%, or approximately the same level as the second quarter of 2009 before the expensive portfolio reassessment last year.
The graph on the right shows the trend in new non-accrual loans. First, on absolute basis the bars, and then also as a percent of beginning period loans, the lines. You can see the significant influence to nonaccrual loans during the third quarter of last year was less than the impact of our portfolio reviews.
This was followed by a 45% decrease in new nonaccrual loans in the fourth quarter and a further 52% decline in the 2010 first quarter, or two consecutive significant quarterly declines. The inflow of $237.9 million in the quarter represents accumulative 73% decline from the peak end of $900 million in the 2009 third quarter.
As you can see on slide 25, we also continue to have success in generating payments and returning loans to accrual status. The Special Assets division has now been fully staffed for nearly a year and we are seeing the benefits of their work. While there will continue to be migration into non-accrual status, we are confident that the migration patterns will no longer generate the upside inflow seen in 2009.
Turning to slide 26, I want to update you on our loan loss reserve position. After the significant bill in 2009 fourth quarter provision essentially equal net charge-offs in the first quarter. As a result, our period-end allowance represented 4.14% of period-end loan and leases narrowing slightly from 4.16%. However, we saw a meaningful improvement in our nonaccrual coverage ratio, which increased 87% of nonaccrual loans, up about 80% at the end of last year.
We believe this level is prudent given the continued challenges in the economic environment despite some of the positive asset quality metrics just discussed. We remain committed to maintaining appropriate reserves and coverage ratios.
Let me turn the presentation back to Steve to wrap up.

Let me share with you expectations for 2010, our purpose with comment about the economy as we said at the outset, we didn’t expect to see a significant economic turnaround in 2010. While we see some signs of stabilization and a key assumption is that that stabilization stays intact, or in fact gets little better throughout the course of the year. Certainly, don't expect double dip in the context of this outlook.
So, having said that, the charge-offs of provision expenses are expected to show improvement further from the first quarter levels. Our allowance for credit loss is expected to decline on an absolute basis for the March 31 level. We are flattening the utilization of existing reserves for inherent losses in the portfolio.
Loans are expected to be flat to up slightly from first quarter levels. On one hand, we expect increases in C&I and certain consumer segment. As customer confidence improves to be offset however by commercial real estate loan requires as we continue to reduce that exposure.
We expect that then we'll remain relatively stable around 3.5%, but we anticipate continued growth of core deposits to grow our retail business customer base as well as increase cross-sell performance through existing customers.
Fee income is expected to grow slightly from the first quarter level, while we expect growth in asset management as well as brokerage and insurance revenues that growth will partially offset by declines coming from Reg E changes in NSF/OD.
Expenses are expected to increase slightly from the first quarter level, reflecting continued investments and growth and investments in key areas under the strategic initiatives. We believe the set of expectations will result in our reporting the operating profit for the full year.
Slide 28 shows quarterly improvement pre-tax, pre-provision performance. We expect again to continue to improve it to get to the $275 million target in the third quarter. The achievement will largely depend on our ability to continue to drive net interest income as well as continued performance in those two other categories.
Growth in net interest income is a factor as we expect the sheet will remain relatively stable, but the mix will continue to improve, particularly on the deposit side in the near-term. Slightly higher loan and investment securities balances will resolve, but continued growth in lower cost core deposits.
Slide 29, in terms of key messages. First, the balance sheet is strong. Loans and investment securities, deposits, other funding, we like where we are with the balance sheet at this point. We have sufficient capital, as you heard earlier.
No plans to raise additional capital. The credit performance continues to improve, reserves are strong, and problem assets are declining, net charge-offs and provision expected to further decline.
We see increased opportunities in growing revenue and we are playing an expansion or growth game in the institution now. We are making investments to grow key businesses.
We are getting stronger everyday. We do expect to hit that $275 million free cash flow provision level in the third quarter by driving revenue and we do expect to report a profit for the full year. So for us, that execution now, and we are getting stronger everyday and focused towards driving results everyday.
So with that, let me thank for your interest in Huntington. The operator, will you open the lines for questions, please?

Our balance sheet migrates asset sensitivity on it's own without any additional adjustments.

As I noted in my comments that we expect to have a $6 billion of swap mature throughout 2011, and that will give us plenty of opportunity to take the balance sheet to be more asset-sensitive at that point in time. There is a slight margin pick up that comes from being more liable sensitive in a steep yield curve, but the new swap we have on the books, they are yielding anywhere from 70 basis points to about 140 basis points and as I said, under a two-year duration.
So there isn't a significant earnings play there. It's more trying to keep neutrality throughout this year and position the balance sheet, so as rate do increase in 2011, and that we can base it from that in the future.

That wouldn't necessarily if that’s where the margin was going to improving in one year what your guys did? I certainly understand everything is going on the deposit side, but maybe if you can just give a little more color on the improvement and then conversely just given the opportunity it looks like it's still there on the CD side, why wouldn’t there be some more expansion beyond what we've seen already.

There were a couple of factors that help drive it for us this year that if you look at the deposit mix change about half of that 50 basis points is really coming from that mix change that we saw throughout the year.
I tribute most of the rest of that margin improvement coming from both, deposits and loan pricing that we're seeing much wider spreads on loan originations than we were, say, 18 months ago and our deposit rates for new time deposits and other products have come down as well, so that's helping us to drive the margin, so I’d say those are both contributing factors.

It's a couple of things. One is that the first quarter does benefit from the day count, so that is about four basis point lift from the margin from there compared to future quarters.
I'd say that the other constraint factor is that this quarter our average earning assets were down slightly. We expect our deposit growth to continue outpace our loan growth throughout this year. As that adds to earning assets, we don’t get the same incremental 3.5% spread on the investment securities compared to the deposit accounts, and so we think that it can be return to the overall margin even though will be added to net interest income.

Welcome, everyone. I'll begin with a review of our first quarter performance highlights. Don will follow with the detailed overview of our financial performance.

Don will follow with the detailed overview of our financial performance. Tim will provide an update on credit, and then I'll return with some 2010 outlook comments. So I hope you and other investors take away from today's presentation.
Let me begin the presentation. Turning to Slide 8. We entered 2010 as a stronger company with underlying momentum and said we expect it to return to profitability some time in 2010. I am very pleased to report that some time is now.  We reported net income of $39.7 million or $0.01 a share this morning. This is a very significant step forward. It represents a reset of expectations for the year for we now expect to report a profit for the full year 2010.  The results included a $38.2 million net tax benefit that Don will detail for you. 
As you think about performance for the rest of the year, it's important to note that we continue to report very good improvement in pretax, pre-provisioned income. This was up 4% for the quarter and 16% annualized from the fourth quarter level and represented the fifth consecutive quarterly improvement. This is 12% higher than a year ago.
We believe this positive performance momentum will increasingly differentiate us from a number of our peers over coming quarters. The primary driver was a 5% linked quarter increase in net interest income as our net interest margin expanded to 3.47% from 3.19% in the fourth quarter.
And as we've mentioned last quarter, the growth in investment securities in the fourth quarter was in short duration securities, about 2.4-year duration. During the quarter, we modestly repositioned our interest rate risk position for more asset sensitivity for 2011. Don will provide details.
We now believe our net interest margin for the rest of the year will remain around a 3.5% level. Average loans declined slightly as decreases in total commercial loans were partially offset by growth in average total consumer loans. Non-interest income was down to primarily to seasonal factors, though we saw good revenue growth in some key activities. The increase in expenses reflected a combination of seasonal factors, but also investments in growth. 
Credit quality trends continue to improve as expected across the board. NPAs declined 7%. Importantly, new NPAs for the quarter declined 52% and charge-offs declined for the quarter 46%, and we saw early stage delinquencies or commercial loans down 13% and consumer loans down 4%.
Turning to Slide 9. While there are some signs of increasing economic stability in some of our markets, the economy remains challenging. And as such, we thought it important to maintain our reserve levels essentially unchanged from where they were at the end of last year. 
Our provision for credit loss is to $235 million, essentially matching the $238 million in net charge-offs. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of period loans and leases was 4.14%. This was down two bps from the prior quarter.
Relative to non-accrual loans, our reserve coverage ratio increased to 87% from 80%. Our capital position is strong. Our tangible capital equity ratio improved four basis points to 5.96 during the last quarter. And in contrast, our regulatory Tier 1 total risk-based capital ratios decline slightly due to an increase in the disallowed deferred tax assets. Nevertheless, the ratios are still strong at $2.5 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, above well-capitalized regulatory thresholds. 
Lastly, our liquidity position remains strong. We felt 5% annualized core deposit growth from the period-end loan-to-deposit ratio of 92%. Period-end cash and investment securities were in excess of $10 billion.
As shown on Slide 10, in addition to some well-deserved recognition of the hard work and success of our colleagues in delivering high quality and value-added services in the area of automobile, finance and treasury management customers, we also continue to move forward with the implementation of strategic initiatives designed for our revenue.  These included, during the quarter: Initiating seven-day banking in our Cleveland market, the first bank to do so; the addition of team of seasoned commercial bankers in Michigan; the announcement of a three-year $4 billion commitment to small business lending; the opening of two new Huntington investment company offices in Central Ohio; and the hiring of a nationally-recognized mutual fund wholesaler to open up the distribution of our Huntington funds through third-party channels.
Each of these initiatives is specifically targeted to grow revenues. We're very excited about the opportunities these represent. With that in mind, let me now turn the presentation over to Don for financial performance details. Don?"

As noted on Slide 11, our net income for the first quarter was $39.7 million or $0.01 per share. One significant item impacted the quarter's results. We recognized that $38.2 million or $0.05 per share net benefit from an increase in the deferred tax asset related to one of the suppliers [ph] from Franklin in 2009.  This benefit was partially offset by the charge related to certain provisions of the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.
Slide 12 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trends. Many of the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation, so let's move on.
On Slide 13, we provided an overview of our pretax, pre-provisioned income performance. We believe this metric is useful in assessing underlying operating performance. We calculate this metric like setting up with pretax earnings and that excluding three items: provision for credit losses, security gains losses and amortization of intangibles. We also adjust for certain significant items where applicable.
On this basis, our pretax, pre-provisioned income for the first quarter was $252 million, up $10 million or 4% from last quarter and 12% higher than a year ago. This improvement clearly reflected some management actions taken over last year, and we continue to look for additional opportunities to improve our operating results.
The most significant contributor to the improvement was our increased net interest income. This improvement will be detailed in the next slide. 
Slide 14 depicts the trends of our net interest income and margin. During the first quarter, our fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $19.6 million, reflecting a 28 basis point increase in our net interest margin to 3.47% and a $0.6 billion decrease to our average earning asset.
The margin change reflected several favorable impacts. First, with the favorable impact of our asset liability management strategies. This impact primarily reflected two components:  
First, in the third and fourth quarter of 2009, certain interest rate swaps were identified as ineffective. During the 2010 first quarter, we terminated most of these swaps and rebooked similar new swaps, resulting in a positive impact on net interest income.
Second, we also entered into new swaps during the quarter to reduce our current asset sensitivity. The new swaps entered into during the quarter were short in duration, an average of 1.7 years. While we're retaining at a very neutral interest rate position throughout all of 2010, we are positioned to become more asset sensitive beginning in 2011.  We have approximately $6 billion of interest rate swaps maturing in 2011.
Second [Third], we also continue to see our margin benefit and a shift in our deposit mix, as well as continued loan and deposit pricing efforts. It is interesting to see that our margins have improved 50 basis points from a year ago. This improvement has occurred despite a shift in our overall asset mix from loans security, significantly improved liquidity position, maintaining a neutral interest rate risk position and a continued high level of non-performing assets.
Continuing on to Slide 15, we showed the linked quarter loan and lease trends. Total commercial loans were down $1 billion or 5%. The decline reflected the anticipated decline in commercial real estate balances from paydowns and charge-offs.  The $0.3 billion decline in C&I loans reflected the impact of a reclass of certain variable rate demand notes from commercial loans in prior period to municipal securities. These reclass accounted for the entire decline in this linked quarter balance.
Total consumer loans were up by $0.9 billion and 6% from the prior quarter. The $0.9 billion increase in average automobile loans and leases primarily reflected the $0.8 billion impact of adopting new accounting standard to consolidate the previously off balance sheet automobile loan securitization transaction. These balances are recorded at fair value.  Also during the quarter, our other loan originations remained strong.
Turning to Slide 16. We continue to generate strong core deposit growth. Total core deposits grew at an annualized 5% rate, despite a $0.9 billion decline in core time deposits. We continue to be pleased with the shift in the mix of our deposit base to more transaction accounts. As noted earlier, this continued to drive the improvement in our net interest margin.
Slide 17 shows the trends in our non-interest income category. Our non-interest income declined $3.7 million from the prior quarter. Deposit service charges were down, reflecting both normal seasonal trends and the continued change in consumer behavior to reduce the underlying NSF/OD activity.
Other income declined by $5.4 million, as much as the prior quarter's benefit from derivative ineffectiveness was recorded in other non-interest income.  Our brokerage and insurance revenues were up $3.6 million, reflecting the impact of seasonally higher contingent insurance and stronger sales levels.
The next slide is a summary of our expense trends. Total expenses were up $75.5 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to the fourth quarter $73.6 million gain on the debt redemption. 
Personnel costs were up $3 million, reflecting the seasonal impact of higher employment taxes and headcount increases related to our strategic initiatives. We're encouraged to see the $7 million decline in OREO foreclosure expense.
Slide 19 is a summary of our capital trends. The current quarter's profit resulted in a slight increase to our TCE ratio from 5.92% to 5.96%. In contrast, regulatory capital ratio has declined slightly, reflecting the disallowance of a greater portion of our deferred tax assets.
At March 31, we had $557 million of deferred tax assets. Of which, only $167 million qualified for inclusion in regulatory capital. Regulations require that we deduct from Tier 1 capital any deferred tax amount that we cannot demonstrate the ability to recover within the next 12-month period. This adjustment for regulatory capital calculation has no impact on our assessment of the realized abilities for our deferred tax assets.
Based on the level of our forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment in our deferred tax asset as of March 31, 2010. We remain very comfortable with our current capital level even if we were to experience a more stressed economic environment. We do not have any current plans to issue additional capital. 
Let me turn the presentation over to Tim Barber to review our credit trends. Tim?"

Slide 20 provides an update on our credit portfolio composition. We continue to see declines in the C&I book, client utilization remains low, and businesses continue to limit capital expenditures, as commercial real estate balances continue to decline as a result of our overall strategy to reduce the level of commercial real estate exposure.
The bulk of the decrease occurred in the non-core portfolio based on both charge-offs and payoffs. We were pleased with the performance of the core portfolio in the quarter as the asset quality metrics held steady.
In the consumer portfolio, the only material change is the inclusion of the auto loan securitization in the balances as of March 31. These securitized loans were originated consistent with our high quality focus and will not have an impact on the ongoing credit quality performance.
I'd like to start the asset quality performance discussion with a couple of slides that provide a quantitative basis for our belief that our credit risk issues peaked in 2009. 
Slide 21 is new to our disclosure and provides additional clarity on the underlying asset quality trends in the commercial portfolio.  We have detailed the growth and criticized loan levels over the course of 2009 in prior discussions, but we have now added a slide to provide the specific trends that have driven the changes over time. 
The 7% decline evident in the first quarter was the direct result of the significant reduction in new criticized loans.  From a credit risk management perspective, the reduced inflow is more predictive of future trends that an increase in resolutions, via upgrades and paydowns. The trends are also directly connected to the non-accruing loan trends we will discuss on a later slide.  In summary, the decrease flow of loans into the criticized category is a quantitative indicator that there has been a change in the asset quality trends in the portfolio.
Slide 22 demonstrates the improved credit quality associated with the consumer portfolio. Declining trends are evident across all of our portfolios in both the 30- and 90-day past due categories. The decline in the 30-day bucket has been steady since the second quarter of 2009, indicating that it's not simply a seasonality or other timing issue. All of the subsegments reflect the same trends, albeit to different degrees. 
The 90-day past due loans are comprised primarily of real estate secured loans that have been written down to a realizable value. Nearly half of the 90-plus-day past due loans are G&A may loans with full government guarantees.  While the overall, downward trend is not as significant as the 30-day trend, we do not use the 90-plus category as a predictor of losses due to the write-down policies we have in place.  While our markets continue to be impacted by the economic conditions, the decline in delinquency rates represents tangible evidence that there are signs of improvement in our portfolios. 
Turning to Slide 23. The commercial net charge-offs on the left side of the slide show a generally declining trend since the fourth quarter of 2008 with two notable exceptions. The outsized 2008 fourth quarter charge-offs included $120 million associated with Franklin Credit relationship. The fourth quarter of 2009 included a number of significant-sized relationships as discussed last quarter. The 2010 first quarter results were consistent with our expectations based on our asset portfolio management throughout 2009.
The graph on the right side of this slide shows consumer loan charge-off trends. The generally upward trend reflects our proactive loss recognition policies, including aggressive actions on bankrupt borrowers. The third quarter of 2009 included a non-performing residential loan sale, as well as $32 million associated with the policy change to accelerate loss recognition. 
We were pleased that total consumer net charge-offs in the quarter were essentially flat with the prior quarter. Combined with the declining delinquency rates noted earlier, we are confident the portfolio will perform within our expectations in the coming quarters.
Turning to Slide 24, I'll walk everyone through the non-performing loan and non-performing asset trends. As shown on the graph on the left, non-performing assets declined 12% in the fourth quarter, and we are pleased with the additional 7% decline in the first quarter. Our non-accruing loan ratio has fallen to 4.78% or approximately the same level as the second quarter of 2009 before the extensive portfolio reassessment last year.
The graph on the right shows the trend in new non-accrual loans. First, on an absolute basis, the bar, and then also as percent of beginning period loans, the line. You can see the significant influence to non-accrual loans through the third deal last year was less than the impact of our portfolio reviews. This was followed by a 45% decrease in new non-accrual loans in the fourth quarter and a further 52% decline in the 2010 first quarter or two consecutive significant quarterly declines.
The inflow of $237.9 million in the quarter represents a cumulative 73% decline from the peak inflow flow of $900 million in the 2009 third quarter.
As you can see on Slide 25, we also continue to have success in generating payments and returning loans to accrual status. The special assets division has now been fully staffed for nearly a year, and we are seeing the benefits of their work. While there will continue to be in migration into non-accrual status, we are confident that the migration patterns will not longer generate the outside inflow seen in 2009.
Turning to Slide 26. I want to update you on our loan loss reserve position. After the significant build in the 2009 fourth quarter, provision essentially equal net charge-offs in the first quarter. As a result, our period-end allowance represented 4.14% of period-end loans and leases, down only slightly from 4.16%. However, we saw a meaningful improvement in our non-accrual coverage late ratio, which increased to 87% of non-accrual loans, up from 80% at the end of last year.
We believe this level is prudent given the continued challenges in the economic environment despite some of the positive asset quality metrics just discussed. We remain committed to maintaining appropriate reserves and coverage ratios.
Let me turn the presentation back to Steve for wrap up."

As we said at the outset, we didn't expect to see significant economic turnaround in 2010. And while we see some signs of stabilization, a key assumptions is that that stabilization stays intact or, in fact, gets a little better throughout the course of the year. Certainly, don't expect to double dip in the context of this outlook.
So having said that, the net charge-offs of provision expenses are expected to show improvement further from the first quarter levels. Our allowance for credit losses are expected to decline on an absolute basis for the March 31 level, reflecting the utilization of existing reserves for inherent losses in the portfolio. 
Loans are expected to be flat to up slightly from first quarter levels. On one hand, we expect increases in C&I consumer segment as customer confidence improves to be offset, however, by Commercial Real Estate loan declines as we continue to reduce that exposure.
We expect that the NIM will remain relatively stable around 3.5%. But we anticipate continued growth in core deposits as grow our retail business customer bases, as well as increased costs sell performance through existing customers. 
Fee income is expected to grow slightly from the first quarter level, while we expect growth in asset management, as well as brokerage and insurance revenues that growth will be partially offset by declines coming from regulatory [ph] changes and in NSF/OD.
Expenses are expected to increase slightly from the first quarter level, reflecting continued investments and growth in investments in key areas under the strategic initiatives.  We believe these set of expectations will result in our reporting the operating profit for the full year.
Slide 28 shows quarterly improvement pretax pre-provision performance. We expect, again, to continue to improve it to get the $275 million target in the third quarter. The achievement will largely depend on our ability to continue to drive net interest income, as well as continued performance in those two other categories.
Growth in net interest income is a factor as we expect the sheet will remain relatively stable, but the mix will continue to improve, particularly on the deposit side in the near team. Slightly higher loan and investment security balances will result, but continued growth in lower cost core deposits.
Slide 29. In terms of key messages, first, the balance sheet is strong. Loans, investments, securities, deposits, other funding, we like where we are with the balance sheet at this point. We have sufficient capital, as you heard earlier. No plans to raise additional capital. The credit performance continues to improve. The reserves are strong, and problem assets are declining net charge-offs and provision expected to further decline.
We see increased opportunities in growing revenue, and we're playing an expansion or growth gain in the institution now. We're making investments to grow key businesses. We're getting stronger everyday. We do expect to hit that $275 million pretax pre-provision level in the third quarter by driving revenue. And we will expect, and we do expect to report a profit for the full year.
So for us is about execution now, and we are getting stronger everyday and focused on driving results everyday. So with that, let me thank you for your interest in Huntington. Operator, will you open the lines for questions, please?"

Our balance sheet migrates asset sensitivity on its own, without any additional adjustments. Our position here is that we don't think, that interest rates will increase significantly throughout 2010. And so we want to keep a fairly neutral position throughout the current calendar year. As I noted in my comments, that we expect to have a $6 billion of swap mature throughout 2011, and that will give us plenty of opportunity to take the balance sheet to be more asset sensitive at that point in time. There is a slight margin pick up that comes from being more liability-sensitive in a steep yield curve that the new swap we have on the books are yielding anywhere from 70 basis points to about 140 basis point, and as I said, under a two-year duration. So there isn't a significant earnings play there.

And then if you look at sort of the issues around what you need to do to pay off of TARP, and I'm respectful of how you described it, for us Steve. I'm not looking to pin you down, but just the thought process. You have to be profitable, you guys are there.

If you would add that to our Tier 1 common equivalent, it's another 70 basis points. So those two combined, would put us over 8% on a core basis, adjusting to those two items.

This presentation contains both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, and where we believe it’s helpful to understanding Huntington’s results of operations or financial position.
Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the slide presentation, in its appendix, in the press release, in the quarterly financial review supplement to today’s earnings press release, or in the related Form 8-K filed later today, all of these can be found on our Web site.
Turning to slide five, today’s discussion including the Q&A period may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on information and assumptions available at this time, and are subject to changes, risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We assume no obligation to update such statements. For a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties, please refer to this slide, and material filed with the SEC, including our most recent forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K.
Now, turning to today’s presentation. As noted on slide six, participating today are Steve Steinour, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Don Kimble, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Tim Barber, Senior Vice President of Credit Risk Management.
Also present, and by way of introduction is, Todd Beekman. He recently joined us as Assistant Director of Investor Relations. He was formerly with Fidelity Management and Research in Boston, where he was an Analyst, including several years as a Regional Bank Analyst. Many of you, I know, know Todd. We look forward to his contribution to our IR effort.

I’ll begin with the review of the second quarter performance highlights. After my overview, Don will detail how Franklin impacted our numbers and then follow with his usual overview of our financial performance. Tim will provide an update on credit. I will then return with the discussion of the impact of recent regulatory changes and 2010 outlook comments.
While we will provide the detail in a moment, I want to point out a couple of key achievements. Overall, we are very pleased with the second quarter performance. We reported higher profits than last quarter. We saw a 3% linked-quarter growth in revenue, even after excluding a $14.2 million increase in MSR valuations. Our capital ratios meaningfully improved during the quarter.
As expected we saw significant declines in nonperforming assets inflows, as inflows of new NPAs and criticized assets continued to fall. Our period-end nonaccruing loan reserve coverage ratio jumped to 120% from 87%. So in sum, another meaningful step forward, moving Huntington to stronger financial performance.
At the end of the quarter we transferred all of our Franklin loans to -for-sale, and subsequent to quarter-end, we sold $274 million of this exposure, which had a significant impact on second quarter performance as it resulted in a $75.5 million charge-off and also $75.5 million of provision expense, a negative $0.07 per share.
There was another $4.5 million in net charge-offs in provision expenses associated with Franklin in the second quarter prior to the transfer into held-for-sale. Don will detail all of this for you later in his presentation. It is important to understand that this transfer into held-for-sale and subsequent sale was a very positive development.
Let’s begin a more detailed presentation. Turning to slide eight, we reported net income of $48.8 million or $0.03 per share. This was a significant achievement. The drivers were substantially improved credit quality and higher pre-tax pre-provision income. We believe these trends will continue.
Our pre-tax pre-provision income was $270.5 million, a 7% improvement from the first quarter and an 18% improvement from a year earlier. This represented our sixth consecutive quarter improvement. The primary driver was a 5% linked-quarter increase in revenue, reflecting 2% growth in fully taxable equivalent net interest income and a 12% increase in non-interest income. This was partially offset by a 4% linked-quarter increase in non-interest expense.
The growth in fully taxable equivalent net interest income reflected modest growth in average total loans. We saw very strong growth in average automobile loans, and leases up 9% as we continue to take advantage of competitive dislocations and benefited from strategic initiatives to expand our in franchise footprint.
Average residential mortgages grew 3%. Partially offsetting these increases were a 4% decline in average commercial real estate loans as we continued to reduce net exposure.
Our average commercial and industrial loans declined slightly. Period end C&I loans were up 1% from the end of March or 3% on the accruing portfolio. Utilization rates remained historically low and relatively unchanged.
So this reflects a combination of several factors, including few opportunities for companies to expand given the weak economy, companies continuing to build strong cash positions, and a general lack of confidence that is postponing investment decisions.
Average total investment securities increased 3% as we continued to deploy funds from a strong growth in core deposits. Our net interest margin was 3.46%, down a basis point of which 6 basis points related to Franklin loans.
Non-interest income increased 12% driven mostly by a $14.2 million increase in MSR valuations, primarily reflecting lower prepayment assumptions, though we also benefited from a 34% increase in mortgage originations, which contributed a $6.2 million increase in origination and secondary market income. Non-interest income also benefited from an increase in seasonal service charges on deposit accounts.
The increase in expenses reflected our continued investment in growth. The real highlight for the quarter was continued significant improvement in credit quality. This improvement reflects clearly the benefit of last year’s focused actions to address credit related problems.
We anticipate continued improvement over the second half of this year. On a linked-quarter basis, nonperforming assets declined 17% and we saw a 28% decrease in new non-performing assets.
We also saw an 8% decline in newly identified criticized commercial loans. While reported net charge-offs increased from the prior quarter, excluding Franklin-related charge-offs, they were down 12%, after also adjusting the prior period Franklin-related net charge-offs.
Our provision for credit losses was $193.4 million or $117.9 million excluding the $75.5 million related to Franklin. Both 30 and 90-day delinquencies continued to decline.
Turning to slide nine, our period-end allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan and leases declined to 3.9%. Importantly and reflecting substantial improvement in credit quality trends, our nonaccrual loan coverage ratio jumped to 120% from 87%. Our capital position is solid with increases in all of our capital ratios.
Our regulatory Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios are $2.8 billion and $2 billion above well capitalized regulatory thresholds. Tangible common equity ratio improved 16 bps to 6.12% and our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio improved 51 bps to 7.04%.
Lastly, our liquidity position remained strong. We saw 6% annualized core deposit growth, with a period-end loan-to-deposit ratio of 93%.
As shown on slide #10, we continue move forward with the implementation of strategic initiatives designed to grow future revenue. These included the hiring and appointment of new key executives in revenue generating businesses. In our commercial banking segment this included a new Director of Commercial Banking, in Central Ohio, and new Regional President in the Greater Cleveland area, and a new President of our Equipment Finance Group. In our Private Financial Group this included a new President of Unified Fund Services, a new Chief Operating Officer for Huntington Insurance, and hiring a new team of trust and private bankers in Dayton, Ohio.
We also made progress in expanding and upgrading our distribution capabilities. In our retail and business banking segment, we have begun the rebranding and refurbishing of banking offices, and initiated in-store and retirement centre expansion. Within PFG we opened a new office in Wheeling, West Virginia and a family office in Columbus devoted to assisting high net worth families with managing and preserving generational wealth.
In support of our initiative to improve cross-sell performance we launched the first phase of our sales force referral automation system called MAX. We have kicked off a strategic plan refresh looking out over the next three years.
Each of these initiatives is specifically targeted to grow revenues. The appendix on slide is showing all the other initiatives since the first quarter of 2009. We are very excited about the cumulative impact and the opportunities these initiatives represent.
Turning to slide #11, it’s important to understand Franklin’s impact on the quarter as well as our rationale for this action. Earlier at the end of the quarter we transferred all our Franklin-related loans to held-for-sale resulting in $75.5 million net charge-off.
One contributing factor to higher bank stock valuation is the demonstrated ability to consistently deliver credit quality performance that is better than peers. That’s our objective and what we want to be known for.
As related to Franklin, since our restructuring in early 2009, this portfolio has performed as expected and we were prepared to hold these loans through maturity. However, a negative side effect to retain these loans has been poorer relative credit quality performance metrics. The confluence of second quarter events gave us the opportunity to essentially bring this relationship to a close by moving these loans in the held-for-sale.
As the quarter progressed, we saw renewed buyer interest in distressed debt. That was also positive.
In contrast, we saw an economic outlook turn more uncertain. Further, the expiration of the tax credits for home purchases and indications that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac might accelerate home foreclosures and sales of OREOs raised concern that residential real estate prices could be under pressure over time, which would lower the value of the collateral supporting these loans.
So late in the quarter, we made a decision to move these loans to held-for-sale, which resulted in the $75.5 million of charge-offs, which was disappointing on one hand. However, I am pleased to report that on July 20, we sold $274 million of the Franklin-related residential mortgages.
Importantly, given today’s much stronger balance sheet and earnings performance, we were able to absorb the related charge-offs and still report growth in earnings and higher capital ratios.
This sale adds to overall future financial performance as we reinvest the proceeds and no longer have to absorb related portfolio servicing and other support costs. It more quickly moves us toward obtaining our objective of better than peer credit quality performance metrics.
Let me turn the presentation over to Don to review the details.

The second column on slide #12 details the impact of the transfer of the Franklin-related loans to held-for-sale. Third column shows other Franklin-related net charge-offs, that is those that occurred during the quarter prior to the transfer to held-for-sale. The last column shows the impact from excluding these Franklin-related items.
Focusing on the second column, as of June 30, $398 million of Franklin-related loans were charged down to $323 million and transferred to held-for-sale. This resulted in $75.5 million of charge-offs and related provision expense.
$14.7 million of the charge-offs were related to Franklin-related home equity loans and $60.8 million of Franklin-related residential mortgages, and adding in the other $4.5 million of Franklin-related net charge-offs, total Franklin net charge-offs in the quarter were $80 million. Net charge-offs as reported and as adjusted to exclude Franklin-related net charge-offs are shown on this slide.
For additional detail and a reconciliation of the impact that Franklin issues on the current as well as prior quarters for all credit-related metrics, please refer to the Franklin reconciliation slides in the appendix.
As Steve noted earlier, the sale of the residential real estate loans was closed on Tuesday, which reduced our NPAs by $225 million. This will reduce our NPA ratio from 4.24% to 3.65%.
Turning to slide #13, our net income for the second quarter was $48.8 million or $0.03 per share. The impact of our transfer of the Franklin loans to held-for-sale is a one significant item impacting the quarter’s results. As discussed earlier, we recognized a $75.5 million or $0.07 per share provision expense related to the transfer. This impact is net of estimated selling cost.
Slide #14 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trends. Many of the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation, so let’s move on.
On Slide #15, we provide an overview of our pre-tax pre-provision income performance. We continue to believe this metric is useful in assessing the underlying operating performance.
We calculate this metric by starting with pre-tax earnings, and then excluding three items; provision for credit losses, security gains and losses, and amortization of intangibles. We also adjust for certain significant items where applicable.
On this basis, our pre-tax pre-provision income for the second quarter was $270 million, up $18 million or 7% from last quarter and 18% higher than a year ago.
Slide #16 depicts the trends of our net interest income and margins. During the second quarter, our fully tax equivalent net interest income increased by $6 million, reflecting a 1 basis point decline in our net interest margin of 3.46% and a $0.3 billion increased to our average earning asset base.
The margin change reflected several items. First was the impact of the deposit mix and pricing changes. The mix shift from time deposits to more transaction based core deposits not only reduces our cost, but also produces a more stable deposit base for us as well.
Offsetting this positive impact was a $6.8 million of 6 basis points reduction in the margin coming from the Franklin-related loans. During the first quarter we received more payments on loans that had been already reduced to a zero balance resulting in additional interest income. These payments slowed significantly in the second quarter.
Other items impacting the quarter included lower interest income on our interest derivatives and in part due to changes in the interest rate environment. Also the day count negatively impacted the second quarter margin.
Going forward we expect some of the same trends, with the Franklin-related sale having a slight reduction to the margin, but a positive impact to the bottom line after considering the servicing cost previously incurred.
Continuing on to slide #17, it shows the changed in our deposits mix over the last five quarters. This shift from 45% of the deposits in time and noncore funds of 29% has improved the margin by 22 basis points.
This mix will also have some impact on the third quarter from the expiration of the TAGP program. We saw $100 million move from transaction accounts to other products including sweep accounts and short-term liabilities.
We also saw approximately $600 million reduction to our deposits as a result of requirements for FDIC coverage. Overall, this performance was in line to better than our expectations. We also have one quarter left with higher price to time deposits running off.
Turning to Slide #18, we continue to generate strong core deposit growth. Total core deposits grew at an annualized 6% rate despite a $0.8 billion decline in average noncore deposits.
Slide #19 shows the trends on loan and lease portfolio. This was the first quarter in the last six that we have actually shown loan growth. Total commercial loans were down $0.4 billion or 2%.
The decline reflected the anticipated decline in commercial real estate balances. The $0.1 billion decline in C&I loans reflected the continued de-leveraging from our commercial customers. However, we did experience a $147 million increase period-end balance from March 31 to June 30.
Total consumer loans were up $0.5 billion or 3% from the prior quarter. The $0.4 billion increase in average automobile loans and leases reflected record originations of over $900 million this past quarter. These originations continue to reflect very high credit quality and reasonable returns.
Slide #20 shows the trends in our non-interest income categories. Our non-interest income increased by $28.8 million from the prior quarter. Our mortgage banking revenues increased by $20.5 million, reflecting a $14 million increase to the net MSR hedging income. This increase reflected a reduction to the underlying prepayment assumption for FCMC MSR asset. These prepayment assumptions were accelerated throughout 2009 with the expectations that the government programs would increase the refinance activity.
We continued to use a third party to assist in valuing the MSR asset and in other to help validate the value assigned. Deposits service charges were up $6.6 million and electronic banking revenues were up $3 million, both reflecting normal seasonal trend.
The next slide is a summary of our expense trends. Total expenses were up $15.7 million from the prior quarter. This reflected an $11.2 million or 6% increases in personnel cost. This increase was due to a 4% increase in staffing levels attributed to strategic initiatives implemented over the last two quarters, the full quarter impact of merit increases awarded late in the first quarter and the reinstatement of the company’s 401(k) plan matching contribution.
Marketing costs were up $6.5 million attributed to brand advertising campaign launched in the second quarter. Other expenses were up $2.8 million, including a $5.4 million increase in cost related to reps and warranties on mortgage loan sales. $4 million of this increase was attributed to an increase to the reserve for this liability as we are using a more forward-looking estimate reflecting the increased cost of the current quarter. Offsetting these increases were declines in OREO with foreclosure expenses as well as seasonal claims and occupancy costs.
Slide #22, is a summary of our capital trends. The current quarter’s profit resulted in an increase to our tangible common equity ratio from 5.96% to 6.12%, but reflecting even stronger improvement were the regulatory capital ratios.
Our Tier 1 common ratio increased to 7.04% from 6.53% and our Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.47% from 11.97%. These increases not only benefited from the capital accretive earnings, but also from a decrease in the total disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes from $390 million at March 31 to $191 million at June 30, as a result of recognition of the tax impact of the Franklin-related charge-offs. The deferred tax asset realization for regulatory capital purposes improved the ratios by approximately 47 basis points.
Turning to Slide #23, one cannot talk about capital without some mention of our plans to repay our $1.4 billion in TARP capital. We believe that we’re better positioned for repayment today. We have strong balance sheet liquidity and our current regulatory capital is over $2 billion in excess of the existing well-capitalized thresholds.
With another quarter of profitable performance and expectations of continued profitability, we’re back to generating capital internally. However, and as noted last quarter, we believe there are three factors for consideration before repayment.
The first is consistent demonstrated profitable performance with growth in earnings. We believe we’re on our way to get (inaudible) quarters in a row. The second is evidence of a sustained economic recovery. This outlook turned a little more negative this past quarter and while we think the economy is stabilizing, it remains fragile.
Third, having better clarity on any new regulatory capital thresholds would be helpful. While the recently passed Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act gave the authority to set these standards, it will be some time before the specific regulations are written. We think our current ratios are above where these new thresholds may eventually be set, but that’s not a certainty.
Based on other banks that have had to raise capital at the time they repaid their TARP, it is likely that we will have to raise capital as well. While we believe we are better positioned today than last quarter, we want to continue to be cognizant of our existing shareholders’ interest as well. We have been under no pressure to repay TARP from anyone. So in some, we intend to repay our TARP capital as soon as it’s prudent to do so.
Let me turn the presentation back over to Tim, for a review of credit trends. Tim?

As you have heard, we continue to make substantial progress across all of our credit metrics. While the Franklin transaction impact was significant and now allows us to report credit metrics on a comparable basis with our peers, the improvement from our ongoing operations is equally important and also sustainable.
The reduction in nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans in the second quarter, excluding Franklin was consistent with first quarter results. We expect to see a continuation of the trend in the coming quarters and I will review some of the specifics on the upcoming slide.
Our criticized loan levels also continued to decline with improvement noted across all of our business segments. The net charge-off ratio associated with our ongoing operations showed solid improvement and we continue to actively manage our late-stage delinquency rate down over time. Importantly, both the charge-off and delinquency trends are evident across all of our portfolio segments.
Our allowance for credit losses ratio declined from 4.14% to 3.9%, but the coverage ratios for both nonaccruing loans and nonperforming assets improved. The coverage ratio associated with criticized assets also improved from the prior quarter. The criticized assets measurement includes commercial criticized loans, consumer over 60-day pass due loans and OREO.
We use this measurement internally and it provides an additional level of granularity and transparency, and our allowance for credit losses coverage, and only looking at the nonaccrual coverage ratios. We continue to feel very comfortable with our reserve level in the context of our portfolio and the market environment.
From an overall portfolio standpoint we continue to see planned reductions in our commercial real estate portfolio, and the C&I portfolio that held steady for the quarter. Within the commercial real estate portfolio, we saw very positive performance from our core portfolio.
The core portfolio remained constant in terms of both portfolio level and asset quality metrics. We had no material change in the core portfolio over the past six months. While we have moved some balances from noncore to core based on our ability to expand the relationships, but loans originally defined as core remain.
The home equity and residential mortgage portfolios remained relatively unchanged in the quarter, but we had a very strong quarter in the auto finance business. As you know, we feel very comfortable with the high-quality focus of this business and the credit quality characteristics, including an average FICO score of 770, end returns on the quarterly production were very strong.
Slide #25 provides a graphical presentation of the nonaccrual loan and nonperforming asset trends on the left side of the slide and the nonaccrual loan inflow on the right side. As we have discussed over the past couple of quarters, the substantial decline in nonaccrual loan inflow is perhaps the most important measurement when assessing the future trends in the portfolio.
Turning to Slide #26, we can review the entire nonperforming asset flow analysis. Of the total decline in nonperforming assets, less than half was related to the Franklin transaction. The drivers of the reduction were charge-offs and loan payments. Importantly, the rate of decline in nonperforming assets accelerated this quarter due to the lower inflow of new NPAs.
Slide #27 continues our disclosure around the level of criticized commercial loans. We saw lower level of inflow during the quarter and just as importantly, we saw a substantially higher level of upgrades into our past categories. We have a very focused upgrade process indicating that these borrowers have established a level of profitability and capital position meriting the change.
As with the nonperforming asset trends we are confident that the declining trend is sustainable in future periods. In summary, the decrease flow of loans into the criticized category is a quantitative indicator that there has been a positive sustainable change in the asset quality trends in the portfolio.
Slide #28 demonstrates the improved credit quality associated with the consumer portfolios. Declining trends are evident across all of our portfolios in both the 30-plus and 90-plus days past due categories. The decline in the over 30-day past due loans has been steady since the second quarter of 2009, indicating that is not simply seasonality or a timing issue. All of the sub-segments reflect the same trend, although to different degrees.
The 90-day past due loans are comprised, primarily of real estate secured loans that have been written down to a realizable value. While the trend is positive, both the level of delinquencies and losses in the consumer portfolio secured by real estate remain at higher than acceptable levels. We continue to originate home equity and residential mortgages in our footprint with the focus on a total financial services relationship.
Origination levels and quality metrics are included in the slide deck appendix. The auto finance portfolio continued to show positive trends even on a lagged analysis basis. We have substantial detail in the appendix to the slide deck regarding the ongoing positive performance trends in the auto portfolio.
While our markets continue to be impacted by the adverse economic conditions, the declining delinquency rate shown here represents some tangible evidence of improvement.
Turning to Slide #29, the commercial net charge-offs on the left side of the slide show a generally declining trend since the second quarter of 2009, with the exception of the outsized fourth quarter that included a number of individual significant size relationships as previously discussed.
Also, of note, recoveries in our C&I portfolio for the second quarter were 50% higher than in the first quarter. While it is too early to call this a trend, we fully expect to recognize increased recoveries in the coming quarters.
The second quarter results were consistent with our expectations based on our active portfolio management strategies. Given the trends in nonaccrual and criticized loans discussed earlier, we are confident our improvement is sustainable.
The graph on the right side of the slide shows consumer loan charge-off trends. As you recall, the third quarter of 2009 included a nonperforming residential loan sale as well as the $32 million loss associated with the policy change to accelerate the timing of loss recognition. In subsequent quarters, we have maintained our proactive loss recognition policies, including aggressive actions on bankrupt borrowers.
We’re pleased that the total consumer net charge-off ratio in the 2010 first quarter was down slightly and the second quarter results reflected an additional decline, excluding the impact of the Franklin transaction. Combined with the declining delinquency rates noted earlier, we are confident our consumer portfolio will continue to perform within our expectations in the coming quarters.
Turning to Slide #30, I’d like to reemphasis the level of our allowance for credit losses and resulting coverage ratios. In the second quarter and excluding the impact from the Franklin transaction, net charge-offs exceeded provision expense by $86 million.
This resulted in allowance for credit loss level of $1.4 billion and a resulting ratio to total loans of 3.9%. Despite the decline, as shown on the right side of the slide, our coverage of nonaccrual loans increased from 87% to 120%. However, we believe we’ll compare favorably to our peers.
The level is prudent given the continued challenges in the economic environment combined with some of the positive asset quality trends just discussed. We remain committed to maintaining our appropriate level of reserve for our portfolio in the economic environment.
Let me turn this presentation back to Steve.

278614,108852374,68624,"Huntington Bancshares Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","So five more slides to recap our current thinking regarding the impact of recent regulatory changes on slide #31, which reflects where we expect to see the impacts.The Federal Reserve recently amended Reg E to prohibit charging overdrafts for ATM or one",1080,"So five more slides to recap our current thinking regarding the impact of recent regulatory changes on slide #31, which reflects where we expect to see the impacts.
The Federal Reserve recently amended Reg E to prohibit charging overdrafts for ATM or one-time debit card transaction unless the customer opts in. Our overdraft charges or NSF/OD for sure is a major source of fee income for us and for other banks, for Huntington fee is right about $90 million a year.
Our basic strategy is to mitigate the potential impact by reaching out to customers and alerting them that we can no longer offer such overdrafts unless they opt into our overdraft service.
To-date, our results are surpassing our expectations, and according to a recent survey our opting percentages are higher than most of our peers. At this point over 20% of all customers have opted in, and for those customers that avail themselves to this service the most, the opting rate is nearly 50%. While we know some customers will not opt in at first, over time we believe some will realize that they’ve not kept a valuable service and well then opt in.
With the recently passed Dodd-Frank Act, while it’s complex as it relates to how this legislation and subsequent rulemaking will impact our company, at this time we believe there are two meaningful areas which we’ve highlighted; interchange fees and the eventual inability to include trust preferred capitals component of regulatory capital.
Now, our annual interchange fee is right about $90 million per year. Most of our fee is what is referred to as signature-based; that is, customer signs an authorization to check out spend, much like a credit card.
The act gives the Federal Reserve and no longer the banks or system owners the ability to set the interchange rate, which we charge margins for the use of debit cards. And what the ultimate impact would be cannot be estimated at this time.
We’ll have to wait for the Federal Reserve action or may take many months, proposals, debate and then rulemaking. I only wanted to mention today the annual revenue at risk. We believe a fraction and may be a small fraction related revenue will eventually be impacted.
With regard to trust preferred securities (inaudible) $570 million outstanding and if disallowed would reduce the regulatory Tier 1 capital by about 1.34%. There is a three-year phase-in beginning January 1, 2013, so there is plenty of time to strategize our capital structure around this new legislation. We do not believe this is a significant issue for Huntington.
Slide #32 shows various return on asset outcomes given a range of net charge-off assumptions and a pre-tax pre-provision income level equal to this quarters’ $270 million, about which is where we are today.
We take the $270 million, subtract the intangible amortization expense of $15 million, as it’s excluded from our pretax pre-provision income calculation, we then provide a range of analyzed net charge-offs from 35 bps to 55 bps, and while we are not yet ready to specify a normalized targeted net charge-off ratio range or what that should be, this range is within certain 10-year and 3-year historical ranges.
We have not considered 2007 for this purpose, as it included a large Franklin charge, which will not recur. We use these net charge-off assumptions as a proxy for the loss provision expense. Subtracting this, this produces a pre-tax income range to which we apply a 30% income tax rate to develop a range of net incomes and calculate the ROI off of that. So we believe we’ve got 110 to 120 ROA of the 270 pre-tax pre-provision.
Turning to Slide #33, let me outline our financial performance expectations for the second half of the year. With regard to the economy and interest rates we see no meaningful change. We’re not expecting a double dip, but we do believe it doesn’t take longer for the economy to recover than we did just 90 days ago.
We anticipate second half pre-tax pre-provision income levels will be in line with second quarter reported performance. NIM is expected to approximate debt of the first half of the year. We expect modest growth in C&I and continued strong growth in automobile loans.
CRE loans will continue to decline with home equity and residential mortgages remaining relatively flat. We can see an increase in investment securities as excess cash comes from strong core deposit growth needing to be deployed.
Fee revenue in the second half is expected to be mixed with certain fee income activities getting a lift from the continued rollout of strategic initiatives offset by lower mortgage banking income, as well as service charge income due to the implementation of Reg E.
Expenses also should be relatively stable with increases due to continued implementation of strategic initiatives. Growth in expenses is expected to be mostly offset by lower loan, Franklin portfolio of servicing and monitoring expenses, as well as a general decline in credit monitoring related expenses as nonperforming assets continued to decline.
Charge-offs and provision expenses are anticipated to be generally in line with the second quarter levels, excluding any Franklin impacts. In some, this should translate into revenue and earnings improvement from the second quarter.
Slide #34, before wrapping up, I wanted to remind you of our 2010 objectives. Shown on the slide, we believe they are well understood by every colleague and that’s what we’re working towards for our execution and delivery. In today’s presentation, we specifically speak to the second half of the year.
In closing, I’d like to remind you of these 2010 objectives. They are essentially the same as they have been through the first quarter and first half. Our balance sheet is getting strong, currently the strongest in recent memory. Our capital levels are sufficient, getting stronger with each profitable quarter. We’re substantially improving underlying credit quality trends, which have now been augmented by our decision on Franklin and that’s positioning us for a credit quality performance that is better than peers.
Underlying earnings and profitability are growing. We continue to see increased opportunities and focusing a great deal of attention on growing revenue. This is supported by our making investments to grow key fee businesses. While the environment is challenging, we’re committed to continuing our move to higher levels of performance and improved execution. We’re clearly on the move.
So that’s it. Thanks for your interest. Operator, we’ll now take questions.

I'll begin with a review of the second quarter performance highlights. After my overview, Don will detail how Franklin impacted our numbers and then follow with his usual overview of our financial performance. Tim will provide an update on credit. I will then return with a discussion of the impact of recent regulatory changes and 2010 outlook comments.
While we will provide the detail in a moment, I want to point out a couple of the key achievements. Overall, we are very pleased with the second quarter performance. We reported a higher profit than last quarter. We saw a 3% linked-quarter growth in revenue, even after excluding a $14.2 million increase in MSR valuation. Our capital ratios meaningfully improved during the quarter. And as expected, we saw significant declines in nonperforming assets inflows -- as inflows of new NPAs in criticized assets continued to fall.
Our period-end nonaccruing loan reserve coverage ratio jumped to 120% from 87%. So in sum, another meaningful step forward, moving Huntington to stronger financial performance. At the end of the quarter, we transferred all of our Franklin loans to held-for-sale, and subsequent to quarter end, we sold $274 million of this exposure. This had a significant impact on second quarter performance, as it resulted in a $75.5 million charge-off and also $75.5 million of provision expense, a negative $0.07 per share. 
There was another $4.5 million in net charge-offs and provision expense associated with Franklin in the quarter, in the second quarter, prior to the transfer in the held-for-sale. Don will detail all of this for you later in this presentation. It's important to understand that this transfer into held-for-sale and subsequent sale was a very positive development. 
Let's begin a more detailed presentation. Turning to Slide 8, we reported net income of $48.8 million or $0.03 per share. This was a significant achievement. The drivers were substantially improved credit quality and higher pretax pre-provision income. We believe these trends will continue. Our pretax pre-provision income was $270.5 million, a 7% improvement from the first quarter and an 18% improvement from a year earlier.
This represented our sixth consecutive quarterly improvement. The primary driver was a 5% link-quarter increase in revenue, reflecting 2% growth in fully taxable equivalent net interest income and a 12% increase in noninterest income. This was partially offset by a 4% link-quarter increase in noninterest expense. The growth in fully taxable equivalent net interest income reflected modest growth in average total loans. We saw very strong growth in average automobile loans and leases, up 9%, as we continued to take advantage of competitive dislocations and benefited from strategic initiatives to expand our in-franchise footprint. 
Average residential mortgages grew 3%. Partially offsetting these increases were a 4% decline in average commercial real estate loans as we continued to reduce net exposure. Our average commercial and industrial loans declined slightly. Period-end C&I loans were up 1% in the end of March or 3% on the accruing portfolio.
Utilization rates remained historically low and relatively unchanged. So this reflects a combination of several factors, including: few opportunities for companies to expand, given the weak economy; companies continuing to build strong cash positions; and a general lack of confidence that is postponing investment decisions. 
Average total investment securities increased 3% as we continued to deploy funds from our strong growth in core deposits. Our net interest margin was 3.46%, down a basis point, of which six basis points related to Franklin loans. 
Noninterest income increased 12%, driven mostly by a $14.2 million increase in MSR valuations, primarily reflecting lowered prepayment assumptions, though we also benefited from a 34% increase in mortgage originations, which contributed a $6.2 million increase in origination and secondary marketing income.
Noninterest income also benefited from an increase in seasonal service charges on deposit accounts. The increase in expenses reflected our continued investment in growth. The real highlight for the quarter was continued significant improvement in credit quality. This improvement reflects clearly the benefit of last year's focused actions to address credit-related problems. We anticipate continued improvement over the second half of this year. On a link-quarter basis, nonperforming assets declined 17% and we saw a 28% decrease in new nonperforming assets.
We also saw an 8% decline in newly identified criticized commercial loans. While reported net charge-offs increased for the prior quarter, excluding Franklin-related net charge-offs that were down 12%, after also adjusting the prior-period Franklin-related net charge-offs. 
Our provision for credit losses was $193.4 million or $117.9 million, excluding the $75.5 million related to Franklin. Both 30- and 90-day delinquencies continued to decline. 
Turning to Slide 9, our period-end allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans and leases declined to 3.9%. Importantly, and reflecting substantial improvement in credit quality trends, our nonaccrual loans coverage ratio jumped to 120% from 87%.
Our capital position is solid, with increases in all of our capital ratios. Our regulatory Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios are $2.8 and $2 billion above well-capitalized regulatory thresholds. 
Tangible common equity ratio improved 16 bps to 6.12%, and our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio improved 51 bps to 7.04%. 
Lastly, our liquidity position remained strong. We saw a 6% annualized core deposit growth with a period-end loan-to-deposit ratio of 93%.
As shown on Slide 10, we continued to move forward with the implementation strategic initiatives designed to grow future revenue. These include the hiring or appointment of new key executives in revenue-generating businesses. In our Commercial Banking segment, this included a new Director of Commercial Banking in central Ohio, a new regional president in the greater Cleveland area and a new president of our Equipment Finance Group. In our Private Financial Group, this included a new president of Unified Fund Services, a new chief operating officer for Huntington Insurance and hiring a new team of trust and private bankers in Dayton, Ohio. 
We also made progress in expanding and upgrading our distribution capabilities. In our Retail and Business Banking segment, we've begun the rebranding and refurbishing of banking offices and initiated in-store and retirement center expansion.
Within PFG, we opened a new office in Wheeling, West Virginia, and a family office in Columbus devoted to assisting high net worth families with managing and preserving generational wealth. 
In support of our initiative to improve cross-sell performance, we launched the first phase of our sales force referral automation system, called MAX. And we’ve kicked off a strategic plan refresh looking out over the next three years. Each of these initiatives is specifically targeted to grow revenues. The appendix has slides showing all the other initiatives since the first quarter of 2009. We're very excited about the cumulative impact and the opportunities these initiatives represent. 
Turning to Slide 11. It’s important to understand Franklin's impact on the quarter as well our rationale for this action. As I noted earlier, at the end of the quarter, we transferred all of our Franklin-related loans to held-for-sale, resulting in a $75.5 million net charge-off. One contributing factor to higher bank stocks valuation is a demonstrated ability to consistently deliver credit quality performance that is better than peers. That's your [ph] (0:13:24) objective and what we want to be known for. 
And as related to Franklin since our restructuring in early 2009, this portfolio has performed as expected, and we were prepared to hold these loans through maturity. However, a negative side effect to retaining these loans has been poorer relative credit quality performance metrics. A confluence of second quarter events gave us the opportunity to essentially bring this relationship to a close by moving these loans into held-for-sale. As the quarter progressed, we saw a renewed buyer interest in distressed debt. And this was the positive. In contrast, we saw an economic outlook turn more uncertain. Further, the expiration of tax credit for home purchases and indications that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac might accelerate home foreclosures and sales of OREOs raised concern that residential real estate prices could be under pressure over time, which would lower the value of the collateral supporting these loans.
So later in the quarter, we made the decision to move these loans to held-for-sale. This resulted in the $75.5 million of charge-offs, which was disappointing on the one hand. However, I'm pleased to report that on July 20, we sold $274 million of the Franklin-related residential mortgages. Importantly, given today's much stronger balance sheet and earnings performance, we were able to absorb the related charge-offs but still report growth in earnings and a higher capital ratios.
This sale adds to overall future financial performance as we reinvest the proceeds and no longer have to absorb related portfolio servicing and other support costs. And it more quickly moves us to attain our objective of better-than-peer credit quality performance metrics. Let me turn the presentation over to Don to review the details."

The third column shows the other Franklin-related net charge-offs, that is, those that occurred during the quarter prior to the transfer to held-for-sale. The last column shows the impact from excluding these Franklin-related items. Focusing on the second column, as of June 30, $398 million of Franklin-related loans were charged down to $323 million and transferred to held-for-sale. This resulted in $75.5 million of charge-offs and related provision expense. $14.7 million of the charge-offs were related to Franklin-related home equity loans and $60.8 million of Franklin-related residential mortgages. When adding in the other $4.5 million of Franklin-related net charge-offs, total Franklin net charge-offs in the quarter were $80 million. Net charge-offs as reported and as adjusted to excluded Franklin-related net charge-offs are shown on this slide. For additional detail and a reconciliation of the impact of the Franklin issues on the current as well as prior quarters for all credit-related metrics, please refer to the Franklin reconciliation slide in the appendix.
As Steve noted earlier, the sale of the residential real estate loans was closed on Tuesday, which reduced our NPAs by $225 million. This would have reduced our NPA ratio from 4.24% to 3.65%. 
Turning to Slide 13, our net income for the second quarter was $48.8 million or $0.03 per share. The impact of our transfer to Franklin loans to held-for-sale is our one significant item impacting the quarter’s results. As discussed earlier, we recognized a $75.5 million or $0.07 per share provision expense related to the transfer. This impact is net of estimated selling costs. 
Slide 14 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trends. Many of the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation. Let's move on. On Slide 15, we provide an overview of our pretax pre-provision income performance. We continue to believe this metric is useful in assessing underlying operating performance. We calculated this metric by starting with pretax earnings and then excluding three items: provision for credit losses, security gains and losses and amortization of intangibles.
We also adjusted certain significant items, where applicable. On this basis, our pretax pre-provision income for the second quarter was $270 million, up $18 million or 7% from last quarter and 18% higher than a year ago. 
Slide 16 depicts the trends of our net interest income and margin. During the second quarter, our fully tax-equivalent net interest income increased by $6 million, reflecting a one basis point decline in our net interest margin of 3.46% and a $0.3 billion increase to our average earning asset base. The margin change reflected several items: First was the impact of our deposit mix and pricing changes. The mix shift from time deposits to more transaction-based core deposits not only reduces our costs but also produces a more stable deposit base for us as well. 
Offsetting this positive impact was a $6.8 million or six basis point reduction in the margin coming from the Franklin-related loans. During this first quarter, we received more payments on loans that had been already reduced to a zero balance, resulting in additional interest income. These payments flowed significantly in the second quarter. Other items impacted the quarter included lower interest income on our interest rate derivatives, in part due to the changes in the interest rate environment. Also, the day count negatively impacted the second quarter margin. 
Going forward, we expect some of the same trends with the Franklin-related sale having a slight reduction to the margins but a positive impact to the bottom line after considering the servicing cost previously incurred.
Continuing on to Slide 17, we showed a change in our deposit mix over the last five quarters. This shift, from 45% of the deposits in time and non-core funds to 29%, has improved the margin by 22 basis points. This mix will also have some impact on the third quarter from the expiration of the TAGP program. We saw $100 million dollars move from transaction accounts to other products, including sweep accounts and short-term liabilities. We also saw approximately $600 million of reductions to our deposits as a result of requirements for FDIC coverage. Overall, this performance was in line or better than our expectations. We also have one quarter left of higher-price time deposits running off. 
Turning to Slide 18, we continued to generate strong core deposit growth. Total core deposits grew at an annualized 6% rate, despite a $0.8 billion decline in average core loan deposits. 
Slide 19 shows the trends on our Loan and Lease portfolio. This was the first quarter in the last six that we've actually shown loan growth. Total commercial loans were down $0.4 billion or 2%. The decline reflected the anticipated decline in commercial real estate balances. The $0.1 billion decline in C&I loans reflected the continued deleveraging from our commercial customers. However, we did experience $147 million increase in period-end balances from March 31 to June 30. 
Total consumer loans were up $0.5 billion or 3% from the prior quarter. The $0.4 billion increase in average automobile loans and leases reflected record originations of over $900 million this past quarter. These originations continue to reflect very high credit quality and reasonable returns. 
Slide 20 shows the trends in our noninterest income categories. Our noninterest income increased by $28.8 million from the prior quarter. Our mortgage banking revenues increased by $20.5 million, reflecting a $14 million increase to the net MSR hedging income. This increase reflected a reduction to the underlying prepayment assumptions for MC MSR [ph] (0:21:12) asset. These prepayment assumptions were accelerated throughout 2009 with the expectation that the government programs would increase the refinance activity. We continue to use a third party to assist in valuing the MSR asset and another to help validate the value assigned. Deposit service charges were up $6.6 million and electronic banking revenues were up $3 million, both reflecting normal seasonal trends. 
The next slide is a summary of our expense trends. Total expenses were up $15.7 million from the prior quarter. This reflected an $11.2 million or 6% increase in personnel costs. This increase was due to a 4% increase in staffing levels, attributed to strategic initiatives implemented over the last two quarters; the full quarter impact of merit increases awarded late in the first quarter; and the reinstatement of the company's 401(k) plan matching contribution. 
Marketing costs were up $6.5 million, attributed to the brand advertising campaign launched in the second quarter. Other expenses were up $2.8 million, including a $5.4 million increase on costs related to reps and warranties on mortgage loan sales. $4 million of this increase was attributed to an increase to the reserve for this liability, as we’re using a more forward-looking estimate, reflecting the increased cost of the current quarter. Offsetting these increases were declines in OREO, with foreclosure expenses as well as seasonal clients and occupancy costs. 
Slide 22 is a summary of our capital trends. The current quarter's profit resulted in an increase to our tangible common equity ratio from 5.96% to 6.12%. But reflecting an even stronger improvement was our regulatory capital ratios. Our Tier 1 common ratio increased to 7.04% from 6.53%, and our Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.47% from 11.97%. These increases not only benefited from the capital accretive earnings but also from a decrease in the total disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes from $390 million at March 31, to $191 million at June 30, as a result of the recognition of the tax impact of the Franklin-related charge-offs. The deferred tax asset realization for regulatory capital purposes improved the ratios by approximately 47 basis points.
Turning to Slide 23, one cannot talk about capital without some mention of our plans to repay our $1.4 billion in TARP capital. We believe that we're better positioned for repayment today. We have strong balance sheet liquidity, and our current regulatory capital is over $2 billion in excess of the existing well-capitalized thresholds. And with another quarter of profitable performance and expectations of continued profitability, we are back to generating capital internally. 
However, and as noted last quarter, we believe there are three factors for consideration before repayment: The first is consistent demonstrated profitable performance with growth in earnings. We believe we're on our way. Again, it’s only two quarters in a row. The second is evidence of a sustained economic recovery. This outlook turned a little more negative this past quarter, and while we think the economy is stabilizing, it remains fragile. Third, having better clarity on any new regulatory capital thresholds would be helpful. 
While the recently passed Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act gave the authority to set these standards, it will be some time before the specific regulations are written. We think our current ratios are above where these new thresholds may eventually be set, but that's not a certainty. 
Based on other banks that have had to raise capital at the time they repaid their TARP, it is likely that we will have to raise capital as well. While we believe we're better positioned today than last quarter, we want to continue to be cognizant of our existing shareholders’ interest as well. We have been under no pressure to repay TARP from anyone. So in sum, we intend to repay our TARP capital as soon as it's prudent to do so. Let me turn the presentation back over to Tim for a review of credit trends. Tim?"

As you have heard, we continue to make substantial progress across all of our credit metrics. While the Franklin transaction impact was significant and now allows us to report credit metrics on a comparable basis with our peers, the improvement from our ongoing operations is equally important and also sustainable. The reduction in nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans in the second quarter excluding Franklin was consistent with first quarter results. We expect to see a continuation of the trend in the coming quarters, and I will review some of its specifics on an upcoming slides. 
Our criticized loan levels also continued to decline, with improvement noted across all of our business segments. And that charge-off ratio associated with our ongoing operations showed solid improvement, and we continued to actively manage our late-stage delinquency rate down over time. Importantly, both the charge-off and delinquency trends are evident across of all our portfolio segments. Our allowance for credit losses ratio declined from 4.14% to 3.9%, but the coverage ratios for both non-accruing loans and nonperforming assets improved. The coverage ratio associated with criticized assets also improved from the prior quarter. 
The criticized assets measurement includes commercial criticized loans, consumer over-60-day past-due loans and OREO. We use this measurement internally, and it provides an additional level of granularity and transparency in our allowance for credit losses coverage, and only looking at the nonaccrual coverage ratios. We continue to feel very comfortable with our reserve level in the context of our portfolio and the market environment.
From an overall portfolio standpoint, we continued to see planned reductions in our Commercial Real Estate portfolio and a C&I portfolio that held steady for the quarter. Within the Commercial Real Estate portfolio, we saw a very positive performance on our Core portfolio. The Core portfolio remained constant in terms of both portfolio level and asset quality metrics. We have seen no material change in the core portfolio over the past six months. While we have moved some balances from non-core to core, based on our ability to expand the relationships, the loans originally defined as core remain. 
The Home Equity and Residential Mortgage portfolios remained relatively unchanged in the quarter, but we had a very strong quarter in the Auto Finance business. As you know, we feel very comfortable with the high-quality focus of this business and the credit quality characteristics, including an average score FICO score of 770, and returns on the quarterly production were very strong. 
Slide 25 provides a graphic representation of the nonaccrual loan and nonperforming asset trends on the left side of the slide and the nonaccrual loan inflow on right side. As we have discussed over the past couple of quarters, the substantial decline in nonaccrual loan inflow is perhaps the most important measurement when assessing the future trends in the portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 26, we can review the entire nonperforming asset flow analysis. Of the total decline in nonperforming assets, less than half was related to the Franklin transaction. The drivers of the reduction were charge-offs and loan payments. Importantly, the rate of decline in nonperforming assets accelerated this quarter due to the lower inflow of new NPAs. Slide 27 continues our disclosure around the level of criticized commercial loans. We saw a lower level of inflow during the quarter, and just as importantly, we saw a substantially higher level of upgrades into our past categories. We have a very focused upgrade process, indicating that these borrowers have established a level of profitability and capital position meriting the change. As with the nonperforming asset trends, we are confident that the declining trend is sustainable in future periods. 
In summary, the decrease flow of loans into the criticized category is a quantitative indicator that there has been a positive sustainable change in the asset quality trends in the portfolio.
Slide 28 demonstrates the improved credit quality associated with the Consumer portfolios. Declining trends are evident across all of our portfolios in both the 30-plus and 90-plus days past due categories. The decline in the over 30-day past due loans has been steady since the second quarter of 2009, indicating that is not simply seasonality or a timing issue. All of the sub-segments reflect the same trends, although to different degrees. The 90-day past due loans are comprised primarily of real estate secured loans that have been written down to a realizable value. While the trend is positive, both the level of delinquencies and losses in the Consumer portfolio secured by real estate remain at higher-than-acceptable levels. We continue to originate home equity and residential mortgages in our footprint, with a focus on a total financial services relationship. Origination levels and quality metrics are included in the slide deck appendix. 
The Auto Finance portfolio continued to show positive trends, even on a lagged-analysis basis. We have substantial detail in the appendix to the slide deck regarding the ongoing positive performance trends in the auto portfolio. While our markets continue to be impacted by the adverse economic conditions, the declining delinquency rates shown here represent some tangible evidence of improvement. 
Turning to Slide 29, the commercial net charge-offs on the left side of the slide show a generally declining trend since the second quarter of 2009, with the exception of the outsized fourth quarter that included a number of individual significant-size relationships, as previously discussed. Also of note, recoveries in our C&I portfolio for the second quarter were 50% higher than in the first quarter. While it is too early to call this a trend, we fully expect to recognize increased recoveries in the coming quarters. 
The second quarter results were consistent with our expectations based on our active portfolio management strategies. Given the trends in nonaccrual and criticized loans discussed earlier, we are confident our improvement is sustainable. 
The graph on the right side of the slide shows consumer loan charge-off trends. As you recall, the third quarter of 2009 included a nonperforming residential loan sale as well as a $32 million loss associated with a policy change to accelerate the timing of loss recognition. In subsequent quarters, we have maintained our proactive loss recognition policies, including aggressive actions on bankrupt borrowers. We were pleased that the total consumer net charge-off ratio in the 2010 first quarter was down slightly and the second quarter results reflected an additional decline excluding the impact of the Franklin transaction.
Combined with the declining delinquency rates noted earlier, we are confident our Consumer portfolio will continue to perform within our expectations in the coming quarters. 
Turning to Slide 30, I'd like to re-emphasize the level of our allowance for credit losses and resulting coverage ratios. In the second quarter, and excluding the impact from the Franklin transaction, net charge-offs exceeded provision expense by $86 million. This resulted in an allowance for credit loss level of $1.4 billion and a resulting ratio to total loans of 3.9%. Despite the decline, as shown on the right side of the slide, our coverage of nonaccrual loans increased from 87% to 120%, a level we believe will compare favorably to our peers. This level is prudent given the continued challenges in the economic environment, combined with some of the positive asset quality trends just discussed. We remain committed to maintaining an appropriate level of reserve for our portfolio in the economic environment. Let me turn this presentation back to Steve."
278614,108852374,69131,"Huntington Bancshares Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","Just five more slides to recap our current thinking regarding the impact of recent regulatory changes.

On Slide 31, this reflects where we expect to see the impacts. The Federal Reserve recently amended Reg E to prohibit charging overdrafts for ATM or a one-time debit card transaction unless the customer opts in. Our overdraft charges, or NSF/OD for short, is a major source of fee income for us and for other banks. For Huntington, fees run about $90 million a year. 
Our basic strategy is to mitigate the potential impact by reaching out to customers and alerting them that we can no longer offer such overdrafts unless they opt in to our overdraft service. To date, our results are surpassing our expectations, and according to a recent survey, our opt-in percentages are higher than most of our peers. At this point, over 20% of our customers have opted in, and for those customers that avail themselves to this service the most, the opt-in rate is nearly 50%. While we know some customers will not opt in at first, over time, we believe some will realize that they’ve not kept a valuable service and will then opt in. 
With the recently passed Dodd-Frank Act is complex -- while it’s complex as it relates to how this legislation and subsequent rule-making will impact our company, at this time we believe there are two meaningful areas which we’ve highlighted: interchange fees and the eventual inability to include trust preferred capital as a component of regulatory capital. Now our annual interchange fees run about $90 million per year. And most of our fees are what is referred to as signature-based. That is, the customer signs an authorization at the checkout stand, much like a credit card. 
The Act gives the Federal Reserve and no the longer banks or system owners the ability to set the interchange rate which we charge merchants for the use of debit cards. And what the ultimate impact will be cannot be estimated at this time. We’ll have to wait for the Federal Reserve action and that is -- or may take many months of proposals, debate, and then rule-making. I only wanted to mention today the annual revenue at risk. We believe a fraction and maybe a small fraction of related revenue will eventually be impacted. 
With regard to Trust Preferred Securities, we’re currently at $570 million outstanding, and if disallowed, would reduce the regulatory Tier 1 capital by about 1.34%. There’s a three-year phase-in beginning January 1, 2013, so there’s plenty of time to strategize our capital structure around this new legislation. We do not believe this is a significant issue for Huntington. 
Slide 32 shows various return on asset outcomes, given a range of net charge-off assumptions and a pretax pre-provision income level equal to this quarter's $270 million, about where -- which is where we are today. We take the $270 million. Subtract the intangible amortization expense of $15 million, as it's excluded from our pretax pre-provision income calculation. We then provide a range of analyzed net charge-off from 35 bps to 55 bps, and while we're not yet ready to specify a normalized targeted net charge-off ratio range, or what that should be, this range is within certain 10- and 3-year historical ranges. We did not consider 2007 for this purpose, as it would have included a large Franklin charge, which will not recur. We use these net charge-off assumptions as a proxy for loan loss provision expense. Subtracting this produces a pretax income range, which would apply a 30% income tax rate to develop a range of net income, and calculate the ROA off of that. So we believe we've got a 110 to 120 ROA off the $270 million pretax pre-provision. 
Turning to Slide 33. Let me outline our financial performance expectations for the second half of the year. With regard to the economy and interest rates, we see no meaningful change. We're not expecting a double dip, but we do believe it’s now going to take longer for the economy to recover than we did just 90 days ago. We anticipate second half pretax pre-provision income levels will be aligned with second quarter reported performance. 
NIM is expected to approximate debt of the first half of the year. We expect modest growth in C&I and continued strong growth from automobile loans. CRE loans will continue to decline, with home-equity and residential mortgages remaining relatively flat. We can see an increase in investment securities as excess cash comes from strong core deposit growth needing to be deployed. Fee revenue in the second half is expected to be mixed with certain fee income activities given a lift from the continued rollout of strategic initiatives offset by lower mortgage banking income as well as service charge income due to implementation of Reg E. 
Expenses also should be relatively stable, with increases due to the continued implementation of strategic initiatives. Any growth in expenses is expected to be mostly offset by lower loan, Franklin portfolio servicing and monitoring expenses, as well as a general decline in credit-monitoring-related expenses as nonperforming assets continue to decline. Charge-offs and provision expenses are anticipated to be generally aligned with the second quarter levels, excluding any Franklin impacts. In sum, this should translate into revenue and earnings improvement from the second quarter. 
Slide 34. Before I wrap you up, I wanted to remind you of our 2010 objectives shown on this slide. We believe they’re well understood by every colleague, and that's what we're working towards our execution and delivery. In today's presentation, these specifically speak to the second half of the year. 
In closing, I'd like to remind you of these 2010 objectives. They're essentially the same as they have been through the first quarter and first half. Our balance sheet getting strong, currently the strongest in recent memory. Our capital levels are sufficient, getting stronger with each profitable quarter. We’re substantially improving underlying credit quality trends, which have now been augmented by our decision on Franklin, and that's positioning us for a credit quality performance that is better than peers. 
Underlying earnings and profitability are growing. We continue to see increased opportunities in focusing a great deal of attention on growing revenue. This is supported by our making investments to grow key fee businesses. While the environment is challenging, we're committed to continuing our move to higher levels of performance and improved execution. We're clearly on the move. 
So that's it. Thanks for your interest. Operator, we'll now take questions."

I'll begin with a review of the second quarter performance highlights. After my overview, Don will detail how Franklin impacted our numbers and then follow with his usual overview of our financial performance. Tim will provide an update on credit. I will then return with a discussion of the impact of recent regulatory changes and 2010 outlook comments.
While we will provide the detail in a moment, I want to point out a couple of the key achievements. Overall, we are very pleased with the second quarter performance. We reported a higher profit than last quarter. We saw a 3% linked-quarter growth in revenue, even after excluding a $14.2 million increase in MSR valuation. Our capital ratios meaningfully improved during the quarter. And as expected, we saw significant declines in nonperforming assets inflows -- as inflows of new NPAs in criticized assets continued to fall.
Our period-end nonaccruing loan reserve coverage ratio jumped to 120% from 87%. So in sum, another meaningful step forward, moving Huntington to stronger financial performance. At the end of the quarter, we transferred all of our Franklin loans to held-for-sale, and subsequent to quarter end, we sold $274 million of this exposure. This had a significant impact on second quarter performance, as it resulted in a $75.5 million charge-off and also $75.5 million of provision expense, a negative $0.07 per share. 
There was another $4.5 million in net charge-offs and provision expense associated with Franklin in the quarter, in the second quarter, prior to the transfer in the held-for-sale. Don will detail all of this for you later in this presentation. It's important to understand that this transfer into held-for-sale and subsequent sale was a very positive development. 
Let's begin a more detailed presentation. Turning to Slide 8, we reported net income of $48.8 million or $0.03 per share. This was a significant achievement. The drivers were substantially improved credit quality and higher pretax pre-provision income. We believe these trends will continue. Our pretax pre-provision income was $270.5 million, a 7% improvement from the first quarter and an 18% improvement from a year earlier.
This represented our sixth consecutive quarterly improvement. The primary driver was a 5% link-quarter increase in revenue, reflecting 2% growth in fully taxable equivalent net interest income and a 12% increase in noninterest income. This was partially offset by a 4% link-quarter increase in noninterest expense. The growth in fully taxable equivalent net interest income reflected modest growth in average total loans. We saw very strong growth in average automobile loans and leases, up 9%, as we continued to take advantage of competitive dislocations and benefited from strategic initiatives to expand our in-franchise footprint. 
Average residential mortgages grew 3%. Partially offsetting these increases were a 4% decline in average commercial real estate loans as we continued to reduce net exposure. Our average commercial and industrial loans declined slightly. Period-end C&I loans were up 1% in the end of March or 3% on the accruing portfolio.
Utilization rates remained historically low and relatively unchanged. So this reflects a combination of several factors, including: few opportunities for companies to expand, given the weak economy; companies continuing to build strong cash positions; and a general lack of confidence that is postponing investment decisions. 
Average total investment securities increased 3% as we continued to deploy funds from our strong growth in core deposits. Our net interest margin was 3.46%, down a basis point, of which six basis points related to Franklin loans. 
Noninterest income increased 12%, driven mostly by a $14.2 million increase in MSR valuations, primarily reflecting lowered prepayment assumptions, though we also benefited from a 34% increase in mortgage originations, which contributed a $6.2 million increase in origination and secondary marketing income.
Noninterest income also benefited from an increase in seasonal service charges on deposit accounts. The increase in expenses reflected our continued investment in growth. The real highlight for the quarter was continued significant improvement in credit quality. This improvement reflects clearly the benefit of last year's focused actions to address credit-related problems. We anticipate continued improvement over the second half of this year. On a link-quarter basis, nonperforming assets declined 17% and we saw a 28% decrease in new nonperforming assets.
We also saw an 8% decline in newly identified criticized commercial loans. While reported net charge-offs increased for the prior quarter, excluding Franklin-related net charge-offs that were down 12%, after also adjusting the prior-period Franklin-related net charge-offs. 
Our provision for credit losses was $193.4 million or $117.9 million, excluding the $75.5 million related to Franklin. Both 30- and 90-day delinquencies continued to decline. 
Turning to Slide 9, our period-end allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans and leases declined to 3.9%. Importantly, and reflecting substantial improvement in credit quality trends, our nonaccrual loans coverage ratio jumped to 120% from 87%.
Our capital position is solid, with increases in all of our capital ratios. Our regulatory Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios are $2.8 and $2 billion above well-capitalized regulatory thresholds. 
Tangible common equity ratio improved 16 bps to 6.12%, and our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio improved 51 bps to 7.04%. 
Lastly, our liquidity position remained strong. We saw a 6% annualized core deposit growth with a period-end loan-to-deposit ratio of 93%.
As shown on Slide 10, we continued to move forward with the implementation strategic initiatives designed to grow future revenue. These include the hiring or appointment of new key executives in revenue-generating businesses. In our Commercial Banking segment, this included a new Director of Commercial Banking in central Ohio, a new regional president in the greater Cleveland area and a new president of our Equipment Finance Group. In our Private Financial Group, this included a new president of Unified Fund Services, a new chief operating officer for Huntington Insurance and hiring a new team of trust and private bankers in Dayton, Ohio. 
We also made progress in expanding and upgrading our distribution capabilities. In our Retail and Business Banking segment, we've begun the rebranding and refurbishing of banking offices and initiated in-store and retirement center expansion.
Within PFG, we opened a new office in Wheeling, West Virginia, and a family office in Columbus devoted to assisting high net worth families with managing and preserving generational wealth. 
In support of our initiative to improve cross-sell performance, we launched the first phase of our sales force referral automation system, called MAX. And we’ve kicked off a strategic plan refresh looking out over the next three years. Each of these initiatives is specifically targeted to grow revenues. The appendix has slides showing all the other initiatives since the first quarter of 2009. We're very excited about the cumulative impact and the opportunities these initiatives represent. 
Turning to Slide 11. It’s important to understand Franklin's impact on the quarter as well our rationale for this action. As I noted earlier, at the end of the quarter, we transferred all of our Franklin-related loans to held-for-sale, resulting in a $75.5 million net charge-off. One contributing factor to higher bank stocks valuation is a demonstrated ability to consistently deliver credit quality performance that is better than peers. That's our objective and what we want to be known for. 
And as related to Franklin since our restructuring in early 2009, this portfolio has performed as expected, and we were prepared to hold these loans through maturity. However, a negative side effect to retaining these loans has been poorer relative credit quality performance metrics. A confluence of second quarter events gave us the opportunity to essentially bring this relationship to a close by moving these loans into held-for-sale. As the quarter progressed, we saw a renewed buyer interest in distressed debt. And this was the positive. In contrast, we saw an economic outlook turn more uncertain. Further, the expiration of tax credit for home purchases and indications that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac might accelerate home foreclosures and sales of OREOs raised concern that residential real estate prices could be under pressure over time, which would lower the value of the collateral supporting these loans.
So later in the quarter, we made the decision to move these loans to held-for-sale. This resulted in the $75.5 million of charge-offs, which was disappointing on the one hand. However, I'm pleased to report that on July 20, we sold $274 million of the Franklin-related residential mortgages. Importantly, given today's much stronger balance sheet and earnings performance, we were able to absorb the related charge-offs but still report growth in earnings and a higher capital ratios.
This sale adds to overall future financial performance as we reinvest the proceeds and no longer have to absorb related portfolio servicing and other support costs. And it more quickly moves us to attain our objective of better-than-peer credit quality performance metrics. Let me turn the presentation over to Don to review the details."

The third column shows the other Franklin-related net charge-offs, that is, those that occurred during the quarter prior to the transfer to held-for-sale. The last column shows the impact from excluding these Franklin-related items. Focusing on the second column, as of June 30, $398 million of Franklin-related loans were charged down to $323 million and transferred to held-for-sale. This resulted in $75.5 million of charge-offs and related provision expense. $14.7 million of the charge-offs were related to Franklin-related home equity loans and $60.8 million of Franklin-related residential mortgages. When adding in the other $4.5 million of Franklin-related net charge-offs, total Franklin net charge-offs in the quarter were $80 million. Net charge-offs as reported and as adjusted to excluded Franklin-related net charge-offs are shown on this slide. For additional detail and a reconciliation of the impact of the Franklin issues on the current as well as prior quarters for all credit-related metrics, please refer to the Franklin reconciliation slide in the appendix.
As Steve noted earlier, the sale of the residential real estate loans was closed on Tuesday, which reduced our NPAs by $225 million. This would have reduced our NPA ratio from 4.24% to 3.65%. 
Turning to Slide 13, our net income for the second quarter was $48.8 million or $0.03 per share. The impact of our transfer to Franklin loans to held-for-sale is our one significant item impacting the quarter’s results. As discussed earlier, we recognized a $75.5 million or $0.07 per share provision expense related to the transfer. This impact is net of estimated selling costs. 
Slide 14 provides a summary of our quarterly earnings trends. Many of the performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation. Let's move on. On Slide 15, we provide an overview of our pretax pre-provision income performance. We continue to believe this metric is useful in assessing underlying operating performance. We calculated this metric by starting with pretax earnings and then excluding three items: provision for credit losses, security gains and losses and amortization of intangibles.
We also adjusted certain significant items, where applicable. On this basis, our pretax pre-provision income for the second quarter was $270 million, up $18 million or 7% from last quarter and 18% higher than a year ago. 
Slide 16 depicts the trends of our net interest income and margin. During the second quarter, our fully tax-equivalent net interest income increased by $6 million, reflecting a one basis point decline in our net interest margin of 3.46% and a $0.3 billion increase to our average earning asset base. The margin change reflected several items: First was the impact of our deposit mix and pricing changes. The mix shift from time deposits to more transaction-based core deposits not only reduces our costs but also produces a more stable deposit base for us as well. 
Offsetting this positive impact was a $6.8 million or six basis point reduction in the margin coming from the Franklin-related loans. During this first quarter, we received more payments on loans that had been already reduced to a zero balance, resulting in additional interest income. These payments flowed significantly in the second quarter. Other items impacted the quarter included lower interest income on our interest rate derivatives, in part due to the changes in the interest rate environment. Also, the day count negatively impacted the second quarter margin. 
Going forward, we expect some of the same trends with the Franklin-related sale having a slight reduction to the margins but a positive impact to the bottom line after considering the servicing cost previously incurred.
Continuing on to Slide 17, we showed a change in our deposit mix over the last five quarters. This shift, from 45% of the deposits in time and non-core funds to 29%, has improved the margin by 22 basis points. This mix will also have some impact on the third quarter from the expiration of the TAGP program. We saw $100 million dollars move from transaction accounts to other products, including sweep accounts and short-term liabilities. We also saw approximately $600 million of reductions to our deposits as a result of requirements for FDIC coverage. Overall, this performance was in line or better than our expectations. We also have one quarter left of higher-price time deposits running off. 
Turning to Slide 18, we continued to generate strong core deposit growth. Total core deposits grew at an annualized 6% rate, despite a $0.8 billion decline in average core loan deposits. 
Slide 19 shows the trends on our Loan and Lease portfolio. This was the first quarter in the last six that we've actually shown loan growth. Total commercial loans were down $0.4 billion or 2%. The decline reflected the anticipated decline in commercial real estate balances. The $0.1 billion decline in C&I loans reflected the continued deleveraging from our commercial customers. However, we did experience $147 million increase in period-end balances from March 31 to June 30. 
Total consumer loans were up $0.5 billion or 3% from the prior quarter. The $0.4 billion increase in average automobile loans and leases reflected record originations of over $900 million this past quarter. These originations continue to reflect very high credit quality and reasonable returns. 
Slide 20 shows the trends in our noninterest income categories. Our noninterest income increased by $28.8 million from the prior quarter. Our mortgage banking revenues increased by $20.5 million, reflecting a $14 million increase to the net MSR hedging income. This increase reflected a reduction to the underlying prepayment assumptions for MC -- [ph]  MSR assets. These prepayment assumptions were accelerated throughout 2009 with the expectation that the government programs would increase the refinance activity. We continue to use a third party to assist in valuing the MSR asset and another to help validate the value assigned. Deposit service charges were up $6.6 million and electronic banking revenues were up $3 million, both reflecting normal seasonal trends. 
The next slide is a summary of our expense trends. Total expenses were up $15.7 million from the prior quarter. This reflected an $11.2 million or 6% increase in personnel costs. This increase was due to a 4% increase in staffing levels, attributed to strategic initiatives implemented over the last two quarters; the full quarter impact of merit increases awarded late in the first quarter; and the reinstatement of the company's 401(k) plan matching contribution. 
Marketing costs were up $6.5 million, attributed to the brand advertising campaign launched in the second quarter. Other expenses were up $2.8 million, including a $5.4 million increase on costs related to reps and warranties on mortgage loan sales. $4 million of this increase was attributed to an increase to the reserve for this liability, as we’re using a more forward-looking estimate, reflecting the increased cost of the current quarter. Offsetting these increases were declines in OREO, with foreclosure expenses as well as seasonal clients and occupancy costs. 
Slide 22 is a summary of our capital trends. The current quarter's profit resulted in an increase to our tangible common equity ratio from 5.96% to 6.12%. But reflecting an even stronger improvement was our regulatory capital ratios. Our Tier 1 common ratio increased to 7.04% from 6.53%, and our Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.47% from 11.97%. These increases not only benefited from the capital accretive earnings but also from a decrease in the total disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes from $390 million at March 31, to $191 million at June 30, as a result of the recognition of the tax impact of the Franklin-related charge-offs. The deferred tax asset realization for regulatory capital purposes improved the ratios by approximately 47 basis points.
Turning to Slide 23, one cannot talk about capital without some mention of our plans to repay our $1.4 billion in TARP capital. We believe that we're better positioned for repayment today. We have strong balance sheet liquidity, and our current regulatory capital is over $2 billion in excess of the existing well-capitalized thresholds. And with another quarter of profitable performance and expectations of continued profitability, we are back to generating capital internally. 
However, and as noted last quarter, we believe there are three factors for consideration before repayment: The first is consistent demonstrated profitable performance with growth in earnings. We believe we're on our way. Again, it’s only two quarters in a row. The second is evidence of a sustained economic recovery. This outlook turned a little more negative this past quarter, and while we think the economy is stabilizing, it remains fragile. Third, having better clarity on any new regulatory capital thresholds would be helpful. 
While the recently passed Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act gave the authority to set these standards, it will be some time before the specific regulations are written. We think our current ratios are above where these new thresholds may eventually be set, but that's not a certainty. 
Based on other banks that have had to raise capital at the time they repaid their TARP, it is likely that we will have to raise capital as well. While we believe we're better positioned today than last quarter, we want to continue to be cognizant of our existing shareholders’ interest as well. We have been under no pressure to repay TARP from anyone. So in sum, we intend to repay our TARP capital as soon as it's prudent to do so. Let me turn the presentation back over to Tim for a review of credit trends. Tim?"

As you have heard, we continue to make substantial progress across all of our credit metrics. While the Franklin transaction impact was significant and now allows us to report credit metrics on a comparable basis with our peers, the improvement from our ongoing operations is equally important and also sustainable. The reduction in nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans in the second quarter excluding Franklin was consistent with first quarter results. We expect to see a continuation of the trend in the coming quarters, and I will review some of its specifics on an upcoming slide. 
Our criticized loan levels also continued to decline, with improvement noted across all of our business segments. And that charge-off ratio associated with our ongoing operations showed solid improvement, and we continued to actively manage our late-stage delinquency rate down over time. Importantly, both the charge-off and delinquency trends are evident across of all our portfolio segments. Our allowance for credit losses ratio declined from 4.14% to 3.9%, but the coverage ratios for both non-accruing loans and nonperforming assets improved. The coverage ratio associated with criticized assets also improved from the prior quarter. 
The criticized assets measurement includes commercial criticized loans, consumer over-60-day past-due loans and OREO. We use this measurement internally, and it provides an additional level of granularity and transparency in our allowance for credit losses coverage, and only looking at the nonaccrual coverage ratios. We continue to feel very comfortable with our reserve level in the context of our portfolio and the market environment.
From an overall portfolio standpoint, we continued to see planned reductions in our Commercial Real Estate portfolio and the C&I portfolio that held steady for the quarter. Within the Commercial Real Estate portfolio, we saw a very positive performance on our core portfolio. The core portfolio remained constant in terms of both portfolio level and asset quality metrics. We have seen no material change in the core portfolio over the past six months. While we have moved some balances from non-core to core, based on our ability to expand the relationships, the loans originally defined as core remain. 
The Home Equity and Residential Mortgage portfolios remained relatively unchanged in the quarter, but we had a very strong quarter in the Auto Finance business. As you know, we feel very comfortable with the high-quality focus of this business and the credit quality characteristics, including an average FICO score of 770, and returns on the quarterly production were very strong. 
Slide 25 provides a graphic representation of the nonaccrual loan and nonperforming asset trends on the left side of the slide and the nonaccrual loan inflow on right side. As we have discussed over the past couple of quarters, the substantial decline in nonaccrual loan inflow is perhaps the most important measurement when assessing the future trends in the portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 26, we can review the entire nonperforming asset flow analysis. Of the total decline in nonperforming assets, less than half was related to the Franklin transaction. The drivers of the reduction were charge-offs and loan payments. Importantly, the rate of decline in nonperforming assets accelerated this quarter due to the lower inflow of new NPAs. 
Slide 27 continues our disclosure around the level of criticized commercial loans. We saw a lower level of inflow during the quarter, and just as importantly, we saw a substantially higher level of upgrades into our past categories. We have a very focused upgrade process, indicating that these borrowers have established a level of profitability and capital position meriting the change. As with the nonperforming asset trends, we are confident that the declining trend is sustainable in future periods. In summary, the decrease flow of loans into the criticized category is a quantitative indicator that there has been a positive sustainable change in the asset quality trends in the portfolio.
Slide 28 demonstrates the improved credit quality associated with the Consumer portfolios. Declining trends are evident across all of our portfolios in both the 30-plus and 90-plus days past due categories. The decline in the over 30-day past due loans has been steady since the second quarter of 2009, indicating it is not simply seasonality or a timing issue. All of the sub-segments reflect the same trends, although to different degrees. The 90-day past due loans are comprised primarily of real estate secured loans that have been written down to a realizable value. While the trend is positive, both the level of delinquencies and losses in the Consumer portfolio secured by real estate remain at higher-than-acceptable levels. We continue to originate home equity and residential mortgages in our footprint, with a focus on a total financial services relationship. Origination levels and quality metrics are included in the slide deck appendix. 
The Auto Finance portfolio continued to show positive trends, even on a lagged-analysis basis. We have substantial detail in the appendix to the slide deck regarding the ongoing positive performance trends in the Auto portfolio. While our markets continue to be impacted by the adverse economic conditions, the declining delinquency rates shown here represent some tangible evidence of improvement. 
Turning to Slide 29, the commercial net charge-offs on the left side of the slide show a generally declining trend since the second quarter of 2009, with the exception of the outsized fourth quarter that included a number of individual significant-size relationships, as previously discussed. Also of note, recoveries in our C&I portfolio for the second quarter were 50% higher than in the first quarter. While it is too early to call this a trend, we fully expect to recognize increased recoveries in the coming quarters. 
The second quarter results were consistent with our expectations based on our active portfolio management strategies. Given the trends in nonaccrual and criticized loans discussed earlier, we are confident our improvement is sustainable. 
The graph on the right side of the slide shows consumer loan charge-off trends. As you recall, the third quarter of 2009 included a nonperforming residential loan sale as well as a $32 million loss associated with a policy change to accelerate the timing of loss recognition. In subsequent quarters, we have maintained our proactive loss recognition policies, including aggressive actions on bankrupt borrowers. We were pleased that the total consumer net charge-off ratio in the 2010 first quarter was down slightly and the second quarter results reflected an additional decline excluding the impact of the Franklin transaction. Combined with the declining delinquency rates noted earlier, we are confident our Consumer portfolio will continue to perform within our expectations in the coming quarters. 
Turning to Slide 30, I'd like to re-emphasize the level of our allowance for credit losses and resulting coverage ratios. In the second quarter, and excluding the impact from the Franklin transaction, net charge-offs exceeded provision expense by $86 million. This resulted in an allowance for credit loss level of $1.4 billion and a resulting ratio to total loans of 3.9%. Despite the decline, as shown on the right side of the slide, our coverage of nonaccrual loans increased from 87% to 120%, a level we believe will compare favorably to our peers. This level is prudent given the continued challenges in the economic environment, combined with some of the positive asset quality trends just discussed. We remain committed to maintaining an appropriate level of reserve for our portfolio in the economic environment. Let me turn this presentation back to Steve."

On Slide 31, this reflects where we expect to see the impacts. The Federal Reserve recently amended Reg E to prohibit charging overdrafts for ATM or onetime debit card transaction unless the customer opts in. Our overdraft charges, or NSF/OD for short, is a major source of fee income for us and for other banks. For Huntington, fees run about $90 million a year. 
Our basic strategy is to mitigate the potential impact by reaching out to customers and alerting them that we can no longer offer such overdrafts unless they opt in to our overdraft service. To date, our results are surpassing our expectations, and according to a recent survey, our opt-in percentages are higher than most of our peers. At this point, over 20% of our customers have opted in, and for those customers that avail themselves to this service the most, the opt-in rate is nearly 50%. While we know some customers will not opt in at first, over time, we believe some will realize that they’ve not kept a valuable service and will then opt in. 
With the recently passed Dodd-Frank Act is complex -- while it’s complex as it relates to how this legislation and subsequent rule-making will impact our company, at this time we believe there are two meaningful areas which we’ve highlighted: interchange fees and the eventual inability to include trust preferred capital as a component of regulatory capital. Now our annual interchange fees run about $90 million per year. And most of our fees are what is referred to as signature-based. That is, the customer signs an authorization at the checkout stand, much like a credit card. 
The Act gives the Federal Reserve and no the longer banks or system owners the ability to set the interchange rate which we charge merchants for the use of debit cards. And what the ultimate impact will be cannot be estimated at this time. We’ll have to wait for the Federal Reserve action and that is -- or may take many months of proposals, debate, and then rule-making. I only wanted to mention today the annual revenue at risk. We believe a fraction and maybe a small fraction of related revenue will eventually be impacted. 
With regard to Trust Preferred Securities, we’re currently at $570 million outstanding, and if disallowed, would reduce the regulatory Tier 1 capital by about 1.34%. There’s a three-year phase-in beginning January 1, 2013, so there’s plenty of time to strategize our capital structure around this new legislation. We do not believe this is a significant issue for Huntington. 
Slide 32 shows various return on asset outcomes, given a range of net charge-off assumptions and a pretax pre-provision income level equal to this quarter's $270 million, about where -- which is where we are today. We take the $270 million. Subtract the intangible amortization expense of $15 million, as it's excluded from our pretax pre-provision income calculation. We then provide a range of analyzed net charge-off from 35 bps to 55 bps, and while we're not yet ready to specify a normalized targeted net charge-off ratio range, or what that should be, this range is within certain 10- and 3-year historical ranges. We did not consider 2007 for this purpose, as it would have included a large Franklin charge, which will not recur. We use these net charge-off assumptions as a proxy for loan loss provision expense. Subtracting this produces a pretax income range, which would apply a 30% income tax rate to develop a range of net income, and calculate the ROA off of that. So we believe we've got a 110 to 120 ROA off the $270 million pretax pre-provision. 
Turning to Slide 33. Let me outline our financial performance expectations for the second half of the year. With regard to the economy and interest rates, we see no meaningful change. We're not expecting a double dip, but we do believe it’s now going to take longer for the economy to recover than we did just 90 days ago. We anticipate second half pretax pre-provision income levels will be aligned with second quarter reported performance. 
NIM is expected to approximate debt of the first half of the year. We expect modest growth in C&I and continued strong growth from automobile loans. CRE loans will continue to decline, with home-equity and residential mortgages remaining relatively flat. We can see an increase in investment securities as excess cash comes from strong core deposit growth needing to be deployed. Fee revenue in the second half is expected to be mixed with certain fee income activities given a lift from the continued rollout of strategic initiatives offset by lower mortgage banking income as well as service charge income due to implementation of Reg E. 
Expenses also should be relatively stable, with increases due to the continued implementation of strategic initiatives. Any growth in expenses is expected to be mostly offset by lower loan, Franklin portfolio servicing and monitoring expenses, as well as a general decline in credit-monitoring-related expenses as nonperforming assets continue to decline. Charge-offs and provision expenses are anticipated to be generally aligned with the second quarter levels, excluding any Franklin impacts. In sum, this should translate into revenue and earnings improvement from the second quarter. 
Slide 34. Before I wrap you up, I wanted to remind you of our 2010 objectives shown on this slide. We believe they’re well understood by every colleague, and that's what we're working towards our execution and delivery. In today's presentation, these specifically speak to the second half of the year. 
In closing, I'd like to remind you of these 2010 objectives. They're essentially the same as they have been through the first quarter and first half. Our balance sheet getting strong, currently the strongest in recent memory. Our capital levels are sufficient, getting stronger with each profitable quarter. We’re substantially improving underlying credit quality trends, which have now been augmented by our decision on Franklin, and that's positioning us for a credit quality performance that is better than peers. 
Underlying earnings and profitability are growing. We continue to see increased opportunities in focusing a great deal of attention on growing revenue. This is supported by our making investments to grow key fee businesses. While the environment is challenging, we're committed to continuing our move to higher levels of performance and improved execution. We're clearly on the move. 
So that's it. Thanks for your interest. Operator, we'll now take questions."

It’s given us even better, frankly, much better insight than what we were getting off a paper tracking process group-wide. So our sales management and sales disciplines are getting better, Tony, and we can see it in cross-sell ratios or new customers as well as existing portfolio. And the learning, the coordination of taking referrals to sales is getting better and will continue to improve, certainly throughout this year and I think possibly even indefinitely. So we're well underway, I believe. Now a lot of the expenses associated with the initiatives, in terms of hiring and things like that, we accelerated, we wanted to get that into the -- get that done in the first half, and I’m glad we have.

After my overview, Don will follow with his usual overview of our financial performance. Dan will provide an update on credit, I'll then return with a discussion of our near-term outlook and key messages to investors. I want to repeat some key points we made in our September Investor Day that are critical for understanding what is driving this company and our financial performance. 
First, we're in a period of continued economic weakness. It's not going to get back to what we all remembered for years. Economic growth will be slow and choppy. Second is the permanent change in consumer and business behavior. Consumers and businesses are deleveraging, and will be reluctant to releverage. There's a new appreciation for savings and cash accumulation. And there's an intense focus on value and for spending lower absolute amounts. And while convenience has always been important to customers, today, it's more important than ever. First, the impact of increased regulation. This means pressure on revenue, higher compliance costs and an increase in prospective capital requirements.
So to position Huntington to win in this type of environment, we first needed to get our credit issues addressed. We believe the aggressive actions taken last year to identify and resolve credit issues accomplished this objective. The continued credit improvement in the third quarter and our ability to maintain strong reserves, while also reducing provision expense, is evidence of our success on this front. 
Next, we needed to develop and implement a strategic plan that would position Huntington to grow core revenues and win in this type of new environment. Our strategic plan was developed and launched last year and continues to be implemented and will evolve. And while it has many aspects, two are worth noting: First was the decision significant investments to organically grow revenue. This included increasing our cross-sell capabilities, as well as making investments and developing new revenue streams, distribution channels and the talent to manage this expansion. The most recent example was our announcement of a 15-year agreement with Giant Eagle to roll out 103 in-store branches over the next few years. We also, this week, announced the hiring of Jeff Dennes, a nationally-recognized leader in online mobile and payments industry, and Jeff will be our Director of Online and Mobile Services.
Second and in response to the environmental and customer attitude and behavioral changes just mentioned, we adopted our Fair Play banking philosophy discussed last month. One aspect was last month's introduction of 24-hour grace on personal overdraft fees. This is creating significant market buzz. Customers are noticing and responding. We believe that the benefits of accelerated customer acquisition and the revenue we will generate will more than offset the fees given up both voluntarily, as well those that are regulatory driven through Reg E and otherwise. 
The implementation of our strategic initiatives create an earnings dynamic where expense growth precedes related revenue gains. Usually in this situation, earnings growth slows down or plateaus, and some of that is evident in our third quarter performance. Our aggressive handling of credit issues last year is enabling us to reduce provision expense this year, translating to earnings growth. 
Importantly, any plateauing is expected to be short-lived as we're already experiencing increased revenues from our strategic initiatives. This growth is evident in net interest income growth that's reflected strong growth in auto loans in two consecutive quarters now of C&I loan growth. 
Given all of this and what's going on in the environment, you can understand why we're pleased that for three consecutive quarters, we reported higher net income. In sum, the third quarter represented another meaningful step forward in moving Huntington financial performance and for breaking away from some of our competition. 
Now let's begin more detailed discussion, turning to Slide 8. We reported net income of $100.9 million or $0.10 a share, and the performance drivers were more of provision expense and higher net interest income. And we believe these trends will continue. Our pretax, pre-provision income was $265 million, down $5 million or 2% from the second quarter. On one hand, given the revenue and economic environment challenges, this is not unexpected. But we are not satisfied with this performance. The primary driver of our growth in pretax income were the $74 million decline in provision for credit losses, as we continue to see significant credit quality improvement such as an 18% decline in nonaccrual loans and a 7% decrease in net charge-offs, excluding Franklin-related impacts of the second quarter. 
Even though our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loans declined, as Dan will elaborate, our nonaccrual loan coverage increased to 140% from 120%. And we believe our key credit metrics such as reserve coverage and nonperforming loan and NPA ratios now fall within the top quartile peer performance, while also showing a clear and sustained trend line.
Also contributing growth in pre-tax income was $7.9 million or a 1% increase in full tax equivalent revenue, which was driven by a $24 million or 3% increase in full taxable equivalent net interest income. Our net interest margin was 3.45% down one basis point, and we posted a 1% increase annualized in total average loans and leases, reflecting the auto growth and the C&I growth mentioned earlier. 
Fee income declined $2.5 million or 1%, primarily driven by lower service charges on deposit accounts. Partially offsetting these benefits was a $13.5 million increase in non-interest expense, primarily reflecting the ongoing implementation of our strategic initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 9, all of our period and capital ratios improved. Regulatory Tier 1 and total risk-based ratios are $2.9 billion and $2.2 billion above well-capitalized regulatory thresholds. Our tangible common equity improved eight bps to 6.2%, and our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio improved 30 basis points to 7.36%. Lastly, our liquidity position remains strong. We saw 2% annualized core deposit growth for the period end loan-to-deposit ratio of 91%.
As shown on Slide 10, we continue to move forward with our positioning for growth with the implementation of strategic initiatives designed to grow future revenue. And these included increasing the investment in our brand, this was evidenced by higher marketing expenses; by retail and business banking introduction of Fair Play banking philosophy and our launch of 24-Hour Grace. That feature gives our retail customers one business day to cover an account overdraft with no penalty, with no charge. Additionally, our auto finance group continues its expansion eastward by complement an earlier expansion in eastern Pennsylvania which have expanded into five New England states. 
Each of these initiatives are specifically targeted to grow revenue. The appendix and slideshow in all other initiatives since the first quarter of 2009. We have and are very excited -- we are very excited about the cumulative impact and opportunities these represent. 
So let me turn the presentation over to Don to review the details. Don?"

Our performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation so let's move on. 
Slide 12 is a summary income statement and shows that the $68.6 million increase in pretax income reflects the benefit of $74.2 million decline and expense and $10.3 million increase in net interest income, which were partially offset by $13.5 million increase in expenses and a $2.5 million decrease in non-interest income. I'll detail these changes in subsequent slides. 
A point Steve mentioned earlier, this is exactly the dynamic we are expecting. By addressing our credit issues last year, we are seeing improvement in credit costs. This allowed us to fund our strategic initiatives while not net income growth. Further as part the benefits of our strategic initiatives continue to build, our objective is to continue earnings growth once credit costs return to more normal levels.
Turning to Slide 13, we show the trends in our revenues hour pretax pre-provisioned income on the last end of the slide. Revenues of continued throughout the last seven quarters. Revenues for the third quarter up 9% over the third quarter of last year. Our pretax pre-provision earnings are about 11% from the last year despite a 2% decline from previous quarter. This decline was caused by several factors including a drop in of revenues of $10 million. We expect pretax pre-provision levels to remain relatively stable even taking into account the remaining impact of Reg E, our Fair Play banking philosophy and lower expected mortgage banking revenues.
Slide 14 depicts the trends of our net interest income in margin. During the third quarter, our full tax equivalent net interest income increased by $10.4 million, reflecting a one basis point decline in our net interest margin to 3.45% and a $0.9 billion increase to our average earning asset base. The margin change reflects several impacts. First, was a favorable impact of our deposit mix and pricing changes. The mix shift from our time deposits to more transaction-based core deposits, both reduced our cost, but also resulted in a more stable deposit base for us as well. Offsetting this positive impact was a $7.5 million or six basis-point reduction to margin coming from the Franklin-related loans. During the third quarter, we completed the sale of Franklin-related loans involving a reduction to net interest income.
This loss of revenue will be more than offset by the reduction in servicing-related costs incurred for the Franklin-related loans. We would expect Franklin-related expenses to decline by $4 million next quarter due to the sale. Other items impacting the quarter included lower interest income on our interest-rate derivatives. Also the day count negatively impacted the third quarter margin. 
Continuing on to Slide 15, which show a change in our deposit mix over the last five quarters. The shift from 40% of our deposits in time and non-core amount to 29% has improved margin by 22 basis points.
Turning to Slide 16, we showed a 1% growth in total core deposits. This was driven by strong growth in money market accounts as interest-bearing demand deposits declined. 
Slide 17 shows the trends in our loan and lease portfolio. Total commercial loans were down $0.1 billion or 1%. The decline reflected the anticipated decline in commercial real estate balances. The $0.1 billion increase to C&I loans reflected improving customer acquisition, resulting from some of the early benefits of our strategic initiatives, including growth in our equipment finance area. These increases were not impacted by increasing utilization rates as they remained at historic low levels of 42%.
Consumer loans were up $0.3 billion or 2% from the prior quarter. The $0.5 billion increase in average automobile loans and leases reflected record originations of over $1 billion this past quarter. These originations continue to reflect very high credit quality and reasonable returns. 
Slide 18 shows the trends in our noninterest income category. Our non-interest income decreased by $2.5 million from the prior quarter. Our deposit service charges were down by $10 million reflecting the adoption of the changes to Reg E and the early stage impact of our Fair Play banking philosophy. We would expect a similar decline in deposit service charges over the next quarter.
Mortgage banking revenue increased at $6.5 billion, reflecting an 81% risk origination and secondary marketing income on $1.6 billion of originations. This increase was offset by a $7.9 million decrease in MSR hedging income. In the second quarter, the MSR hedging income reflected a change to the underlying prepayment assumptions for the MSR assets, which contribute to a $12.2 million benefit to income last quarter. 
The next slide is a summary of our expense trends. Total expenses were about $13.5 million from the prior quarter. This reflected a $13.4 million increase in personnel costs. This increase was due to a 1.5% increase in staffing levels, attributed to the strategic initiative implemented over the last several quarters, higher production related expenses of $5.6 million and higher pension and 401(k) costs of $3.2 million. 
OREO on foreclosure expenses were up $7.1 million from the second quarter as the prior quarter included a $3.7 million OREO gain in the current quarter and included $2 million Franklin-related OREO loss. We're continuing to manage down our OREO portfolio. 
Marketing costs were also up $3.2 million, attributed to brand advertising campaign. The decline in professional services of $3.7 million reflects the reduction in servicing costs for the Franklin-related loans. Continued reduction in this cost should be reflected in the fourth quarter.
Slide 20 is a summary of our capital trends. The current quarter's net income resulted in an increased to our tangible common equity ratio to 6.2% from 6.12% despite a $1.4 billion increase to our asset base, reflecting even stronger improvement to our Tier 1 capital ratio which increased to 7.36% from 7.06% and our Tier 1 ratio which increased from 12.76% to 12.51%. These increases not only benefited from a capital accretive earning but also from a decrease in the total disallowed deferred tax asset  for regulatory capital purposes, from $191 million at June 30 to $113 million as of September 30. Our first tax asset realization for regulatory capital purposes improved the ratios by about 18 basis points.
Turning to Slide 21, our initial review of the Basel III guidelines would suggest a minimal impact on regulatory capital ratios at less than 10 basis points. This has been in our Tier 1 ratio for the trust preferred securities, which currently adds about 133 basis points to this ratio. 
Related to our TARP repayment plans, our message is basically the same. We recognize that our earnings are returning to more core levels, and that's positive. Yet the economy remains fragile. Also additional clarity is needed from the regulators on the interpretation of the TARP. As we said previously, our objective is to repay when we believe it is prudent to do so. 
Let me turn the presentation over to Dan Neumeyer to review credit trends. Dan?"

Slide 22 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. We continue to make very good progress in improving our credit quality metrics, both the nonaccrual loan ratio and the nonperforming asset ratio shows significant improvement in the quarter, the latter aided by the sale of Franklin assets that were moved to health for sale in the second quarter and disposed of in the third quarter. We continue to see continued, meaningful reductions in our non-performers in the coming quarters. Criticized loan level also continued to decline despite unsettled economic conditions. 
The net charge-off ratio fell to 1.98% on an annualized basis, a further reduction from the prior quarter. 90-day loans past due and accruing interests saw a very slight uptick in the quarter, not unexpected given seasonal patterns in consumer behavior. The ACL ratio moved from 3.67% from 3.9%, although coverage ratios on both non-accruals and nonperforming assets continued to show very healthy improvement given significantly lower nonperforming asset levels. The ACL to criticized asset ratio also showed stronger coverage, an indication that we're adequately reserved against emerging problem loans. 
We continue to work to rebalance the portfolio with an emphasis on reducing non-core commercial real estate exposure, while continuing to grow C&I and consumer categories. Indirect auto is originating record volumes with excellent credit quality metrics. 
Slide 23 provides a graphic presentation of a nonaccrual loan and nonperforming assets trends on the left side of the slide and the nonaccrual loan inflow on the right side. The overall trend in nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets continues to be very positive, and exhibits very meaningful improvement in the last four quarters.
Nonaccrual inflows did experience an increase in the quarter, reflecting a continued fragile economy. Several larger credits contributed much of the increase and were placed on nonaccrual in line with our continued conservative posture of early recognition and resolution of emerging problem loans. 30% of our total commercial loans are nonaccrual remain current on principal and interest. 
Turning to Slide 24, we can review the entire nonperforming asset flow analysis. As mentioned, we did see an increase in new NPAs in the third quarter, reflecting continued economic stress and the uneven nature of the commercial portfolio recovery. However, we also saw an increase in loans returning to accruing status and an increase in payments. These factors, along with asset sales, contributed to a 30% reduction in NPAs for the quarter, the most significant reduction in some time. 
Slide 25 continues our disclosure on the level of criticized commercial loans. Criticized commercial loans fell 11% for the second consecutive quarter, showing sustained momentum in the level of problem loan resolution. The fragility of the economic environment remains apparent as we continued to see an inflow of new watchlist loans. However, we also continue to see a healthy level of loans moving back to the past category by risk rating upgrades and an increase in the level of pay downs on these criticized loans. It's our expectation that despite like challenging outlook, we'll continue to make good progress in reducing our overall level of criticized loans in the coming quarters.
Reflecting the unevenness of the recovery, our total commercial loan, 30-day delinquencies increased to 1.08% from 0.95% at the end of the second quarter. Almost all of these loans are managed of our Special Assets Department and receive the highest level of scrutiny and attention. 90 days past dues remain at zero for the fourth consecutive quarter, again, reflecting our aggressive treatment of developing problem loans. 
Slide 27 demonstrates the improved credit quality associated with the consumer portfolios. Overall, consumer delinquencies in the 30-day category continued to an exhibit improving trend. 
Residential mortgage and auto continue to show improvement from the prior quarter, while home equity loans exhibit a small increase. In the 90-day category, auto and home equity held fairly steady from the prior quarter while residential delinquencies demonstrated an increase. Although some seasonal upticks are anticipated, we continue to manage our delinquency levels very closely and expect the overall positive trend to continue. 
Delinquency measures in all consumer categories were better than at 9/30, one year ago. Our consumer portfolio consists primarily of loans within our footprint and is relationship-based. We continued to originate high quality assets with high FICO scores and reasonable loan-to-value.
Turning to Slide 28, commercial net charge-offs continued to show an improving trend following 10% from the prior quarter. Lower levels of NPAs showed continued declines in commercial charge-offs. Consumer loan charge-offs were flat in dollar terms but as a percentage of loans spelled due to additional loan growth primarily in auto. While high unemployment rates and economic malaise continued to present challenges in the consumer portfolio, the relationship nature our portfolio, coupled with early intervention and managing delinquencies, should allow us to exhibit continued positive momentum in the consumer book.
Turning to Slide 29, the loan-loss provision for the third quarter of $119 million with less than charge-offs of $184 million. This resulted in ACL-to-loans of 3.67, down from 3.9 at June 30. Importantly, the coverage ratio of ACL to NALs increased significantly from 120% at June 30th to 140% at September 30. Also the coverage ratio relative to criticized assets continued to increase an overall credit quality which remains much improved. We believe this level of coverage is very healthy and quite strong relative to our peer group. We also believe that it is appropriate given the difficult economic environment that remain before us. 
Overall, we remain very pleased with our progress in the credit front and all of our portfolios. We are cognizant of the challenges that remain before us and are confident in our ability to navigate through them while demonstrating continued improvement in our credit metrics. Let me turn the presentation back to Steve."

The CRE covered by these expectations is beyond the fourth quarter but to some extent determined by what happens in the economy. So here's our thinking -- it's going to remain generally weak, no meaningful change is expected. Confidence continues to be a challenge at very low levels. We're not anticipating, however, a double-dip recession. We do believe, however, that any recovery is getting pushed further and further out. So the key drivers of net income growth are expected to be from net interest income and lower provision for credit losses, reflecting our expectation for continued improvement in our key credit metrics, including adoptions in nonperforming assets at lower charge-offs, which we saw in the third quarter. 
Again, pretax pre-provision earnings will likely remain comparable to the 2010 year-to-date performance, with similar dynamics as that seen in the third quarter performance. We anticipate modest loan growth, driven by continued strong growth in autos and some growth in the C&I loans, partially offset by continued declines in commercial real estate loans. We still do not anticipate much, if any growth, to home equity loans. Residential mortgage refinancing activity will likely remain above historical trends due to continued low interest rates, but since most of our loans originated are fixed-rate which we sell, we're not likely to see much growth, if any, in this category. 
We continue to expect growth in demand deposit, and savings accounts, and although we may choose to manage that growth differently, if we continue to see limited reinvestment options. Fee income growth we expect will be mixed. We anticipate improvements in our strategic initiatives, as they gain further traction. Yet much of the growth near-term may be mitigated by lower mortgage banking income and declines in service charges on deposits. 
Manager's expense is expected to remain relatively stable with third quarter performance, with growth from strategic initiatives mitigated by lower credit-related and to some extent some lower marketing expenses. Taking all of this together, we anticipate continued modest growth in net income. 
On Slide 31, in closing, I want to remind all of our investors and customers of several key messages, our balance sheet is strong and our capital levels are sufficient and getting stronger with each passing profitable quarter. Our substantially improved credit quality performance positions us to obtain top quartile performance. Our strategic initiatives continue to gain traction, and while the environment is challenging, everyday we are making progress. We are clearly on the move. We are growing and getting stronger. So thank you for your interest in Huntington.

But I'd say that we are expecting the fee to return there. That the expense increases this past quarter reflected not only some of the initiatives but also the benefit from some higher levels of mortgage production, which resulted in higher incentive costs for us as well.

We certainly aren't waiting until there are no options left on those credits. In terms of the criticized asset flow, that was fairly broad-based. We saw actually more in terms of dollars in the C&I world and in business banking and actually less in commercial real estate. And when you look at the inflows, it is very diversified, again, amongst geographies. Given this economy, there are a lot of undercapitalized companies that are still struggling. Many have made great advances in cutting their cost structure and are surviving. Others are struggling a bit. So I think it's -- given the kind of a slowdown that we've seen in the last quarter, which began with kind of the European disruption and the effects of that, we have seen a lagged effect on that slow down and I think an increase in the third quarter. We're not necessarily anticipating that same level of inflow in the fourth quarter, but it's kind of too early to tell."

Dan will provide an update on credit, I'll then return with a discussion of our near-term outlook and key messages to investors. I want to repeat some key points we made in our September Investor Day that are critical for understanding what is driving this company and our financial performance. 
First, we're in a period of continued economic weakness. It's not going to get back to what we all remembered for years. Economic growth will be slow and choppy. Second, is the permanent change in consumer and business behavior. Consumers and businesses are deleveraging, and will be reluctant to re-leverage. There's a new appreciation for savings and cash accumulation. And there's an intense focus on value and for spending lower absolute amounts. And while convenience has always been important to customers, today, it's more important than ever. Third, the impact of increased regulation. This means pressure on revenue, higher compliance costs and an increase in prospective capital requirements.
So to position Huntington to win in this type of environment, we first needed to get our credit issues addressed. We believe the aggressive actions taken last year to identify and resolve credit issues accomplished this objective. The continued credit improvement in the third quarter and our ability to maintain strong reserves, while also reducing provision expense, is evidence of our success on this front. 
Next, we needed to develop and implement a strategic plan that would position Huntington to grow core revenues and win in this type of new environment. Our strategic plan was developed and launched last year and continues to be implemented and will evolve. And while it has many aspects, two are worth noting: First, was the decision significant investments to organically grow revenue. This included increasing our cross-sell capabilities, as well as making investments and developing new revenue streams, distribution channels and the talent to manage this expansion. The most recent example was our announcement of a 15-year agreement with Giant Eagle to roll out 103 in-store branches over the next few years. We also, this week, announced the hiring of Jeff Dennes, a nationally-recognized leader in online mobile and payments industry, and Jeff will be our Director of Online and Mobile Services.
Second, and in response to the environmental and customer attitude and behavioral changes just mentioned, we adopted our Fair Play banking philosophy discussed last month. One aspect was last month's introduction of 24-hour grace on personal overdraft fees. This is creating significant market buzz. Customers are noticing and responding. We believe that the benefits of accelerated customer acquisition and the revenue we will generate will more than offset the fees given up both voluntarily, as well those that are regulatory driven through Reg E and otherwise. 
The implementation of our strategic initiatives creates an earnings dynamic where expense growth precedes related revenue gains. Usually in this situation, earnings growth slows down or plateaus, and some of that is evident in our third quarter performance. Our aggressive handling of credit issues last year is enabling us to reduce provision expense this year, translating to earnings growth. 
Importantly, any plateauing is expected to be short-lived as we're already experiencing increased revenues from our strategic initiatives. This growth is evident in net interest income growth that's reflected strong growth in auto loans in two consecutive quarters now of C&I loan growth. 
Given all of this and what's going on in the environment, you can understand why we're pleased that for three consecutive quarters, we’ve reported higher net income. In sum, the third quarter represented another meaningful step forward in moving Huntington to stronger financial performance and for breaking away from some of our competition. 
Now let's begin more detailed discussion, turning to Slide 8. We reported net income of $100.9 million or $0.10 a share, and the performance drivers were more provision expense and higher net interest income. And we believe these trends will continue. Our pretax, pre-provision income was $265 million, down $5 million or 2% from the second quarter. On one hand, given the revenue and economic environment challenges, this is not unexpected. But, we are not satisfied with this performance. The primary driver of our growth in pretax income was a $74 million decline in provision for credit losses, as we continue to see significant credit quality improvement such as an 18% decline in nonaccrual loans and a 7% decrease in net charge-offs, excluding Franklin-related impacts of the second quarter. 
Even though our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loans declined, as Dan will elaborate, our nonaccrual loan coverage increased to 140% from 120%. And we believe our key credit metrics such as reserve coverage and nonperforming loan and NPA ratios now fall within the top quartile of peer performance, while also showing a clear and sustained trend line.
Also contributing growth in pre-tax income was $7.9 million or a 1% increase in fully tax equivalent revenue, which was driven by a $10.4 million or 3% increase in fully taxable equivalent net interest income. Our net interest margin was 3.45% down one basis point, and we posted a 1% increase annualized in total average loans and leases, reflecting the auto growth and the C&I growth mentioned earlier. 
Fee income declined $2.5 million or 1%, primarily driven by lower service charges on deposit accounts. Partially offsetting these benefits was a $13.5 million increase in non-interest expense, primarily reflecting the ongoing implementation of our strategic initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 9, all of our period and capital ratios improved. Regulatory Tier 1 and total risk-based ratios are $2.9 billion and $2.2 billion above well-capitalized regulatory thresholds. Our tangible common equity improved eight bps to 6.2%, and our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio improved 30 basis points to 7.36%. Lastly, our liquidity position remains strong. We saw 2% annualized core deposit growth with a period end loan-to-deposit ratio of 91%.
As shown on Slide 10, we continue to move forward with our positioning for growth with the implementation of strategic initiatives designed to grow future revenue. And these included increasing the investment in our brand, this was evidenced by higher marketing expenses; by retail business banking introduction of Fair Play banking philosophy and our launch of 24-Hour Grace. That feature gives our retail customers one business day to cover an account overdraft with no penalty, with no charge. Additionally, our auto finance group continues its expansion eastward by complementing an earlier expansion into eastern Pennsylvania with now an expansion  into five New England states. 
Each of these initiatives is specifically targeted to grow revenue. The appendix and slides showing  all other initiatives since the first quarter of 2009. We have and are very excited -- we are very excited about the cumulative impact and opportunities these represent. 
So let me turn the presentation over to Don to review the details. Don?"

Many of the  performance metrics will be discussed later in the presentation, so let's move on. 
Slide 12 is a summary income statement and shows that the $68.6 million increase in pretax income will swing to [ph] (0:25:38) the benefit of $74.2 million decline and provision expense and $10.3 million increase in net interest income, which were partially offset by a $13.5 million increase in expenses and a $2.5 million decrease in non-interest income. I'll detail these changes in subsequent slides. 
A point Steve made earlier, this is exactly the dynamic we were expecting. By addressing our credit issues last year, we are seeing a quick improvement in credit costs. This allows us to fund our strategic initiatives while not interrupting our net income growth. Further, as part the benefits of our strategic initiatives continue to build, our objective is to continue earnings growth once credit costs return to more normal levels.
Turning to Slide 13, we show the trends in our revenues in our pretax pre-provisioned income on the left-hand side of the  slide. Revenues have continued to grow throughout the last seven quarters. Revenues for the third quarter are up 9% over the third quarter of last year. Our pretax pre-provision earnings are about 11% from the last year despite a 2% decline from the previous quarter. This decline was caused by several factors, including a drop in deposit service charge revenues of $10 million. We expect pretax pre-provision levels to remain relatively stable even taking into account the remaining impact of Reg E, our Fair Play banking philosophy and lower expected mortgage banking revenues.
Slide 14 depicts the trends of our net interest income and margin. During the third quarter, our fully tax equivalent net interest income increased by $10.4 million, reflecting a one basis point decline in our net interest margin to 3.45% and a $0.9 billion increase to our average earning asset base. The margin change reflected several impacts. First, was a favorable impact of our deposit mix and pricing changes. The mix shift from our time deposits to more transaction-based core deposits, both reduced our cost, but also results in a more stable deposit base for us as well. Offsetting this positive impact was a $7.5 million or six basis-point reduction to margin coming from the Franklin-related loans. During the third quarter, we completed the sale of Franklin-related loans involving a reduction to net interest income.
This loss of revenue will be more than offset by the reduction in servicing-related costs incurred for the Franklin-related loans. We would expect Franklin-related expenses to decline by $4 million next quarter due to the sale. Other items impacting the quarter included lower interest income on our interest-rate derivatives. Also the day count negatively impacted the third quarter margin. 
Continuing on to Slide 15, which showed a change in our deposit mix over the last five quarters. The shift from 40% of our deposits in time and non-core to 29% has improved our margin by 22 basis points.
Turning to Slide 16, we showed a 1% growth in total core deposits. This was driven by strong growth in money market accounts as interest-bearing demand deposits declined. 
Slide 17 shows the trends in our loan and lease portfolio. Total commercial loans were down $0.1 billion or 1%. The decline reflected the anticipated decline in commercial real estate balances. The $0.1 billion increase to C&I loans reflected improving customer acquisition, resulting from some of the early benefits of our strategic initiatives, including growth in our equipment finance area. These increases were not impacted by increasing utilization rates as they remained at historic low levels of 42%.
Consumer loans were up $0.3 billion or 2% from the prior quarter. The $0.5 billion increase in average automobile loans and leases reflected record originations of over $1 billion this past quarter. These originations continue to reflect very high credit quality and reasonable returns. 
Slide 18 shows the trends in our noninterest income category. Our non-interest income decreased by $2.5 million from the prior quarter. Our deposit service charges were down by $10 million reflecting the adoption of the changes to Reg E and the early stage impact of our Fair Play banking philosophy. We would expect a similar decline in deposit service charges over the next quarter.
Mortgage banking revenue increased by $6.5 million, reflecting an 81% increase in  origination and secondary marketing income on $1.6 billion of originations. This increase was offset by a $7.9 million decrease in MSR hedging income. In the second quarter, the MSR hedging income reflected a change to the underlying prepayment assumptions for the MSR assets, which contributed a $12.2 million benefit to income last quarter. 
The next slide is a summary of our expense trends. Total expenses were up $13.5 million from the prior quarter. This reflected a $13.4 million increase in personnel costs. This increase was due to a 1.5% increase in staffing levels, attributed to the strategic initiatives implemented over the last several quarters, higher production-related incentives of $5.6 million and higher pension and 401(k) costs of $3.2 million. 
OREO on foreclosure expenses were up $7.1 million from the second quarter as the prior quarter included a $3.7 million OREO gain and the current quarter included a $2 million Franklin-related OREO loss. We're continuing to manage down our OREO portfolio. 
Marketing costs were also up $3.2 million, attributed to the brand advertising campaign. The decline in professional services of $3.7 million reflects the reduction in servicing costs for the Franklin-related loans. Continued reduction in this cost should be reflected in the fourth quarter.
Slide 20 is a summary of our capital trends. The current quarter's net income resulted in an increase to our tangible common equity ratio to 6.2% from 6.12% despite a $1.4 billion increase to our asset base. Reflecting even stronger improvement were our Tier 1 capital ratio which increased to 7.36% from 7.06% and our Tier 1 ratio which increased to 12.76% from 12.51%. These increases not only benefited from a capital accretive earning but also from a decrease in the total disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes, from $191 million at June 30 to $113 million as of September 30. Our first tax asset realization for regulatory capital purposes improved the ratios by about 18 basis points.
Turning to Slide 21, our initial review of the Basel III capital [ph] (0:32:19) guidelines would suggest a minimal impact on regulatory capital ratios at less than 10 basis points. This is asking [ph] (0:32:25) our Tier 1 ratio for the trust preferred securities, which currently adds about 133 basis points to this ratio. 
Related to our TARP repayment plans, our message is basically the same. We recognize that our earnings are returning to more core levels, and that's a positive. Yet the economy remains fragile. Also additional clarity is needed from the regulators on their interpretation of the Basil III accord.. As we said, previously, our objective is to repay when we believe it is prudent to do so. 
Let me turn the presentation over to Dan Neumeyer to review credit trends. Dan?"

Slide 22 provides an overview of our credit quality trends. We continue to make very good progress in improving our credit quality metrics, both the nonaccrual loan ratio and the nonperforming asset ratio shows significant improvement in the quarter, the latter aided by the sale of Franklin assets that were moved to “held [ph] (0:33:17) for sale” in the second quarter and disposed of in the third quarter. We continue to see continued, meaningful reductions in our non-performers in the coming quarters. Criticized loan levels also continued to decline despite unsettled economic conditions. 
The net charge-off ratio fell to 1.98% on an annualized basis, a further reduction from the prior quarter. 90-day loans past due and accruing interests saw a very slight uptick in the quarter, not unexpected given seasonal patterns in consumer behavior. The ACL ratio moved from 3.67% from 3.9%, although coverage ratios on both non-accrual loans and nonperforming assets continued to show very healthy improvement given significantly lower nonperforming asset levels. The ACL-to-criticized- asset ratio also showed stronger coverage, an indication that we're adequately reserved against emerging problem loans. 
We continue to work to rebalance the portfolio with an emphasis on reducing non-core commercial real estate exposure, while continuing to grow C&I and consumer categories. Indirect auto is originating record volumes with excellent credit quality metrics. 
Slide 23 provides a graphic presentation of the nonaccrual loan and nonperforming assets trends on the left side of the slide and the nonaccrual loan inflow on the right side. The overall trend in nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets continues to be very positive, and exhibits very meaningful improvement in the last four quarters.
Nonaccrual inflows did experience an increase in the quarter, reflecting a continued fragile economy. Several larger credits contributed much of the increase and were placed on nonaccrual in line with our continued conservative posture of early recognition and resolution of emerging problem loans. 30% of our total commercial loans on nonaccrual remain current on principal and interest. 
Turning to Slide 24, we can review the entire nonperforming assets flow analysis. As mentioned, we did see an increase in new NPAs in the third quarter, reflecting continued economic stress and the uneven nature of the commercial portfolio recovery. However, we also saw an increase in loans returning to accruing status and an increase in payments. These factors, along with asset sales, contributed to a 30% reduction in NPAs for the quarter, the most significant reduction in some time. 
Slide 25 continues our disclosure on the level of criticized commercial loans. Criticized commercial loans fell 11% for the second consecutive quarter, showing sustained momentum in the level of problem-loan resolution. The fragility of the economic environment remains apparent as we continued to see an inflow of new watch-list loans. However, we also continue to see a healthy level of loans moving back to the past category by a risk rating upgrade and an increase in the level of pay downs on these criticized loans. It's our expectation that despite like challenging outlook, we'll continue to make good progress in reducing our overall level of criticized loans in the coming quarters.
Reflecting the unevenness of the recovery, our total commercial loan, 30-day delinquencies increased to 1.08% from 0.95% at the end of the second quarter. Almost all of these loans are managed by our Special Assets Department and receive the highest level of scrutiny and attention. 90 days past dues remain at zero for the fourth consecutive quarter, again, reflecting our aggressive treatment of developing problem loans. 
Slide 27 demonstrates the improved credit quality associated with the consumer portfolios. Overall, consumer delinquencies in the 30-day category continued to exhibit improving trend. 
Residential mortgage and auto continue to show improvement from the prior quarter, while home equity loans and lines exhibited a small increase. In the 90-day category, auto and home equity held fairly steady from the prior quarter while residential delinquencies demonstrated an increase. Although some seasonal upticks are anticipated, we continue to manage our delinquency levels very closely and expect the overall positive trend to continue. 
Delinquency measures in all consumer categories were better than at 9/30, one year ago. Our consumer portfolio consists primarily of loans within our footprint and is relationship-based. We continue to originate high- quality assets with high FICO scores and reasonable loan-to-value.
Turning to Slide 28, commercial net charge-offs continued to show an improving trend falling 10% from the prior quarter. Lower levels of NPAs showed continued declines in commercial charge-offs. Consumer loan charge-offs were flat in dollar terms, but as a percentage of loans fell due to additional loan growth primarily in auto. While high unemployment rates and economic malaise continued to present challenges in the consumer portfolio, the relationship nature our portfolio, coupled with early intervention and managing delinquencies, should allow us to exhibit continued positive momentum in the consumer book.
Turning to Slide 29, the loan-loss provision for the third quarter of $119 million with less than charge-offs of $184 million. This resulted in ACL-to-loans of 3.67, down from 3.9 at June 30. Importantly, the coverage ratio of ACL to NALs increased significantly from 120% at June 30 to 140% at September 30. Also the coverage ratio relative to criticized assets continued to increase and overall credit quality which remains much improved. We believe this level of coverage is very healthy and quite strong relative to our peer group. We also believe that it is appropriate given the difficult economic environment that remains before us. 
Overall, we remain very pleased with our progress on the credit front and all of our portfolios. We are cognizant of the challenges that remain before us and are confident in our ability to navigate through them while demonstrating continued improvement in our credit metrics. Let me turn the presentation back to Steve."
278614,113476409,81013,"Huntington Bancshares Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","I'd like to use Slide 30 to recap our current thinking regarding near-term expectations.

The time period covered by these expectations is beyond the fourth quarter but to some extent determined by what happens in the economy. So here's our thinking -- it's going to remain generally weak, no meaningful change is expected. Confidence continues to be a challenge at very low levels. We're not anticipating, however, a double-dip recession. We do believe, however, that any recovery is getting pushed further and further out. So the key drivers of net income growth are expected to be from net interest income and lower provision for credit losses, reflecting our expectation for continued improvement in our key credit metrics, including reductions in nonperforming assets and lower charge-offs, which you saw in the third quarter. 
Again, pretax pre-provision earnings will likely remain comparable to the 2010 year-to-date performance, with similar dynamics as that seen in the third quarter performance. We anticipate modest loan growth, driven by continued strong growth in autos and some growth in the C&I loans, partially offset by continued declines in commercial real estate loans. We still do not anticipate much, if any growth, to home equity loans. Residential mortgage refinancing activity will likely remain above historical trends due to continued low interest rates, but since most of our loans originated as fixed-rate loans which we sell, we're not likely to see much growth, if any, in this category. 
We continue to expect growth in demand deposits and savings accounts, and although we may choose to manage that growth differently, if we continue to see limited reinvestment options. Fee income growth we expect will be mixed. We anticipate improvements in our strategic initiatives, as they gain further traction. Yet much of the growth near-term may be mitigated by lower mortgage banking income and declines in service charges on deposits. 
Noninterest expense is expected to remain relatively stable with third quarter performance, with growth from strategic initiatives mitigated by lower credit-related and to some extent some lower marketing expenses. Taking all of this together, we anticipate continued modest growth in net income. 
On Slide 31, in closing, I want to remind all of our investors and customers of several key messages: our balance sheet is strong and our capital levels are sufficient and getting stronger with each passing profitable quarter. Our substantially improved credit quality performance positions us to obtain top quartile performance. Our strategic initiatives continue to gain traction, and while the environment is challenging, every day we are making progress. We are clearly on the move. We are growing and getting stronger. So thank you for your interest in Huntington.

But I'd say that we are expecting the fee to returns there. That the expense increases this past quarter reflected not only some of the initiatives but also the benefit from some of the higher levels of mortgage production, which resulted in higher incentive costs for us as well.

Many have made great advances in cutting their cost structure and are surviving. Others are struggling a bit.
