Adjusted EBITDA was $982 million, a 33% increase ov",1125,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our results for 2009. The recession made it a difficult year to navigate, but we focused on the basics and delivered very solid progress. Adjusted EBITDA was $982 million, a 33% increase over 2008. We extended for a fifth year, Tenet's strong record of growth in EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Our EBITDA in 2009 was more than twice what Tenet generated in 2004 when we had 40% more hospitals than we have today. Our adjusted free cash flow improved by almost $400 million to positive $165 million. While adjusted free cash flow excludes our payments to the Department of Justice, worth noting that we will make the last of these payments in August. It brings us on track to begin generating positive absolute free cash flow and marking another important milestone for the company.I'd like to begin by giving you a summary of how we generated these results. One of the most important objectives was to control costs, and we did that very well. We made serious cost cuts in virtually all areas of our business. This showed up in our results every quarter. We had dramatic reductions in employee turnover and the use of contract labor. For several years, we've been working hard to reduce turnover. Having achieved solid gains in 2009, we took actions to maintain them. In Q4, we decided to make a $16 million discretionary contribution to the 401(k) accounts of our employees who are not eligible to participate in our incentive compensation plan. We also provided non-executive employees with merit increases above the rate of inflation. I mentioned these actions in order to point out that we've made investments in keeping our employee retention and satisfaction high.We also met our objectives with regard to pricing. The mix shift that occurred in 2009  made these pricing increases less obvious, but they are very real. Health insurers recognize the value in retaining access to the quality of care that Tenet hospitals are able to provide their members, and we've been able to negotiate appropriate pricing increases. So with cost and pricing being two parameters, more or less under our direct control, we met and significantly exceeded all our performance objectives in these areas.Turning to measures for which we have less direct control. We had a much better year with regard to bad-debt expense than anyone might have projected last January. The volume picture however, was mixed. We were very pleased with the 3.4% year-over-year growth in the same-hospital outpatient [indiscernible]. Because margins are generally higher on the outpatient side, this growth helped us expand overall margins.Same-hospital admissions were down 0.6% year-over-year, while total admissions were are up by 0.2%, basically flat. One area of disappointment in 2009 was Commercial admission, which declined for the year by 4.7%. We had anecdotal evidence that these declines are consistent with the commercial volume declines our affiliated physicians are experiencing. We hear from our health plan customers that they saw declines at similar rates. Continued weakness in the economy appears to be the main driver of this segment of the business. We have a broad group of initiatives to gain market share, but the environment for commercial admission is very tough. Unfortunately, the trend has not improved so far this year, with the year-over-year comparisons somewhat weaker than what we saw in Q4. It's pretty clear that we're off to a slow start for the year as far as volumes are concerned. Our outlook assumes overall volumes to be flat and commercial volumes down 3%.  The silver lining to the soft commercial volume story was we achieved very strong earnings improvement in 2009 in spite of it. The changes we made to our cost structure has enhanced the potential profitability and operating leverage of the company. For example, if we can generate even modest volume increases going forward, we believe we are well positioned to achieve significant growth in earnings and cash flow.Let me now turn to some high-level comments on our outlook for 2010. As you read in this morning's press release, we are projecting growth in adjusted EBITDA some place between flat and up 7%. I'd like to highlight a few of the assumptions driving these numbers.  First, in order to optimize the financial impact of the Health Information Technology provision in last year's stimulus bill, we expect to incur incremental clinical information technology expenses of about $40 million in 2010. As we've said in the past, we had already planned to make the investments but now to qualify in the government incentive payment, we will accelerate their implementation. The adverse impact of these expenditures on 2010 EBITDA is largely a timing issue. This is because there's an 18-month mismatch between the early expenses of the program and the revenue recognition that begins no later than early 2012.  P&L impact of this initiative is truly significant when we consider that it reduces our expected EBITDA growth rate by four percentage points. These expenses will improve an important part of our business and are designed to meaningfully enhance patient care and long-term profitability. People have more to say about this program and how it advances our Medicare Performance Initiative. All things considered, we see 2010 as a transition year. It will be a year of significant technology investment, potential risks from increasing bad debt, state Medicaid cuts and hopefully the tail end of the recession due to weakness in commercial volumes. Even after taking all the upside and downside risks into account, we expect to see profitability growth of up to 7% and expect to generate more than $100 million in adjusted free cash flow. In other words, our outlook for the free cash flow could well be positive in 2010, even including the burden of the cash outflow for our final DOJ payments.To summarize, I feel very good about the progress we made in 2009. We are heading into 2010 strongly positioned to deal with the challenges confronting the industry. Before I turn things over to Steve, let me tell you about some changes to our Investor Relations program this year. Instead of holding our annual investor Day in Dallas, we've decided to be more visible and accessible on the road. We intend to visit various cities in order to meet with more of you in person, and we plan to participate in a few more conferences than in prior years.  We've also decided to shorten our quarterly pre-announcement quiet [ph] period in order to accommodate more of your requests for meetings. I'll be anxious to get your feedback throughout the year as to whether this is a better approach. In the meantime, let me now turn things over to Steve Newman. Steve?"
107911,85037470,51207,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2010",2010-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch on four topics important to both short and long-term success: Our Medical Staff Development activities, our Health Information Technology initiatives, the status of our Medicare performance",1061,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch on four topics important to both short and long-term success: Our Medical Staff Development activities, our Health Information Technology initiatives, the status of our Medicare performance initiative and an update on our volume-building activities through innovations and marketing. We believe that the vast majority of new physicians joining our medical staffs are doing so as a result of our value proposition of having high-quality, efficiently operated inpatient and outpatient services. This value proposition is supplemented through the activities of our Med3000 Practice Resources joint venture, which I'll talk more about later. As I mentioned in our previous call, we have focused more effort on attracting high-quality, hard-working productive physicians, and assimilating them more effectively into our medical staffs and hospitals. As a result, we're seeing tangible benefits from our more focused efforts. Let's turn to review of the recent progress we've made in medical staff development. In 2009, we attracted 855 active staff physicians, net of attrition. 249 of these physicians, net of attrition, joined us in the fourth quarter. We accomplished this through a variety of means although the overwhelming focus was on the redirection of existing physicians. If necessary to meet demonstrated community need, we relocate certain physicians in a particular specialty, but relocations generally represent less than 10% of our growth in medical staff. Physician employment represents an even smaller share of our growth because we are utilizing this tactic very selectively.Due to our improved assimilation process and because of improvement of the facilities and services we provide to physicians, the class of 2009 is among the most productive classes we've ever assembled. While the class of '08 has been extremely productive, the class of '09 is already outperforming them on several measures, while maintaining a commitment to our quality standards. Compared to the class of '08, these new '09 physicians are averaging 46% more total admissions, 27% more commercial admissions and 32% more commercial outpatient visits.  This productivity data is based upon Q4 performance only and therefore, we expect even greater productivity gains from the class of '09 as their relatively young relationships mature over the next 12 months. We believe our improvements in quality efficiency service and other initiatives will strengthen our relationship with these and future physicians.Let's turn to a brief discussion on Health Information Technology or HIT. HIT is the glue that joins the existing strategies we've shared with you over the last three years. By the end of 2010, 19 of our hospitals will have begun installing advanced clinical systems. These activities will result in each hospital having a Computerized Physician Order Entry System, CPOE,  and an electronic health record at the completion of deployment. The implementation at each hospital is expected to take 16 to 21 months, depending upon its existing systems. It's the 16-to-21-month implementation period, which is the determinant of Trevor's earlier statement that we expect to earn the first of the incentive payments by early 2012. While this hospital-based program is proceeding, we will simultaneously deploy our physician office HIT  plan. This plan utilizes the resources of our joint venture, Med3000 Practice Resources. We will deploy a suite of products that includes an office-based electronic health record, a patient health record, E-prescribing technology and electronic data interchange capabilities for claim submissions. These new initiatives have been designed to dovetail smoothly with our existing systems. First, the Computerized Physician Order Entry System  will contain over 600 standardized order sets. A number of these sets were developed to execute our Medicare Performance Initiative. This CPOE will allow us to accelerate the standardization of care in our hospitals, both improving clinical outcomes and driving down variable cost at the bedside. Second, the broad implementation of HIT will eliminate redundancy and increase the efficiency of care. This brings with it staffing efficiencies and will accelerate our efforts to optimize labor and supply costs. These clinical systems also will provide us with improved patient safety and clinical outcomes, further advancing our long-standing commitment to quality. Finally, the HIT offering for physician practices will more tightly align our affiliated physicians with our hospitals. It's an effective sales tool for our physician relationship program representatives since our hospitals will be able to provide advanced IT systems to help physicians improve their practice efficiencies and obtain office-based financial incentives under the ARRA high-tech funding program.Next, I want to offer a couple of comments on Phase I of our Medicare Performance Initiative rollout. Our MPI teams are currently deployed in 16 hospitals. We expect to have completed Phase I of MPI at 42 hospitals by the end of December 2010 with all hospitals being completed by the end of Q1 2011. As you know, Phase I focuses on the development of a customized list, a five DRGs at each hospital, where we identify the largest opportunity to decrease variable cost, while improving clinical outcomes. It is important to remember that simultaneously, we have ongoing resource utilization initiatives such as medication use management and standardization programs in cardiac rhythm management devices and orthopedic and spinal implants.  We expect these combined programs to yield $28 million to $32 million of cost savings in 2010. Additionally, all of the savings from the progress made through these initiatives this year will not be fully visible until 2011, due to the timing of the rollout and the phase in adoption of the clinical delivery system changes. I continue to be excited about the prospects for MPI, and our early results strengthen my confidence.Finally, turning to volume growth, we remain excited about our many initiatives designed to capture incremental market share. I'm particularly enthusiastic about our business-to-business initiative in Texas and Florida, which take advantage of the employer channel to capture patients covered by commercial insurance. We also are enjoying increasing success in our direct-mail marketing initiatives, as we expand our use of variable dynamic printing to customize our mail drops. These programs are data intensive, and include active and precise monitoring of the reactions of patients we know are covered by commercial insurance. We are using more Internet marketing, and are employing search engine optimization strategies to target select and receptive populations focused on both wellness and specific disease management. These initiatives are all designed to gain market share. With that, let me now turn [Audio Gap]Chief Financial Officer, Biggs Porter. Biggs?"

As both Steve and Trevor discussed, despite the dramatic decline in discretionary consumer spending experienced in most sectors of the economy, Tenet's admission exhibited only modest decline, while outpatient",2048,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As both Steve and Trevor discussed, despite the dramatic decline in discretionary consumer spending experienced in most sectors of the economy, Tenet's admission exhibited only modest decline, while outpatient extended it's [indiscernible] vigorous growth, with an increase of 3.5% in the fourth quarter. Flu provided us with a modest boost to our volume statistics, but because of its low-margin value, contributed little incremental to the bottom line. Commercial volumes are weaker than expected in the fourth quarter with declines of 5.3% in commercial admissions and 3.9% in commercial outpatient visits. As our pricing remains strong, even these softer volumes resulted in solid same-hospital revenue growth of 3.5%. This pricing growth included a 2.8% increase in patient revenue from commercial managed care, demonstrating continued pricing growth given the context of declining commercial volumes.As most of you know, we do not disclose specific number for our commercial pricing increase, but I will note that our pricing increase in the fourth quarter was our strongest quarter in 2009. After making some minor tweaks to normalize our revenue reflecting prior-year cost of work [ph] adjustments and a favorable one-time item in 2008, revenue growth was an even stronger 3.7%. Cost control continues to contribute to wider margins. With controllable operating expense growing by just 2.7% and an even more restraining 2.5% on a per-adjusted-patient-day basis. Even these modest increases would've been still better and we not elected to make a discretionary increase in our 401(k) match to employees who are not eligible for incentive compensation. That added $16 million to SWB. Without this discretionary expense items, the increase in controllable cost for APD would have been 1.6%.  We will only make discretionary contributions such as this in the future if we have substantial increases in year-over-year profitability or if necessary to meet competitive pressures. Supply and expense increased by 1.9% for APD,  a larger increase than we've seen recently. This was driven by increased usage of high cost pharmaceuticals and Biologics, as well continued growth in the use of implantable devices. As growth in the usage of implantable devices is highly correlated with growth in higher-margin procedures, this growth of supply cost is not entirely unwelcome. Other operating expense increased by $11 million or 2.2% per APD. This increase was in part, due to lower cost allocations for information systems and business office cost of discontinued operations, which require the absorption of some of those cost by continuing operations. Malpractice expense declined by $4 million, continuing a favorable trend we've seen throughout 2009. We will continue to drive on this but for actual [ph] reason we don't forecast net reductions year-over-year in 2010, although, at a rising risk-free interest rate environment, it is possible.Bad debt expense rose by $12 million as the bad debt ratio increased by 30 basis points to 7.9%. This is another area where despite continuing employment weakness in many of our markets, we outperformed the earlier expectations. This increase was impacted by higher pricing, as well as a 240 basis point decline in our self-pay collection rate area during the course of the year. But was helped by decline in uninsured volumes. Sequentially however, our collection rate was substantially unchanged for the third quarter.Turning to cash and cash flow, we ended the year with $690 million in cash, a decline of $41 million from September 30, but somewhat higher than the $525 million to $660 million we had projected in our 2009 outlook. Among other items, our cash position was impacted by, higher-than-anticipated capital expenditures, which came in at $192 million, including an acceleration of HIT CapEx of $18 million and $58 million in an early tax payment otherwise scheduled for 2010, which will save us interest cost between now or what was otherwise a June projected payment date. We also saw a benefit of $25 million with another improvement in our accounts receivable. Day sales outstanding declined to 46 days  at year end, down from 47 days at September 30. Since we started the year at 50 days, this was a significant improvement during the course of the year.Let me now turn to our outlook for 2010. We've provided a fair amount of detail on our 2010 outlook in both our press release and slides we posted to the Tenet website this morning. The headline is we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $985 million to $1,050,000,000. This range includes at both ends, incremental HIT expense in 2010 of  approximately $40 million as I will discuss more in a moment.  Without that spending, our range for 2010  for adjusted EBITDA would have been $1,025,000,000 to $1,090,000,000. We have considered numerous variables, representing both risks and opportunities in setting the range of adjusted EBITDA. These include variables related to state funding and the continued unknowns related to the economy. In absolute terms, these variables create a potentially broader set of outcomes than what is expressed in our outlook range. We presume that neither anything bad nor anything good happens in setting the adjusted EBITDA range, but we have considered continued adverse mix shift away from commercial and higher bad debt expense in even the upper end of the range.  At the middle of the range, we would expect commercial inpatient volumes to be in the range of a negative 3% year-over-year in 2010, but still represents a recovery from the declines we've recently experiences. At the lower end of the range, all other things equal, could accommodate bigger commercial volume declines, increases in the uninsured, lower state funding and/or additional declines in the collectability of self-pay and balance after accounts. Our outlook assumes total admissions will be approximately flat to growth of plus or minus 50 basis points. We continue to remain cautious on the outlook for commercial volume growth and our outlook assumes it will be premature to expect the eventual recovery in commercial admissions to occur in 2010.Our assumptions are considerably more robust on the outpatient side, where we are assuming growth of 3% to 4% and significantly greater stability in terms of payer mix.We assume pricing increases of 2% to 3% in, in-patient revenue per admission and somewhat stronger 3% to 4% increase in outpatient revenue per visit, with the greater visibility of pricing growth on the outpatient side being helped by our assumption of stable payer mix on outpatient. These assumptions would afford us 2010 revenue growth of 4% to 6%, in line to modestly stronger than the same-hospital net revenue growth of 4.3% we recorded in 2009. As we disclosed on our third quarter 10-Q, we have a potential to receive as much as $60 million in annual revenues attributable to 2010 for the California provider fee legislation. This is one of the many variables we considered to setting our range. In fact, it could be a greater amount if retroactive treatment is being appropriated [ph] by CMS. Controllable operating expenses are assumed to grow by 4% to 6%. This growth was significantly impacted by $40 million in incremental expense for clinical information technology spending. This HIT spending is tied to our plans to comply with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act or ARRA and we expect this investment to qualify us for significant incentive payments, starting in either late 2011 or early 2012. As we said last fall, this spending is consistent with our existing plans to invest in HIT, but in order to qualify for as much as a thorough [ph] incentive payments by achieving meaningful use of milestones as we can achieve, we elected to accelerate that spending. We believe this increased spending on HIT should be considered as [indiscernible] non-recurring in its EBITDA effects in 2010 and 2011, as beginning in 2012 and in future years, we anticipate there will be incentive revenue and operational other benefits which will offset this incremental expense. Although we are very far along in our scheduling of the work, we will continue to work the schedule against the requirements as they evolve, so it is possible we will see further change, including in the timing of this expense. Without that $40 million in incremental accelerated HIT expense, the assumed 2010 outlook growth in controllable operating expenses will decline by a little over 50 basis points to 3.5% to 5.5%. Although we will continuously work on cost improvement and expect to yield on these efforts in 2010, including in our supplies and Medicare Performance Initiatives, the incremental savings from these in 2010 will be more modest than the approximately $188 million we achieved on our various initiatives in 2009. We assume bad debt expense to be in the range of 7.8% to 8.8% of net operating revenues. This would be a modest increase at the lower end of the range to a significant increase at the higher end, relative to the 7.7% recorded in 2009. But also note that this range encompasses the 8% total company bad debt ratio with which the ended the year. In terms of dollars, this would be an increase of roughly $30 million to $140 million relative to the $697 million of bad debt expense recorded in 2009.Turning to the outlook for cash. We provided the details on Slide 25 on the web. A few comments on the major items. We are looking for capital expenditures in the range of $475 million to $525 million, or $20 million to $70 million increase over the $455 million in CapEx in continuing operation in 2009. Included in this outlook is approximately $7 million in HIT CapEx, a $20 million increase over the aggregate $50 million HIT capital expenditures remaining in 2009. This HIT requirement is a principal reason for raising our CapEx outlook for 2010.Based on our above assumptions, we expect adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations in the range of $105 million to $125 million. I'll remind you that free cash flow in 2010 will include the final $17 million we will pay as a part of our government settlement. Retirement and obligation this year, clears the runway for increasing positive free cash flow in the future. These assumptions would result to the cash position at December 31, 2010 in the range of $630 million to $700 million. Question frequently arises as to what we believe we can achieve in EBITDA margin over time. In the near term, the effect of the economy on state funding, commercial volumes and account collectability continues to create an uncertain environment, making it difficult to create a timetable and slope for improvement. Over the intermediate to longer term, federal funding is also certain to contain pressures which you must offset through other efforts. The highest target we put out for ourselves when we first gave intermediate-term guidance a few years ago was 13%, but we also said that, that does not necessarily represent a ceiling. Irrespective of geographic and business mix considerations relative to our peers, we have excess capacity and a high fixed-cost base. Stabilizing commercial volumes as the economy improves, and achieving aggregate growth therefore, are one key to our continued margin improvements as we go forward. We also expect our MPI and other cost-control initiatives and increasing emphasis on higher-margin Outpatient business, organically or through continuous selective acquisitions to contribute measurably to EBITDA margin over the next two to three years. How fast these efforts fall to the bottom line will depend significantly on the externalities, I've already described.In summary, in 2009, we were able to accomplish the following key elements of performance. We constrained growth in bad debt expense, a strong outpatient volume growth which mitigated the revenue impact of softer commercial admissions, had solid revenue growth, excellent cost control and strong cash flow. We remain confident that our initiatives to drive revenue growth, reduce cost and drive increasingly positive bottom-line free cash flow will be successful. The ranges we've assumed in 2010 for pricing revenues and adjusted EBITDA allow for factors [ph] that are partially or totally out of our control, related to recession.  But having said that, the value of our initiatives were clearly demonstrated in 2009, creating a step function increase in our profitability and cash flow and providing strong foundation for future growth.With that, I'll ask the operator to open the floor for questions.

I think, that we continue to learn how to improve the efficacy of our physician relationship program. There are a couple of things we're doing to upscale that function and make it more effective in terms of capturing our target, which is more commercial managed care inpatient volume. Number one, we're arming those PRP reps with items that we say are in their goodie bag, which is the tools and techniques to help the physicians practice more efficiently and effectively. We mentioned earlier, the deployment of our office base HIT suite. That will once again attract, not only physicians affiliated with our hospitals today but those are not affiliated that have a high book of commercial managed care business today. I think the second thing we've learned is how to improve our targeting. It's fascinating that a significant amount of the value league is occurring in physicians that are not our most frequent admitters. Overtime, our referring physicians, especially our primary care physicians, don't come to the hospital as frequently as they used to. So in addition to deploying hospital list that are full-time within the facility to take those referrals, we have to strengthen our outreach to those doctors who we don't see walking around the hospitals very frequently. Additionally, we're improving the assimilation of those new to staff by introducing them to their referral sources. So I do believe that we have an opportunity to improve the output and efficacy of our physician relationship program, and we'll go after those value leagues that today are causing us to not have increase in commercial managed care admissions."

I think it just confuses the issue and makes for estimates versus guidance comparisons to be negative, which I don't think you need. The second thing is, I guess where I'm coming out on this quarter was, that the right read is I think you'll confirm, given the $16 million of discretionary payments that were certainly not expected in my model, that the earnings power of the company in the fourth quarter from an EBITDA perspective was much stronger than anticipated. And I guess we're all sitting here, with the stock down 9%, a little bit disappointed that the 2010 commentary sounds so funereal. Now let's all recognize -- recognizing that it's your job to be prudent and it's your job to be conservative, it's a little troubling to have the answer to the question, why are you assuming your cost going up 3% to 5%, or are you assuming a return to inflationary trends be positive when the articulation of where those pressures are hasn't been precise. So I would ask for better articulation of that. And then the second issue around that is, if you're rolling out Medicare performance initiative this year and you're not rolled out to all the hospitals, and your supply initiatives are only partially rolled out, the ones that go hand in glove with that. Aren't there additional cost in your numbers that would show up in the other operating expense related to the Medicare performance initiative that you haven't enumerated?"

So there are certainly going to be effects more broadly than just looking at supplies, which is something as typically been focused on when we talk about the MPI effort. Back to the broader question on inflationary pressures, we did give a relatively normal looking merit increase in the fourth quarter. We talked about that when we issued our third quarter outlook. So there's built in inflationary pressure on SWB from that action. And as Trevor mentioned, it was above what the rate of inflation has been. Union contracts also provide for some set increases which are not tied to inflationary measures. And so the SWB line is not going to move literally with inflation or the absence of it for 2010. On the supply side, certainly, we expect to be able to continue to drive down costs using MPI and our other initiatives. But when you look at it across the entirety of our costs, that $30 million that Steve mentioned that get somewhat muted by the numerator and denominator effect, besides the number [ph]."

And I guess, I'm a little bit concerned because I would think that the employment situation hasn't gotten that much better that your retention rates should still be strong and improving the programs you have on labor retention, and around reducing turnover, should be strong and improving. Your contract labor costs control should be strong and improving. Your other operating expenses I think have been historically low. Obviously, there are some twisting around of that because of a new IT initiative and some cost associated with that, which you've articulated in detail. But I can't help feeling, and I'd be okay with this, I mean it's your job to be conservative, but I can't help feeling that there's still a lot going on that would suggest separate and apart from labor where yes, calling that out is important. The other costs probably -- the pressure probably shouldn't be above an inflationary environment where we're not really in an inflation -- above an inflation rate where we're not really in an inflationary environment. So I'm a little -- I think I know the answer, which is that, this is your first look at 2010 guidance, and someone at some place told you to set it conservatively.

We drove, systematically, malpractice expense down during 2009, repeatedly making actuarial adjustments for favorable experience. At this point in time, we're not forecasting similar reductions to occur in 2010, so our guidance does not embed a continued reduction in malpractice. Having said that, we certainly have all of our efforts aimed in that direction, and that is one of the things that would influence the other cost category. And it's one area where we may prove to be conservative. Secondly, as I said, in an environment of rising risk-free, and in this case, discount rates, there also is a favorable impact on malpractice expense. It doesn't affect the cash piece of it, but it would affect the expense piece of it. We haven't presumed that into our forecast as well.

I think by focusing the PRP reps on those new recruits, as well as those that have not yet joined the staff, and then subdividing the ones that have joined by the ones that put a minority of their work at the hospital, will increase our yield in terms of total referred inpatient and outpatient volume, as well as commercial managed care. So we are learning. We have changed things as a result of the observations we shared with you in Q3 conference call, and I think we're making progress. Over time, I think the goal will be to actually add fewer physicians who each contribute more in terms of meaningful inpatient and outpatient volumes that meet our community need and prevent patients from having to out-migrate from our service area, so that for 2010, we'll probably target 800 to 900 active staff physicians net of attrition.

We've also been driving down the discharge, but not sent to payer time cycles. So we get bills out in the door faster. We get paid faster. That's been a systematic approach over the last year. We have routine so-called, cash is king calls, with all of our hospitals where we go over those kinds of metrics, talk about cycle times on the receivable side, also look at inventories, which isn't a part of your question, to measure there we're driving down those as well. So it's a very concerted effort between what happens within Conifer, what happens within our hospitals on everything associated with cycle time process, upfront collections, which have been driving down the receivables balances. And we obviously have been very successful. And one of the thing we're worried about, in 2009 in a recessionary environment, was that the fact that we'll go the other way, that we would have people paying us more slowly. And to the extent that has happened, it's been offset, as if by the increasing point of service collections. If you look to 2010, we're not projecting in our guidance that we continue to decline days and receivables, but there is certainly something that we're going to go try to accomplish as we continue to refine the process and reduce cycle times."

I'm not reading your early notes this morning and some others if there's some questions or interpretational issues as to what we've actually reflected in outlook for that. So if you will, I'll take this as an opportunity to clarify. The release said that we had $35 million of state cuts outside of California, which are partially offset by the receipt of up to $60 million of the California provider fee. The California provider fee is one of many risks and opportunities included to say in the range. So we look at every risk, every opportunity. We look at the probability of its occurrence as a basis for determining what kind of a range of outcomes we should expect for the year. So in this case, effectively what's included in the range for the California provider fee or for other things beginning with [ph] risks and opportunities are factored numbers. So if I was doing a walk forward to the middle of our range, I would use $30 million as the amount to include for the California provider fee. So not the full amount but a factored amount. And you get there by your saying it was approved prospectively or it's a probabilistic outcome along with the others considered in setting the range. So if not, I think appropriate people can conclude that we've put $60 million into all levels of the range for the California provider fee, and that our outlook is conditional upon $60 million. The bottom line of all that is that, when and if the provider fee is approved, which I said, might not be towards -- or the middle of the year, we would not want analysts to immediately add the gross value of that fee to our outlook range. We'll need to reassess the range against all our areas of performance, all the risks and opportunities, cost, revenue, volume or otherwise, in assessing how that  provider fee would affect the range, if we'd move it up or down or what."

As you've already noticed, we shorted our earnings release significantly. Our intention is to narrow the focus to the key items driving our performance in the quarter. Let me assure all of you, we value the extent of our disclosures, that we're still completely committed to transparency. All of the information you're used to seeing in our earnings release is still in our 10-Q. 
We're also going to streamline this call. Biggs and I will be the only speakers making prepared remarks, but Steve Newman and others are here to answer questions. We've cut the length of our remarks to 10 minutes, so that we'll have plenty of time for Q&A and can still finish the call within one hour. So in the spirit of being concise, let me jump right into a discussion of our results. 
I'm very pleased with our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter, which grew more than 7% over last year's first quarter and reached a margin of 12.7%, our highest quarterly margin in seven years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was greater than in any first quarters in 2003, and we achieved it with half the number of hospitals we had then. On the basis of the strong start to the year, we are confirming our existing full year outlook for adjusted EBITDA in a range of $985 million to $1,050,000,000. 
While we achieved our earnings objective for the quarter, volumes were soft, but our performance was excellent in the other key economic drivers of acuity, pricing and cost control. Our proven ability to control cost has significant positive implications for our longer-term operating leverage. Once we achieve a meaningful and sustained recovery in volumes, we now had to turn the resulting revenue growth into attractive growth on the bottom line.  This quarter, for example, we took a decline of 2% in admissions, turned it into 3.4% growth in revenues and into more than double that rate of growth in EBITDA. We should be able to do better than that with some volume growth. 
While volumes for the first quarter were disappointing, the month-by-month trajectory of volumes was encouraging. To be specific, January and February were weak but the trend was better in March. On the outpatient side, the year-over-year growth rates in March were more than 500 basis points stronger than February, indicating one of the strongest snap backs we've ever seen. 
The trend in admissions through the first 28 days in April was similar to March, although commercial is trending a bit stronger and outpatient visits are trending a bit weaker. This shows the kind of short-term volatility in patient volumes that we've talked about on prior calls.
Other companies have mentioned that bad weather, lack of flu, declining birthrates and bad economic conditions depressed volumes. And although we agree that they had an effect, it's difficult to quantify precisely. 
Our admissions through the emergency department continue to achieve positive year-over-year growth in the quarter. This indicates that our soft volumes are primarily limited to our Elective business. This should not surprising as elective procedures are most directly impacted by a slow economy.
Strong growth in revenues per unit continues to make a significant contribution to our earnings momentum. In patient revenue per admission ran 160 basis points stronger than the midpoint of our outlook assumption, and the favorable variance was more than 400 basis points on the outpatient side. Our pricing was enhanced by higher acuity, particularly in our commercial business. And given that 80% of our contract volume is negotiated for 2010 and more than 60% for 2011, we are confident this strength will continue to help drive our earnings growth.
As I mentioned earlier, cost control was once against stellar in the quarter. Total controllable costs increased by only 1.3%. Now practice expense continue to decline, and we even picked up $2 million in savings in the quarter from reduced rent at our new corporate headquarters. 
Bad debt expense increased in the quarter, but the fully allocated cost of providing uncompensated care, that is care to both uninsured and charity patients, increased by only $6 million from last year's first quarter. This is far smaller than the $33 million increase in bad debt expense year-over-year. The tangible EBITDA impact, of course, is strictly limited to the cost of care as opposed to the largely offsetting movements in revenue and bad debt line items.
These numerous factors all helped us improve adjusted free cash flow in the quarter by $33 million compared to last year's first quarter. The first quarter is always the lowest in terms of adjusted free cash flow due to the timing of certain annual cash payments but clearly, it is trending in the right direction. 
To summarize, I'm pleased with our response to the continued weak economy and soft-volume environment in the quarter. When confronted by this extraordinary challenges, our hospital management teams responded quickly and effectively to maintain our positive earnings trajectory. Now with the resumption of volume growth, I'm confident we can generate some truly outstanding bottom line performance. 
Let me turn things over to Biggs who will share some commentary on our outlook. And then, open up the call to Q&A. Biggs?"
107911,100324930,59497,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. I will limit my introductory comments this morning to the refinements we are making to our outlook for 2010. Our most important comment is that we are confirming the outlook range for adjusted EBITDA for 2010",905,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. I will limit my introductory comments this morning to the refinements we are making to our outlook for 2010. Our most important comment is that we are confirming the outlook range for adjusted EBITDA for 2010. Earlier in the year, we set our outlook range of $985 million to $1,050,000,000. That range continues to appear very realistic to us. 
The summary of our refinements to our outlook assumptions is provided on Slide 6 on the web. On that slide, you'll see that softer volumes in our first quarter have caused us to re-evaluate our volume outlook for the year. Our outlook for admissions growth has been reduced by 100 basis points. We're now assuming admissions will decline 50 to 150 basis points in 2010 as contrasted with our initial assumption of approximately flat admissions for the year. 
Because our initial assumption for 2010 growth in outpatient visits was significantly stronger, we reduced the outlook on the outpatient side by a more significant 200 basis points. Having said that, much of the volume declines in the first quarter relative to last year and correspondingly the variance in our expectation for the year is in lower acuity conditions. So the revenue and EBITDA effects are not as significant. 
Accordingly, pricing on a per patient basis is favorably impacted by this patient mix shift to higher acuity. We're now significantly more positive on the growth we assume can be achieved in unit revenues. Our assumption for growth in inpatient revenue per admission is now more bullish 300 to 400 basis points, representing an enhancement to our initial growth assumption of 100 basis points. We are making similar 100 basis point refinement to our assumed growth in outpatient revenue per visit to a new range of 400 to 500 basis points.
These enhanced assumptions for pricing significantly mitigate the adverse impact on assumed 2010 revenues. We believe only a $50 million decrease and assume 2010 revenues would be necessary to reflect lower volume projection. We believe this modest reduction in our revenue outlook can be offset by an equal, if not greater reduction in our outlook for 2010 controllable costs.
About half of these savings are directly linked to the revised volume projection, and the remaining related to enhanced assumptions regarding incremental cost efficiencies. These efficiencies include the improvements in productivity, malpractice and other controllable expenses we benefited from in the quarter. 
Before leaving our cost assumptions, let me remind you, again, that we've included a $40 million in assumed incremental cost in our 2010 outlook to cover the impact of our accelerated HIT program. As we proceed with the implementation, we continue to look for opportunities to reduce the 2010 expense. But at this time, we're going to remain conservative with respect to this $40 million estimate. This program continues to be implemented on schedule, and we expect to begin generating some offsetting revenues as early as late next year and to be completely offsetting in this incremental expense by revenues and operating benefits beginning in 2012.  The increase in bad debt expense we experienced in the first quarter is fully consistent with our prior outlook, which therefore remains unchanged. 
We had no cause, at this point, to change any of the other assumptions embedded in our outlook. In particular, there is nothing incremental to report on the California provider fee, although investors should be aware that this is only $30 million in the middle of our range, and there is considerable upside to that number.
As these assumptions for softer volumes offset by higher acuity, per unit revenue and cost reductions are worked through our models. The result is confirmation of our pre-existing 2010 range for adjusted EBITDA. With no change to our EBITDA outlook, there is no change to our GAAP earnings, although we've made certain adjustments to our share count, in part reflecting changes in our share price.
We've also added an outlook line item for EPS reflecting tax expense without any pro forma normalization for changes in our NOL valuation allowance. Book tax expense could, in fact, become significantly favorable this year should we qualify for the recognition in the tax provision of some or all of the $1 billion benefit of our NOL carry forward and other deferred tax benefits prior to year-end 2010. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, this recognition occurs when the company has demonstrated that there is a reasonable expectation of future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefit of the NOL. Due to our demonstrated improved performance, we are approaching that point in time and will continue to assess this quarterly.
In summary, we remain confident that our initiatives to drive revenue growth, control costs and drive increasingly positive bottom line profitability and free cash flow will be successful. The ranges we have assumed in 2010 for pricing, revenues and adjusted EBITDA allow for effects, either partially or totally out of our control, related to the recession. We believe the recent pattern of volume declines will improve and on an intraperiod basis, these trends are improving. 
Looking past 2010, I will also reiterate that as the economy improve, we believe we will see improvement in commercial volumes and bad debt expense and believe we will also benefit from our initiatives to grow outpatient volumes organically and through selective acquisitions. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the floor for questions. Operator?"

About 70% of the total was hospital-based imaging being declined for the quarter, also with outpatient laboratory testing contributed to that. It's only isolated to two sites in California. And to some extent, also compromised in Texas with respect to outpatient. That may sound odd since Texas is part of the central region. But in those two sites in California, physician IPA-owned facilities opened, which took imaging and laboratory testing out of the hospitals. And we have a unique situation in Texas where freestanding emergency rooms were approved by legislature. That then pulled some visits out of our hospitals, especially in Houston and Dallas. So central was stronger in aggregate, but those two issues really aggregated to keep our outpatient visits negative. And when you consider the lack of flu-types syndromes that we saw last year in our ERs, which we didn't see this year, I think our aggregate performance down 0.6% and emergency visits really was quite minimal."

So by example, if you have more surgeries, it does proportionally change your patient days but it may change your supply more significantly. So you really have to dig in and understand on a specific basis what's happening in the business, now that supplies are performing against that. So admittedly, it's hards for you all to do it, totally from the outside looking in. So for the year, we certainly still believe we're going to get yield from all of our supplies initiatives, including MPI, nothing has changed there.

We're doing a number of things in MPI to continue to drive our supply cost down. The impact from MPI is both short-term and long-term. We're able to certainly continue our efforts to drive down individual unit pricing. In terms of implants, we just had a concession on our cardiacs stent implants with another 10% drop. That, combined with more appropriate utilization, is going to continue to drive down our supply cost in cardiac interventions.

We had 30 physicians in attendance. Our Corporate Chief Medical Officer was there as well as our Regional Chief Medical Officer. And I think as the environment changes, as healthcare reform moves forward, as physicians understand their performance, both in their office as well as in-hospitals and outpatient facilities, is being measured by both commercial and governmental payers, with the potential for their pro fees to be affected, they are coming on board with the idea they should participate us.

And even seemingly little things, I threw out that little factoid about the savings in rent on our headquarters move. But basically, every decision we make is made with the cost imperative in mind. So I would say that for some time, we've been operating in more of a stable environment. Clearly, volume remains our number one challenge. A few weeks ago, we had our 350 top hospitals and corporate managers here in Dallas for a conference, that was basically the entire topic. So the initiatives we have on volume, the initiatives we have around recruiting physicians, the MPI initiative, which is very directly focused on cost and quality and improving that, those are the engines that we are counting on to continue to drive improvements in the economics. And I think we're approaching a level where although our margins are still low relative to the industry peers, they're not orders of magnitude low like they were and we are within reach continuing to improve the levels that we can be proud of."

But having said that, your question is still a good one. I do think we're conservative with respect to cost performance otherwise. Malpractice expense, very low in the first quarter. We find that very challenging to forecast and won't give line item guidance. But in a nutshell, we presume the remainder of the year that it goes back up from this first quarter level to stay conservative along that point, and it's quite possible that we will be better than that. As I mentioned before just besides our efforts to control malpractice expense, the fact that there will be likely increasing discount rates into the future will cost that expense to be lower. But at this point in time, that's a difficult thing to forecast just like the economy, so we have left it at a conservative point. Same with our overall cost performance, I think, that we had a very good first quarter. Everything worked well even in a period where we had declining volumes. I think that we haven't fully extended that level of performance out for the remainder of the year to stay conservative as we watch the economy, but once again, we will see how that unfolds. In balance, as I said, we think that our outlook, we're very comfortable with it. I think that we're conservative on the cost, as I said. On the volume side, we still have some improvement to accomplish, so we've decided to leave it alone in the aggregate as far as the overall EBITDA outlook looks.

As you've already noticed, we shorted our earnings release significantly. Our intention is to narrow the focus to the key items driving our performance in the quarter. Let me assure all of you, we value the extent of our disclosures, that we're still completely committed to transparency. All of the information you're used to seeing in our earnings release is still in our 10-Q. 
We're also going to streamline this call. Biggs and I will be the only speakers making prepared remarks, but Steve Newman and others are here to answer questions. We've cut the length of our remarks to 10 minutes, so that we'll have plenty of time for Q&A and can still finish the call within one hour. So in the spirit of being concise, let me jump right into a discussion of our results. 
I'm very pleased with our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter, which grew more than 7% over last year's first quarter and reached a margin of 12.7%, our highest quarterly margin in seven years. Our adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was greater than in any first quarters in 2003, and we achieved it with half the number of hospitals we had then. On the basis of the strong start to the year, we are confirming our existing full year outlook for adjusted EBITDA in a range of $985 million to $1,050,000,000. 
While we achieved our earnings objective for the quarter, volumes were soft, but our performance was excellent in the other key economic drivers of acuity, pricing and cost control. Our proven ability to control cost has significant positive implications for our longer-term operating leverage. Once we achieve a meaningful and sustained recovery in volumes, we now had to turn the resulting revenue growth into attractive growth on the bottom line.  This quarter, for example, we took a decline of 2% in admissions, turned it into 3.4% growth in revenues and into more than double that rate of growth in EBITDA. We should be able to do better than that with some volume growth. 
While volumes for the first quarter were disappointing, the month-by-month trajectory of volumes was encouraging. To be specific, January and February were weak but the trend was better in March. On the outpatient side, the year-over-year growth rates in March were more than 500 basis points stronger than February, indicating one of the strongest snap backs we've ever seen. 
The trend in admissions through the first 28 days in April was similar to March, although commercial is trending a bit stronger and outpatient visits are trending a bit weaker. This shows the kind of short-term volatility in patient volumes that we've talked about on prior calls.
Other companies have mentioned that bad weather, lack of flu, declining birthrates and bad economic conditions depressed volumes. And although we agree that they had an effect, it's difficult to quantify precisely. 
Our admissions through the emergency department continue to achieve positive year-over-year growth in the quarter. This indicates that our soft volumes are primarily limited to our Elective business. This should not surprising as elective procedures are most directly impacted by a slow economy.
Strong growth in revenues per unit continues to make a significant contribution to our earnings momentum. In patient revenue per admission ran 160 basis points stronger than the midpoint of our outlook assumption, and the favorable variance was more than 400 basis points on the outpatient side. Our pricing was enhanced by higher acuity, particularly in our commercial business. And given that 80% of our contract volume is negotiated for 2010 and more than 60% for 2011, we are confident this strength will continue to help drive our earnings growth.
As I mentioned earlier, cost control was once against stellar in the quarter. Total controllable costs increased by only 1.3%. Now practice expense continue to decline, and we even picked up $2 million in savings in the quarter from reduced rent at our new corporate headquarters. 
Bad debt expense increased in the quarter, but the fully allocated cost of providing uncompensated care, that is care to both uninsured and charity patients, increased by only $6 million from last year's first quarter. This is far smaller than the $33 million increase in bad debt expense year-over-year. The tangible EBITDA impact, of course, is strictly limited to the cost of care as opposed to the largely offsetting movements in revenue and bad debt line items.
These numerous factors all helped us improve adjusted free cash flow in the quarter by $33 million compared to last year's first quarter. The first quarter is always the lowest in terms of adjusted free cash flow due to the timing of certain annual cash payments but clearly, it is trending in the right direction. 
To summarize, I'm pleased with our response to the continued weak economy and soft-volume environment in the quarter. When confronted by this extraordinary challenges, our hospital management teams responded quickly and effectively to maintain our positive earnings trajectory. Now with the resumption of volume growth, I'm confident we can generate some truly outstanding bottom line performance. 
Let me turn things over to Biggs who will share some commentary on our outlook. And then, open up the call to Q&A. Biggs?

That range continues to appear very realistic to us. 
The summary of our refinements to our outlook assumptions is provided on Slide 6 on the web. On that slide, you'll see that softer volumes in our first quarter have caused us to re-evaluate our volume outlook for the year. Our outlook for admissions growth has been reduced by 100 basis points. We're now assuming admissions will decline 50 to 150 basis points in 2010 as contrasted with our initial assumption of approximately flat admissions for the year. 
Because our initial assumption for 2010 growth in outpatient visits was significantly stronger, we reduced the outlook on the outpatient side by a more significant 200 basis points. Having said that, much of the volume declines in the first quarter relative to last year and correspondingly the variance in our expectation for the year is in lower acuity conditions. So the revenue and EBITDA effects are not as significant. 
Accordingly, pricing on a per patient basis is favorably impacted by this patient mix shift to higher acuity. We're now significantly more positive on the growth we assume can be achieved in unit revenues. Our assumption for growth in inpatient revenue per admission is now more bullish 300 to 400 basis points, representing an enhancement to our initial growth assumption of 100 basis points. We are making similar 100 basis point refinement to our assumed growth in outpatient revenue per visit to a new range of 400 to 500 basis points.
These enhanced assumptions for pricing significantly mitigate the adverse impact on assumed 2010 revenues. We believe only a $50 million decrease and assume 2010 revenues would be necessary to reflect lower volume projection. We believe this modest reduction in our revenue outlook can be offset by an equal, if not greater reduction in our outlook for 2010 controllable costs.
About half of these savings are directly linked to the revised volume projection, and the remaining related to enhanced assumptions regarding incremental cost efficiencies. These efficiencies include the improvements in productivity, malpractice and other controllable expenses we benefited from in the quarter. 
Before leaving our cost assumptions, let me remind you, again, that we've included a $40 million in assumed incremental cost in our 2010 outlook to cover the impact of our accelerated HIT program. As we proceed with the implementation, we continue to look for opportunities to reduce the 2010 expense. But at this time, we're going to remain conservative with respect to this $40 million estimate. This program continues to be implemented on schedule, and we expect to begin generating some offsetting revenues as early as late next year and to be completely offsetting in this incremental expense by revenues and operating benefits beginning in 2012.  The increase in bad debt expense we experienced in the first quarter is fully consistent with our prior outlook, which therefore remains unchanged. 
We had no cause, at this point, to change any of the other assumptions embedded in our outlook. In particular, there is nothing incremental to report on the California provider fee, although investors should be aware that this is only $30 million in the middle of our range, and there is considerable upside to that number.
As these assumptions for softer volumes offset by higher acuity, per unit revenue and cost reductions are worked through our models. The result is confirmation of our pre-existing 2010 range for adjusted EBITDA. With no change to our EBITDA outlook, there is no change to our GAAP earnings, although we've made certain adjustments to our share count, in part reflecting changes in our share price.
We've also added an outlook line item for EPS reflecting tax expense without any pro forma normalization for changes in our NOL valuation allowance. Book tax expense could, in fact, become significantly favorable this year should we qualify for the recognition in the tax provision of some or all of the $1 billion benefit of our NOL carry forward and other deferred tax benefits prior to year-end 2010. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, this recognition occurs when the company has demonstrated that there is a reasonable expectation of future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefit of the NOL. Due to our demonstrated improved performance, we are approaching that point in time and will continue to assess this quarterly.
In summary, we remain confident that our initiatives to drive revenue growth, control costs and drive increasingly positive bottom line profitability and free cash flow will be successful. The ranges we have assumed in 2010 for pricing, revenues and adjusted EBITDA allow for effects, either partially or totally out of our control, related to the recession. We believe the recent pattern of volume declines will improve and on an intraperiod basis, these trends are improving. 
Looking past 2010, I will also reiterate that as the economy improve, we believe we will see improvement in commercial volumes and bad debt expense and believe we will also benefit from our initiatives to grow outpatient volumes organically and through selective acquisitions. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the floor for questions. Operator?

I want to give you some additional color about outpatient visits and variation by region. Certainly, our outpatient declines across the company were largely related to imaging declines. About 70% of the total was hospital-based imaging being declined for the quarter, also with outpatient laboratory testing contributed to that. It's only isolated to two sites in California. And to some extent, also compromised in Texas with respect to outpatient. That may sound odd since Texas is part of the central region. But in those two sites in California, physician IPA-owned facilities opened, which took imaging and laboratory testing out of the hospitals. And we have a unique situation in Texas where freestanding emergency rooms were approved by legislature. That then pulled some visits out of our hospitals, especially in Houston and Dallas. So central was stronger in aggregate, but those two issues really aggregated to keep our outpatient visits negative. And when you consider the lack of flu-types syndromes that we saw last year in our ERs, which we didn't see this year, I think our aggregate performance down 0.6% and emergency visits really was quite minimal.

Others, as we flow-through, take more time to develop. So it's both short- and longer-term cost savings in the supply area. Also, I should mention that we're working continuously on length of stay and driving down other variable costs, other than the supply cost, through the Medicare performance initiative.

But what I'm more interested in is, we saw, despite a significant increase in acuity that drove really, I think, perhaps even record rates of growth on outpatient revenue per visit, as well as strong growth on net revenue per adjusted admission. Despite that higher acuity, we saw a reduction in the average length of stay. Now that to me is fascinating. Is this proof of Medicare performance initiative beginning to take root? That's part one of the question.

And it is particularly noteworthy that the length of stay was down in the quarter, because our OB deliveries were down 4% or over 730 deliveries. Those, as you know, have a length of stay of between one and two days and tend to pull down the overall length of stay. So with the absence of those, you would have expected our length of stay to creep up. So I do think the effort that we're putting into the Medicare performance initiative and the rollout of our case management program aggressively to each hospital has made a difference in the length of stay, which then will affect our variable costs and our profitability for inpatient stay.

Back to the issue of physicians, we continue to find physicians interested in learning more about the Medicare performance initiative. We kicked off MPI at one of our Houston hospitals yesterday. We had 30 physicians in attendance. Our Corporate Chief Medical Officer was there as well as our Regional Chief Medical Officer. And I think as the environment changes, as healthcare reform moves forward, as physicians understand their performance, both in their office as well as in-hospitals and outpatient facilities, is being measured by both commercial and governmental payers, with the potential for their pro fees to be affected, they are coming on board with the idea they should participate us. So I do believe that the embracing of MPI by physicians is increasing with time.

I think we clearly put all of the clean up and all of the legacy issues behind us. And so we're just really operating the company in a way where we're focused on the basics of building volume, making sure that the pricing increases we are able to get are fair and appropriate and controlling cost. And driving cash through a variety of initiatives, we don't necessarily talk about it on this call, but we've done very well in bringing working capital out of the business. And even seemingly little things, I threw out that little factoid about the savings in rent on our headquarters move. But basically, every decision we make is made with the cost imperative in mind. So I would say that for some time, we've been operating in more of a stable environment. Clearly, volume remains our number one challenge. A few weeks ago, we had our 350 top hospitals and corporate managers here in Dallas for a conference, that was basically the entire topic. So the initiatives we have on volume, the initiatives we have around recruiting physicians, the MPI initiative, which is very directly focused on cost and quality and improving that, those are the engines that we are counting on to continue to drive improvements in the economics. And I think we're approaching a level where although our margins are still low relative to the industry peers, they're not orders of magnitude low like they were and we are within reach continuing to improve the levels that we can be proud of.

But having said that, your question is still a good one. I do think we're conservative with respect to cost performance otherwise. Malpractice expense, very low in the first quarter. We find that very challenging to forecast and won't give line item guidance. But in a nutshell, we presume the remainder of the year that it goes back up from this first quarter level to stay conservative along that point, and it's quite possible that we will be better than that. As I mentioned before just besides our efforts to control malpractice expense, the fact that there will be likely increasing discount rates into the future will cost that expense to be lower. But at this point in time, that's a difficult thing to forecast just like the economy, so we have left it at a conservative point. Same with our overall cost performance, I think, that we had a very good first quarter. Everything worked well even in a period where we had declining volumes. I think that we haven't fully extended that level of performance out for the remainder of the year to stay conservative as we watch the economy, but once again, we will see how that unfolds. In balance, as I said, we think that our outlook, we're very comfortable with it. I think that we're conservative on the cost, as I said. On the volume side, we still have some improvement to accomplish, so we've decided to leave it alone in the aggregate as far as the overall EBITDA outlook looks. But you're right to look at the cost and say, ""Gee, it appears conservative.""

I'm very pleased with our solid performance in the second quarter. We generated $268 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing 9% growth over 2009 and a margin of 11.6%. We are in the midst of generating one of t",1178,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our solid performance in the second quarter. We generated $268 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing 9% growth over 2009 and a margin of 11.6%. We are in the midst of generating one of the strongest earnings trajectories in our recent history, and we faced a difficult comparison versus the second quarter of 2009, when EBITDA was up more than 50%. The 11.6% margin was the highest margin for a second quarter in the last seven years, and we achieved it in a difficult volume environment. 
The in-patient admissions picture was virtually identical to our first quarter, although there was a little more strength in our outpatient business in the second quarter relative to the first. When we released interim second quarter volumes on June 14, the volume picture for the quarter was stronger. Unfortunately, the final few weeks of June and all of July were soft, so we're off to a slow start for volumes in the third quarter. We also started the third quarter with a difficult comparison. Last year at this time, we were off to a strong start for Q3, with positive admissions growth in July.
Turning back to the second quarter, total admissions were down 2%. But that's before you take into account a decline in both flu and OB/GYN-related cases. Had it not been for these two categories, total admissions for the quarter would have been down less than 1%. But we are most disappointed by the 7.2% decline in commercial admissions and the 5.4% decline in commercial outpatient visits. 
Providing context for our commercial volumes relative to the industry continues to be difficult. There is really only one data point so far for the second quarter, namely HCA's negative 5.3% statistic for what they termed ""Managed Care and Other."" Our comparable statistic would have been negative 6.2%. 
While commercial volumes are a part of our story, they are not the whole story. I hope you noticed that our commercial revenues grew by 2%. So clearly, something is helping us mitigate these volume declines. Here's some insight into what's going on beneath the surface of our commercial volume trends.
First, there was a significant pickup in our commercial case mix index which increased 2.8%. Over a third of our decline in commercial admissions was OB/GYN-related. As many of you have written about the decline in U.S. birth rate, it's probably no surprise that the reduction in deliveries explains nearly 20% of our decline in commercial admissions in the second quarter. 
In addition, we had a favorable shift within the mix of our commercial payers from lower-paying to higher-paying health plans. The impact of these two factors, when combined with continuing increases in commercial pricing, resulted in commercial revenue growth of 2%. At the end of the day, it's this revenue growth and solid cost control which drove our 9% growth in EBITDA. 
Also, I don't want to overlook some areas of strength in the overall volume picture. Our outpatient business appears to be picking up after a weaker start to the year. Second quarter aggregate outpatient visits declined by less than 1%, while we saw positive growth in government outpatient of 2%.
Our admissions through the emergency department were equal to last year's statistic. This is further evidence that elective procedures are most directly impacted by a slow economy. And to complete the volume story, note that total government admissions were flat, and adjusted admissions declined by just 0.6%. 
We continue to show strong numbers in the area of cost control and rates. And importantly, the delta between these two variables continues to expand. Inpatient net revenue per admission and outpatient net revenue per visit grew by 4.6% and 5.3% respectively, significantly outpacing a 3.8% growth in controllable costs per adjusted patient day.
Collectively, these factors helped us to generate adjusted free cash flow of $121 million in Q2, bringing free cash flow for the first half to positive $21 million. That's a $23 million improvement on a year-to-date basis from last year and a significant achievement given the large cash consumption that's typical for our first quarter.
Speaking of cash, excluding cash and insurance subsidiaries, we had a corporate cash balance of $600 million at the end of Q2. Taking only into account capital expenditures, July repurchases of $40 million of debt and our planned investment in outpatient centers through the remainder of the year, our year-end outlook for corporate cash is $500 million to $575 million. Based on the improvement in our performance over the last several years and our credit line availability, we believe this amount of cash exceeds our liquidity requirements, even after considering the normal first quarter seasonal usage. Our liquidity will be even greater if we received the full California provider fee and complete the sale of some of our medical office buildings.
I want to spend a moment on two actions that will improve our financial flexibility. First, in order to improve cash flow and manage our debt maturities, today, we launched the refinancing of a portion of our $1 billion of 2013 debt. If we successfully complete this transaction as contemplated, our debt will drop by another $200 million to roughly $4.0 billion, our annual cash flow will improve by $11 million and our next significant maturity of debt will not occur until 2015.
Second, we are now beginning to negotiate a new credit line. Because our credit line is used to support letters of credit, which expire next year, it makes sense to replace that line in the third quarter of this year. Today, our facility is $800 million in size and after taking into account outstanding letters of credit and other limitations, we have undrawn capacity of approximately $500 million. 
We will seek to maintain a facility of $800 million with a five-year term. We also believe that based on our improved financial condition and the current bank market, we will be able to improve our capital allocation options, including lifting an existing limitation on stock repurchases. We think the combination of these actions, namely retiring $240 million of debt, extending $600 million of 2013 debt to 2020 and arranging a new credit line, will enable us to maintain an appropriately prudent capital structure and liquidity posture while adding new flexibility.
Please keep in mind that any further decisions to make investments in our business, make acquisitions, retire debt or repurchase stock, are conditional upon our outlook, as well as the opportunities and market conditions at the time. So I can't project a future capital deployment strategy with greater precision today. 
To summarize, I'm pleased with our effective response to the continued weak economy and soft volume environment in the first half. When confronted by these extraordinary challenges, our management teams responded quickly to maintain our positive earnings trajectory. And once we generate volume growth, I'm confident that we can achieve some truly outstanding bottom line performance. Let me now turn the floor over to Biggs Porter, our Chief Financial Officer. Biggs?"
107911,109241320,71637,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. As Trevor said, we are very pleased with our EBITDA and cash flow results for the quarter. There were two items we've pointed out in the release which could be characterized as non-recurring but they were ide",879,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. As Trevor said, we are very pleased with our EBITDA and cash flow results for the quarter. There were two items we've pointed out in the release which could be characterized as non-recurring but they were identical in size and therefore, fully offsetting.
The two items are a favorable Medicare bad debt settlement, offset by a reduction in revenue related to the Supplemental Security Income adjustment to Medicare reimbursement. I'll otherwise now give a little color on the other value drivers. 
First, as Trevor said on pricing, growth in per-unit revenues continues to make a solid contribution of profitability. We also have good visibility into future years' pricing. At this point, approximately 95% of our commercial contracting is complete for 2010, 75% for 2011 and 35% for 2012.
Attributable costs again reflect good cost discipline with an increase of 3.8% for adjusted patient day. Salaries, wages and benefits was well controlled with an increase of 3.4% also on a PAPD basis, demonstrating our ability to effectively flex our staffing in response to fluctuating volumes. 
Supply costs increased just 1.2% per adjusted patient day relative to last year's second quarter. The one area showing cost pressure is other controllable costs, which were up 6.8% per adjusted patient day. There were increases in various elements of costs, some of which are non-recurring by nature, including a contractual settlement on a lease, a credit in the prior year's results, provider taxes and IT maintenance costs.
Malpractice expense declined by $2 million or 7% relative to last year but increased by $14 million over the first quarter. Malpractice was negatively affected by a decrease in the discount rate and some individual claim adjustments. Otherwise, it would have been substantially less. If discount rates are stable or increase and we don't have the unusually large specific claim adjustments, there's opportunity for malpractice to decline in future quarters. However, since forecasting a malpractice expense is challenging, our outlook has been left conservative.
Our bad debt ratio was flat relative to last year at 7.5% but there were a number of moving pieces which contributed to that result. Reported bad debt for the quarter included the benefit of a $28 million favorable adjustment for Medicare bad debts. In a related item, we also recorded unfavorable contractual adjustments for Medicare of $8 million. Netting the $8 million from the $28 million results in a favorable $20 million. This $20 million offsets the unfavorable SSI adjustment of the same magnitude referred to earlier. We also expect any recurring effects from these items to offset. 
The sum of uninsured maturity admissions declined by 2.2% in the quarter. This decline helped control the costs of providing uncompensated care to an increase of only $5 million in the quarter. 
On a totally separate subject, there has been some positive movement on CMS's response to the California provider fee legislation. There have been comments received from CMS, which have prompted an adjustment to the program but moved it much closer to approval. At this time, we expect the benefit we will receive this year to be $70 million, $30 million of which would be applicable to 2009. Having said that, we are leaving the $30 million contribution in the middle of our 2010 outlook range unchanged until the program passes the last step of formal CMS approval.
Turning to our outlook. As you know, we raised our outlook for 2010 EBITDA by $50 million in early June. We remain confident with the new range of $1.035 billion to $1.1 billion as we expect acuity and shifts between commercial payers to continue to provide offset to aggregate volume statistical declines. This is consistent with the notion that the quality of commercial admits is better than what the unadjusted commercial volume statistic would suggest. To understand what the real impact of commercial volume losses is, one needs to add back the increase in acuity and the effects of payer shifts within commercial. This would bring the economic effects of commercial inpatient volume loss in the second quarter down to approximately 4%, rather than 7.2% and would put the effects of commercial pricing at around 7% to 7.5%. The details of our outlook are provided on Slide 12.
The walk forward of cash from June 30 to December 31, as reflected on Slide 13, breaks down second half cash flow into its major components, so that you can more clearly see the positive cash generated from operations and the planned deployment Trevor mentioned earlier. You will note that we have reduced our outlook for year-end cash to reflect the potential for outpatient acquisitions and the $40 million of debt we repurchased in July. Although not yet formally reflected in the outlook, we show the pro forma effect of the range of cash we would use in the refinancing and debt repurchase transaction which we launched today.
So to summarize. We have strong results for the quarter and earnings and cash flow. Commercial patient mix shifts continue to significantly offset gross statistical changes in volume. The potential upside of the California provider fee is nearing reality, and there is confirmation of our outlook for the year. I will now ask the operator to assemble the queue for Q&A. Operator?"

And then on acute acquisitions, it does seem as though the supply side of that market is increasing very steadily.

Because we have examined this question quite extensively here. I think there's several ways to approach it. So first of all, I think we are still in an environment where there is not a direct correlation between pricing and volume. There just doesn't seem to be any evidence of that. I think that volume is driven by all of the strategies that we outlined about physician alignment and about competitive positioning within markets and the local economies. And again, you get into these micro-localities where really the particular employment position in a very small market makes a difference. I think going forward, in terms of changing strategies, we have employed for some time a differentiating strategy on clinical quality. We thought that, that would generate differentiated volumes. And there were quarters when it appeared to be doing so but I'm not sure you can make a blanket statement on that. I think that as transparency increases and as health plans focus more on delivering value to their customers, the quality differentiation will have to play an important part. I want to make sure, even though we have generated strong increases in per unit revenues over the past several years, we still believe that our pricing positions us very effectively in terms of delivering value in the markets. Rarely are we the high-priced provider in a market. That position is usually held by a large not-for-profit system in a particular market. And then in terms of dealing with us from a health plan perspective, we have a very efficient revenue cycle, a very efficient back office. We have very few disputes with the payers. And so, we try to point out to them that as they look at the overall cost of doing business with providers, we tend to be positioned very effectively. I think the strategies will continue to be legitimate and valuable for the foreseeable future. When you get into several years from now into tiering of networks and more restrictive networks and so forth, I think we're also well positioned for that. And that is where you may begin to see opportunities to link price and volume. But I don't think it's -- the industry's just not there today."

So it would suggest that the commercial patients coming in through the ER are indeed sicker than they were a year ago. The other point is that Trevor mentioned that our overall ED admissions are flat compared to the same quarter prior year. The fact that we had 2,000 fewer visits for influenza would, in fact, increase the overall case mix index of patients we're seeing in the ED. And therefore, those admitted would be higher acuity.

Obviously in the face of the weak commercial volumes and the other dynamics around this economic downturn, you've been able to have very good cost controls on key items like labor and supplies. But I think there's sort of this concern that if these payer pressures continue to exert themselves out there, at some point, you sort of hit a wall on that cost savings. I guess, I'm trying to get my arms around and wonder if you've thought about the issue of whether -- does all of this go hand-in-hand if the cost opportunities you're realizing are hand-in-hand with some of the banks that are driving the commercial volume pressures, for example?

But that's why we really some time ago turned our attention to more creative approaches to cost reduction, such as those that are part of the Medicare performance initiative. And that really gets to a whole different range of cost opportunities in the utilization of supplies and length of stay and even the clinical practice of medicine. That, together with the investments we're making in technology, should open up new opportunities for us in cost management beyond the traditional levers that were largely oriented towards labor. And again, I also should point out how really outstanding our performance has been in the revenue cycle. I mean, that's an important cost driver, and we have been very effective in managing that, both from an expense and a cash flow perspective."

On supplies, we've had sort of relentless upward pressure on the high-value supplies and fairly benign pricing pressure on commodity supplies.

I'm very pleased with our solid performance in the second quarter. We generated $268 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing 9% growth over 2009 and a margin of 11.6%. We are in the midst of generating one of t",1178,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our solid performance in the second quarter. We generated $268 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing 9% growth over 2009 and a margin of 11.6%. We are in the midst of generating one of the strongest earnings trajectories in our recent history, and we faced a difficult comparison versus the second quarter of 2009, when EBITDA was up more than 50%. The 11.6% margin was the highest margin for a second quarter in the last seven years, and we achieved it in a difficult volume environment. 
The in-patient admissions picture was virtually identical to our first quarter, although there was a little more strength in our outpatient business in the second quarter relative to the first. When we released interim second quarter volumes on June 14, the volume picture for the quarter was stronger. Unfortunately, the final few weeks of June and all of July were soft, so we're off to a slow start for volumes in the third quarter. We also started the third quarter with a difficult comparison. Last year at this time, we were off to a strong start for Q3, with positive admissions growth in July.
Turning back to the second quarter, total admissions were down 2%. But that's before you take into account a decline in both flu and OB/GYN-related cases. Had it not been for these two categories, total admissions for the quarter would have been down less than 1%. But we are most disappointed by the 7.2% decline in commercial admissions and the 5.4% decline in commercial outpatient visits. 
Providing context for our commercial volumes relative to the industry continues to be difficult. There is really only one data point so far for the second quarter, namely HCA's negative 5.3% statistic for what they termed ""Managed Care and Other."" Our comparable statistic would have been negative 6.2%. 
While commercial volumes are a part of our story, they are not the whole story. I hope you noticed that our commercial revenues grew by 2%. So clearly, something is helping us mitigate these volume declines. Here's some insight into what's going on beneath the surface of our commercial volume trends.
First, there was a significant pickup in our commercial case mix index which increased 2.8%. Over a third of our decline in commercial admissions was OB/GYN-related. As many of you have written about the decline in U.S. birth rate, it's probably no surprise that the reduction in deliveries explains nearly 20% of our decline in commercial admissions in the second quarter. 
In addition, we had a favorable shift within the mix of our commercial payers from lower-paying to higher-paying health plans. The impact of these two factors, when combined with continuing increases in commercial pricing, resulted in commercial revenue growth of 2%. At the end of the day, it's this revenue growth and solid cost control which drove our 9% growth in EBITDA. 
Also, I don't want to overlook some areas of strength in the overall volume picture. Our outpatient business appears to be picking up after a weaker start to the year. Second quarter aggregate outpatient visits declined by less than 1%, while we saw positive growth in government outpatient of 2%.
Our admissions through the emergency department were equal to last year's statistic. This is further evidence that elective procedures are most directly impacted by a slow economy. And to complete the volume story, note that total government admissions were flat, and adjusted admissions declined by just 0.6%. 
We continue to show strong numbers in the area of cost control and rates. And importantly, the delta between these two variables continues to expand. Inpatient net revenue per admission and outpatient net revenue per visit grew by 4.6% and 5.3% respectively, significantly outpacing a 3.8% growth in controllable costs per adjusted patient day.
Collectively, these factors helped us to generate adjusted free cash flow of $121 million in Q2, bringing free cash flow for the first half to positive $21 million. That's a $23 million improvement on a year-to-date basis from last year and a significant achievement given the large cash consumption that's typical for our first quarter.
Speaking of cash, excluding cash and insurance subsidiaries, we had a corporate cash balance of $600 million at the end of Q2. Taking only into account capital expenditures, July repurchases of $40 million of debt and our planned investment in outpatient centers through the remainder of the year, our year-end outlook for corporate cash is $500 million to $575 million. Based on the improvement in our performance over the last several years and our credit line availability, we believe this amount of cash exceeds our liquidity requirements, even after considering the normal first quarter seasonal usage. Our liquidity will be even greater if we receive the full California provider fee and complete the sale of some of our medical office buildings.
I want to spend a moment on two actions that will improve our financial flexibility. First, in order to improve cash flow and manage our debt maturities, today, we launched the refinancing of a portion of our $1 billion of 2013 debt. If we successfully complete this transaction as contemplated, our debt will drop by another $200 million to roughly $4.0 billion, our annual cash flow will improve by $11 million and our next significant maturity of debt will not occur until 2015.
Second, we are now beginning to negotiate a new credit line. Because our credit line is used to support letters of credit, which expire next year, it makes sense to replace that line in the third quarter of this year. Today, our facility is $800 million in size and after taking into account outstanding letters of credit and other limitations, we have undrawn capacity of approximately $500 million. 
We will seek to maintain a facility of $800 million with a five-year term. We also believe that based on our improved financial condition and the current bank market, we will be able to improve our capital allocation options, including lifting an existing limitation on stock repurchases. We think the combination of these actions, namely retiring $240 million of debt, extending $600 million of 2013 debt to 2020 and arranging a new credit line, will enable us to maintain an appropriately prudent capital structure and liquidity posture while adding new flexibility.
Please keep in mind that any further decisions to make investments in our business, make acquisitions, retire debt or repurchase stock, are conditional upon our outlook, as well as the opportunities and market conditions at the time. So I can't project a future capital deployment strategy with greater precision today. 
To summarize, I'm pleased with our effective response to the continued weak economy and soft volume environment in the first half. When confronted by these extraordinary challenges, our management teams responded quickly to maintain our positive earnings trajectory. And once we generate volume growth, I'm confident that we can achieve some truly outstanding bottom line performance. Let me now turn the floor over to Biggs Porter, our Chief Financial Officer. Biggs?"
107911,109241320,73762,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. As Trevor said, we are very pleased with our EBITDA and cash flow results for the quarter. There were two items we've pointed out in the release which could be characterized as non-recurring but they were ide",879,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. As Trevor said, we are very pleased with our EBITDA and cash flow results for the quarter. There were two items we've pointed out in the release which could be characterized as non-recurring but they were identical in size and therefore, fully offsetting.
The two items are a favorable Medicare bad debt settlement, offset by a reduction in revenue related to the Supplemental Security Income adjustment to Medicare reimbursement. I'll otherwise now give a little color on the other value drivers. 
First, as Trevor said on pricing, growth in per-unit revenues continues to make a solid contribution of profitability. We also have good visibility into future years' pricing. At this point, approximately 95% of our commercial contracting is complete for 2010, 75% for 2011 and 35% for 2012.
Attributable costs again reflect good cost discipline with an increase of 3.8% for adjusted patient day. Salaries, wages and benefits was well controlled with an increase of 3.4% also on a PAPD basis, demonstrating our ability to effectively flex our staffing in response to fluctuating volumes. 
Supply costs increased just 1.2% per adjusted patient day relative to last year's second quarter. The one area showing cost pressure is other controllable costs, which were up 6.8% per adjusted patient day. There were increases in various elements of costs, some of which are non-recurring by nature, including a contractual settlement on a lease, a credit in the prior year's results, provider taxes and IT maintenance costs.
Malpractice expense declined by $2 million or 7% relative to last year but increased by $14 million over the first quarter. Malpractice was negatively affected by a decrease in the discount rate and some individual claim adjustments. Otherwise, it would have been substantially less. If discount rates are stable or increase and we don't have the unusually large specific claim adjustments, there's opportunity for malpractice to decline in future quarters. However, since forecasting a malpractice expense is challenging, our outlook has been left conservative.
Our bad debt ratio was flat relative to last year at 7.5% but there were a number of moving pieces which contributed to that result. Reported bad debt for the quarter included the benefit of a $28 million favorable adjustment for Medicare bad debts. In a related item, we also recorded unfavorable contractual adjustments for Medicare of $8 million. Netting the $8 million from the $28 million results in a favorable $20 million. This $20 million offsets the unfavorable SSI adjustment of the same magnitude referred to earlier. We also expect any recurring effects from these items to offset. 
The sum of uninsured maturity admissions declined by 2.2% in the quarter. This decline helped control the costs of providing uncompensated care to an increase of only $5 million in the quarter. 
On a totally separate subject, there has been some positive movement on CMS's response to the California provider fee legislation. There have been comments received from CMS, which have prompted an adjustment to the program but moved it much closer to approval. At this time, we expect the benefit we will receive this year to be $70 million, $30 million of which would be applicable to 2009. Having said that, we are leaving the $30 million contribution in the middle of our 2010 outlook range unchanged until the program passes the last step of formal CMS approval.
Turning to our outlook. As you know, we raised our outlook for 2010 EBITDA by $50 million in early June. We remain confident with the new range of $1.035 billion to $1.1 billion as we expect acuity and shifts between commercial payers to continue to provide offset to aggregate volume statistical declines. This is consistent with the notion that the quality of commercial admits is better than what the unadjusted commercial volume statistic would suggest. To understand what the real impact of commercial volume losses is, one needs to add back the increase in acuity and the effects of payer shifts within commercial. This would bring the economic effects of commercial inpatient volume loss in the second quarter down to approximately 4%, rather than 7.2% and would put the effects of commercial pricing at around 7% to 7.5%. The details of our outlook are provided on Slide 12.
The walk forward of cash from June 30 to December 31, as reflected on Slide 13, breaks down second half cash flow into its major components, so that you can more clearly see the positive cash generated from operations and the planned deployment Trevor mentioned earlier. You will note that we have reduced our outlook for year-end cash to reflect the potential for outpatient acquisitions and the $40 million of debt we repurchased in July. Although not yet formally reflected in the outlook, we show the pro forma effect of the range of cash we would use in the refinancing and debt repurchase transaction which we launched today.
So to summarize. We have strong results for the quarter and earnings and cash flow. Commercial patient mix shifts continue to significantly offset gross statistical changes in volume. The potential upside of the California provider fee is nearing reality, and there is confirmation of our outlook for the year. I will now ask the operator to assemble the queue for Q&A. Operator?"

Or is it more just when the economy rebounds, we should get some pickup from that? I mean, can you separate the two?"

I think there is several ways to approach it. So first of all, I think we are still in an environment where there is not a direct correlation between pricing and volume. There just doesn't seem to be any evidence of that. I think that volume is driven by all of the strategies that we outlined about physician alignment and about competitive positioning within markets and the local economies. And again, you get into these micro-localities where really the particular employment position in a very small market makes a difference. I think going forward, in terms of changing strategies, we have employed for some time a differentiating strategy on clinical quality. We thought that, that would generate differentiated volumes. And there were quarters when it appeared to be doing so but I'm not sure you can make a blanket statement on that. I think that as transparency increases and as health plans focus more on delivering value to their customers, the quality differentiation will have to play an important part. I want to make sure, even though we have generated strong increases in per unit revenues over the past several years, we still believe that our pricing positions us very effectively in terms of delivering value in the markets. Rarely are we the high-priced provider in a market. That position is usually held by a large not-for-profit system in a particular market. And then in terms of dealing with us from a health plan perspective, we have a very efficient revenue cycle, a very efficient back office. We have very few disputes with the payers. And so, we try to point out to them that as they look at the overall cost of doing business with providers, we tend to be positioned very effectively. I think those strategies will continue to be legitimate and valuable for the foreseeable future. When you get into several years from now into tiering of networks and more restrictive networks and so forth, I think we're also well positioned for that. And that is where you may begin to see opportunities to link price and volume. But I don't think it's -- the industry's just not there today."

So it would suggest that the commercial patients coming in through the ER are indeed sicker than they were a year ago. The other point is that Trevor mentioned that our overall ED admissions are flat compared to the same quarter prior year. The fact that we had 2,000 fewer visits for influenza would, in fact, increase the overall case mix index of patients we're seeing in the ED. And therefore, those admitted would be higher acuity.

I'm very pleased with our solid performance in the second quarter. We generated $268 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing 9% growth over 2009 and a margin of 11.6%.We are in the midst of generating one of",1176,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our solid performance in the second quarter. We generated $268 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing 9% growth over 2009 and a margin of 11.6%.
We are in the midst of generating one of the strongest earning trajectories in our recent history. And we face a difficult comparison versus the second quarter of 2009 when EBITDA was up more than 50%. The 11.6% margin was the highest margin for a second quarter in the last seven years. And we achieved it in a difficult volume environment. 
The in-patient admissions picture was virtually identical to our first quarter, although there was a little more strength in our Outpatient business in the second quarter relative to the first.
When we released interim second quarter volumes on June 14th, the volume picture for the quarter was stronger. Unfortunately, the final few weeks of June and all of July were soft, so we're off to a slow start for volumes in the third quarter. We also started the third quarter with a difficult comparison. Last year at this time, we were off to a strong start for Q3 with positive admissions growth in July.
Turning back to the second quarter, total admissions were down 2%. But that's before you take into account a decline in both flu and OB/GYN-related cases. Had it not been for these two categories, total admissions for the quarter would have been down less than 1%. But we are most disappointed by the 7.2% decline in commercial admissions and the 5.4% decline in commercial outpatient visits. 
Providing context for our commercial volumes relative to the industry continues to be difficult. There is really only one data point so far for the second quarter, namely HCA's negative 5.3% statistic for what they termed, “Managed Care and Other.” Our comparable statistic would have been negative 6.2%.
While commercial volumes are a part of our story, they are not the whole story. I hope you noticed that our commercial revenues grew by 2%. So clearly, something is helping us mitigate these volume declines. Here's some insight into what's going on beneath the surface of our commercial volume trends.
First, there was a significant pickup in our commercial case mix index, which increased 2.8%. Over a third of our decline in commercial admissions was OB/GYN-related. As many of you have written about the declining U.S. birthrate, it's probably no surprise that the reduction in deliveries explained nearly 20% of our decline in commercial admissions in the second quarter.
In addition, we had a favorable shift within the mix of our commercial payers from lower-paying to higher-paying health plans. The impact of these two factors, when combined with continuing increases in commercial pricing, resulted in commercial revenue growth of 2%. At the end of the day, it's this revenue growth and solid cost control which drove our 9% growth in EBITDA.
Also, I don't want to overlook some areas of strength in the overall volume picture. Our Outpatient business appears to be picking up after a weaker start to the year. Second quarter aggregate Outpatient business declined by less than 1%, while we saw positive growth in government outpatient of 2%. Our admissions through the emergency department were equal to last year's statistic. This is further evidence that elective procedures are most directly impacted by a slow economy. And to complete the volume story, note that total government admissions were flat and adjusted admissions declined by just 0.6%.
We continue to show strong numbers in the area of cost control and rates. And importantly, the delta between these two variables continues to expand. Inpatient net revenue per admission and outpatient net revenue per visit grew by 4.6% and 5.3%, respectively, significantly outpacing a 3.8% growth in controllable cost per adjusted patient day. 
Collectively, these factors helped us to generate adjusted free cash flow of $121 million in Q2, bringing free cash flow for the first half to positive $21 million. That's a $23 million improvement on a year-to-date basis from last year and a significant achievement given the large cash consumption that's typical for our first quarter.
Speaking of cash, excluding cash and insurance subsidiaries, we had a corporate cash balance of $600 million at the end of Q2. Taking only into account capital expenditures, July repurchases of $40 million of debt and our planned investment in outpatient centers through the remainder of the year, our year-end outlook for corporate cash is $500 million to $575 million. 
Based on the improvement in our performance over the last several years and our credit line availability, we believe this amount of cash exceeds our liquidity requirements even after considering the normal first quarter seasonal usage. Our liquidity will be even greater if we receive the full California provider fee and complete the sale of some of our medical office buildings. 
I want to spend a moment on two actions that will improve our financial flexibility. First, in order to improve cash flow and manage our debt maturities, today, we launched the refinancing of a portion of our $1 billion of 2013 debt. If we successfully complete this transaction as contemplated, our debt will drop by another $200 million to roughly $4.0 billion, our annual cash flow will improve by $11 million and our next significant maturity of debt will not occur until 2015. 
Second, we are now beginning to negotiate a new credit line. Because our credit line is used to support letters of credit which expire next year, it makes sense to replace that line in the third quarter of this year. Today, our facility is $800 million in size and after taking into account outstanding letters of credit and other limitations, we have undrawn capacity of approximately $500 million. We will seek to maintain a facility of $800 million with a five-year term. We also believe that based on our improved financial condition and the current bank market, we will be able to improve our capital allocation option, including lifting an existing limitation on stock repurchases.
We think the combination of these actions, namely, retiring $240 million of debt, extending $600 million of 2013 debt to 2020, and arranging a new credit line will enable us to maintain an appropriately prudent capital structure and liquidity posture while adding new flexibility.
Please keep in mind that any further decisions to make investments in our business, make acquisitions, retire debt or repurchase stock are conditional upon our outlook, as well as the opportunities and market conditions at the time, so I can't project a future capital deployment strategy with greater precision today. 
To summarize, I'm pleased with our effective response to the continued weak economy and soft volume environment in the first half. When confronted by these extraordinary challenges, our management teams responded quickly to maintain our positive earnings trajectory. And once we generate volume growth, I'm confident that we can achieve some truly outstanding bottom line performance. Let me now turn the floor over to Biggs Porter, our Chief Financial Officer. Biggs?"
107911,109241320,79563,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. As Trevor said, we are very pleased with our EBITDA and cash flow results for the quarter.

As Trevor said, we are very pleased with our EBITDA and cash flow results for the quarter. There were two items we pointed out in the release, which could be characterized as non-recurring, but they were identical in size and therefore fully offsetting. The two items are a favorable Medicare bad debt settlement, offset by a reduction in revenue related to the supplemental security income adjustment to Medicare reimbursement. 
I will otherwise now give a little color on the other value drivers. First, as Trevor said, on pricing, growth and per unit revenues continues to make a solid contribution to profitability. We also have good visibility into future years’ pricing. At this point, approximately 95% of our commercial contracting is complete for 2010, 75% for 2011 and 35% for 2012.
Controllable costs again reflect good cost discipline, with an increase of 3.8% per adjusted patient day. Salaries, wages and benefits was well-controlled, with an increase of 3.4%, also on a PAPD basis, demonstrating our ability to effectively flex our staffing in response to fluctuating volumes. Supply cost increased just 1.2% per adjusted patient day relative to last year's second quarter.
The one area showing cost pressure is other controllable costs, which were up 6.8% per adjusted patient day. There were increases in various elements of cost, some of which are non-recurring by nature, including a contractual settlement on a lease, a credit in the prior year's results, provider taxes and IT maintenance costs. 
Malpractice expense declined by $2 million or 7% relative to last year, but increased by $14 million over the first quarter. Malpractice was negatively affected by a decrease in the discount rate and some individual claim adjustments. Otherwise, it would have been substantially less. If discount rates are stable or increase and we don't have the unusually large specific claim adjustments, there is opportunity for malpractice to decline in future quarters. However, since forecasting a malpractice expense is challenging, our outlook has been left conservative.
Our bad debt ratio was flat relative to last year at 7.5%, but there were a number of moving pieces which contributed to that result. Reported bad debt for the quarter included the benefit of a $28 million favorable adjustment for Medicare bad debt. In a related item, we also recorded unfavorable contractual adjustments for Medicare of $8 million. Netting the $8 million from the $28 million results in a favorable $20 million. This $20 million offsets the unfavorable SSI adjustment of the same magnitude referred to earlier. 
We also expect any recurring effects from these items to offset. The sum of uninsured and charity admissions declined by 2.2% in the quarter. This decline helped control the cost of providing uncompensated care to an increase of only $5 million in the quarter. 
On a totally separate subject, there has been some positive movement on CMS's response to the California provider fee legislation. There have been comments received from CMS which have prompted an adjustment to the program, but moved it much closer to approval. At this time, we expect the benefit we will receive this year to be $70 million, $30 million of which would be applicable to 2009. Having said that, we are leaving the $30 million contribution in the middle of our 2010 outlook range unchanged until the program passes the last step of formal CMS approval.
Turning to our outlook. As you know, we raised our outlook for 2010 EBITDA by $50 million in early June. We remain confident with the new range of $1.035 billion to $1.1 billion, as we expect acuity and shifts between commercial payers to continue to provide offset to aggregate volume statistical declines. This is consistent with the notion that the quality of commercial admits is better than what the unadjusted commercial volume statistic would suggest. 
To understand what the real impact of commercial volume losses is, one needs to add back the increase in acuity and the effects of payer shifts within commercial. This would bring the economic effects of commercial inpatient volume loss in the second quarter down to approximately 4% rather than 7.2%, and will put the effects of commercial pricing at around 7% to 7 1/2%. The details of our outlook are provided on Slide 12.
The walk forward of cash from June 30 to December 31 as reflected on Slide 13 breaks down second half cash flow into its major components, so that you can more clearly see the positive cash generated from operations and the planned deployment Trevor mentioned earlier. You will note that we have reduced our outlook for year-end cash to reflect the potential for outpatient acquisitions and the $40 million of debt we repurchased in July. Although not yet formally reflected in the outlook, we show the pro forma effect of the range of cash we would use in the refinancing and debt repurchase transaction, which we launched today.
So to summarize. We have strong results for the quarter in earnings and cash flow. Commercial patient mix shifts continue to significantly offset growth statistical changes in volume. The potential upside of the California provider fee is nearing reality and there is confirmation of our outlook for the year. I will now ask the operator to assemble the queue for Q&A. Operator?"

We are tying our doctors more closely to our facilities through this HIT set of products and that will make a difference longer term. Additionally, we are reactivating a number of organizations that we had 10 or 12 years ago that are called Physician Hospital Organizations. These are entities that are jointly owned by physicians and hospitals, and allow for contracting on a single signature, whether it be with a commercial payer or a governmental payer.

I think there are several ways to approach it. So first of all, I think we are still in an environment where there is not a direct correlation between pricing and volume. There just doesn't seem to be any evidence of that. I think that volume is driven by all of the strategies that we outlined about physician alignment and about competitive positioning within markets and the local economies. And again, you get into these micro localities where it really, the particular employment position in a very small market makes a difference. I think going forward, is in terms of changing strategies, we have employed for some time a differentiating strategy on clinical quality. We thought that, that would generate differentiated volumes and there were quarters when it appeared to be doing so. But I'm not sure you can make a blanket statement on that. I think that as transparency increases and as health plans focus more on delivering value to their customers, the quality differentiation will have to play an important part. I want to make sure that even though we have generated strong increases in per unit revenues over the past several years, we still believe that our pricing positions us very effectively in terms of delivering value in the markets. Rarely are we the high-priced provider in a market. That position is usually held by a large not-for-profit system in a particular market. And then in terms of dealing with us from a health plan perspective, we have a very efficient revenue cycle, a very efficient back office, we have very few disputes with the payers. And so we try to point out to them that as they look at the overall cost of doing business with providers, we tend to be positioned very effectively. I think those strategies will continue to be legitimate and valuable for the foreseeable future. When you get into several years from now into tiering of networks and more restrictive networks and so forth, I think we're also well positioned for that. And that is where you may begin to see opportunities to link price and volume. But I don't think the industry’s just not there today."

So it would suggest that the commercial patients coming in through the ER are indeed sicker than they were a year ago. The other point is that Trevor mentioned that our overall ED admissions are flat compared to the same quarter prior year. The fact that we had 2,000 fewer visits for influenza would in fact increase the overall case mix index of patients we're seeing in the ED and, therefore, those admitted would be higher acuity.

I can understand why they would not have necessarily wanted to pass something before the recess, but it's important to the governors. We have tried to estimate what an effect on us would be if the FMAP incremental money were not continued, and it hit directly and only to the Medicaid budget of every state and if we proportionately were hit directly. So I don't if you should call that a worst-case analysis. But it's a direct flow through directly to us of eliminating those funds and the total would be what, Biggs?"

One thing that I encounter, I guess, and I'd be interested in your perspective on it, is the sustainability of the cost trends. Obviously, in the face of the weak commercial volumes and the other dynamics around this economic downturn, you've been able to have very good cost controls on key items like labor and supplies.

I guess I'm trying to get my arms around, I wonder if you've thought about the issue of whether -- does all of this go hand-in-hand, that the cost opportunities you’re realizing are hand-in-hand with some of the things that are driving the commercial volume pressures, for example?

That together with the investments we're making in technology should open up new opportunities for us in cost management beyond the traditional levers that were largely oriented towards labor.

On supplies, we've had sort of relentless upward pressure on the high-value supplies and fairly benign pricing pressure on commodity supplies.

Well, I will blame you if you write report saying that this is a noisy quarter. In summary, our earnings number was huge and we're raising the bottom end of our 2010 outlook. The volumes were soft, and the EBITD",1672,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Well, I will blame you if you write report saying that this is a noisy quarter. In summary, our earnings number was huge and we're raising the bottom end of our 2010 outlook. The volumes were soft, and the EBITDA is flat to 2009, if you make appropriate adjustments. 
We generated over $900 million in net income due to the accounting recognition of the value of our tax loss carryforward. Biggs will explain this further, but the key point is that while existence of the NOL has been well known it should be more tangible to investors now that it's on the books.
Looking beyond net income, we were challenged by soft volumes in the quarter. We reacted to a particularly weak July by implementing a reduction in force in August. The impact of these actions to reduce costs along with improved volume trends after July led to a positive earnings trend in the quarter, in which EBITDA grew steadily from July to August to September. 
It's worth noting that we face the very tough comparison this year as adjusted EBITDA was up 50% in the third quarter last year. Once you allow for year-over-year variability, our longer-term EBITDA trend remains strong. You can see the variability and the clear long-term trend demonstrated on Slide 4.
Clearly, our growth has been very strong but not a steady as I'd like. When you make your assessment of our growth in EBITDA in the quarter, please consider the items on Slide 5. The third quarter of 2009 included three favorable items contributing a total of $20 million. We called out these items in last year's third quarter call, and nearly all of you noted them when assessing our performance. 
In contrast, this year's third quarter includes items with a net unfavorable impact of $16 million. In total, these items created a $36 million unfavorable swing from the third quarter of 2009 to this year's quarter. Net of these items, this quarter was essentially unchanged.
As I mentioned earlier, we're raising the bottom end of our outlook for 2010 EBITDA to a new range of $1,050,000,000 to $1.1 billion. This is the second time this year we've increased one or both ends of the range. Volumes were certainly weaker than we originally anticipated, but this has been offset by stronger pricing, enhanced acuity and excellent cost control. We're also benefiting from the California provider fee being larger than we forecast and health IT spending being less than we anticipated.
Soft volumes were a dominant theme across the industry last quarter, so I'd like to give you some color on our experience. The overall takeaways that the volume declines were contained to a small number of hospitals, and once again a single service line. OB accounted for a full third of our volume loss.
Total admissions declined 3.5%, and commercial admissions declined 8.6% in the quarter. July was by far our weakest month for patient volumes. The trend was more encouraging in August and through mid-September. Through the first 28 days of October, commercial admissions trended slightly better than in Q3 but total admissions were slightly weaker.
As you can see on Slide 7, outpatient visits were down 2% in the third quarter. Emergency department outpatient visits were down 1.7% in the quarter, but just over 70% of that decline is due to a reduction in flu, so non-flu ED visits are basically flat year-over-year. Outpatient surgeries were up modestly, increasing by 0.1% and adjusted admissions were down only 1.8%.
The volume losses this quarter and this year have been confined to a small number of hospitals. In fact, just seven hospitals comprise more than 70% of our total admissions declines in the third quarter. But while these seven hospitals cost the majority of our volume losses, the other 42 hospitals in the aggregate are performing better than the industry average. 
The seven hospitals are widely dispersed. There are two in Texas, but they're not in the same market. The other five are each in different states. Interestingly, although California is challenged by extremely high unemployment in some of our markets, none of our California hospitals are among the seven.
There is no single theme for the volume losses at these seven hospitals. One of the hospitals are having a solid and growing year but facing extremely tough comparison on volumes in Q3. Another one lost the unprofitable volume. Those two, plus three others, grew EBITDA significantly despite their volume losses. 
The two others saw challenges with their physician channels. These are instances where physicians have gone into direct competition with the hospitals, where we're competing hospitals have engaged in very aggressive and sudden physician employment strategies. No matter the reason for the volume declines, we're responding appropriately, and we believe that we're already turning the losses around. In October, in these seven hospitals, while still down, the volumes were down by a lower percentage than in the third quarter.
Turning to service lines. I already mentioned that the third of the total volume decline was in OB. Looking beyond OB, there's some elective service lines, I'd like to share some interesting insights with you. As we're deep into the recession, it's very clear that patients who have a significant personal financial responsibility are behaving very differently than patients who don't. We've known all along that this was driving reductions in our commercial elective surgical volumes. But let me give you some facts that our other orthopedic surgery as an example.
If you look at Slide 10, you'll see that total admissions for orthopedic surgeries declined by 2.5%. Commercially insured orthopedic surgeries declined by 9%. Orthopedic surgeries for all other patients, most of whom are covered by Medicare and Medicaid, actually increased 0.2%. 
The same pattern is true with spinal fusions. Commercially insured spinal fusions declined by 160 admissions or 15% in the third quarter, but noncommercial spinal fusions increased by 17% or over 150 admissions in the quarter. Since the same physicians are doing these surgeries for both payer classes, the loss of commercial volumes and the growth of noncommercial volumes to just this behavior is being driven by the patient not the physicians. We believe this patient behavior is largely related to economic uncertainty on the part of the patients, commercial enrollment losses and rising co-pays and deductibles for those who remain insured.
Again, on Slide 10, you can see this pattern holds through across several service lines that we would consider as elective and easy to defer. Slide 11 illustrates that when the procedure is harder to defer, like in the case of OB, the changes in volumes in other commercial and noncommercial populations are very similar. 
Despite the challenges to volume growth, favorable pricing and acuity continue to drive a stable picture for revenues. Commercial pricing remains particularly strong. We also had a 2.4% increase in commercial acuity. The result was positive commercial revenue growth of nearly 1% for the quarter. Collectively, this helped us generate adjusted free cash flow of $53 million in Q3, bringing year-to-date free cash flow deposit of $74 million. 
We've made a lot of progress on other front in the quarter. We continue to improve and de-risk our capital structure, pushing out the majority of our 2013 maturities to 2020, while retiring $229 million face value of debt. This brings our total debt slightly more than $4 billion with no meaningful maturities for five years. We also entered into a new $800 million credit line with new flexibility with regard to our capital allocation options, including lifting an existing limitation on stock repurchases.
Earlier this year, we drew your attention to the seven items on Slide 14, which we believe can drive significant margin expansion and earnings growth over the next few years. While some of these items depends on a recovering economy, three of these initiatives, Outpatient, Medicare Performance Initiative and Conifer, were more directly under our control and less dependent on an economic recovery.
Just walking down the list for a minute, our newly acquired outpatient centers are already coming online. We expect to have invested about $70 million in outpatient acquisitions by the end of 2010 and believe there are enough great opportunities that we could do that again in 2011. We anticipate these acquisitions will add $100 million to $150 million to revenues in 2011, and given the much higher margins in this business, contribute as much as $30 million to $40 million in 2011 EBITDA.
Turning to MPI, we are very much on track with our 2010 objective of a $30 million incremental EBITDA contribution. While we have not yet completed our MPI plan for 2011, our preliminary view is for another $30 million. Conifer will take longer to gain visibility, but we remain very excited about its prospects. Conifer's contributions from outside clients to 2011's EBITDA growth will exceed $10 million.
Our healthcare information technology initiative will again create incremental expenses in 2011. And as previously disclosed, we're not planning on a net positive net financial contribution from the initiative prior to 2012. Earlier last month, we went live at four hospitals, and the rollout went smoothly. We're going live in an additional three hospitals this month.
In addition, we continue to achieve solid commercial pricing that's consistent with the trends of recent years. To make major progress on margin expansion and EBITDA growth, we need volume growth and to go back towards prerecession bad debt expense levels. But it's still clear there's much we can achieve even in the absence of recovery.
So to wrap-up, I believe we demonstrated once again that we have the appropriate and effective leverage to pull in the short term to keep us on track relative to our longer-term performance milestone. I also believe our long-term growth strategy have us well positioned to face the myriad challenges that 2011 will bring. 
And with that, let me turn the floor over to Biggs Porter, our Chief Financial Officer. Biggs?"
107911,114307236,84333,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. The biggest item impacting our net income for the quarter is a recognition of the tax benefit or our net operating loss carry forward. This recognition resulted from our reversal of the previously-established",2154,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. The biggest item impacting our net income for the quarter is a recognition of the tax benefit or our net operating loss carry forward. This recognition resulted from our reversal of the previously-established valuation allowance and added $981 million to our net income or $1.75 per diluted share. 
Under generally accepted accounting principles, which arguably are conservative on this point and in recognition of our sustained and sustainable return to profitability, the realization of this tax benefits has become sufficiently likely as to require its recognition in our financial statements. Given the conservative criteria applied in our GAAP, this makes a strong statement about the expectations of our future profitability and the value of the NOL.
As a result of this recognition, our income statement tax rate in future quarters will approximate a normalized tax rate of approximately 40%. From a cash perspective, however, we will continue to benefit from the tax shield, and our tax payments on future income will be primarily limited to state taxes, and will continue at the low level of recent years. It will remain low until our loss carry forward is fully utilized, which is still a number of years out.
The biggest item not impacting either net income or adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was the $64 million net receipt of revenues related to the California provider fee. Due to delays in a very complex approval process, this materially favorable event was not recognized in the third quarter. The portion of the plan related to direct medical payments was approved after the end of the quarter, with the Managed Care portion still pending. We had expected that up to $55 million would be recognized in the third quarter. This delay has no affect on full year income but will cost some of the cash receipts to slip out of this year into next, which we estimate at a net $36 million.
Looking forward to next year, the California provider fee may be renewed for a half year, and a new fee in Pennsylvania worth approximately $25 million is in the process of development. Other states are also working on these types of arrangements. Just as food for thought, if you put the normalized 2010 value of the California provider fee at $37 million, but Pennsylvania fee and a partial extension of the California fee could more than replace that. So you should not think of the revenue from the California provider fee as being entirely non-recurring and looking at next year. For a cash basis, the cash received from provider fees could actually go up next year.
Adjusting both quarters for prior cost quarter adjustments, revenues grew slightly in the third quarter as a result of strong commercial pricing and case mix, offset by adverse payer mix in aggregate declines in paying volumes. As in the prior quarters of this year, case mix on commercial Managed Care was strong relative to last year reflecting about a 3% increase. As I said in last quarter's comments, this increase in acuity has to be considered in understanding the economic effect of lower volume.
Our overall pricing picture remains positive. Even with the commercial volume declines we experienced in the quarter, commercial pricing gains were sufficient to drive growth of 0.9% in commercial revenues in the quarter. Because of the payer mix shift, however, net inpatient revenue per admission increased by only 1.1%, and net outpatient revenue per visit increased by 5.6%. 
The strong increase in outpatient pricing reflects the loss of H1N1 volumes from last year, which had generated lower revenues per outpatient visit. The absence of flu volumes in this year's third quarter drove average pricing higher. Once again, this demonstrates the necessity of understanding acuity and patient mix when assessing the economic effects of volume fluctuations.
While among the topic of pricing, I will comment that we continue to have very good visibility with regard to our forward pricing. At this point, approximately 80% of our commercial contracting is complete for 2011 and 40% for 2012. 
Turning to cost. Although the benefits weren't fully visible in the third quarter, we successfully took action to flex our cost structure. As Trevor mentioned, July's volumes were particularly weak. We responded very quickly to reduce our staffing and implemented the significant reduction for us in August. We incurred a couple of million in severance costs as part of this, but this August, the action left us well positioned for the balance of the quarter.  Those cut should also have full visibility in our fourth quarter. 
In addition, we have delayed our annual merit increases for the general population from October 1 to January 1. This takes us a step closer to timing our merit increases for all employees in the April time period where they used to be.
The result of these actions are merely evident in our internal measures of productivity, which looks at FTEs per adjusted average daily census. Despite the soft volumes in the quarter, this productivity measure actually improved in the third quarter as FTEs per adjusted average daily census declined in September by 1.2%.
Supplies cost were essentially flat in the quarter. On a per-adjusted patient-day basis, the increase in supplies cost was 2.6% as adverse operating leverage and the increase in acuity offset the effects of our supply cost initiatives. Because we recorded within other controllable cost line were more of a challenge. Many of the costs recorded in this heading are more heavily fixed or semi-variable in nature and as a result are more difficult to flex in response to soft volumes. 
We also recorded some incremental expense from items whose actual early determine impact is adversely influenced by declining interest rates. While now practice expenses increased by only $1 million relative to last year's third quarter, the decline in interest and therefore discount rates at $11 million to malpractice expense in the current quarter. Combined with an increase of $3 million in workers comp expense, lower discount rates added $14 million to operating expense in the quarter. This discount rate adjustment should be considered unusual at this point given low rates we were already seeing on U.S. Treasuries and can be expected to more than reversed itself in the future when interest rates rise to normal levels, thereby creating earnings upside of up to $40 million at some point in the future.
In addition, we recorded an incremental $4 million of HIT expense. As Trevor mentioned, we successfully went live on the first phase of the system of four of our hospitals in the month of October, and we now expect the internal effects of these expenses to be down to $11 million in 2010. We expect this incremental expense to increase in 2011 prior to being offset in 2012 by the recognition of federal incentive payments. This increase is now a deferral of 2010 expenses, but is reflective of the increase and number of implementations in 2011.
Our bad debt ratio declined to 8.3% in the quarter, a 20 basis point decline relative to 8.5% a year ago. This decline includes the recurring benefits of federal Medicare bad debt recoveries, as well as declines in uninsured volumes. We view the size of this quarter's Medicare bad debt recovery as representative of ongoing sustainable impacts that can be expected in future quarters.
We had $398 million in cash and cash equivalents at quarter end, a decrease of $313 million from June 30. The largest driver of the cash decline was the use of $274 million to reduce debt. Cash provided from continuing operations was $160 million, and adjusted free cash flow was $53 million after capital expenditures of $107 million in the quarter. 
In the third quarter year-to-date, our cash from operations has been held back by lower levels of accounts payable and in the prior year. Some of this is due to the timing of expenditures or aggressive disbursements. We've not changed policy or contractual arrangements however, and we expect payables to expand again by year end.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed the sale of a number of our Florida medical office buildings, generating cash of $46 million. As a part of the sale, the buyers committed to certain capital improvements to facilities, which will benefit our position Tenet's. These MOBs had immaterial annual ends and EBITDA. 
We continue to actually market additional MOBs, and we believe a number of these transactions could be completed in the next few quarters. At this point, we have other MOB sales contracts pending worth approximately $50 million, but in real estate, nothing is done until it closes so there's not reflected in our outlook.
Turning to our outlook. We have raised the lower end of our outlook to a new range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. We raised both ends of the range of pretax income, reflecting lower depreciation and interest expense. Our revised assumptions are detailed on Slide 24. This revision includes the lowering of our volume and revenue estimates, which are tied to a later reductions in our cost estimates for the balance of the year. 
There's been speculation that volumes will grow in the fourth quarter of more than a seasonal basis due to the effects of co-pays and deductibles. At this point, we're going to be conservative and not count on that in our outlook. The walk forward of cash from September 30 to December 31 is provided on Slide 25 breaks down fourth quarter cash flow into its major components. 
It's too early to give an outlook for 2011, but I do think it's appropriate to give a little balance to what the headwinds and opportunities are going into next year. First, the biggest challenge remains on the volume side, but some of the effects of the economy and flu should have average rate by the end of this year. Economic stability followed by recovery would presumably create upside. Second, we expect the full year benefit on the outpatient acquisition we're completing on the second half of this year and a partial benefit of those we're targeting for next year.
Third, we're already seeing improvement in the yield on our physician additions the last couple of years, and we expect expansion of that benefit in 2011 and beyond. Fourth, commercial pricing is almost completely negotiated with reasonable existent price increases expected next year. Medicare, all in, is basically flat as outpatient increases offset inpatient decreases. I've already talked about state signing and potentially new provider fees with the 2009 retroactive portion of the California provider fee being the one element most challenging to replace.
Finally on the cost side, we will increase our investment in our physician base and HIT both of which will yield improvements for the future. And we will continue to drive on our Medicare performance and related initiatives to reduce link to stay in supply costs. 
In the aggregate, we will continue to drive toward industry margins. We have confidence in the path we have laid out. The only gating consideration in what the near-term timing and slow for progress is going to be is the degree of economic headwinds we must offset. On the positive side for 2011, we expect to drive value in the outpatient investments, position base initiatives, commercial pricing and the Medicare performance initiative. The big potential near-term negative, longer-term appositive is, as I just said, the effect of economic conditions. It is not clear and therefore remains subject to continuing evaluation by us as to what extent economic conditions will offset the net positive drivers of growth in 2011.
So to summarize. The value of our NOL carryforwards has been confirmed from accounting standpoint. We have raised our outlook for EBITDA and pretax and net income for the year. We approved cost efficiencies in the quarter, as we were able to react quickly to significant volume declines in the first month of the quarter. This will be fully visible in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow came under pressure due to the timing of disbursements in rising CapEx. But because of the timing effects on accounts payable will reverse themselves, we have retained our free cash flow outlook for the year. Pricing continued as the source of strength. Commercial case mix remained favorable compared to the prior year. California provider fee, has been partially approved while full approval expected this quarter. 
And one last point. From a volume and payer mix standpoint, this was the weakest quarter we've experienced, clearly reflective of the economic headwinds. However, the fact that we held earnings flat on a normalized basis and even in this harsh environment demonstrates that we are well positioned to grow earnings as the economy moderates and/or as our volume initiatives yield increasing results.

But we were trying to make the point that although I think the industry-wide volume weakness was well known throughout the quarter. There were plenty of surveys and other indicators that, that was taking place. What was surprisingly negative was July. And so, I mentioned that July was particularly weak and then we took actions to reduce cost. Of course, these actions couldn't be taken in July, they were taken in August and have that effect of creating a positive trajectory in EBITDA from July to August to September. And as volume losses moderated from July through August through mid-September, then they did turn down in late September, that's the implication of saying that they were strong through mid-September. So I think one way -- the thing I would characterize as being unusual in the third quarter at least for us was how negative the first month was and then the fact that although many in the industry anticipated some snap back in August was encouraging, that, that encouraging trend at least in terms of volume did not persist through the entire quarter. And then based on our comments about October, it didn't persist into October. but I think to answer your question about what we can do and how we've been able to offset weak volumes, obviously, it's very hard on a month-to-month basis, because it's easier on a quarterly basis and it gets easier to accomplish. I shouldn't use the word easy. That's not easy but it's less difficult to accomplish on a yearly basis. And so, if you look at the quarter as a whole, we really overcame a lot of challenge that we had right out of the box in July. But it's difficult to do more in a short period of time. I think we have positioned ourselves well going into the fourth quarter. But again, we don't even have the first month of results on that yet."

But this is a trend that is inexorable. It started with the large most prosperous, not for profits. We compete against a lot of this in our markets and we have completely adopted, I think new and improved way to do this. So just to go in order of sort of the promise that we're doing about it. Purchasing practices is really not market practice anymore. It's employing physicians. So you don't have the problem from the 90s of spending a lot of capital on purchasing something that turns out to not be worth of what you paid for. So it's really hiring talent. And then in terms of hiring talent, we've become very sophisticated about how to do it in terms of providing incentives for productivity so we don't experience the next problem that was characteristic for the 90s, which is hiring physicians, which essentially was enabling them to retire at the expense of the hospital. So we're incentivizing productivity. And we've also experienced some churn of the employed physicians based on those who failed to meet the productivity target leaving and those who are succeeding in the productivity target staying and enjoying the benefits of that. We've also been very selective in terms of the credentials of the physicians that we've been hiring. So just as if you undertook to hire a cadre of 200 MBA students you want to go to the top schools and hire the best students, we're doing the same thing when it comes to physicians. We're also being very selective about filling certain holes and specialties or building primary-care networks, where that strategy is right. And then finally, rather than attempting to manage all these practices ourselves, we've employed in a joint venture format a practice management company that's an expert in doing this and running them at economic results that are superior to what hospitals generally experience. So I think, all of these things together and I didn't mention the EMR solution that we're offering for physicians, I think it's a better solution, and we probably got started later than we should have. And perhaps it's because of historic bias, at least on my part, against that as a strategy. But we are well into it now and have a very strong pipeline of physicians that we are employing."

It's very limiting. Based on my comments about outpatient, it appears that we are doing that, and we're very pleased to outpatient acquisitions that we're making. I would say that the potential acquisitions of the acute care hospitals that would be of interest to us or of the greatest interest to us, there are certainly more hospitals considering selling themselves or seeking partnerships of some kind. And we're spending more time than we ever have exploring those types of things. I think it's premature to talk about value and whether we would actually proceed and devote our capital in that way. What we haven't been doing, you obviously noticed is we have not been competing in the auctions that has been out there for standalone hospitals or possibles that or -- whatever other acute-care transactions are out there.

Once again, be in the middle of the race. So those seem like based on everything we know, still some recent very conservative positions to be taken as we look at the underlying trends.

In summary, our earnings number was huge and we're raising the bottom end of our 2010 outlook. The volumes were soft, and the EBITDA is flat to 2009, if you make appropriate adjustments. 
We generated over $900 million in net income due to the accounting recognition of the value of our tax loss carryforward. Biggs will explain this further, but the key point is that while existence of the NOL has been well known it should be more tangible to investors now that it's on the books.
Looking beyond net income, we were challenged by soft volumes in the quarter. We reacted to a particularly weak July by implementing a reduction in force in August. The impact of these actions to reduce costs along with improved volume trends after July led to a positive earnings trend in the quarter, in which EBITDA grew steadily from July to August to September. 
It's worth noting that we face the very tough comparison this year as adjusted EBITDA was up 50% in the third quarter last year. Once you allow for year-over-year variability, our longer-term EBITDA trend remains strong. You can see the variability and the clear long-term trend demonstrated on Slide 4.
Clearly, our growth has been very strong but not a steady as I'd like. When you make your assessment of our growth in EBITDA in the quarter, please consider the items on Slide 5. The third quarter of 2009 included three favorable items contributing a total of $20 million. We called out these items in last year's third quarter call, and nearly all of you noted them when assessing our performance. 
In contrast, this year's third quarter includes items with a net unfavorable impact of $16 million. In total, these items created a $36 million unfavorable swing from the third quarter of 2009 to this year's quarter. Net of these items, this quarter was essentially unchanged.
As I mentioned earlier, we're raising the bottom end of our outlook for 2010 EBITDA to a new range of $1,050,000,000 to $1.1 billion. This is the second time this year we've increased one or both ends of the range. Volumes were certainly weaker than we originally anticipated, but this has been offset by stronger pricing, enhanced acuity and excellent cost control. We're also benefiting from the California provider fee being larger than we forecast and health IT spending being less than we anticipated.
Soft volumes were a dominant theme across the industry last quarter, so I'd like to give you some color on our experience. The overall takeaways that the volume declines were contained to a small number of hospitals, and once again a single service line. OB accounted for a full third of our volume loss.
Total admissions declined 3.5%, and commercial admissions declined 8.6% in the quarter. July was by far our weakest month for patient volumes. The trend was more encouraging in August and through mid-September. Through the first 28 days of October, commercial admissions trended slightly better than in Q3 but total admissions were slightly weaker.
As you can see on Slide 7, outpatient visits were down 2% in the third quarter. Emergency department outpatient visits were down 1.7% in the quarter, but just over 70% of that decline is due to a reduction in flu, so non-flu ED visits are basically flat year-over-year. Outpatient surgeries were up modestly, increasing by 0.1% and adjusted admissions were down only 1.8%.
The volume losses this quarter and this year have been confined to a small number of hospitals. In fact, just seven hospitals comprise more than 70% of our total admissions declines in the third quarter. But while these seven hospitals cost the majority of our volume losses, the other 42 hospitals in the aggregate are performing better than the industry average. 
The seven hospitals are widely dispersed. There are two in Texas, but they're not in the same market. The other five are each in different states. Interestingly, although California is challenged by extremely high unemployment in some of our markets, none of our California hospitals are among the seven.
There is no single theme for the volume losses at these seven hospitals. One of the hospitals are having a solid and growing year but facing extremely tough comparison on volumes in Q3. Another one lost the unprofitable volume. Those two, plus three others, grew EBITDA significantly despite their volume losses. 
The two others saw challenges with their physician channels. These are instances where physicians have gone into direct competition with the hospitals, where we're competing hospitals have engaged in very aggressive and sudden physician employment strategies. No matter the reason for the volume declines, we're responding appropriately, and we believe that we're already turning the losses around. In October, in these seven hospitals, while still down, the volumes were down by a lower percentage than in the third quarter.
Turning to service lines. I already mentioned that the third of the total volume decline was in OB. Looking beyond OB, there's some elective service lines, I'd like to share some interesting insights with you. As we're deep into the recession, it's very clear that patients who have a significant personal financial responsibility are behaving very differently than patients who don't. We've known all along that this was driving reductions in our commercial elective surgical volumes. But let me give you some facts that our other orthopedic surgery as an example.
If you look at Slide 10, you'll see that total admissions for orthopedic surgeries declined by 2.5%. Commercially insured orthopedic surgeries declined by 9%. Orthopedic surgeries for all other patients, most of whom are covered by Medicare and Medicaid, actually increased 0.2%. 
The same pattern is true with spinal fusions. Commercially insured spinal fusions declined by 160 admissions or 15% in the third quarter, but noncommercial spinal fusions increased by 17% or over 150 admissions in the quarter. Since the same physicians are doing these surgeries for both payer classes, the loss of commercial volumes and the growth of noncommercial volumes to just this behavior is being driven by the patient not the physicians. We believe this patient behavior is largely related to economic uncertainty on the part of the patients, commercial enrollment losses and rising co-pays and deductibles for those who remain insured.
Again, on Slide 10, you can see this pattern holds through across several service lines that we would consider as elective and easy to defer. Slide 11 illustrates that when the procedure is harder to defer, like in the case of OB, the changes in volumes in other commercial and noncommercial populations are very similar. 
Despite the challenges to volume growth, favorable pricing and acuity continue to drive a stable picture for revenues. Commercial pricing remains particularly strong. We also had a 2.4% increase in commercial acuity. The result was positive commercial revenue growth of nearly 1% for the quarter. Collectively, this helped us generate adjusted free cash flow of $53 million in Q3, bringing year-to-date free cash flow deposit of $74 million. 
We've made a lot of progress on other front in the quarter. We continue to improve and de-risk our capital structure, pushing out the majority of our 2013 maturities to 2020, while retiring $229 million face value of debt. This brings our total debt slightly more than $4 billion with no meaningful maturities for five years. We also entered into a new $800 million credit line with new flexibility with regard to our capital allocation options, including lifting an existing limitation on stock repurchases.
Earlier this year, we drew your attention to the seven items on Slide 14, which we believe can drive significant margin expansion and earnings growth over the next few years. While some of these items depends on a recovering economy, three of these initiatives, Outpatient, Medicare Performance Initiative and Conifer, were more directly under our control and less dependent on an economic recovery.
Just walking down the list for a minute, our newly acquired outpatient centers are already coming online. We expect to have invested about $70 million in outpatient acquisitions by the end of 2010 and believe there are enough great opportunities that we could do that again in 2011. We anticipate these acquisitions will add $100 million to $150 million to revenues in 2011, and given the much higher margins in this business, contribute as much as $30 million to $40 million in 2011 EBITDA.
Turning to MPI, we are very much on track with our 2010 objective of a $30 million incremental EBITDA contribution. While we have not yet completed our MPI plan for 2011, our preliminary view is for another $30 million. Conifer will take longer to gain visibility, but we remain very excited about its prospects. Conifer's contributions from outside clients to 2011's EBITDA growth will exceed $10 million.
Our healthcare information technology initiative will again create incremental expenses in 2011. And as previously disclosed, we're not planning on a net positive net financial contribution from the initiative prior to 2012. Earlier last month, we went live at four hospitals, and the rollout went smoothly. We're going live in an additional three hospitals this month.
In addition, we continue to achieve solid commercial pricing that's consistent with the trends of recent years. To make major progress on margin expansion and EBITDA growth, we need volume growth and to go back towards prerecession bad debt expense levels. But it's still clear there's much we can achieve even in the absence of recovery.
So to wrap-up, I believe we demonstrated once again that we have the appropriate and effective leverage to pull in the short term to keep us on track relative to our longer-term performance milestone. I also believe our long-term growth strategy have us well positioned to face the myriad challenges that 2011 will bring. 
And with that, let me turn the floor over to Biggs Porter, our Chief Financial Officer. Biggs?

107911,114307236,84347,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. The biggest item impacting our net income for the quarter is a recognition of the tax benefit or our net operating loss carry forward. This recognition resulted from our reversal of the previously-established",2154,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. The biggest item impacting our net income for the quarter is a recognition of the tax benefit or our net operating loss carry forward. This recognition resulted from our reversal of the previously-established valuation allowance and added $981 million to our net income or $1.75 per diluted share. 
Under generally accepted accounting principles, which arguably are conservative on this point and in recognition of our sustained and sustainable return to profitability, the realization of this tax benefits has become sufficiently likely as to require its recognition in our financial statements. Given the conservative criteria applied in our GAAP, this makes a strong statement about the expectations of our future profitability and the value of the NOL.
As a result of this recognition, our income statement tax rate in future quarters will approximate a normalized tax rate of approximately 40%. From a cash perspective, however, we will continue to benefit from the tax shield, and our tax payments on future income will be primarily limited to state taxes, and will continue at the low level of recent years. It will remain low until our loss carry forward is fully utilized, which is still a number of years out.
The biggest item not impacting either net income or adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was the $64 million net receipt of revenues related to the California provider fee. Due to delays in a very complex approval process, this materially favorable event was not recognized in the third quarter. The portion of the plan related to direct medical payments was approved after the end of the quarter, with the Managed Care portion still pending. We had expected that up to $55 million would be recognized in the third quarter. This delay has no affect on full year income but will cost some of the cash receipts to slip out of this year into next, which we estimate at a net $36 million.
Looking forward to next year, the California provider fee may be renewed for a half year, and a new fee in Pennsylvania worth approximately $25 million is in the process of development. Other states are also working on these types of arrangements. Just as food for thought, if you put the normalized 2010 value of the California provider fee at $37 million, but Pennsylvania fee and a partial extension of the California fee could more than replace that. So you should not think of the revenue from the California provider fee as being entirely non-recurring and looking at next year. For a cash basis, the cash received from provider fees could actually go up next year.
Adjusting both quarters for prior cost quarter adjustments, revenues grew slightly in the third quarter as a result of strong commercial pricing and case mix, offset by adverse payer mix in aggregate declines in paying volumes. As in the prior quarters of this year, case mix on commercial Managed Care was strong relative to last year reflecting about a 3% increase. As I said in last quarter's comments, this increase in acuity has to be considered in understanding the economic effect of lower volume.
Our overall pricing picture remains positive. Even with the commercial volume declines we experienced in the quarter, commercial pricing gains were sufficient to drive growth of 0.9% in commercial revenues in the quarter. Because of the payer mix shift, however, net inpatient revenue per admission increased by only 1.1%, and net outpatient revenue per visit increased by 5.6%. 
The strong increase in outpatient pricing reflects the loss of H1N1 volumes from last year, which had generated lower revenues per outpatient visit. The absence of flu volumes in this year's third quarter drove average pricing higher. Once again, this demonstrates the necessity of understanding acuity and patient mix when assessing the economic effects of volume fluctuations.
While among the topic of pricing, I will comment that we continue to have very good visibility with regard to our forward pricing. At this point, approximately 80% of our commercial contracting is complete for 2011 and 40% for 2012. 
Turning to cost. Although the benefits weren't fully visible in the third quarter, we successfully took action to flex our cost structure. As Trevor mentioned, July's volumes were particularly weak. We responded very quickly to reduce our staffing and implemented the significant reduction for us in August. We incurred a couple of million in severance costs as part of this, but this August, the action left us well positioned for the balance of the quarter.  Those cut should also have full visibility in our fourth quarter. 
In addition, we have delayed our annual merit increases for the general population from October 1 to January 1. This takes us a step closer to timing our merit increases for all employees in the April time period where they used to be.
The result of these actions are merely evident in our internal measures of productivity, which looks at FTEs per adjusted average daily census. Despite the soft volumes in the quarter, this productivity measure actually improved in the third quarter as FTEs per adjusted average daily census declined in September by 1.2%.
Supplies cost were essentially flat in the quarter. On a per-adjusted patient-day basis, the increase in supplies cost was 2.6% as adverse operating leverage and the increase in acuity offset the effects of our supply cost initiatives. Because we recorded within other controllable cost line were more of a challenge. Many of the costs recorded in this heading are more heavily fixed or semi-variable in nature and as a result are more difficult to flex in response to soft volumes. 
We also recorded some incremental expense from items whose actual early determine impact is adversely influenced by declining interest rates. While now practice expenses increased by only $1 million relative to last year's third quarter, the decline in interest and therefore discount rates at $11 million to malpractice expense in the current quarter. Combined with an increase of $3 million in workers comp expense, lower discount rates added $14 million to operating expense in the quarter. This discount rate adjustment should be considered unusual at this point given low rates we were already seeing on U.S. Treasuries and can be expected to more than reversed itself in the future when interest rates rise to normal levels, thereby creating earnings upside of up to $40 million at some point in the future.
In addition, we recorded an incremental $4 million of HIT expense. As Trevor mentioned, we successfully went live on the first phase of the system of four of our hospitals in the month of October, and we now expect the internal effects of these expenses to be down to $11 million in 2010. We expect this incremental expense to increase in 2011 prior to being offset in 2012 by the recognition of federal incentive payments. This increase is now a deferral of 2010 expenses, but is reflective of the increase and number of implementations in 2011.
Our bad debt ratio declined to 8.3% in the quarter, a 20 basis point decline relative to 8.5% a year ago. This decline includes the recurring benefits of federal Medicare bad debt recoveries, as well as declines in uninsured volumes. We view the size of this quarter's Medicare bad debt recovery as representative of ongoing sustainable impacts that can be expected in future quarters.
We had $398 million in cash and cash equivalents at quarter end, a decrease of $313 million from June 30. The largest driver of the cash decline was the use of $274 million to reduce debt. Cash provided from continuing operations was $160 million, and adjusted free cash flow was $53 million after capital expenditures of $107 million in the quarter. 
In the third quarter year-to-date, our cash from operations has been held back by lower levels of accounts payable and in the prior year. Some of this is due to the timing of expenditures or aggressive disbursements. We've not changed policy or contractual arrangements however, and we expect payables to expand again by year end.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed the sale of a number of our Florida medical office buildings, generating cash of $46 million. As a part of the sale, the buyers committed to certain capital improvements to facilities, which will benefit our position Tenet's. These MOBs had immaterial annual ends and EBITDA. 
We continue to actually market additional MOBs, and we believe a number of these transactions could be completed in the next few quarters. At this point, we have other MOB sales contracts pending worth approximately $50 million, but in real estate, nothing is done until it closes so there's not reflected in our outlook.
Turning to our outlook. We have raised the lower end of our outlook to a new range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. We raised both ends of the range of pretax income, reflecting lower depreciation and interest expense. Our revised assumptions are detailed on Slide 24. This revision includes the lowering of our volume and revenue estimates, which are tied to a later reductions in our cost estimates for the balance of the year. 
There's been speculation that volumes will grow in the fourth quarter of more than a seasonal basis due to the effects of co-pays and deductibles. At this point, we're going to be conservative and not count on that in our outlook. The walk forward of cash from September 30 to December 31 is provided on Slide 25 breaks down fourth quarter cash flow into its major components. 
It's too early to give an outlook for 2011, but I do think it's appropriate to give a little balance to what the headwinds and opportunities are going into next year. First, the biggest challenge remains on the volume side, but some of the effects of the economy and flu should have average rate by the end of this year. Economic stability followed by recovery would presumably create upside. Second, we expect the full year benefit on the outpatient acquisition we're completing on the second half of this year and a partial benefit of those we're targeting for next year.
Third, we're already seeing improvement in the yield on our physician additions the last couple of years, and we expect expansion of that benefit in 2011 and beyond. Fourth, commercial pricing is almost completely negotiated with reasonable existent price increases expected next year. Medicare, all in, is basically flat as outpatient increases offset inpatient decreases. I've already talked about state signing and potentially new provider fees with the 2009 retroactive portion of the California provider fee being the one element most challenging to replace.
Finally on the cost side, we will increase our investment in our physician base and HIT both of which will yield improvements for the future. And we will continue to drive on our Medicare performance and related initiatives to reduce link to stay in supply costs. 
In the aggregate, we will continue to drive toward industry margins. We have confidence in the path we have laid out. The only gating consideration in what the near-term timing and slow for progress is going to be is the degree of economic headwinds we must offset. On the positive side for 2011, we expect to drive value in the outpatient investments, position base initiatives, commercial pricing and the Medicare performance initiative. The big potential near-term negative, longer-term appositive is, as I just said, the effect of economic conditions. It is not clear and therefore remains subject to continuing evaluation by us as to what extent economic conditions will offset the net positive drivers of growth in 2011.
So to summarize. The value of our NOL carryforwards has been confirmed from accounting standpoint. We have raised our outlook for EBITDA and pretax and net income for the year. We approved cost efficiencies in the quarter, as we were able to react quickly to significant volume declines in the first month of the quarter. This will be fully visible in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow came under pressure due to the timing of disbursements in rising CapEx. But because of the timing effects on accounts payable will reverse themselves, we have retained our free cash flow outlook for the year. Pricing continued as the source of strength. Commercial case mix remained favorable compared to the prior year. California provider fee, has been partially approved while full approval expected this quarter. 
And one last point. From a volume and payer mix standpoint, this was the weakest quarter we've experienced, clearly reflective of the economic headwinds. However, the fact that we held earnings flat on a normalized basis and even in this harsh environment demonstrates that we are well positioned to grow earnings as the economy moderates and/or as our volume initiatives yield increasing results.

And conversely, where we've seen these physician competition phenomenon that has really created new capacity and a new entrant into a market that's very aggressive owned by physicians were they have the ability to direct patients, that in some of our markets with the lowest unemployment are the best trends in unemployment. So I would set aside the unemployment correlation. We've also seen some very strong volume performance in Florida, which is a market that's struggled for a long time. And that I think can be attributed to strong management actions and market working to see sizeably on business development activity. So you really -- at the risk of having added two paragraphs to my script on this volume side, I'm trying to convey an impression that there is not an overall trend, one way or another that you can point to or some correlation that it's really more one-off issues.

But we were trying to make the point that although I think the industry-wide volume weakness was well known throughout the quarter. There were plenty of surveys and other indicators that, that was taking place. What was surprisingly negative was July. And so, I mentioned that July was particularly weak and then we took actions to reduce cost. Of course, these actions couldn't be taken in July, they were taken in August and have that effect of creating a positive trajectory in EBITDA from July to August to September. And as volume losses moderated from July through August through mid-September, then they did turn down in late September, that's the implication of saying that they were strong through mid-September. So I think one way -- the thing I would characterize as being unusual in the third quarter at least for us was how negative the first month was and then the fact that although many in the industry anticipated some snap back in August was encouraging, that, that encouraging trend at least in terms of volume did not persist through the entire quarter. And then based on our comments about October, it didn't persist into October. but I think to answer your question about what we can do and how we've been able to offset weak volumes, obviously, it's very hard on a month-to-month basis, because it's easier on a quarterly basis and it gets easier to accomplish. I shouldn't use the word easy. That's not easy but it's less difficult to accomplish on a yearly basis. And so, if you look at the quarter as a whole, we really overcame a lot of challenge that we had right out of the box in July. But it's difficult to do more in a short period of time. I think we have positioned ourselves well going into the fourth quarter. But again, we don't even have the first month of results on that yet.

We compete against a lot of this in our markets and we have completely adopted, I think new and improved way to do this. So just to go in order of sort of the promise that we're doing about it. Purchasing practices is really not market practice anymore. It's employing physicians. So you don't have the problem from the 90s of spending a lot of capital on purchasing something that turns out to not be worth of what you paid for. So it's really hiring talent. And then in terms of hiring talent, we've become very sophisticated about how to do it in terms of providing incentives for productivity so we don't experience the next problem that was characteristic for the 90s, which is hiring physicians, which essentially was enabling them to retire at the expense of the hospital. So we're incentivizing productivity. And we've also experienced some churn of the employed physicians based on those who failed to meet the productivity target leaving and those who are succeeding in the productivity target staying and enjoying the benefits of that. We've also been very selective in terms of the credentials of the physicians that we've been hiring. So just as if you undertook to hire a cadre of 200 MBA students you want to go to the top schools and hire the best students, we're doing the same thing when it comes to physicians. We're also being very selective about filling certain holes and specialties or building primary-care networks, where that strategy is right. And then finally, rather than attempting to manage all these practices ourselves, we've employed in a joint venture format a practice management company that's an expert in doing this and running them at economic results that are superior to what hospitals generally experience. So I think, all of these things together and I didn't mention the EMR solution that we're offering for physicians, I think it's a better solution, and we probably got started later than we should have. And perhaps it's because of historic bias, at least on my part, against that as a strategy. But we are well into it now and have a very strong pipeline of physicians that we are employing.

It's very limiting. Based on my comments about outpatient, it appears that we are doing that, and we're very pleased to outpatient acquisitions that we're making. I would say that the potential acquisitions of the acute care hospitals that would be of interest to us or of the greatest interest to us, there are certainly more hospitals considering selling themselves or seeking partnerships of some kind. And we're spending more time than we ever have exploring those types of things. I think it's premature to talk about value and whether we would actually proceed and devote our capital in that way. What we haven't been doing, you obviously noticed is we have not been competing in the auctions that has been out there for standalone hospitals or possibles that or -- whatever other acute-care transactions are out there. I don't think we are necessarily the best potential acquirers for those kinds of things. Where we have been focused is more in our markets and things that have some degree of synergy, where we understand the market, we understand the dynamics and the future trends. And obviously, given the uncertainties around healthcare reforms something you have to take into consideration when you evaluate the hospitals. So for that reason, we've been most focused on the outpatient side. I think that you'll agree since we gave some disclosure on those numbers that those are incrementally very helpful acquisitions for us. We like that business and will continue to do that as much as possible. And then, with -- there maybe opportunities in the future within our Services business, which we're also very excited about, the multiple issue tends to present a barrier there, but we have to keep our eyes open on that as well.

So we've got to assess, if you will, what that means with respect to the implementation for next year have or we do have more implementations next year than this year. More hospitals will be in process, so we do expect the number to go up.

And of course, there's opportunity, they'll beyond with that to help drive towards the end of the range as well. From a revenue standpoint, we've just looked at what's real recent experience on volumes. And as I said, we didn't presume many kind of a hockey stick in the last two months of the year. But from an overall admit standpoint, at the middle of the range, we could be at a negative 4% to 5% and still hit the middle of the range and commercial still be in that 6% to 7% kind of range where we were at for the first half. Once again, be in the middle of the race. So those seem like based on everything we know, still some recent very conservative positions to be taken as we look at the underlying trends. So there's opportunity in my mind for us to do better than those of both on the cost side and on the volume side but as you know, we didn't take up the upper end of the range because we wanted to stay conservative and not presume that we're going to do better than those and left ourselves, I'd say to build a range based on those stats.

Well, I won’t blame you if you write reports saying that this is a noisy quarter. In summary, our earnings number was huge and we're raising the bottom end of our 2010 outlook. The volumes were soft, and the E",1675,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Well, I won’t blame you if you write reports saying that this is a noisy quarter. In summary, our earnings number was huge and we're raising the bottom end of our 2010 outlook. The volumes were soft, and the EBITDA is flat to 2009 if you make appropriate adjustments. 
We generated over $900 million in net income due to the accounting recognition of the value of our tax loss carryforward. Biggs will explain this further, but the key point is that while existence of the NOL has been well known, it should be more tangible to investors now that it's on the books.
Looking beyond net income, we were challenged by soft volumes in the quarter. We reacted to a particularly weak July by implementing a reduction in force in August. The impact of this action to reduce costs along with improved volume trends after July led to a positive earnings trend in the quarter in which EBITDA grew steadily from July to August to September. 
It's worth noting that we faced a very tough comparison this year as adjusted EBITDA was up 50% in the third quarter last year. Once you allow for year-over-year variability, our longer-term EBITDA trend remains strong. You can see the variability and the clear long-term trend demonstrated on Slide 4.
Clearly, our growth has been very strong but not as steady as I'd like. When you make your assessment of our growth in EBITDA in the quarter, please consider the items on Slide 5. The third quarter of 2009 included three favorable items contributing a total of $20 million. We called out these items on last year's third quarter call, and nearly all of you noted them when assessing our performance. 
In contrast, this year's third quarter includes items with a net unfavorable impact of $16 million. In total, these items created a $36 million unfavorable swing from the third quarter of 2009 to this year's quarter. Net of these items, this quarter was essentially unchanged.
As I mentioned earlier, we're raising the bottom end of our outlook for 2010 EBITDA to a new range of $1,050,000,000 to $1.1 billion. This is the second time this year we've increased one or both ends of the range. Volumes were certainly weaker than we originally anticipated, but this has been offset by stronger pricing, enhanced acuity and excellent cost control. We're also benefiting from the California provider fee being larger than we forecast and health IT spending being less than we anticipated.
Soft volumes were a dominant theme across the industry last quarter, so I'd like to give you some color on our experience. The overall takeaway’s that the volume declines were contained to a small number of hospitals, and once again a single service line. OB accounted for a full third of our volume loss.
Total admissions declined 3.5%, and commercial admissions declined 8.6% in the quarter. July was by far our weakest month for patient volumes. The trend was more encouraging in August and through mid-September. Through the first 28 days of October, commercial admissions trended slightly better than in Q3 but total admissions were slightly weaker.
As you can see on Slide 7, outpatient visits were down 2% in the third quarter. Emergency department outpatient visits were down 1.7% in the quarter, but just over 70% of that decline is due to a reduction in flu, so non-flu ED visits are basically flat year-over-year. Outpatient surgeries were up modestly, increasing by 0.1% and adjusted admissions were down only 1.8%.
The volume losses this quarter and this year have been confined to a small number of hospitals. In fact, just seven hospitals comprise more than 70% of our total admissions declines in the third quarter. So while these seven hospitals cost the majority of our volume losses, the other 42 hospitals in the aggregate are performing better than the industry average. 
The seven hospitals are widely dispersed. There are two in Texas, but they're not in the same market. The other five are each in different states. Interestingly, although California is challenged by extremely high unemployment in some of our markets, none of our California hospitals are among the seven.
There is no single theme for the volume losses at these seven hospitals. One of the hospitals is having a solid and growing year, but faced an extremely tough comparison on volumes in Q3. Another one lost to unprofitable volume. Those two, plus three others, grew EBITDA significantly despite their volume losses. 
The two others saw challenges with their physician channels. These are instances where physicians have gone into direct competition with the hospitals, or where competing hospitals have engaged in very aggressive and sudden physician employment strategies. No matter the reason for the volume declines, we're responding appropriately, and we believe that we are already turning the losses around. In October, in these seven hospitals, while still down, the volumes were down by a lower percentage than in the third quarter.
Turning to service lines. I already mentioned that a third of the total volume decline was in OB. Looking beyond OB to some elective service lines, I'd like to share some interesting insights with you. As we're deep into the recession, it's very clear that patients who have a significant personal financial responsibility are behaving very differently than patients who don't. We've known all along that this was driving reductions in our commercial elective surgical volumes. But let me give you some facts that our orthopedic surgeries as an example.
If you look at Slide 10, you'll see that total admissions for orthopedic surgeries declined by 2.5%. Commercially insured orthopedic surgeries declined by 9%. Orthopedic surgeries for all other patients, most of whom are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, actually increased 0.2%. 
The same pattern is true with spinal fusions. Commercially insured spinal fusions declined by 160 admissions or 15% in the third quarter, but noncommercial spinal fusions increased by 17% or over 150 admissions in the quarter. Since the same physicians are doing these surgeries for both payer classes, the loss of commercial volumes and the growth of noncommercial volumes suggests this behavior is being driven by the patients, not the physicians. We believe this patient behavior is largely related to economic uncertainty on the part of the patients, commercial enrollment losses and rising co-pays and deductibles for those who remain insured.
Again, on Slide 10, you can see this pattern holds true across several service lines that we would consider as elective and easy to defer. Slide 11 illustrates that when a procedure is harder to defer, like in the case of OB, the changes in volumes in the commercial and noncommercial populations are very similar. 
Despite the challenges to volume growth, favorable pricing and acuity continue to drive a stable picture for revenues. Commercial pricing remains particularly strong. We also had a 2.4% increase in commercial acuity. The result was positive commercial revenue growth of nearly 1% for the quarter. Collectively, this helped us generate adjusted free cash flow of $53 million in Q3, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to positive $74 million. 
We've made a lot of progress on other fronts in the quarter. We continue to improve and de-risk our capital structure, pushing out the majority of our 2013 maturities to 2020, while retiring $229 million face value of debt. This brings our total debt to slightly more than $4 billion with no meaningful maturities for five years. We also entered into a new $800 million credit line with new flexibility with regard to our capital allocation options, including lifting an existing limitation on stock repurchases.
Earlier this year, we drew your attention to the seven items on Slide 14, which we believe can drive significant expansion in earnings growth over the next few years. While some of these items depend on a recovering economy, three of these initiatives, Outpatient, Medicare Performance Initiative and Conifer, were more directly under our control and less dependent on an economic recovery.
Just walking down the list for a minute, our newly acquired outpatient centers are already coming online. We expect to have invested about $70 million in outpatient acquisitions by the end of 2010 and believe there are enough great opportunities that we could do that again in 2011. We anticipate these acquisitions will add $100 million to $150 million to revenues in 2011, and given the much higher margins in this business, contribute as much as $30 million to $40 million in 2011 EBITDA.
Turning to MPI, we are very much on track with our 2010 objective of a $30 million incremental EBITDA contribution. While we have not yet completed our MPI plan for 2011, our preliminary view is for another $30 million. Conifer will take longer to gain visibility, but we remain very excited about its prospects. Conifer's contributions from outside clients to 2011's EBITDA growth will exceed $10 million.
Our healthcare information technology initiative will again create incremental expenses in 2011. And as previously disclosed, we are not planning on a net positive net financial contribution from the initiative prior to 2012. Earlier last month, we went live at four hospitals, and the rollout went smoothly. We're going live at an additional three hospitals this month.
In addition, we continue to achieve solid commercial pricing that's consistent with the trends of recent years. To make major progress on margin expansion and EBITDA growth, we need volume growth and to go back towards prerecession bad debt expense levels. But it's still clear there's much we can achieve even in the absence of recovery.
So to wrap up, I believe we demonstrated once again that we have the appropriate and effective levers to pull in the short term to keep us on track relative to our longer-term performance milestone. I also believe our long-term growth strategies have us well positioned to face the myriad of challenges that 2011 will bring. 
And with that, let me turn the floor over to Biggs Porter, our Chief Financial Officer. Biggs?"
107911,114307236,84399,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. The biggest item impacting our net income for the quarter is a recognition of the tax benefit of our net operating loss carryforward. This recognition resulted from our reversal of the previously-established",2155,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. The biggest item impacting our net income for the quarter is a recognition of the tax benefit of our net operating loss carryforward. This recognition resulted from our reversal of the previously-established valuation allowance and added $981 million to our net income or $1.75 per diluted share. 
Under generally accepted accounting principles, which arguably are conservative on this point, and in recognition of our sustained and sustainable return to profitability, the realization of this tax benefits has become sufficiently likely as to require its recognition in our financial statements. Given the conservative criteria applied in our GAAP, this makes a strong statement about the expectations of our future profitability and the value of the NOL.
As a result of this recognition, our income statement tax rate in future quarters will approximate a normalized tax rate of approximately 40%. From a cash perspective, however, we will continue to benefit from the tax shield, and our cash tax payments on future income will be primarily limited to state taxes, and will continue at the low level of recent years. They will remain low until our loss carryforward is fully utilized, which is still a number of years out.
The biggest item not impacting either net income or adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was the $64 million net receipt of revenues related to the California provider fee. Due to delays and a very complex approval process, this materially favorable event was not recognized in the third quarter. The portion of the plan related to direct medical payments was approved after the end of the quarter, with the Managed Care portion still pending. We had expected that up to $55 million would be recognized in the third quarter. This delay has no affect on full year income but will cause some of the cash receipts to slip out of this year into next, which we estimate at a net $36 million.
Looking forward to next year, the California provider fee may be renewed for a half year, and a new fee in Pennsylvania worth approximately $25 million is in the process of development. Other states are also working on these types of arrangements. Just as food for thought, if you put the normalized 2010 value of the California provider fee at $37 million, the Pennsylvania fee and a partial extension of the California fee could more than replace that. So you should not think of the revenue from the California provider fee as being entirely non-recurring in looking at next year. From a cash basis, the cash received from provider fees could actually go up next year.
Adjusting both quarters for prior-year cost report adjustments, revenues grew slightly in the third quarter as a result of strong commercial pricing and case mix, offset by adverse payer mix and aggregate declines in paying volumes. As in the prior quarters of this year, case mix on commercial Managed Care was strong relative to last year, reflecting about a 3% increase. As I said in last quarter's comments, this increase in acuity has to be considered in understanding the economic effect of lower volume.
Our overall pricing picture remains positive. Even with the commercial volume declines we experienced in the quarter, commercial pricing gains were sufficient to drive growth of 0.9% in commercial revenues in the quarter. Because of the payer mix shift, however, net inpatient revenue per admission increased by only 1.1%, and net outpatient revenue per visit increased by 5.6%. 
The strong increase in outpatient pricing reflects the loss of H1N1 volumes from last year, which had generated lower revenues per outpatient visit. The absence of flu volumes in this year's third quarter drove average pricing higher. Once again, this demonstrates the necessity of understanding acuity and patient mix when assessing the economic effects of volume fluctuations.
While I’m on the topic of pricing, I will comment that we continue to have very good visibility with regard to our forward pricing. At this point, approximately 80% of our commercial contracting is complete for 2011 and 40% for 2012. 
Turning to cost. Although the benefits weren't fully visible in the third quarter, we successfully took action to flex our cost structure. As Trevor mentioned, July's volumes were particularly weak. We responded very quickly to reduce our staffing and implemented a significant reduction in force in August. We incurred a couple of million in severance costs as part of this, but this August action left us well positioned for the balance of the quarter. Those cuts should also have full visibility in our fourth quarter. 
In addition, we have delayed our annual merit increases for the general population from October 1 to January 1. This takes us a step closer to timing our merit increases for all employees in the April time period where they used to be.
The result of these actions are immediately evident in our internal measures of productivity, which looks at FTEs per adjusted average daily census. Despite the soft volumes in the quarter, this productivity measure actually improved in the third quarter as FTEs per adjusted average daily census declined in September by 1.2%.
Supplies cost were essentially flat in the quarter. On a per-adjusted patient-day basis, the increase in supplies cost was 2.6% as adverse operating leverage and the increase in acuity offset the effects of our supply cost initiatives. The costs we recorded within other controllable costs line were more of a challenge. Many of the costs recorded under this heading are more heavily fixed or semi-variable in nature and, as a result, are more difficult to flex in response to soft volumes. 
We also recorded some incremental expense from items whose actuarially determined impact is adversely influenced by declining interest rates. While malpractice expenses increased by only $1 million relative to last year's third quarter, the decline in interest and therefore discount rates added $11 million to malpractice expense in the current quarter. Combined with an increase of $3 million in workers’ comp expense, lower discount rates added $14 million to operating expense in the quarter. This discount rate adjustment should be considered unusual at this point given the low rates we were already seeing on U.S. Treasuries and can be expected to more than reverse itself in the future when interest rates rise to normal levels, thereby creating earnings upside of up to $40 million at some point in the future.
In addition, we recorded an incremental $4 million in HIT expense. As Trevor mentioned, we successfully went live on the first phase of these systems at four of our hospitals in the month of October, and we now expect the incremental effects of these expenses to be down to $11 million in 2010. We expect this incremental expense to increase in 2011 prior to being offset in 2012 by the recognition of federal incentive payments. This increase is not a deferral of 2010 expenses, but is reflective of the increase in a number of implementations in 2011.
Our bad debt ratio declined to 8.3% in the quarter, a 20 basis point decline relative to 8.5% a year ago. This decline includes the recurring benefits of federal Medicare bad debt recoveries as well as declines in uninsured volumes. We view the size of this quarter's Medicare bad debt recovery as representative of ongoing sustainable impacts that can be expected in future quarters.
We had $398 million in cash and cash equivalents at quarter end, a decrease of $313 million from June 30. The largest driver of the cash decline was the use of $274 million to reduce debt. Cash provided from continuing operations was $160 million, and adjusted free cash flow was $53 million after capital expenditures of $107 million in the quarter. 
In the third quarter year-to-date, our cash from operations has been held back by lower levels of accounts payable than in the prior year. Some of this is due to the timing of expenditures, overdrafts and disbursements. We've not changed policy or contractual arrangements, however, and we expect payables to expand again by year end.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed the sale of a number of our Florida medical office buildings, generating cash of $46 million. As a part of the sale, the buyers committed to certain capital improvements to the facilities, which will benefit our physician tenants. These MOBs had immaterial annual rents and EBITDA. 
We continue to actively market additional MOBs, and we believe a number of these transactions could be completed in the next few quarters. At this point, we have other MOB contracts pending worth approximately $50 million, but in real estate, nothing is done until it closes, so it is not reflected in our outlook.
Turning to our outlook. We have raised the low end of our outlook to a new range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. We raised both ends of the range on pretax income, reflecting lower depreciation and interest expense. Our revised assumptions are detailed on Slide 24. These revision includes the lowering of our volume and revenue estimates, which are tied to related reductions in our cost estimates for the balance of the year. 
There's been speculation that volumes will grow in the fourth quarter on more than a seasonal basis due to the effects of co-pays and deductibles. At this point, we're going to be conservative and not count on that in our outlook. The walk-forward of cash from September 30 to December 31 is provided on Slide 25 breaks down fourth quarter cash flow into its major components. 
It's too early to give an outlook for 2011, but I do think it's appropriate to give a little balance to what the headwinds and opportunities are going into next year. First, the biggest challenge remains on the volume side, but some of the effects of the economy and flu should have anniversaried by the end of this year. Economic stability followed by recovery would presumably create upside. Second, we expect the full year benefit on the outpatient acquisitions we're completing on the second half of this year and a partial benefit of those we are targeting for next year.
Third, we're already seeing improvement in the yield on our physician additions the last couple of years, and we expect expansion of that benefit in 2011 and beyond. Fourth, commercial pricing is almost completely negotiated with reasonable consistent price increases expected next year. Medicare, all in, is basically flat as outpatient increases offset inpatient decreases. I've already talked about state funding and potential new provider fees with the 2009 retroactive portion of the California provider fee being the one element most challenging to replace.
Finally on the cost side, we will increase our investment in our physician base and HIT, both of which will yield improvements for the future. And we will continue to drive on our Medicare Performance and related initiatives to reduce length of stay and supply costs. 
In the aggregate, we will continue to drive toward industry margins. We have confidence in the path we have laid out. The only gating consideration in what the near-term timing and slope of progress is going to be is the degree of economic headwinds we must offset. On the positive side for 2011, we expect to drive value in outpatient investments, physician base initiatives, commercial pricing and the Medicare Performance Initiative. The big potential near-term negative, longer-term a positive is, as I just said, the effect of economic conditions. It is not clear and therefore remains subject to continuing evaluation by us, as to what extent economic conditions will offset the net positive drivers of growth in 2011.
So to summarize. The value of our NOL carryforward has been confirmed from an accounting standpoint. We have raised our outlook for EBITDA at pretax and net income for the year. We approved cost efficiencies in the quarter, as we were able to react quickly to significant volume declines in the first months of the quarter. This will be fully visible in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow came under pressure due to the timing of disbursements in rising CapEx. But because of the timing effects on accounts payable will reverse themselves, we have retained our free cash flow outlook for the year. Pricing continued as a source of strength. Commercial case mix remained favorable compared to the prior year. California provider fee has been partially approved while full approval expected this quarter. 
And one last point. From a volume and payer mix standpoint, this was the weakest quarter we've experienced, clearly reflective of the economic headwinds. However, the fact that we held earnings flat on a normalized basis and even in this harsh an environment demonstrates that we are well positioned to grow earnings as the economy moderates and/or as our volume initiatives yield increasing results.

We have demonstrated high quality. They assess that themselves. So I don't need to convince them of that. And our price point relative to our competitors in virtually all of our markets is certainly not the highest, and sometimes it's on the low end of the market pricing, and typically with a large, prominent, successful, not-for-profit system leading the way on pricing. So I feel that we are well positioned with the national payers from a value point of view. We're also exceedingly well positioned when they look at the total cost of doing business with us because we have streamlined and automated the revenue cycle process with them. So we have lowered -- they tell us, we have lower-than-average denials.

But we were trying to make the point that although I think the industry-wide volume weakness was well known throughout the quarter, there were plenty of surveys and other indicators that, that was taking place; what was surprisingly negative was July. And so I mentioned that July was particularly weak and then we took actions to reduce cost. Of course, those actions couldn't be taken in July; they were taken in August and had that effect of creating a positive trajectory in EBITDA from July to August to September. And as volume losses moderated from July through August through mid-September, then they did turn down in late September; that's the implication of saying that they were strong through mid-September. So I think one way -- the thing I would characterize as being unusual in the third quarter at least for us was how negative the first month was and then the fact that although many in the industry anticipated some snap back and August was encouraging, that, that encouraging trend at least in terms of volume did not persist through the entire quarter. And then based on our comments about October, it didn't persist into October. But I think to answer your question about what we can do and how we've been able to offset weak volumes, obviously, it's very hard on a month-to-month basis; it gets easier on a quarterly basis and it gets easier to accomplish. I shouldn't use the word easy because it’s not easy, but it's less difficult to accomplish on a yearly basis. And so, if you look at the quarter as a whole, we really overcame a lot of challenge that we had right out of the box in July. But it's difficult to do more in a short period of time. I think we have positioned ourselves well going into the fourth quarter. But again, we don't even have the first month of results on that yet."

But this is a trend that is inexorable. It started with the large, most prosperous not-for-profits. We compete against a lot of those in our markets and we have completely adopted a, I think, new and improved way to do this. So just to go in order of sort of the problems and what we're doing about it, purchasing practices is really not market practice anymore. It's employing physicians. So you don't have the problem from the ‘90s of spending a lot of capital on purchasing something that turns out to not be worth of what you paid for it. So it's really hiring talent. And then in terms of hiring talent, we've become very sophisticated about how to do it in terms of providing incentives for productivity so we don't experience the next problem that was characteristic for the ‘90s, which is hiring physicians, which essentially was enabling them to retire at the expense of the hospital. So we're incentivizing productivity. And we've also experienced some churn of the employee physicians based on those who failed to meet the productivity targets leaving and those who are succeeding in the productivity targets staying and enjoying the benefits of that. We've also been very selective in terms of the credentials of the physicians that we've been hiring. So just as if you undertook to hire a cadre of 200 MBA students, you’d want to go to the top schools and hire the best students; we're doing the same thing when it comes to physicians. We're also being very selective about filling certain holes in specialties or building primary-care networks, where that strategy is right. And then finally, rather than attempting to manage all these practices ourselves, we've employed in a joint venture format a practice management company that's an expert in doing this and running them at economic results that are superior to what hospitals generally experience. So I think all of those things together and I didn't mention the EMR solution that we're offering for physicians, so I think it's a better solution, and we probably got started later than we should have. And perhaps it's because of historic bias, at least on my part, against that as a strategy. But we are well into it now and have a very strong pipeline of physicians that we are employing."

Based on my comments about outpatient, it appears that we are doing that, and we're very pleased with the outpatient acquisitions that we're making. I would say that the potential acquisitions of acute care hospitals that would be of interest to us or of the greatest interest to us, there are certainly more hospitals considering selling themselves or seeking partnerships of some kind. And we're spending more time than we ever have exploring those types of things. I think it's premature to talk about value and whether we would actually proceed and devote our capital in that way. What we haven't been doing, you obviously noticed, is we have not been competing in the auctions that have been out there for standalone hospitals or hospitals that are distressed or whatever other acute-care transactions are out there. I don't think we are necessarily the best potential acquirers for those kinds of things. Where we have been focused is more in our markets of things that have some degree of synergy, where we understand the market, we understand the dynamics and the future trends. And obviously, given the uncertainties around healthcare reform, is something you have to take into consideration when you evaluate the hospitals. So for that reason, we've been most focused on the outpatient side. I think that you'll agree, since we gave some disclosure on those numbers, that those are incrementally very helpful acquisitions for us. We like that business and will continue to do that as much as possible. And then, with -- there may be opportunities in the future within our Services business, which we're also very excited about.

And so, given the sort of rapidly decreasing expectations of inflation and also the observations we made of competitive practice declining in terms of the increases that competitors appear to be giving to people, what we've decided to do was to implement the program effective January 1, but to tell people in advance what they would get. So I think it's a very good solution from a cost management perspective. It also administratively will simplify our administration of these programs in the future.

So that's at the middle of the range. And of course, there's opportunity to go beyond that to help drive towards the other end of the range as well. From a revenue standpoint, we've just looked at what's real recent experience on volumes. And as I said, we didn't presume any kind of a hockey stick in the last two months of the year. But from an overall admit standpoint, at the middle of the range, we could be at a negative 4% to 5% and still hit the middle of the range and commercial still be in that 6% to 7% kind of range that we were at in the first half. Once again, it would be at the middle of the range. So those seem like, based on everything we know, still some reasonably conservative positions to be taking as we look at the underlying trends. So there's opportunity in my mind for us to do better than those, both on the cost side and on the volume side, but as you know, we didn't take up the upper end of the range because we wanted to stay conservative and not presume that we were going to do better than those and lift ourselves, I'd say, to build a range based on those stats."

In summary, our earnings number was huge and we're raising the bottom end of our 2010 outlook. The volumes were soft, and the EBITDA is flat to 2009 if you make appropriate adjustments. 
We generated over $900 million in net income due to the accounting recognition of the value of our tax loss carryforward. Biggs will explain this further, but the key point is that while existence of the NOL has been well known, it should be more tangible to investors now that it's on the books.
Looking beyond net income, we were challenged by soft volumes in the quarter. We reacted to a particularly weak July by implementing a reduction in force in August. The impact of this action to reduce costs along with improved volume trends after July led to a positive earnings trend in the quarter in which EBITDA grew steadily from July to August to September. 
It's worth noting that we faced a very tough comparison this year as adjusted EBITDA was up 50% in the third quarter last year. Once you allow for year-over-year variability, our longer-term EBITDA trend remains strong. You can see the variability and the clear long-term trend demonstrated on Slide 4.
Clearly, our growth has been very strong but not as steady as I'd like. When you make your assessment of our growth in EBITDA in the quarter, please consider the items on Slide 5. The third quarter of 2009 included three favorable items contributing a total of $20 million. We called out these items on last year's third quarter call, and nearly all of you noted them when assessing our performance. 
In contrast, this year's third quarter includes items with a net unfavorable impact of $16 million. In total, these items created a $36 million unfavorable swing from the third quarter of 2009 to this year's quarter. Net of these items, this quarter was essentially unchanged.
As I mentioned earlier, we're raising the bottom end of our outlook for 2010 EBITDA to a new range of $1,050,000,000 to $1.1 billion. This is the second time this year we've increased one or both ends of the range. Volumes were certainly weaker than we originally anticipated, but this has been offset by stronger pricing, enhanced acuity and excellent cost control. We're also benefiting from the California provider fee being larger than we forecast and health IT spending being less than we anticipated.
Soft volumes were a dominant theme across the industry last quarter, so I'd like to give you some color on our experience. The overall takeaway’s that the volume declines were contained to a small number of hospitals, and once again a single service line. OB accounted for a full third of our volume loss.
Total admissions declined 3.5%, and commercial admissions declined 8.6% in the quarter. July was by far our weakest month for patient volumes. The trend was more encouraging in August and through mid-September. Through the first 28 days of October, commercial admissions trended slightly better than in Q3 but total admissions were slightly weaker.
As you can see on Slide 7, outpatient visits were down 2% in the third quarter. Emergency department outpatient visits were down 1.7% in the quarter, but just over 70% of that decline is due to a reduction in flu, so non-flu ED visits are basically flat year-over-year. Outpatient surgeries were up modestly, increasing by 0.1% and adjusted admissions were down only 1.8%.
The volume losses this quarter and this year have been confined to a small number of hospitals. In fact, just seven hospitals comprise more than 70% of our total admissions declines in the third quarter. So while these seven hospitals cost the majority of our volume losses, the other 42 hospitals in the aggregate are performing better than the industry average. 
The seven hospitals are widely dispersed. There are two in Texas, but they're not in the same market. The other five are each in different states. Interestingly, although California is challenged by extremely high unemployment in some of our markets, none of our California hospitals are among the seven.
There is no single theme for the volume losses at these seven hospitals. One of the hospitals is having a solid and growing year, but faced an extremely tough comparison on volumes in Q3. Another one lost to unprofitable volume. Those two, plus three others, grew EBITDA significantly despite their volume losses. 
The two others saw challenges with their physician channels. These are instances where physicians have gone into direct competition with the hospitals, or where competing hospitals have engaged in very aggressive and sudden physician employment strategies. No matter the reason for the volume declines, we're responding appropriately, and we believe that we are already turning the losses around. In October, in these seven hospitals, while still down, the volumes were down by a lower percentage than in the third quarter.
Turning to service lines. I already mentioned that a third of the total volume decline was in OB. Looking beyond OB to some elective service lines, I'd like to share some interesting insights with you. As we're deep into the recession, it's very clear that patients who have a significant personal financial responsibility are behaving very differently than patients who don't. We've known all along that this was driving reductions in our commercial elective surgical volumes. But let me give you some facts that our orthopedic surgeries as an example.
If you look at Slide 10, you'll see that total admissions for orthopedic surgeries declined by 2.5%. Commercially insured orthopedic surgeries declined by 9%. Orthopedic surgeries for all other patients, most of whom are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, actually increased 0.2%. 
The same pattern is true with spinal fusions. Commercially insured spinal fusions declined by 160 admissions or 15% in the third quarter, but noncommercial spinal fusions increased by 17% or over 150 admissions in the quarter. Since the same physicians are doing these surgeries for both payer classes, the loss of commercial volumes and the growth of noncommercial volumes suggests this behavior is being driven by the patients, not the physicians. We believe this patient behavior is largely related to economic uncertainty on the part of the patients, commercial enrollment losses and rising co-pays and deductibles for those who remain insured.
Again, on Slide 10, you can see this pattern holds true across several service lines that we would consider as elective and easy to defer. Slide 11 illustrates that when a procedure is harder to defer, like in the case of OB, the changes in volumes in the commercial and noncommercial populations are very similar. 
Despite the challenges to volume growth, favorable pricing and acuity continue to drive a stable picture for revenues. Commercial pricing remains particularly strong. We also had a 2.4% increase in commercial acuity. The result was positive commercial revenue growth of nearly 1% for the quarter. Collectively, this helped us generate adjusted free cash flow of $53 million in Q3, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to positive $74 million. 
We've made a lot of progress on other fronts in the quarter. We continue to improve and de-risk our capital structure, pushing out the majority of our 2013 maturities to 2020, while retiring $229 million face value of debt. This brings our total debt to slightly more than $4 billion with no meaningful maturities for five years. We also entered into a new $800 million credit line with new flexibility with regard to our capital allocation options, including lifting an existing limitation on stock repurchases.
Earlier this year, we drew your attention to the seven items on Slide 14, which we believe can drive significant expansion in earnings growth over the next few years. While some of these items depend on a recovering economy, three of these initiatives, Outpatient, Medicare Performance Initiative and Conifer, were more directly under our control and less dependent on an economic recovery.
Just walking down the list for a minute, our newly acquired outpatient centers are already coming online. We expect to have invested about $70 million in outpatient acquisitions by the end of 2010 and believe there are enough great opportunities that we could do that again in 2011. We anticipate these acquisitions will add $100 million to $150 million to revenues in 2011, and given the much higher margins in this business, contribute as much as $30 million to $40 million in 2011 EBITDA.
Turning to MPI, we are very much on track with our 2010 objective of a $30 million incremental EBITDA contribution. While we have not yet completed our MPI plan for 2011, our preliminary view is for another $30 million. Conifer will take longer to gain visibility, but we remain very excited about its prospects. Conifer's contributions from outside clients to 2011's EBITDA growth will exceed $10 million.
Our healthcare information technology initiative will again create incremental expenses in 2011. And as previously disclosed, we are not planning on a net positive net financial contribution from the initiative prior to 2012. Earlier last month, we went live at four hospitals, and the rollout went smoothly. We're going live at an additional three hospitals this month.
In addition, we continue to achieve solid commercial pricing that's consistent with the trends of recent years. To make major progress on margin expansion and EBITDA growth, we need volume growth and to go back towards prerecession bad debt expense levels. But it's still clear there's much we can achieve even in the absence of recovery.
So to wrap up, I believe we demonstrated once again that we have the appropriate and effective levers to pull in the short term to keep us on track relative to our longer-term performance milestone. I also believe our long-term growth strategies have us well positioned to face the myriad of challenges that 2011 will bring. 
And with that, let me turn the floor over to Biggs Porter, our Chief Financial Officer. Biggs?"
107911,114307236,84546,"Tenet Healthcare Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Tenet Healthcare Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. The biggest item impacting our net income for the quarter is a recognition of the tax benefit of our net operating loss carryforward. This recognition resulted from our reversal of the previously-established",2155,"Thank you, Trevor, and good morning, everyone. The biggest item impacting our net income for the quarter is a recognition of the tax benefit of our net operating loss carryforward. This recognition resulted from our reversal of the previously-established valuation allowance and added $981 million to our net income or $1.75 per diluted share. 
Under generally accepted accounting principles, which arguably are conservative on this point, and in recognition of our sustained and sustainable return to profitability, the realization of this tax benefits has become sufficiently likely as to require its recognition in our financial statements. Given the conservative criteria applied in our GAAP, this makes a strong statement about the expectations of our future profitability and the value of the NOL.
As a result of this recognition, our income statement tax rate in future quarters will approximate a normalized tax rate of approximately 40%. From a cash perspective, however, we will continue to benefit from the tax shield, and our cash tax payments on future income will be primarily limited to state taxes, and will continue at the low level of recent years. They will remain low until our loss carryforward is fully utilized, which is still a number of years out.
The biggest item not impacting either net income or adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was the $64 million net receipt of revenues related to the California provider fee. Due to delays and a very complex approval process, this materially favorable event was not recognized in the third quarter. The portion of the plan related to direct medical payments was approved after the end of the quarter, with the Managed Care portion still pending. We had expected that up to $55 million would be recognized in the third quarter. This delay has no affect on full year income but will cause some of the cash receipts to slip out of this year into next, which we estimate at a net $36 million.
Looking forward to next year, the California provider fee may be renewed for a half year, and a new fee in Pennsylvania worth approximately $25 million is in the process of development. Other states are also working on these types of arrangements. Just as food for thought, if you put the normalized 2010 value of the California provider fee at $37 million, the Pennsylvania fee and a partial extension of the California fee could more than replace that. So you should not think of the revenue from the California provider fee as being entirely non-recurring in looking at next year. From a cash basis, the cash received from provider fees could actually go up next year.
Adjusting both quarters for prior-year cost report adjustments, revenues grew slightly in the third quarter as a result of strong commercial pricing and case mix, offset by adverse payer mix and aggregate declines in paying volumes. As in the prior quarters of this year, case mix on commercial Managed Care was strong relative to last year, reflecting about a 3% increase. As I said in last quarter's comments, this increase in acuity has to be considered in understanding the economic effect of lower volume.
Our overall pricing picture remains positive. Even with the commercial volume declines we experienced in the quarter, commercial pricing gains were sufficient to drive growth of 0.9% in commercial revenues in the quarter. Because of the payer mix shift, however, net inpatient revenue per admission increased by only 1.1%, and net outpatient revenue per visit increased by 5.6%. 
The strong increase in outpatient pricing reflects the loss of H1N1 volumes from last year, which had generated lower revenues per outpatient visit. The absence of flu volumes in this year's third quarter drove average pricing higher. Once again, this demonstrates the necessity of understanding acuity and patient mix when assessing the economic effects of volume fluctuations.
While I’m on the topic of pricing, I will comment that we continue to have very good visibility with regard to our forward pricing. At this point, approximately 80% of our commercial contracting is complete for 2011 and 40% for 2012. 
Turning to cost. Although the benefits weren't fully visible in the third quarter, we successfully took action to flex our cost structure. As Trevor mentioned, July's volumes were particularly weak. We responded very quickly to reduce our staffing and implemented a significant reduction in force in August. We incurred a couple of million in severance costs as part of this, but this August action left us well positioned for the balance of the quarter. Those cuts should also have full visibility in our fourth quarter. 
In addition, we have delayed our annual merit increases for the general population from October 1 to January 1. This takes us a step closer to timing our merit increases for all employees in the April time period where they used to be.
The result of these actions are immediately evident in our internal measures of productivity, which looks at FTEs per adjusted average daily census. Despite the soft volumes in the quarter, this productivity measure actually improved in the third quarter as FTEs per adjusted average daily census declined in September by 1.2%.
Supplies cost were essentially flat in the quarter. On a per-adjusted patient-day basis, the increase in supplies cost was 2.6% as adverse operating leverage and the increase in acuity offset the effects of our supply cost initiatives. The costs we recorded within other controllable costs line were more of a challenge. Many of the costs recorded under this heading are more heavily fixed or semi-variable in nature and, as a result, are more difficult to flex in response to soft volumes. 
We also recorded some incremental expense from items whose actuarially determined impact is adversely influenced by declining interest rates. While malpractice expenses increased by only $1 million relative to last year's third quarter, the decline in interest and therefore discount rates added $11 million to malpractice expense in the current quarter. Combined with an increase of $3 million in workers’ comp expense, lower discount rates added $14 million to operating expense in the quarter. This discount rate adjustment should be considered unusual at this point given the low rates we were already seeing on U.S. Treasuries and can be expected to more than reverse itself in the future when interest rates rise to normal levels, thereby creating earnings upside of up to $40 million at some point in the future.
In addition, we recorded an incremental $4 million in HIT expense. As Trevor mentioned, we successfully went live on the first phase of these systems at four of our hospitals in the month of October, and we now expect the incremental effects of these expenses to be down to $11 million in 2010. We expect this incremental expense to increase in 2011 prior to being offset in 2012 by the recognition of federal incentive payments. This increase is not a deferral of 2010 expenses, but is reflective of the increase in a number of implementations in 2011.
Our bad debt ratio declined to 8.3% in the quarter, a 20 basis point decline relative to 8.5% a year ago. This decline includes the recurring benefits of federal Medicare bad debt recoveries as well as declines in uninsured volumes. We view the size of this quarter's Medicare bad debt recovery as representative of ongoing sustainable impacts that can be expected in future quarters.
We had $398 million in cash and cash equivalents at quarter end, a decrease of $313 million from June 30. The largest driver of the cash decline was the use of $274 million to reduce debt. Cash provided from continuing operations was $160 million, and adjusted free cash flow was $53 million after capital expenditures of $107 million in the quarter. 
In the third quarter year-to-date, our cash from operations has been held back by lower levels of accounts payable than in the prior year. Some of this is due to the timing of expenditures, overdrafts and disbursements. We've not changed policy or contractual arrangements, however, and we expect payables to expand again by year end.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed the sale of a number of our Florida medical office buildings, generating cash of $46 million. As a part of the sale, the buyers committed to certain capital improvements to the facilities, which will benefit our physician tenants. These MOBs had immaterial annual rents and EBITDA. 
We continue to actively market additional MOBs, and we believe a number of these transactions could be completed in the next few quarters. At this point, we have other MOB contracts pending worth approximately $50 million, but in real estate, nothing is done until it closes, so it is not reflected in our outlook.
Turning to our outlook. We have raised the low end of our outlook to a new range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. We raised both ends of the range on pretax income, reflecting lower depreciation and interest expense. Our revised assumptions are detailed on Slide 24. These revision includes the lowering of our volume and revenue estimates, which are tied to related reductions in our cost estimates for the balance of the year. 
There's been speculation that volumes will grow in the fourth quarter on more than a seasonal basis due to the effects of co-pays and deductibles. At this point, we're going to be conservative and not count on that in our outlook. The walk-forward of cash from September 30 to December 31 is provided on Slide 25 breaks down fourth quarter cash flow into its major components. 
It's too early to give an outlook for 2011, but I do think it's appropriate to give a little balance to what the headwinds and opportunities are going into next year. First, the biggest challenge remains on the volume side, but some of the effects of the economy and flu should have anniversaried by the end of this year. Economic stability followed by recovery would presumably create upside. Second, we expect the full year benefit on the outpatient acquisitions we're completing on the second half of this year and a partial benefit of those we are targeting for next year.
Third, we're already seeing improvement in the yield on our physician additions the last couple of years, and we expect expansion of that benefit in 2011 and beyond. Fourth, commercial pricing is almost completely negotiated with reasonable consistent price increases expected next year. Medicare, all in, is basically flat as outpatient increases offset inpatient decreases. I've already talked about state funding and potential new provider fees with the 2009 retroactive portion of the California provider fee being the one element most challenging to replace.
Finally on the cost side, we will increase our investment in our physician base and HIT, both of which will yield improvements for the future. And we will continue to drive on our Medicare Performance and related initiatives to reduce length of stay and supply costs. 
In the aggregate, we will continue to drive toward industry margins. We have confidence in the path we have laid out. The only gating consideration in what the near-term timing and slope of progress is going to be is the degree of economic headwinds we must offset. On the positive side for 2011, we expect to drive value in outpatient investments, physician base initiatives, commercial pricing and the Medicare Performance Initiative. The big potential near-term negative, longer-term a positive is, as I just said, the effect of economic conditions. It is not clear and therefore remains subject to continuing evaluation by us, as to what extent economic conditions will offset the net positive drivers of growth in 2011.
So to summarize. The value of our NOL carryforward has been confirmed from an accounting standpoint. We have raised our outlook for EBITDA at pretax and net income for the year. We approved cost efficiencies in the quarter, as we were able to react quickly to significant volume declines in the first months of the quarter. This will be fully visible in the fourth quarter. 
Free cash flow came under pressure due to the timing of disbursements in rising CapEx. But because of the timing effects on accounts payable will reverse themselves, we have retained our free cash flow outlook for the year. Pricing continued as a source of strength. Commercial case mix remained favorable compared to the prior year. California provider fee has been partially approved while full approval expected this quarter. 
And one last point. From a volume and payer mix standpoint, this was the weakest quarter we've experienced, clearly reflective of the economic headwinds. However, the fact that we held earnings flat on a normalized basis and even in this harsh an environment demonstrates that we are well positioned to grow earnings as the economy moderates and/or as our volume initiatives yield increasing results.

But we were trying to make the point that although I think the industry-wide volume weakness was well known throughout the quarter, there were plenty of surveys and other indicators that, that was taking place; what was surprisingly negative was July. And so I mentioned that July was particularly weak and then we took actions to reduce cost. Of course, those actions couldn't be taken in July; they were taken in August and had that effect of creating a positive trajectory in EBITDA from July to August to September. And as volume losses moderated from July through August through mid-September, then they did turn down in late September; that's the implication of saying that they were strong through mid-September. So I think one way -- the thing I would characterize as being unusual in the third quarter at least for us was how negative the first month was and then the fact that although many in the industry anticipated some snap back and August was encouraging, that, that encouraging trend at least in terms of volume did not persist through the entire quarter. And then based on our comments about October, it didn't persist into October. But I think to answer your question about what we can do and how we've been able to offset weak volumes, obviously, it's very hard on a month-to-month basis; it gets easier on a quarterly basis and it gets easier to accomplish. I shouldn't use the word easy because it’s not easy, but it's less difficult to accomplish on a yearly basis. And so, if you look at the quarter as a whole, we really overcame a lot of challenge that we had right out of the box in July. But it's difficult to do more in a short period of time. I think we have positioned ourselves well going into the fourth quarter. But again, we don't even have the first month of results on that yet."

But this is a trend that is inexorable. It started with the large, most prosperous not-for-profits. We compete against a lot of those in our markets and we have completely adopted a, I think, new and improved way to do this. So just to go in order of sort of the problems and what we're doing about it, purchasing practices is really not market practice anymore. It's employing physicians. So you don't have the problem from the ‘90s of spending a lot of capital on purchasing something that turns out to not be worth of what you paid for it. So it's really hiring talent. And then in terms of hiring talent, we've become very sophisticated about how to do it in terms of providing incentives for productivity so we don't experience the next problem that was characteristic for the ‘90s, which is hiring physicians, which essentially was enabling them to retire at the expense of the hospital. So we're incentivizing productivity. And we've also experienced some churn of the employee physicians based on those who failed to meet the productivity targets leaving and those who are succeeding in the productivity targets staying and enjoying the benefits of that. We've also been very selective in terms of the credentials of the physicians that we've been hiring. So just as if you undertook to hire a cadre of 200 MBA students, you’d want to go to the top schools and hire the best students; we're doing the same thing when it comes to physicians. We're also being very selective about filling certain holes in specialties or building primary-care networks, where that strategy is right. And then finally, rather than attempting to manage all these practices ourselves, we've employed in a joint venture format a practice management company that's an expert in doing this and running them at economic results that are superior to what hospitals generally experience. So I think all of those things together and I didn't mention the EMR solution that we're offering for physicians, so I think it's a better solution, and we probably got started later than we should have. And perhaps it's because of historic bias, at least on my part, against that as a strategy. But we are well into it now and have a very strong pipeline of physicians that we are employing."

I don't think it would make any sense to push it out farther. That's actually quite a conservative approach to a capital structure, which I think is appropriate given the risks in the business and the historic leverage that we've had. We've also obviously brought down the leverage ratios substantially. This new credit line offers us a lot of flexibility. We’re obviously not commenting today on the potential for share buybacks, but it's obviously something we couldn't even consider prior to this new credit line. So we'll just have to see depending on circumstances what we decide to do there. Biggs, did I leave anything out?"

Based on my comments about outpatient, it appears that we are doing that, and we're very pleased with the outpatient acquisitions that we're making. I would say that the potential acquisitions of acute care hospitals that would be of interest to us or of the greatest interest to us, there are certainly more hospitals considering selling themselves or seeking partnerships of some kind. And we're spending more time than we ever have exploring those types of things. I think it's premature to talk about value and whether we would actually proceed and devote our capital in that way. What we haven't been doing, you obviously noticed, is we have not been competing in the auctions that have been out there for standalone hospitals or hospitals that are distressed or whatever other acute-care transactions are out there. I don't think we are necessarily the best potential acquirers for those kinds of things. Where we have been focused is more in our markets of things that have some degree of synergy, where we understand the market, we understand the dynamics and the future trends. And obviously, given the uncertainties around healthcare reform, is something you have to take into consideration when you evaluate the hospitals. So for that reason, we've been most focused on the outpatient side. I think that you'll agree, since we gave some disclosure on those numbers, that those are incrementally very helpful acquisitions for us. We like that business and will continue to do that as much as possible. And then, with -- there may be opportunities in the future within our Services business, which we're also very excited about. The multiple issue tends to present a barrier there, but we have to keep our eyes open on that as well."

Real near term, comparing third quarter to the fourth quarter, other improvements we expect are on the malpractice and workers’ comp side where we took the hits in the third quarter for the discount rate. We expect those to not occur in the fourth quarter and possibly will have improvement again in the fourth quarter as a result of what continues to be good claims experience. Another thing looking at the third quarter, as I said, there was a couple million dollars of severance costs in there, so that was the cost of achieving the reductions and we don't expect that to occur in the fourth quarter in the future. So there's a number of things going on in addition to just the pure FTE reductions to be considered looking at or later [ph] (1:05:48) this year and on to the future.

So that's at the middle of the range. And of course, there's opportunity to go beyond that to help drive towards the other end of the range as well. From a revenue standpoint, we've just looked at what's real recent experience on volumes. And as I said, we didn't presume any kind of a hockey stick in the last two months of the year. But from an overall admit standpoint, at the middle of the range, we could be at a negative 4% to 5% and still hit the middle of the range and commercial still be in that 6% to 7% kind of range that we were at in the first half. Once again, it would be at the middle of the range. So those seem like, based on everything we know, still some reasonably conservative positions to be taking as we look at the underlying trends. So there's opportunity in my mind for us to do better than those, both on the cost side and on the volume side, but as you know, we didn't take up the upper end of the range because we wanted to stay conservative and not presume that we were going to do better than those and lift ourselves, I'd say, to build a range based on those stats."

Well, I will blame you if you write report saying that this is a noisy quarter. In summary, our earnings number was huge and we're raising the bottom end of our 2010 outlook.

In summary, our earnings number was huge and we're raising the bottom end of our 2010 outlook. The volumes were soft, and the EBITDA is flat to 2009, if you make appropriate adjustments.
 We generated over $900 million in net income due to the accounting recognition of the value of our tax loss carryforward. Biggs will explain this further, but the key point is that while existence of the NOL has been well known it should be more tangible to investors now that it's on the books.
 Looking beyond net income, we were challenged by soft volumes in the quarter. We reacted to a particularly weak July by implementing a reduction in force in August. The impact of these actions to reduce costs along with improved volume trends after July led to a positive earnings trend in the quarter, in which EBITDA grew steadily from July to August to September.
 It's worth noting that we face the very tough comparison this year as adjusted EBITDA was up 50% in the third quarter last year. Once you allow for year-over-year variability, our longer-term EBITDA trend remains strong. You can see the variability and the clear long-term trend demonstrated on Slide 4.
 Clearly, our growth has been very strong but not a steady as I'd like. When you make your assessment of our growth in EBITDA in the quarter, please consider the items on Slide 5. The third quarter of 2009 included three favorable items contributing a total of $20 million. We called out these items in last year's third quarter call, and nearly all of you noted them when assessing our performance.
 In contrast, this year's third quarter includes items with a net unfavorable impact of $16 million. In total, these items created a $36 million unfavorable swing from the third quarter of 2009 to this year's quarter. Net of these items, this quarter was essentially unchanged.
 As I mentioned earlier, we're raising the bottom end of our outlook for 2010 EBITDA to a new range of $1,050,000,000 to $1.1 billion. This is the second time this year we've increased one or both ends of the range. Volumes were certainly weaker than we originally anticipated, but this has been offset by stronger pricing, enhanced acuity and excellent cost control. We're also benefiting from the California provider fee being larger than we forecast and health IT spending being less than we anticipated.
 Soft volumes were a dominant theme across the industry last quarter, so I'd like to give you some color on our experience. The overall takeaways that the volume declines were contained to a small number of hospitals, and once again a single service line. OB accounted for a full third of our volume loss.
 Total admissions declined 3.5%, and commercial admissions declined 8.6% in the quarter. July was by far our weakest month for patient volumes. The trend was more encouraging in August and through mid-September. Through the first 28 days of October, commercial admissions trended slightly better than in Q3 but total admissions were slightly weaker.
 As you can see on Slide 7, outpatient visits were down 2% in the third quarter. Emergency department outpatient visits were down 1.7% in the quarter, but just over 70% of that decline is due to a reduction in flu, so non-flu ED visits are basically flat year-over-year. Outpatient surgeries were up modestly, increasing by 0.1% and adjusted admissions were down only 1.8%.
 The volume losses this quarter and this year have been confined to a small number of hospitals. In fact, just seven hospitals comprise more than 70% of our total admissions declines in the third quarter. But while these seven hospitals cost the majority of our volume losses, the other 42 hospitals in the aggregate are performing better than the industry average.
 The seven hospitals are widely dispersed. There are two in Texas, but they're not in the same market. The other five are each in different states. Interestingly, although California is challenged by extremely high unemployment in some of our markets, none of our California hospitals are among the seven.
 There is no single theme for the volume losses at these seven hospitals. One of the hospitals are having a solid and growing year but facing extremely tough comparison on volumes in Q3. Another one lost the unprofitable volume. Those two, plus three others, grew EBITDA significantly despite their volume losses.
 The two others saw challenges with their physician channels. These are instances where physicians have gone into direct competition with the hospitals, where we're competing hospitals have engaged in very aggressive and sudden physician employment strategies. No matter the reason for the volume declines, we're responding appropriately, and we believe that we're already turning the losses around. In October, in these seven hospitals, while still down, the volumes were down by a lower percentage than in the third quarter.
 Turning to service lines. I already mentioned that the third of the total volume decline was in OB. Looking beyond OB, there's some elective service lines, I'd like to share some interesting insights with you. As we're deep into the recession, it's very clear that patients who have a significant personal financial responsibility are behaving very differently than patients who don't. We've known all along that this was driving reductions in our commercial elective surgical volumes. But let me give you some facts that our other orthopedic surgery as an example.
 If you look at Slide 10, you'll see that total admissions for orthopedic surgeries declined by 2.5%. Commercially insured orthopedic surgeries declined by 9%. Orthopedic surgeries for all other patients, most of whom are covered by Medicare and Medicaid, actually increased 0.2%.
 The same pattern is true with spinal fusions. Commercially insured spinal fusions declined by 160 admissions or 15% in the third quarter, but noncommercial spinal fusions increased by 17% or over 150 admissions in the quarter. Since the same physicians are doing these surgeries for both payer classes, the loss of commercial volumes and the growth of noncommercial volumes to just this behavior is being driven by the patient not the physicians. We believe this patient behavior is largely related to economic uncertainty on the part of the patients, commercial enrollment losses and rising co-pays and deductibles for those who remain insured.
 Again, on Slide 10, you can see this pattern holds through across several service lines that we would consider as elective and easy to defer. Slide 11 illustrates that when the procedure is harder to defer, like in the case of OB, the changes in volumes in other commercial and noncommercial populations are very similar.
 Despite the challenges to volume growth, favorable pricing and acuity continue to drive a stable picture for revenues. Commercial pricing remains particularly strong. We also had a 2.4% increase in commercial acuity. The result was positive commercial revenue growth of nearly 1% for the quarter. Collectively, this helped us generate adjusted free cash flow of $53 million in Q3, bringing year-to-date free cash flow deposit of $74 million.
 We've made a lot of progress on other front in the quarter. We continue to improve and de-risk our capital structure, pushing out the majority of our 2013 maturities to 2020, while retiring $229 million face value of debt. This brings our total debt slightly more than $4 billion with no meaningful maturities for five years. We also entered into a new $800 million credit line with new flexibility with regard to our capital allocation options, including lifting an existing limitation on stock repurchases.
 Earlier this year, we drew your attention to the seven items on Slide 14, which we believe can drive significant margin expansion and earnings growth over the next few years. While some of these items depends on a recovering economy, three of these initiatives, Outpatient, Medicare Performance Initiative and Conifer, were more directly under our control and less dependent on an economic recovery.
 Just walking down the list for a minute, our newly acquired outpatient centers are already coming online. We expect to have invested about $70 million in outpatient acquisitions by the end of 2010 and believe there are enough great opportunities that we could do that again in 2011. We anticipate these acquisitions will add $100 million to $150 million to revenues in 2011, and given the much higher margins in this business, contribute as much as $30 million to $40 million in 2011 EBITDA.
 Turning to MPI, we are very much on track with our 2010 objective of a $30 million incremental EBITDA contribution. While we have not yet completed our MPI plan for 2011, our preliminary view is for another $30 million. Conifer will take longer to gain visibility, but we remain very excited about its prospects. Conifer's contributions from outside clients to 2011's EBITDA growth will exceed $10 million.
 Our healthcare information technology initiative will again create incremental expenses in 2011. And as previously disclosed, we're not planning on a net positive net financial contribution from the initiative prior to 2012. Earlier last month, we went live at four hospitals, and the rollout went smoothly. We're going live in an additional three hospitals this month.
 In addition, we continue to achieve solid commercial pricing that's consistent with the trends of recent years. To make major progress on margin expansion and EBITDA growth, we need volume growth and to go back towards prerecession bad debt expense levels. But it's still clear there's much we can achieve even in the absence of recovery.
 So to wrap-up, I believe we demonstrated once again that we have the appropriate and effective leverage to pull in the short term to keep us on track relative to our longer-term performance milestone. I also believe our long-term growth strategy have us well positioned to face the myriad challenges that 2011 will bring.
 And with that, let me turn the floor over to Biggs Porter, our Chief Financial Officer. Biggs?

The biggest item impacting our net income for the quarter is a recognition of the tax benefit or our net operating loss carry forward. This recognition resulted from our reversal of the previously-established valuation allowance and added $981 million to our net income or $1.75 per diluted share.
 Under generally accepted accounting principles, which arguably are conservative on this point and in recognition of our sustained and sustainable return to profitability, the realization of this tax benefits has become sufficiently likely as to require its recognition in our financial statements. Given the conservative criteria applied in our GAAP, this makes a strong statement about the expectations of our future profitability and the value of the NOL.
 As a result of this recognition, our income statement tax rate in future quarters will approximate a normalized tax rate of approximately 40%. From a cash perspective, however, we will continue to benefit from the tax shield, and our tax payments on future income will be primarily limited to state taxes, and will continue at the low level of recent years. It will remain low until our loss carry forward is fully utilized, which is still a number of years out.
 The biggest item not impacting either net income or adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was the $64 million net receipt of revenues related to the California provider fee. Due to delays in a very complex approval process, this materially favorable event was not recognized in the third quarter. The portion of the plan related to direct medical payments was approved after the end of the quarter, with the Managed Care portion still pending. We had expected that up to $55 million would be recognized in the third quarter. This delay has no affect on full year income but will cost some of the cash receipts to slip out of this year into next, which we estimate at a net $36 million.
 Looking forward to next year, the California provider fee may be renewed for a half year, and a new fee in Pennsylvania worth approximately $25 million is in the process of development. Other states are also working on these types of arrangements. Just as food for thought, if you put the normalized 2010 value of the California provider fee at $37 million, but Pennsylvania fee and a partial extension of the California fee could more than replace that. So you should not think of the revenue from the California provider fee as being entirely non-recurring and looking at next year. For a cash basis, the cash received from provider fees could actually go up next year.
 Adjusting both quarters for prior cost quarter adjustments, revenues grew slightly in the third quarter as a result of strong commercial pricing and case mix, offset by adverse payer mix in aggregate declines in paying volumes. As in the prior quarters of this year, case mix on commercial Managed Care was strong relative to last year reflecting about a 3% increase. As I said in last quarter's comments, this increase in acuity has to be considered in understanding the economic effect of lower volume.
 Our overall pricing picture remains positive. Even with the commercial volume declines we experienced in the quarter, commercial pricing gains were sufficient to drive growth of 0.9% in commercial revenues in the quarter. Because of the payer mix shift, however, net inpatient revenue per admission increased by only 1.1%, and net outpatient revenue per visit increased by 5.6%.
 The strong increase in outpatient pricing reflects the loss of H1N1 volumes from last year, which had generated lower revenues per outpatient visit. The absence of flu volumes in this year's third quarter drove average pricing higher. Once again, this demonstrates the necessity of understanding acuity and patient mix when assessing the economic effects of volume fluctuations.
 While among the topic of pricing, I will comment that we continue to have very good visibility with regard to our forward pricing. At this point, approximately 80% of our commercial contracting is complete for 2011 and 40% for 2012.
 Turning to cost. Although the benefits weren't fully visible in the third quarter, we successfully took action to flex our cost structure. As Trevor mentioned, July's volumes were particularly weak. We responded very quickly to reduce our staffing and implemented the significant reduction for us in August. We incurred a couple of million in severance costs as part of this, but this August, the action left us well positioned for the balance of the quarter.  Those cut should also have full visibility in our fourth quarter.
 In addition, we have delayed our annual merit increases for the general population from October 1 to January 1. This takes us a step closer to timing our merit increases for all employees in the April time period where they used to be.
 The result of these actions are merely evident in our internal measures of productivity, which looks at FTEs per adjusted average daily census. Despite the soft volumes in the quarter, this productivity measure actually improved in the third quarter as FTEs per adjusted average daily census declined in September by 1.2%.
 Supplies cost were essentially flat in the quarter. On a per-adjusted patient-day basis, the increase in supplies cost was 2.6% as adverse operating leverage and the increase in acuity offset the effects of our supply cost initiatives. Because we recorded within other controllable cost line were more of a challenge. Many of the costs recorded in this heading are more heavily fixed or semi-variable in nature and as a result are more difficult to flex in response to soft volumes.
 We also recorded some incremental expense from items whose actual early determine impact is adversely influenced by declining interest rates. While now practice expenses increased by only $1 million relative to last year's third quarter, the decline in interest and therefore discount rates at $11 million to malpractice expense in the current quarter. Combined with an increase of $3 million in workers comp expense, lower discount rates added $14 million to operating expense in the quarter. This discount rate adjustment should be considered unusual at this point given low rates we were already seeing on U.S. Treasuries and can be expected to more than reversed itself in the future when interest rates rise to normal levels, thereby creating earnings upside of up to $40 million at some point in the future.
 In addition, we recorded an incremental $4 million of HIT expense. As Trevor mentioned, we successfully went live on the first phase of the system of four of our hospitals in the month of October, and we now expect the internal effects of these expenses to be down to $11 million in 2010. We expect this incremental expense to increase in 2011 prior to being offset in 2012 by the recognition of federal incentive payments. This increase is now a deferral of 2010 expenses, but is reflective of the increase and number of implementations in 2011.
 Our bad debt ratio declined to 8.3% in the quarter, a 20 basis point decline relative to 8.5% a year ago. This decline includes the recurring benefits of federal Medicare bad debt recoveries, as well as declines in uninsured volumes. We view the size of this quarter's Medicare bad debt recovery as representative of ongoing sustainable impacts that can be expected in future quarters.
 We had $398 million in cash and cash equivalents at quarter end, a decrease of $313 million from June 30. The largest driver of the cash decline was the use of $274 million to reduce debt. Cash provided from continuing operations was $160 million, and adjusted free cash flow was $53 million after capital expenditures of $107 million in the quarter.
 In the third quarter year-to-date, our cash from operations has been held back by lower levels of accounts payable and in the prior year. Some of this is due to the timing of expenditures or aggressive disbursements. We've not changed policy or contractual arrangements however, and we expect payables to expand again by year end.
 Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we completed the sale of a number of our Florida medical office buildings, generating cash of $46 million. As a part of the sale, the buyers committed to certain capital improvements to facilities, which will benefit our position Tenet's. These MOBs had immaterial annual ends and EBITDA.
 We continue to actually market additional MOBs, and we believe a number of these transactions could be completed in the next few quarters. At this point, we have other MOB sales contracts pending worth approximately $50 million, but in real estate, nothing is done until it closes so there's not reflected in our outlook.
 Turning to our outlook. We have raised the lower end of our outlook to a new range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. We raised both ends of the range of pretax income, reflecting lower depreciation and interest expense. Our revised assumptions are detailed on Slide 24. This revision includes the lowering of our volume and revenue estimates, which are tied to a later reductions in our cost estimates for the balance of the year.
 There's been speculation that volumes will grow in the fourth quarter of more than a seasonal basis due to the effects of co-pays and deductibles. At this point, we're going to be conservative and not count on that in our outlook. The walk forward of cash from September 30 to December 31 is provided on Slide 25 breaks down fourth quarter cash flow into its major components.
 It's too early to give an outlook for 2011, but I do think it's appropriate to give a little balance to what the headwinds and opportunities are going into next year. First, the biggest challenge remains on the volume side, but some of the effects of the economy and flu should have average rate by the end of this year. Economic stability followed by recovery would presumably create upside. Second, we expect the full year benefit on the outpatient acquisition we're completing on the second half of this year and a partial benefit of those we're targeting for next year.
 Third, we're already seeing improvement in the yield on our physician additions the last couple of years, and we expect expansion of that benefit in 2011 and beyond. Fourth, commercial pricing is almost completely negotiated with reasonable existent price increases expected next year. Medicare, all in, is basically flat as outpatient increases offset inpatient decreases. I've already talked about state signing and potentially new provider fees with the 2009 retroactive portion of the California provider fee being the one element most challenging to replace.
 Finally on the cost side, we will increase our investment in our physician base and HIT both of which will yield improvements for the future. And we will continue to drive on our Medicare performance and related initiatives to reduce link to stay in supply costs.
 In the aggregate, we will continue to drive toward industry margins. We have confidence in the path we have laid out. The only gating consideration in what the near-term timing and slow for progress is going to be is the degree of economic headwinds we must offset. On the positive side for 2011, we expect to drive value in the outpatient investments, position base initiatives, commercial pricing and the Medicare performance initiative. The big potential near-term negative, longer-term appositive is, as I just said, the effect of economic conditions. It is not clear and therefore remains subject to continuing evaluation by us as to what extent economic conditions will offset the net positive drivers of growth in 2011.
 So to summarize. The value of our NOL carryforwards has been confirmed from accounting standpoint. We have raised our outlook for EBITDA and pretax and net income for the year. We approved cost efficiencies in the quarter, as we were able to react quickly to significant volume declines in the first month of the quarter. This will be fully visible in the fourth quarter.
 Free cash flow came under pressure due to the timing of disbursements in rising CapEx. But because of the timing effects on accounts payable will reverse themselves, we have retained our free cash flow outlook for the year. Pricing continued as the source of strength. Commercial case mix remained favorable compared to the prior year. California provider fee, has been partially approved while full approval expected this quarter.
 And one last point. From a volume and payer mix standpoint, this was the weakest quarter we've experienced, clearly reflective of the economic headwinds. However, the fact that we held earnings flat on a normalized basis and even in this harsh environment demonstrates that we are well positioned to grow earnings as the economy moderates and/or as our volume initiatives yield increasing results.

I guess the volume weakness is something that everyone was talking about throughout the quarter. So I do think that really caught people that of off-guard. I guess it was just throughout the year with the volume weakness you guys have able to offset it through better unit pricing growth, as well as just cost cutting. So I guess the question is, as you look back on the quarter, Trevor, just maybe talk about -- and you guys called out a few things like the discount rate and some of the issues around cost there, but I guess just in terms of the ability to offset the volume weakness and not even the most recent quarter but going forward as well maybe just to go back through and talk about some of the initiatives there and certainly, you have the great slide deck here with that, but to just get some more clarity in terms of just visibility around the ability to offset volumes.

But we were trying to make the point that although I think the industry-wide volume weakness was well known throughout the quarter. There were plenty of surveys and other indicators that, that was taking place. What was surprisingly negative was July. And so, I mentioned that July was particularly weak and then we took actions to reduce cost. Of course, these actions couldn't be taken in July, they were taken in August and have that effect of creating a positive trajectory in EBITDA from July to August to September. And as volume losses moderated from July through August through mid-September, then they did turn down in late September, that's the implication of saying that they were strong through mid-September. So I think one way -- the thing I would characterize as being unusual in the third quarter at least for us was how negative the first month was and then the fact that although many in the industry anticipated some snap back in August was encouraging, that, that encouraging trend at least in terms of volume did not persist through the entire quarter. And then based on our comments about October, it didn't persist into October. but I think to answer your question about what we can do and how we've been able to offset weak volumes, obviously, it's very hard on a month-to-month basis, because it's easier on a quarterly basis and it gets easier to accomplish. I shouldn't use the word easy. That's not easy but it's less difficult to accomplish on a yearly basis. And so, if you look at the quarter as a whole, we really overcame a lot of challenge that we had right out of the box in July. But it's difficult to do more in a short period of time. I think we have positioned ourselves well going into the fourth quarter. But again, we don't even have the first month of results on that yet.

Obstetrics supply stayed down for quite a while. So I would expect on that basis case mix do not changed radically over the near term. As I said, case mix on commercial Managed Care was up about 3%. It was up about 1% on a Medicare Managed Care and up almost 5% on Medicaid Managed Care. So in most of the categories, it was up in the quarter. We'll see, of course, with that was a longer term but there's nothing right now that indicates that, that would change. So we'll just have to watch it but I think is reflective of the economics of today.

But this is a trend that is inexorable. It started with the large most prosperous, not for profits. We compete against a lot of this in our markets and we have completely adopted, I think new and improved way to do this. So just to go in order of sort of the promise that we're doing about it. Purchasing practices is really not market practice anymore. It's employing physicians. So you don't have the problem from the 90s of spending a lot of capital on purchasing something that turns out to not be worth of what you paid for. So it's really hiring talent. And then in terms of hiring talent, we've become very sophisticated about how to do it in terms of providing incentives for productivity so we don't experience the next problem that was characteristic for the 90s, which is hiring physicians, which essentially was enabling them to retire at the expense of the hospital. So we're incentivizing productivity. And we've also experienced some churn of the employed physicians based on those who failed to meet the productivity target leaving and those who are succeeding in the productivity target staying and enjoying the benefits of that. We've also been very selective in terms of the credentials of the physicians that we've been hiring. So just as if you undertook to hire a cadre of 200 MBA students you want to go to the top schools and hire the best students, we're doing the same thing when it comes to physicians. We're also being very selective about filling certain holes and specialties or building primary-care networks, where that strategy is right. And then finally, rather than attempting to manage all these practices ourselves, we've employed in a joint venture format a practice management company that's an expert in doing this and running them at economic results that are superior to what hospitals generally experience. So I think, all of these things together and I didn't mention the EMR solution that we're offering for physicians, I think it's a better solution, and we probably got started later than we should have. And perhaps it's because of historic bias, at least on my part, against that as a strategy. But we are well into it now and have a very strong pipeline of physicians that we are employing.

It's very limiting. Based on my comments about outpatient, it appears that we are doing that, and we're very pleased to outpatient acquisitions that we're making. I would say that the potential acquisitions of the acute care hospitals that would be of interest to us or of the greatest interest to us, there are certainly more hospitals considering selling themselves or seeking partnerships of some kind. And we're spending more time than we ever have exploring those types of things. I think it's premature to talk about value and whether we would actually proceed and devote our capital in that way. What we haven't been doing, you obviously noticed is we have not been competing in the auctions that has been out there for standalone hospitals or possibles that or -- whatever other acute-care transactions are out there. I don't think we are necessarily the best potential acquirers for those kinds of things. Where we have been focused is more in our markets and things that have some degree of synergy, where we understand the market, we understand the dynamics and the future trends. And obviously, given the uncertainties around healthcare reforms something you have to take into consideration when you evaluate the hospitals. So for that reason, we've been most focused on the outpatient side. I think that you'll agree since we gave some disclosure on those numbers that those are incrementally very helpful acquisitions for us. We like that business and will continue to do that as much as possible.

We think we get back down to that $1,995 kind of level. So it's at the middle of the range. And of course, there's opportunity, they'll beyond with that to help drive towards the end of the range as well. From a revenue standpoint, we've just looked at what's real recent experience on volumes. And as I said, we didn't presume many kind of a hockey stick in the last two months of the year. But from an overall admit standpoint, at the middle of the range, we could be at a negative 4% to 5% and still hit the middle of the range and commercial still be in that 6% to 7% kind of range where we were at for the first half. Once again, be in the middle of the race. So those seem like based on everything we know, still some recent very conservative positions to be taken as we look at the underlying trends. So there's opportunity in my mind for us to do better than those of both on the cost side and on the volume side but as you know, we didn't take up the upper end of the range because we wanted to stay conservative and not presume that we're going to do better than those and left ourselves, I'd say to build a range based on those stats.
