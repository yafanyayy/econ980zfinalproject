I’ll make some opening comments and then hand the call over to Mary and Dan for a more detailed discussion of our credit and financial performance. For the past two years credit trans of dominated our results they secure positive developments resulting from our continued focus on our strategic plans and core operations and while credit remains difficult and its impact remain significant very pleased with the improvement in trends we saw on the fourth quarter.
Charge-offs was $708 million down $48 million from last quarter and NPA’s up just 1%. Total delinquencies were down 33%, including early and late stage. Those are welcomed improvements from recent trends. We saw a drop in commercial net charge-offs from the third quarter, which as you’ll recall, included the effect of the annual shared national credit exam.
We expect commercial charge-offs to decline significantly in the first quarter and overall improved performance for all of 2010, as new problem assets generally have lower loss content than what we’ve been dealing with the past 12 months or 18 months. We also made great progress in dealing with commercial delinquencies this quarter. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were down 46% sequentially and loans past due 90 days or more were down 68% sequentially.
This represented both improved flows during the quarter, as well as the efforts of our commercial banking and special asset groups to address delinquencies, get them resolved and current or to further the workout process. Commercial non-performing assets were down about 1% in the quarter, which was the first drop we’ve seen in quite sometime. We do expect commercial NPA’s to increase in the first quarter, but we continue to believe the general trend is slowing.
NPA inflows are continuing to shift to products where loss severities are lower and work out options are greater, like C&I and income-producing real estate. Consumer charge-offs also declined in most categories and were down for the second consecutive quarter. We expect first quarter consumer charge-offs to increase modestly, given the effect of bringing consumer securitizations back on balance sheet and normal seasonality.
We currently expect consumer charge-offs for the remainder of the year to remain relatively stable and below the levels we saw in mid 2009, based on migration trends and our current outlook for the economy. Our reserve position remains strong at nearly 5% of loans and 127% of NPLs. We expect losses in 2010 to be below ‘09s levels and given our current expectations, we don’t expect any significant further reserve builds to be necessary.
The implementation of FAS 166 and 167 will result in a small increase to the reserve in the first quarter as we bring assets on balance sheet. Mary and Dan will talk about that more in their remarks. Overall, we feel good about where we are with the reserve and that’s a good position to be in as we turn to 2010.
Now, let me give you some high level operating results. The net interest margin increased 12 bps sequentially, a little better than we expected, which reflects good discipline on rates and the rolling off of high cost CDs we put on last year. Net interest income was up modestly, about 1%, reflecting good net interest margin and deposit trends largely offset for a difficult environment for asset generation. Transaction deposits were up 6% from last quarter with 1.1 billion of growth in DDA balances and 1.5 billion of growth in interest checking.
A strong deposit growth and muted asset trends have created a lot of liquidity and we’ve reduced wholesale funding by $17.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. Mortgage business continues to perform very well and we generated another $4.4 billion of originations during the quarter. This was a record year for both mortgage banking revenue and origination volume and we’ve been pleased with our ability to continue that momentum throughout the year even as the refinancing boom began to wane.
Finally, last quarter we discussed the significant impact of credit charges recorded in revenue and expenses. These totaled $145 million in the third quarter of which $45 million was provisioned for unfunded commitments. This quarter, those charges dropped to $85 million with $10 million in unfunded provisions. While it’s difficult to predict the impact from quarter-to-quarter, I believe this is a more representative starting place for those costs as we move into 2010. Dan will talk later about the impact of those charges and where they appear in more detail.
Finally, let me just make a couple of comments on the environment. We’re starting to see some additional positive indicators in the economy. For example, recent data showing that economic conditions improved in 10 of the 12 fed reserved districts, home sales and GDP both showed positive growth in the latter part of 2009 and the competitive environment is also much more rational than we experienced a year ago, which creates a more stable operating environment, but economic activity is still mixed.
Many of our commercial clients are very nervous about investing in new projects. Commercial line utilization at 33% is the lowest I’ve seen in my career, as customers are being conservative at extending themselves, even when they have committed financing. Retail customers are continuing to deleverage, which is healthy for the economy in the long term, but will likely lead to a slower recovery than we’ve seen after other recent recessions.
Housing prices remain well off their highs, and while we’ve seen a small recovery in prices in some markets, 5% increase after double digit decreases still leaves a lot of people under water. All told, a much better operating environment than we’ve seen in sometime, the economy is not yet firing on all cylinders an improvement will likely be measured over the next several quarters.
We continue to remain focused on our core operations and the things we can control, like customer satisfaction, deepening our relationships and investing in the company’s future while remaining disciplined on expenses and driving higher revenue and profitability. We’re confident these actions and those we’ve taken on the credit front will serve us well in 2010 and the future.
With that, let me turn it over to Mary to discuss credit trends and more detail. Mary?

As Kevin mentioned, overall credit trends were better than expected. Let me walk through results, starting with charge-offs. Total net charge-offs of $708 million decreased $48 million sequentially. Commercial net charge-offs declined $32 m",2529,"Thanks, Kevin. As Kevin mentioned, overall credit trends were better than expected. Let me walk through results, starting with charge-offs. Total net charge-offs of $708 million decreased $48 million sequentially. Commercial net charge-offs declined $32 million to $468 million from $500 million last quarter.
As you’ll recall, third quarter charge-offs were elevated due to higher losses related to the Shared National Credit exam. Florida and Michigan continued to represent a disproportionate share of charge-offs and while Florida will remain a challenging market for sometime, parts of our Michigan portfolio have begun to show signs of bottoming out.
C&I net losses this quarter totaled $183 million, down $73 million with a sequential decline attributable to a broad base of industry segments and the effect of the SNC exam in the third quarter. Michigan and Florida accounted for 52% of C&I losses during the quarter, while representing 23% of C&I loans.
Commercial construction net charge-offs were $135 million, up $9 million, with Michigan and Florida generating 61% of losses. Commercial mortgage losses of $142 million increased $24 million from the third quarter, with Michigan and Florida contributing 56% of losses.
Across the portfolio, homebuilder developer losses totaled $110 million, which was flat versus the third quarter. You’ll recall that we suspended homebuilder originations two years ago, have already recognized significant charge-offs in that portfolio and worked to reduce our exposure. Portfolio balances are $1.6 billion, less than half of their peak levels. We expect losses there to comedown, given the work we’ve done on that portfolio.
As Kevin touched on earlier, our current expectations are for commercial charge-offs to comedown again in the first quarter. While commercial charge-offs can be somewhat lumpy, we believe they will be down about $100 million in the first quarter give or take, from $468 million this quarter and that they should remain well below the levels we experienced in the latter part of 2009.
Turning to the consumer portfolio, consumer net charge-offs decreased $16 million during the quarter, totaling $240 million. Improvement was broad based. Net charge-offs on the residential mortgage portfolio were $78 million, a decrease of $14 million from the third quarter.
Michigan and Florida accounted for 73% of losses from 42% of the total mortgage portfolio. Home equity losses increased $2 million sequentially to $82 million, including $34 million of losses in the broker portfolio. The net charge-off rate on brokered home equity was about 7% annualized, which is almost four times the loss rate on our branch originated book.
The brokered equity portfolio is $1.9 billion of outstanding, down from about $3.5 billion a couple of years ago and continues to run off. Auto loan net charge-offs were down $2 million sequentially, reflecting higher values received at auction. Performance has been very good in this portfolio throughout the cycle and reflects a number of improvements in underwriting in the past couple of years.
Credit card losses were flat compared with the third and second quarters. Total card balances are about $2 billion and as we’ve discussed previously, this is a branch originated in footprint relationship product for us. We’d expect card charge-offs to trend with unemployment and bankruptcy filings overtime.
We expect first quarter consumer charge-offs to increase modestly, about $10 million or so from the fourth quarter. That reflects the effect of bringing consumer securitizations on balance sheet due to FAS 166 and 167, and seasonality. Beyond that, current migration trends and expectations would suggest that consumer losses should remain pretty stable in the remainder of 2010.
We continually update our stress test models and have outlined the results of those scenarios, which I just described on one of the slides in our normal earnings presentation posted on the website. Taking our commercial and consumer charge-offs expectations together, we currently expect 2010 charge-offs to be lower than the $2.6 billion we experienced in 2009. To place that into a broader context, in our SCAP submissions, we submitted baseline credit losses of $2.9 billion for 2009 and $2.8 billion in 2010.
Our actual charge-offs in 2009, were about $300 million lower than our baseline submission and as I’ve just noted, we currently expect charge-offs to be lower than $2.6 billion in 2010. Our revised current view of 2010 stress scenario losses, which we don’t believe is likely, is actually much closer to our original S Cap baseline scenario than the S Cap adverse scenario published in May.
We’ve also posted the extensive portfolio stratifications, we have traditionally published to provide as much transparency as we can into our credit results and expectations. Now, moving on to NPAs, NPAs, including held-for-sale totaled $3.5 billion at quarter end, down 1% from the third quarter. Excluding $224 million of NPAs in our held-for-sale portfolio, where the loans have already been fully marked, portfolio NPAs totaled $3.2 billion that represented growth of just $24 million, or 1%.
Florida in Michigan remained the most challenged geographies and account for 44% of NPAs in the portfolio. Portfolio commercial NPAs declined by $20 million, or 1% from the third quarter, which was better than we originally expected. That was due to a variety of factors: Improved financial performance, less deterioration than we expected during the quarter, and higher paydowns than we expected.
That’s a reflection of improving migration trends and the effects of shifting from a period of high sustained growth to an environment that shows signs of beginning to stabilize. Within NPAs, commercial TDRs on non-accrual status increased to $47 million from $18 million last quarter. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans where it makes good economic sense for the bank, for credit where the cash flows support the reworked structure.
Commercial construction NPAs decreased $44 million. Florida and Michigan were down $50 million combined. Commercial mortgage NPAs were up $16 million. C&I NPAs was down $9 million from the third quarter, with Florida the biggest driver of the decrease. Across the portfolio, residential builder and developer NPAs of $548 million, represented 22% of total commercial NPAs and were down $52 million sequentially.
As Kevin discussed, based on current migration expectations, we expect commercial NPAs to be up moderately in the first quarter, with commercial NPA inflows lower than fourth quarter inflows. Of NPA inflows currently forecasted in the first quarter, a majority was current at year end, and we believe that’s indicative of a reasonable workout potential for these NPAs in many cases.
We anticipate commercial NPAs over the course of the year to generally reflect to the broader slowing trend that we’ve seen the past several quarters. Improved early stage delinquency results are encouraging in this respect and liquidity has improved for moving distressed assets and that adds another method of managing NPAs as we move into 2010.
Moving to consumer NPA trends, NPAs totaled $704 million at the end of the quarter, up $44 million, or 7% sequential increase from the third quarter. Non-accrual consumer TDRs were $33 million of the increase. Residential mortgage NPAs increased $38 million during the quarter to $523 million, with TDRs representing $26 million of the sequential growth.
Home equity NPAs totaled $71 million at the end of the fourth quarter, down $1 million from third quarter levels. Auto NPAs were flat and credit card NPAs were up $7 million, with the increase attributable to TDRs. In terms of overall consumer TDR activity, we’ve modified about $2.7 billion of loans since the third quarter of 2007, of which $258 million were carried as non-accruals at December 31.
A little over a quarter of the loans we’ve restructured to-date have redefaulted. On a lagged basis, as you would expect, redefault rates are higher, but remains below 40% of modified loans. We believe that experience is generally inline with the industry. As this portfolio matures, we’d expect TDR redefaults to continue to increase due to seasoning.
Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of our loss mitigation efforts. In the first quarter, we expect consumer NPAs to grow in the mid single digits, consistent with fourth quarter trends or perhaps a little better. We would expect modest consumer NPA growth going forward, driven primarily by increased TDRs, the result of our active modification program.
To wrap up the NPA discussion, we believe we’ve been as aggressive as anyone in assuring we’ve written problem loans down to realistic and realize of values. Total NPAs, commercial and consumer, are being carried at approximately 59% of their original face value through the process of taking charge-offs, marks, and specific reserves recorded through the fourth quarter.
Moving to delinquency trends, commercial loans 30 to 89 days past due were $367 million and declined by $318 million or 46% from the third quarter. Commercial loans 90 days past due were about $200 million and dropped $414 million compared with the third quarter, a 68% decline.
As noted lost quarter, we had a number of delinquencies where the loan was past maturity, but still current which has since been resolved. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect the seasonal increase in delinquencies from these very low levels experienced in the fourth quarter, but for growth to be moderate.
As we discussed last quarter, consumer delinquency trends overall have continued to moderate. Three key drivers of those trends are the seasoning of loans made in 2005, significant underwriting improvements in home equity and auto portfolios, and the runoff of mortgages due to our 95% scalability strategy. These factors are having an increasing impact on the performance of the portfolio.
Consumer delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due increased 4% sequentially to $528 million. Consumer loans over 90 days past due were $369 million, down $12 million, with Florida representing the largest decline for the second consecutive quarter. We expect delinquencies to be up modestly in the first quarter, with 30 to 89 relatively stable and over 90s reflecting the growth in early stage delinquencies in the fourth quarter.
A couple of comments on provision expense and the allowance; provision expense for the quarter was $776 million and exceeded net charge-offs by $68 million, this increase to the allowance to $3.75 billion. Our allowance coverage ratio remained strong, covering non-performing loans by 127% and fourth quarter annualized net charge-offs by 132% and we feel we are well positioned here, absent unexpected developments.
Let me spend a moment on a couple of other topics. First, an update on the non-performing loans we’ve moved to held-for-sale status. Those balances were originally $473 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and they are down to $216 million at the end of 2009. In the fourth quarter, we also moved $9 million into held-for-sale from the portfolio.
During the quarter, we received payments of $16 million and wrote down principal balances of retained loans by $13 million. We also sold, settled, or closed $61 million of these NPAs during the quarter and realized about $4 million of gains on those sales and transferred $3 million to OREO.
Since we moved these loans, our realization of gains and write-downs largely offset and these values overall are consistent with our original marks. We currently carry the remaining loans in this pool at about $0.33 on the dollar of their original contractual balances.
To sum up, we’re encouraged by recent trends, but we’re also realistic about the environment. Unemployment is high and is expected to remain high. Home prices have stopped declining as precipitously, but have not turned around yet and in some markets they continue to be under significant pressure. Those forces suggest that consumer losses will remain elevated for sometime. 
Additionally, while we’ve been very pleased with the results of our consumer loan modification, not all of those modifications are going to be successful and we’ll see some NPAs and losses develop from those loans, even as we see improvement in overall trends, but we’ve taken that into account in our outlook and believe these actions will reduce the losses the company ultimately experiences.
On the commercial side, we’ve been through a part of the cycle, where loss severity has been very high, due to the nature and type of products involved, namely commercial construction and residential development. Those areas dominated our NPA inflows and charge-offs through 2008 and 2009. Our current inflows have been more reflective of typical cycle developments, including C&I and commercial mortgage.
There’s been a lot of justified focus on commercial real estate at this stage of the cycle, so let me make a few comments on that front. Our commercial real estate loans are about $15.6 billion, or 20% of the loan portfolio, which is a relatively low percentage compared with other regional banks. Of that $15.6 billion, $11.8 billion is in commercial mortgage and $3.8 billion is in commercial construction.
Obviously, the construction portfolio has been under the most stress and we’ve been very proactive managing this portion of the loan portfolio. We’ve suspended home builder and developer loans back in 2007, a non-owner occupied real estate lending in early 2008. While we expect to see continued stress in the area, these credits were affected earlier in the cycle, given the issues in residential real estate and shortfalls in adequate cash flow to bring projects to fruition.
The current stage of the cycle is marked by a shift in NPA inflows toward income producing properties backed by mortgages. Of our $11.8 billion commercial mortgage portfolio, about half is non-owner occupied, but is income producing. The cash flow from these properties gives us a much greater ability to work these loans out and as a result, we tend to experience lower loss severities than the loans that created most of the issues earlier in the cycle, but they do typically take time to work out.
So like consumer, we expect commercial charge-offs to remain elevated in 2010, but we do expect to see significant improvement in loss experience during the year versus what we saw the past couple of quarters. The burden of provisioning on earnings and on capital generation has been pretty material over the past couple of years. In 2008 and 2009, we incurred provision expense of almost $3 billion in excess of charge-offs. The elimination of that additional burden should have a significant positive effect on results, even as charge-offs remain higher than we would like.
We experienced pain from this credit cycle earlier than others, given our geographies and given some product areas where we frankly made some loans we shouldn’t have made. Brokered home equity and home builder lending were two areas that stand out, but there are others we’ve discussed over the past several years.
Because of these factors, particularly the early cycles in Michigan and then Florida, we adjusted our underwriting earlier, we charged loans off earlier, and we built reserves earlier and more significantly to than many of our peers. We’ve tried to be aggressive in recognizing issues and getting them revolved and behind us. As a result, we don’t believe we have an overhang or any catch up to deal with and we feel well positioned as we move into 2010.
With that, I’ll turn things over to Dan to discuss operating trends. Dan.

270961,84102665,46403,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-21-2010",2010-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Okay, thanks, Mary. As Kevin noted, while this quarter still reflects a difficult environment, we did see significant progress not only on the credit front, but in operating results as well. For the quarter, we’ve reported a net loss of $98 million and",2831,"Okay, thanks, Mary. As Kevin noted, while this quarter still reflects a difficult environment, we did see significant progress not only on the credit front, but in operating results as well. For the quarter, we’ve reported a net loss of $98 million and paid preferred dividends of $62 million, which resulted in a loss of $160 million on an available to common shareholders basis.
Last quarter, our net loss was $97 million, or $159 million to common. Excluding the effects of Visa, on a core basis, the net loss last quarter was $303 million, compared with this quarter’s $98 million net loss. That $200 million after tax improvement was driven by three factors. The first was a lower provision, which was down $176 million pre-tax, reflecting both lower charge-offs, as well as a lower reserve bill. The second was lower credit related cost in revenues and expenses, which was down $60 million pre-tax., and then the third was our favorable operating trends.
As Kevin and Mary noted, we expect the first quarter charge-offs to come down again and we don’t expect much of a reserve build, if any next quarter, beyond the effect of FAS 166 and 167. So, we’re currently expecting earnings trends to improve again in the first quarter as we move closer to turning that bottom line positive. Some of the major themes for the quarter outside of credit were continued net interest margin expenses, lower credit related costs, and strong deposit growth.
Net interest margin increased 12 basis points sequentially to 3.55%. As with previous quarters, the expansion was driven by maturities of high rate CDs put on the sheet in the fall of 2008. Net interest income was up $8 million, or 1%, with the margin benefit of strong deposit growth offset by asset growth head wins that we’ve been experiencing recently.
Average core deposits grew by 3% sequentially and 11% on a year-over-year basis with strong growth in transaction accounts. Compared with last quarter, credit cost recognized through fee income and operating expense were down significantly. Totaling $85 million in this quarter compared with $145 million last quarter. That positive variance was driven by a lower provision for unfunded commitments, lower credit related derivative losses, and lower fair value adjustments on loans held-for-sale.
I’ll talk about the revenue and expense split of these charges in a moment. Going forward, we expect these costs to remain elevated, but this quarter’s number is closer to a run rate that should improve overtime. Overall, it was a pretty clean quarter, although there were two significant items that largely offset one another.
We recorded a mark-to-market gain on warrants we hold from the FTPs transaction, which are valued based on a set of publicly traded proxies. That gain was $20 million and was recorded in other income. We also recorded a $22 million reserve for litigation risks associated with one of our bank card association memberships and that was recorded in other expense.
With that context, let’s go through the balance sheet in a bit more detail. Average earning assets were down about 2% compared with last quarter and 4% on a year-over-year basis. This trend continues to be driven by soft commercial loan demand and the continued impact of our strategy of targeting the sale of about 95% of our mortgage production. Let me mention here the prospective effect on our balance sheet of FAS 166 and 167, which we implement on January 1 of 2010.
This was a fairly minor event for Fifth Third, but it will result in loans in the first quarter increasing by about $2.3 billion and securities being reduced by about $900 million. The loans come from the consolidation of approximately $1.5 billion in consumer loan securitizations and from $800 million of commercial loan conduit assets, which will be added to loans. Offsetting that will be our previous investments of $800 million in the conduits commercial paper and net of $100 million in other securities which will go away. That’s the net effect on earning assets overall will be about $1.4 billion.
Now, looking at the fourth quarter, average loans held for investments were down 3% sequentially and 10% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to the 2.3 billion effect of FAS 166 and 167, we believe that C&I balances are reaching a bottom and we’ll begin to see some organic growth soon. CRE loans on the other hand will likely continue to decline for at least several more quarters. For the year, we would expect loan balances to begin to grow modestly, although it’s a little early to say how much that growth maybe over the course of the year.
Now, to give a little more detail by product types, in the fourth quarter, average commercial loans decreased 4%, or $2.1 billion, with the majority of that decline reflecting lower line utilization, as well as charge-offs. Line utilization was down $1 billion sequentially and is down $3.9 billion from a year ago. This lower line utilization reflects customer caution. We still have those relationships, and as their confidence returns, this will represent some built in loan growth, as line usage returns.
Average consumer loans were down 1% sequentially and 3% on a year-over-year basis. Auto loan balances increased 1% sequentially and 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. We’re pleased to see growth continue here beyond the third quarter benefit from the Cash for Clunkers program. Auto loan demand remains solid and credit performance has been good. Going forward, loan balances will reflect the inclusion of about $1.2 billion in auto loans that will be consolidated on January 1 of 2010.
Credit card balances were up 1% on a sequential basis and 13% on a year-over-year basis. Residential mortgages were down 3% sequentially and 13% from a year ago, as we continue to sell most of our new production. Flow sales during the quarter were $4.2 billion. Home equity loans were down 1% sequentially and 3% on a year-over-year basis. We currently expect home equity loan balances to be relatively stable in 2010, which reflects relatively low demand, but some stabilization in home prices in a number of our markets. 
Average securities increased by about $800 million during the quarter, with proceeds primarily invested in agency mortgage-backed securities. We’ll continue to evaluate securities investments in the context of loan growth, in the context of excess funding, and of course the overall interest rate environment.
We remain very thoughtful about taking these positions, given our expectation for future rate increases, although the risk/reward profile has improved recently. We’ve supplemented our balance sheet hedges to reflect these purchases and to maintain our overall relatively neutral interest rate risk position.
Moving onto deposits, we saw continued strong deposit growth momentum this quarter with a significant positive shift in mix toward lower cost deposits. Average core deposit growth was 3% sequentially and 11% on a year-over-year basis. Transaction account showed the strongest growth with DDA balances up 6% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. We also had significant growth in interest checking deposits, which increased 10% sequentially and 19% on a year-over-year basis.
Looking forward to the first quarter, we expect core deposit growth to be fairly similar to the fourth, given the low rate environment, customers continue to value liquidity and we expect that will continue in the near term. Retail core deposits were flat sequentially and increased 6% on a year-over-year basis.
Our new higher value and bundled product offerings are attracting higher average balances. We’ve gotten good feedback from customers on these new product offerings. That offset, a decline in net new account production, which was driven by our no longer offering the totally free checking product.
Total commercial core deposits were up 12% sequentially and 28% from a year ago. Commercial DDAs increased 10% from the third quarter and 46% from last year, while commercial interest checking increased 22% sequentially and 47% from last year. I would note that average public fund balances in interest checking increased by $1 billion on a sequential basis and as tax refunds are issued, we would expect some of that growth to reverse.
Otherwise, the growth has been driven by higher average balances, which reflects cautiousness and excess liquidity among our customers. As I noted earlier, our liquidity remains very strong. Wholesale funding levels were reduced again this quarter by $3.8 billion, or 15% and we’ve now paid down $17.5 billion of wholesale funding since a year ago.
Let me give just a quick update on FTPS. The deconversion process continues and we’ve completed transitioning of a number of core HR functions over to the joint venture. Retained card and processing fee income was up modestly on a sequential basis, coming in at $76 million for the quarter compared with $74 million last quarter.
Card and processing expense of $27 million compares to $25 million last quarter and includes about $10 million of retained expense, as well as $17 million in charges from FTPS related to their providing process services to the bank. We also had a $39 million of revenue from the FTPS transition services agreement or TSA, which covers costs of a similar amount incurred by Fifth Third and providing services to the processing JV. That revenue is recorded in other non-interest income.
Last quarter we had about 38 million of related TSA revenue. We would expect approximately $12 million to $15 million of TSA in the first quarter and between $45 million and $50 million for all of 2010. We would expect first quarter expenses to decline in a like fashion.
Finally, we recognized equity method income of $8 million related to our 49% interest in the joint venture through the other income line. That compares with about $7 million last quarter and the $8 million did not include the warrant mark-to-market adjustment, which I talked about earlier.
Moving on now to the income statement; starting with net interest income. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $8 million sequentially to $882 million. That was driven primarily by deposit reprising and partially offset by lower loan balances. Net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 3.55%, a little better than we expected on wider deposit and loan spreads.
We currently expect margin to expand another 5 to 10 basis points in the first quarter, with solid growth in net interest income perhaps in the $15 million range, including about $10 million effect from adding the assets that we talked about earlier related to FAS 166 and 167. As we move further into the year, we would expect earning asset growth, driven by modest growth in loans and securities and a margin that is likely to be stable after the first quarter in the near term.
Moving on to fees, third quarter net interest non-interest income was $651 million. Non-core items in non-interest income are outlined pretty thoroughly in the earnings release. I won’t go through those in detail, but on a core basis, fee income increased $30 million or 5% from the third quarter and $73 million or 13% from the third quarter of 2008.
Credit related charges that roll through non-interest income fell on the quarter from $45 million last quarter to approximately $30 million this quarter. The strong year-over-year results come primarily from the increases in mortgage banking revenue. Corporate banking revenue of $98 million for the quarter was up $12 million from a seasonally soft third quarter or about 15%.
Sequential growth was driven by institutional sales, interest rate derivatives revenue, and business lending fees, and partially offset by declines in foreign exchange revenue. We expect solid results again in the first quarter, although they will likely be lower than the seasonally strong fourth quarter.
Deposit service charges were down 3% from the third quarter and 2% from a year ago. Consumer deposit fees were down approximately $6 million on a sequential basis, which more than offset $1 million increase in commercial deposit fees. We continue to position checking account offerings for changes in the regulatory environment, which contributed to the lower consumer deposit fees this quarter, as well as to an anticipated similar decline in the first quarter.
We’d expect positive seasonality in the second quarter and additional account growth to offset these effects after the first quarter. We’ve been proactive in adjusting our offerings and we believe we’re well positioned in terms of regulatory developments and offering value to our customers. Investment advisory revenue increased 4% sequentially and declined 2% on a year-over-year basis. Recent market performance has benefited the trust asset management and brokerage groups and we’re expecting strong growth again in the first quarter.
As mentioned earlier, mortgage origination volume remained robust during the quarter at about $4.4 billion. Net mortgage revenue of $132 million was down 8 million from last quarter. We continue to capture greater market share and purchase originations increased to 36% of our volume from the fourth quarter.
Right now we expect net mortgage banking revenue to decline about $20 million or so in the first quarter. Obviously that could move significantly, but overall, we’ve been very pleased with the continued strength of this business. We currently expect fee income for the first quarter to be about $580 million give or take. 
Relative to the fourth quarter, that would reflect three main drivers. First, the decline in TSA revenue I outlined earlier, which is about $25 million. Second is the effect of the $20 million gain on warrants that was reported in the third quarter. Third, we expect mortgage banking revenue to be down about $20 million. Beyond the first quarter, which is a seasonally low quarter, we expect fee growth to pick up on positive seasonality in the second quarter and growth across our fee businesses through the remainder of the year.
Turning to expenses, non-interest expense of $967 million was up 10% sequentially. However, fourth quarter results included the $22 million litigation reserve that I’ve mentioned earlier, while third quarter results included a net $73 million reduction in expense due to Visa. Exclude these items expenses were $945 million in the fourth quarter, down just slightly from core expenses of $949 million in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, total credit related cost within operating expenses includes the provision for unfunded commitments were $55 million versus $100 million last quarter. This positive variance was partially offset by the effects of a $14 million tax related accrual and $8 million in growth and marketing expense.
We currently expect non-interest expense in the first quarter to be consistent with that $945 million in the fourth quarter of core expenses and expected $20 million increase in seasonal FICO in unemployment expense will be offset by the reduction in FTPS support expenses I mentioned earlier, which is primarily personnel related. Let me stop for a moment and just do a quick reconciliation of pre-provision net revenue.
Reported pre-tax pre-provision earnings were $562 million in the fourth quarter and that’s consistent with the core number. Last quarter, core PPNR was about $530 million. We would anticipate PPNR to be down about $20 million to $30 million in the first quarter, given the expectations for a reduction in mortgage banking revenue and the effect of the $20 million in seasonal benefits expense I mentioned just a minute ago.
Offsetting those negative variances would be pretty solid growth and net interest income. We currently expect PPNR results in subsequent quarters to rebound and exceed fourth quarter levels, driven by net interest income growth, growth in fee businesses, and lower credit related operating expenses.
Let me add to my comments on the implementation of FAS 166 and 167 this quarter. We will record a cumulative effect of adjustment to retained earnings in the first quarter, which we currently estimate to be a charge of approximately $90 million. That will reflect the valuation marks and the net difference in the carrying value of assets recognized and derecognized as part of that adoption.
That charge would include an addition to the loan loss reserve of approximately $10 million for loans that are being added to the balance sheet, as well as a portion of the reserve for unfunded commitments will also be reclassified to the reserve for loan losses to reflect the conduit assets that are being added to the loan portfolio.
Now, moving onto capital, our quarter end capital ratios remained strong. The TCE ratio, excluding $240 million of unrealized securities gains was 6.5%. Tier 1 common equity was 7% and Tier 1 capital was 13.3%. The effect of incorporating the net $1.4 billion of assets onto the balance sheet and the charge to equity will reduce our TCE ratio by about 15 basis points. We already carried those assets in our risk weighted asset calculations for regulatory purposes unless the effect on Tier 1 and total capital ratios will be less than five basis points.
I think with that, I’ll open it up for questions.

So in earlier stages of the cycle, where we had situations that were more purely collateral-dependent, it wouldn’t make sense. As we move through the cycle, we will continue to see additional opportunities for that kind of restructuring on a case by case basis, given the characterization of the types of credit workout situations that we’re working through right now.

The taxes that are recorded each quarter really reflect an estimate of what the year end overall tax, tax rate will be depending on levels of taxable income and that’s impacted by credits and permanent items, which have a bigger impact on the effective rate, depending on how much income you have.
So I think our overall tax provision this quarter, it was really reflective of just working through those year end calculations and is kind of the final true up for the year, there was not any significant adjustments included in there. We did have some significant period items related to leasing litigation and bank owned life insurance that were in the first quarter that impacted the overall effective rate for the year and contributed to a very low effective rate overall.
I think as you look forward, the best way to look at our taxes is that we have about $100 million in tax credits that we would anticipate for 2010 and then our marginal tax rate on income that we earned is about 36%. So depending on the level of income, if you put that $100 million in tax credits with a provision of 36% of expected income, you would come up with a tax rate that won’t be 36%, would likely be less than that given the impact of the credits, but exactly what that rate would end up being will be a function of what taxable income for the year end would be.

Clearly one factor would be the overall economic trends within the footprint. We also would evaluate whether we’re seeing any particular themes in certain industry segments within the C&I portfolio, and actually in the past, we have called out a couple of segments of the portfolio more specifically as we saw those segments driving higher losses. The best examples of that being real estate related industries within C&I, as well as the dealer portion of the portfolio.
We’ve continued to see improvement in those areas and so as we look at the economic factors, as we look at the industry segments, we don’t see any particular theme coming out from an industry standpoint. There’s a fairly broad base that we look at. So at this point in time, that would be some of the consideration that would give rise to our comments.
The other thing I would point out in terms of loss severities, there’s really kind of a descending priority, if you will with regards to loss severities, starting first in the commercial portfolio with the nature of the construction product and/or the homebuilder portfolio, looking then at other elements of the non-owner occupied portfolio going from there to the owner occupied portfolio.
Then finally going to the CNI portion of the portfolio and because of the characteristics of the C&I portfolio, even as we may still see some additional stress there, the expectation would be that the loss severities in that portion of the portfolio would be far or less than what we experienced earlier in the cycle.

I'll make some opening comments and then hand the call over to Mary and Dan for a more detailed discussion of our credit and financial performance. For the past two years, credit trends have dominated our results. They have stirred [ph]  Positive developments resulting from our continued focus on our strategic plans and core operations. And while credit remains difficult and its impact remains significant, we are very pleased with the improvement in trends we saw in the fourth quarter. Charge-offs were $708 million, down $48 million from last quarter and NPAs were up just 1%. Total delinquencies were down 33%, including early and late stage. Those are welcome improvement from recent trends. We saw a drop in commercial net charge-offs from the third quarter, which as you'll recall, included the effect of annual Shared National Credit exam. We expect commercial charge-offs to decline significantly on the first quarter, and overall improved performance for all of 2010, as new problem assets generally have lower loss content than what we've been dealing with the past 12 or 18 months.We also have made great progress in dealing with commercial delinquencies this quarter. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were down 46% sequentially and loans past due 90 days or more were down 68% sequentially. This represented both improved flows during the quarter, as well as the efforts of our commercial banking and Special Assets Groups to address delinquencies, get them resolved and current or further the workout process.Commercial nonperforming assets were down about 1% in the quarter, which is the first drop we've seen in quite some time. We do expect commercial NPAs to increase in the first quarter, but we continue to believe the general trend is slowing. NPA inflows are continuing to shift to products where loss severities are lower, and workout options are greater like C&I and income producing real estate.Consumer charge-offs also declined in most categories and were down for the second consecutive quarter. We expect first quarter consumer charge-offs to increase modestly given the effect of bringing consumer securitizations back on balance sheet and normal seasonality. We currently expect consumer charge-offs for the remainder of the year to remain relatively stable, and below the levels we saw in mid 2009 based on migration trends and our current outlook for the economy.Our reserve position remains strong and nearly 5% of loans and 127% of NPLs. We expect losses in 2010 to be below 2009 levels and given our current executions, we don't expect any significant further reserve bills to be necessary.The implementation of FAS 166, 167 were results in a small increase to the reserve in the first quarter as we bring assets on the balance sheet. Mary and Dan will talk about that more in their remarks. Overall, we feel good about where we are with the reserve and that's a good position to be in as we head into 2010. Now let me give you some high-level operating results.The net interest margin increased 12 bips sequentially, a little better than we expected, which reflects good discipline on rates, and the rolling off of high cost CDs we put on last year. Net interest income was up modestly about 1%, reflecting good net interest margin and deposit trends largely offset by difficult environment for asset generation. Transaction deposits were up 6% from last quarter, with $1.1 billion of growth in DDA balances and $1.5 billion of growth in interest checking. Our strong deposit growth and muted asset trends have created a lot of liquidity and we've reduced wholesale funding by $17.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. Mortgage business continues to perform very well and we generated another $4.4 billion of originations during the quarter. This was a record year for both mortgage banking revenue and origination volume, and we've been pleased with our ability to continue that momentum throughout the year, even as the refinancing boom began to wane.Finally, last quarter, we discussed the significant impact of credit related charges recorded in revenue and expenses. These totaled $145 million in the third quarter of which $45 million was provisioned for unfunded commitments. This quarter, those charges dropped to $85 million with $10 million in unfunded provision. While it's difficult to predict the impact from quarter-over-quarter, I believe this is a more representative starting place for those costs as we move into 2010. Dan will talk later about the impact of those charges and where they appear in more detail.Finally, let me just make a couple of comments on the environment. Starting to see some additional positive indicators in the economy. For example, recent data showing that economic conditions improved in 10 of the 12 Fed Reserve Districts. Home sales and GDP both showed positive growth in the latter part of 2009. And the competitive environment is also much more rational than we experienced a year ago, which creates a more stable operating environment. Economic activities is still mixed. Many of our commercial clients are very nervous about investing in new projects. Commercial line utilizations at 33% is the lowest I've seen in my career, as customers are being conservative at extending themselves even when they have committed financing.Retail customers are continuing to deleverage, which is healthy for the economy in the long term, but will likely lead to a slower recovery than we've seen after other recent recessions. Housing prices remain well off their highs and while we've seen a smaller recovery in prices in some markets, a 5% increase after double-digit decreases still leaves a lot of people underwater. All told, a much better operating environment that we've seen in some time, the economy is not yet firing on all cylinders and improvement will likely be measured in the next several quarters.We continue to remain focused on our core operations and the things we can control, like customer satisfaction, deepening our relationships and investing in the company's future while remaining disciplined on expenses and driving higher revenue and profitability. We're confident these actions and those we've taken in the credit front will serve us well in 2010 and the future. With that, let me turn it over to Mary to discuss credit trends in more detail. Mary?"

As Kevin mentioned, overall credit trends were better than expected. Let me walk through results starting with charge-offs. Total net charge-offs was $708 million, decreased $48 million sequentially. Commercial net charge offs declined $32",2513,"Thanks, Kevin. As Kevin mentioned, overall credit trends were better than expected. Let me walk through results starting with charge-offs. Total net charge-offs was $708 million, decreased $48 million sequentially. Commercial net charge offs declined $32 million to $468 million from $500 million last quarter. If you'll recall, third quarter charge-offs were elevated due to higher losses related to the Shared National Credit exam. Florida and Michigan continue to represent a disproportionate share of charge-offs and while Florida will remain a challenging market for sometime, parts of our Michigan portfolio have begun to show signs of bottoming out.C&I net losses this quarter totaled $183 million, down $73 million with a sequential decline attributable to a broad base of industry segments and the effects of the SNC exam in the third quarter. Michigan and Florida accounted for 52% of C&I losses during the quarter while representing 23% of C&I loans.Commercial construction net charge-offs were $135 million, up $9 million with Michigan and Florida generating 61% of losses. Commercial mortgage losses of $142 million, increased $24 million from the third quarter, with Michigan and Florida contributing 56% of losses. Across the portfolio, homebuilder/developer losses totaled $110 million, which was flat versus the third quarter. You'll recall that we suspended homebuilder originations two years ago, have already recognized significant charge-offs in that portfolio and work to reduce our exposure. Portfolio balances are $1.6 billion, less than half of their peak level. We expect losses there to come down given the work we've done on that portfolio.As Kevin touched on earlier, our current expectations are for commercial charge-offs to come down again in the first quarter. While commercial charge-offs can be somewhat lumpy, we believe they'll be down about 100 million in the first quarter give or take, from $468 million this quarter and that they should remain well below the levels we experienced in the latter part of 2009.Turning to the consumer portfolio, consumer net charge-offs decreased $16 million during the quarter, totaling $240 million. Improvement was broad-based. Net charge-offs on the residential mortgage portfolio were $78 million, a decrease of $14 million from the third quarter. Michigan and Florida accounted for 73% of losses from 42% of the total mortgage portfolio.Home equity losses increased $2 million, sequentially to $82 million, including $34 million of losses in the brokered portfolio. The net charge-offs rate on brokered home equity was about 7% annualized, which is almost four times the loss rate on our branch originated books.The brokered equity portfolio is $1.9 billion of outstanding, down from about $3.5 billion a couple of years ago and continues to runoff. Auto loan net charge-offs were down $2 million sequentially, reflecting higher values received at auction. Performance has been very good in this portfolio throughout the cycle and reflects a number of improvements in underwriting in the past couple of years.Credit card losses were flat compared with the third and second quarters. Total card balances are about $2 billion and as we've discussed previously, this is a branch originated in footprint relationship product for us. We'd expect card charge-offs to trend with unemployment and bankruptcy filings over time. We expect first quarter consumer charge-offs to increase modestly about $10 million or so from the fourth quarter. That reflects the effect of bringing consumer securitizations on balance sheet due to FAS 166 and 167 and seasonality. Beyond that, current migration trends and expectations would suggest that consumer losses should remain pretty stable in the remainder of 2010.We continually update our stress test model and have outlined the result of those scenarios, which I just described on one of the slides in our normal earnings presentation posted on the website. Taking our commercial and consumer charge-offs expectations together, we currently expect 2010 charge-offs to be lower than the $2.6 billion we experienced in 2009.To place that into a broader context, in our SCAP [Supervisory Capital Assessment Program] submission, we submitted baseline credit losses of $2.9 billion for 2009 and $2.8 billion in 2010. Our actual charge-offs in 2009 were about $300 million lower than our baseline submission. And as I just noted, we currently expect charge-offs to be lower than $2.6 billion in 2010. In our revised current view of 2010 trust scenario losses, which we don't believe is likely, is actually much closer to our original SCAP baseline scenario than the SCAP adverse scenario published in May.  We've also posted the extensive portfolio stratification we have traditionally published to provide as much transparency as we can into our credit results and expectations. Now moving on to NPAs. NPAs including held for sale, totaled $3.5 billion at quarter end, down 1% from the third quarter. Excluding $224 million of NPAs in our held-for-sale portfolio where the loans have already been fully marked, portfolio NPAs totaled $3.2 billion. That represented growth of just $24 million or 1%. Florida and Michigan remained the most challenged geographies and account for 44% of NPAs in the portfolio.Portfolio commercial NPAs declined by $20 million or 1% from the third quarter, which was better than we originally expected. That was due to a variety of factors: Improved financial performance, less deterioration than we expected during the quarter, and higher pay downs than we expected. That's a reflection of improving migration trends and the effects of shifting from a period of high sustained growth to an environment that shows signs of beginning to stabilize.Within NPAs, commercial TDRs, our non-accrual status increased to $47 million from $18 million last quarter. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans where it makes good economic sense for the bank. For credits where cash flow support the rework structure. Commercial construction NPAs decreased to $44 million. Florida and Michigan were down $50 million combined. Commercial mortgage NPAs were up $16 million. C&I NPAs were down $9 million from the third quarter with Florida the biggest driver of the decrease.Across the portfolios, residential builder and developer NPAs at $548 million, represented 22% of total commercial NPAs and were down $52 million sequentially. As Kevin discussed, based on current migration expectations, we expect commercial NPAs to be up moderately in the first quarter with commercial NPA inflows lower than fourth quarter inflows.Of NPAs inflows currently forecasted in the first quarter, a majority were current at year end, and we believe that's indicative of a reasonable workout potential for these NPAs in many cases. We anticipate commercial NPAs over the course of the year to generally reflect the broader slowing trend that we've seen in the past several quarters. Improved early stage delinquency results are encouraging in this respect. And liquidity has improved from moving distressed assets and that adds another method of managing NPAs as we move into 2010.Moving to consumer NPA trends, NPAs totaled $704 million at the end of the quarter, a $44 million or 7% sequential increase from the third quarter. Non-accrual consumer TDR were $33 million of the increase. Residential mortgage NPAs increased $38 million during the quarter to $523 million with TDRs representing $26 million of the sequential growth. Home equity NPAs totaled $71 million at the end of the fourth quarter, down $1 million from third quarter level.Auto NPAs were flat and credit card NPAs were up $7 million with the increase attributable to TDRs. In terms of overall consumer TDR activity, we've modified about $2.7 billion of loan since the third quarter of 2007, of which $258 million were carried as non-accruals at December 31.A little over a quarter of the loans we've restructured to date have redefaulted. On a lags basis, as you would expect, redefault rates are higher but remains below 40% of modified loans. We believe that experience is generally in line with the industry. As this portfolio matures, we'd expect TDR redefault to continue to increase due to seasoning. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of our loss mitigation efforts.In the first quarter, we expect consumer NPAs to grow in the mid-single digits, consistent with fourth quarter trends or perhaps a little better. We would expect modest consumer NPA growth going forward, driven primarily by increased TDRs, the result of our active modification program. To wrap up the NPA discussion, we believe we've been as aggressive as anyone in ensuring that we've written problem loans down to realistic and realizable value. Total NPAs, commercial and consumer, are being carried at approximately 59% of their original face value through the process of taking charge offs, marks and specific reserves recorded through the fourth quarter.Moving to delinquency trends. Commercial loans, 30 to 89 days past due, were $367 million and declined by $318 million or 46% from the third quarter. Commercial loans 90 days past due were about $200 million and dropped $414 million compared with the third quarter, a 68% decline. As noted last quarter, we had a number of delinquencies with the loan with past maturity but still current, which have since then resolved. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect the seasonal increase in delinquencies from these very low levels experienced in the fourth quarter but for growth to be moderate. As we discussed last quarter, consumer delinquency trends overall have continued to moderate. Three key drivers of those trends are the seasoning of loans made in 2005, significant underwriting improvements in home equity and auto portfolios and the runoff of mortgages due to our 95% salability strategy. These factors are having an increasing impact on the performance of the portfolio. Consumer delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due increased to 4% sequentially to $528 million. Consumer loans over 90 days past due were $369 million, down $12 million, with Florida representing the largest decline for the second consecutive quarter. We expect delinquencies to be up modestly in the first quarter, with 30 to 89 relatively stable and over 90s, reflecting the growth in early-stage delinquencies in the fourth quarter.A couple of comments on provision expense and the allowance. Provision expense for the quarter was $766 million and exceeded net charge offs by $68 million. This increase to the allowance to $3.75 billion. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong, covering non-performing loans by 127% and fourth quarter annualized net charge off by 132%, and we feel we are well positioned here, absent unexpected development.Let me spend a moment on a couple of other topics. First, an update on the non-performing loans we've moved to held-for-sale status. Those balances were originally $473 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and they're down to $216 million at the end of 2009. In the fourth quarter, we also moved $9 million into held for sale from the portfolio. During the quarter, we received payments of $16 million and wrote down principle balances of retained loans by $13 million. We also sold settled or closed $61 million these NPAs during the quarter and realized about $4 million of gains on those sales and transferred $3 million to OREO. Since we moved these loans, our realization of gains and write-downs largely offset and these values overall are consistent with our original mark. We currently carry the remaining loans in this pool at about $0.33 on the dollar of their original contractional balances. To sum up, we're encouraged by recent trends but we're also realistic about the environment. Unemployment is high and is expected to remain high. Home prices have stopped declining precipitously but has not turned around yet, and in some markets, they continue to be under significant pressure. Those forces suggest that consumer losses will remain elevated for some time. Additionally, while we've been very pleased with the results of our consumer loan modification, not all of those modifications are going to be successful. And we'll see some NPAs and losses developed from those loans even as we see improvement in overall trends. But we've taken that into account in our outlook, and believe these actions will reduce the losses the company ultimately experiences.On the commercial side, we've been through a part of the cycle where loss severity has been very high due to the nature and type of products involved, namely, commercial construction and residential development. Those areas dominated our NPA inflows and charge offs through 2008 and 2009. Our current inflows have been more reflective of typical cycle development, including C&I and commercial mortgage.There's been a lot of justified focus on commercial real estate at this stage of the cycle, so let me make a few comments on that front. Our commercial real estate loans are about $15.6 billion or 20% of the loan portfolio, which is a relatively low percentage compared with other regional banks. Of that $15.6 billion, $11.8 billion is in commercial mortgage and $3.8 billion is in commercial construction. Obviously, the construction portfolio has been under the most stress, and we've been very proactive managing this portion of the loan portfolio. We suspended the homebuilder and developer loans back in 2007 and non-owner occupied real estate lending in early 2008. While we expect to see continued stress in the area, these credits were affected earlier in the cycle given the issues in residential real estate and shortfalls on adequate cash flow to bring projects to fruition.The current stage of the cycle is marked by a shift in NPA inflows toward income-producing properties backed by mortgages. Of our $11.8 billion commercial mortgage portfolio, about half of non-owner occupied that is income producing. The cash flow from these properties gives us a much greater ability to work these loans out and as a result, we tend to experience lower loss severities in the loans that created most of the issues earlier in the cycle. But they do typically take time to work out. And so like consumer, we expect commercial charge-off to remain elevated in 2010, but we do expect to see significant improvement in loss experienced during the year versus what we saw during the past couple of quarters. The burden of provisioning on earnings and on capital generation has been pretty material over the past couple of years. In 2008 and 2009, we incurred provision expense of almost $3 billion in excess of charge-offs. The elimination of that additional burden should have a significant positive effect on results, even if charge-offs remain higher than we'd like. We experienced pain from this credit cycle earlier than others, given our geographies and given some product areas where we frankly made some loans we shouldn't have made. Brokered home equity and homebuilder lending were two areas that stand out. But there are others we've discussed over the past several years. Because of these factors, particularly the early cycles in Michigan and in Florida, we adjusted our underwriting earlier, we charged loans off earlier and we built reserves earlier and more significantly than many of our peers.We've tried to be aggressive in recognizing issues and getting them resolved and behind us. As a result, we don't believe we have an overhang or any catch-up to deal with and we feel well positioned as we move into 2010. With that, I'll turn things over to Dan to discuss operating trends. Dan?"

As Kevin noted, while this quarter still reflects a difficult environment, we did see significant progress, not only on the credit front, but in operating results as well.

As Kevin noted, while this quarter still reflects a difficult environment, we did see significant progress, not only on the credit front, but in operating results as well. For the quarter, we reported a net loss of $98 million and paid preferred dividends of $62 million, which resulted in a loss of $160 million on available-to-common-shareholders basis.Last quarter, our net loss was $97 million or $159 million to common [ph]. Excluding the effects of Visa, on a core basis the net loss last quarter, was $303 million compared with this quarter's $98 million net loss.A $200 million after-tax improvement was driven by three factors. The first was a lower provision, which was down $176 million pretax, reflecting both lower charge-offs as well as a lower reserve build. The second was lower credit related cost in revenues and expenses, which was down $60 million pretax. And then the third was our favorable operating trends. As Kevin and Mary noted, we expect the first quarter charge-offs to come down again and we don't expect much of a reserve build, if any, next quarter beyond the effect of FAS 166 and 167. So we're currently expecting earnings trends to improve, again, in the first quarter as we move closer to moving that bottom line positive. Some of the major themes for the quarter outside of credit were continued net interest margin expansion, lower credit-related costs and strong deposit growth. Net interest margin increased 12 basis points sequentially to 3.55%. As of previous quarters, the expansion was driven by maturities of high rate CDs put on the sheet in the fall of 2008. Net interest income was up $8 million or 1%, with the margin benefit of strong deposit growth, offset by asset growth headwinds that we've been experiencing recently.Average core deposits grew by 3% sequentially and 11% on a year-over-year basis, with strong growth in transaction accounts. Compared with last quarter, credit costs recognized through fee income and operating expense were down significantly, totaling $85 million this quarter compared with $145 million last quarter. That positive variance was driven by a lower provision for unfunded commitments, lower credit-related derivative losses and lower fair value adjustments on loans held for sale. I'll talk about the revenue and expense included [ph] on these charges in a moment.Going forward, we expect these costs to remain elevated but this quarter's number is closer to a run rate that should improve over time. Overall, it's a pretty clean quarter, although there were two significant items that largely offset one another. We recorded a mark-to-market gain on warrants we hold from the FTPS transaction, which are valued based on a set of publicly traded proxies. That gain was $20 million and was recorded in other income. We also recorded a $22 million reserve for litigation risks associated with one of our bank card association memberships and that was recorded in other expense.With that context, let's go through the balance sheet in a bit more detail. Average earning assets were down about 2% compared with last quarter, and 4% on a year-over-year basis. This trend continues to be driven by soft commercial loan demand and the continued impact of our strategy of targeting the sale of about 95% of our mortgage production. Let me mention here the prospective effect on our balance sheet of FAS 166 and 167, which we implement on January 1, 2010. This was a fairly minor event for Fifth Third, but it will result in loans in the first quarter increasing by about $2.3 million and securities being reduced by about $900 million.The loans come from the consolidation of approximately $1.5 billion in consumer loan securitizations and from $800 million of commercial loan conduit assets, which will be added to loans. Offsetting that will be our previous investments of $800 million in the conduits commercial paper and a net of $100 million in other securities, which will go away. Thus, the net effect on earning assets overall will be about $1.4 billion.Now looking at the fourth quarter. Average loans held for investment were down 3% sequentially and 10% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to the $2.3 billion effect of FAS 166 and 167, we believe that C&I balances are reaching a bottom and will begin to see some organic growth soon. CRE loans on the other hand will likely continue to decline for at least several more quarters. For the year, we'd expect loan balances to begin to grow modestly, although it's a little early to say how much that growth may be over the course of the year.Now to give a little more detail by product types. In the fourth quarter, average commercial loans decreased 4% or $2.1 billion, with the majority of that decline reflecting lower line utilization as well as charge-offs. Line utilization was down $1 billion sequentially and was down $3.9 million from a year ago.This lower line utilization reflects customer caution. We still have those relationships, and as their confidence returns, this will represent some built-in loan growth as line usage returns. Average consumer loans were down 1% sequentially and 3% on a year-over-year basis. Auto loan balances increased 1% sequentially and 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. We're pleased to see growth continue here beyond the third quarter benefit from the Cash for Clunkers program. Auto loan demand remains solid and credit performance has been good. Going forward, loan balances will reflect the inclusion of about $1.2 billion in auto loans that will be consolidated on January 1, 2010. Credit card balances were up 1% on a sequential basis and 13% on a year-over-year basis. Residential mortgages were down 3% sequentially and 13% from a year ago, as we continue to sell most of our new production. Flow [ph] sales during the quarter were $4.2 billion. Home equity loans were down 1% sequentially and 3% on a year-over-year basis. We currently expect home equity loan balances to be relatively stable in 2010, which reflects relatively low demand but some stabilization in home prices in a number of our markets.Average securities increased by about $800 million during the quarter, with proceeds primarily invested agency mortgage-backed securities. We'll continue to evaluate securities investments in the context of loan growth, in the context of excess funding and of course, the overall interest rate environment.We remain very thoughtful about taking these positions, given our expectation for future rate increases, although the risk reward profile has improved recently. We supplemented our balance sheet hedges to reflect these purchases, and to maintain our overall relatively neutral interest rate risk position. Moving on to deposits. We saw a continued strong deposit growth momentum this quarter with a significant positive shift in mix toward lower-cost deposits. Average core deposit growth was 3% sequentially and 11% on a year-over-year basis. Transaction account showed the strongest growth with DDA balances up 6% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. We also had significant growth in interest checking deposits, which increased 10% sequentially and a 19% on a year-over-year basis. Looking forward to the first quarter, we expect core deposit growth to be fairly similar to the fourth. Given the low rate environment, customers continue to value liquidity and we expect that will continue in the near term. Retail core deposits were flat sequentially and increased 6% on a year-over-year basis. Our new higher value and bundled product offerings are attracting higher average balances.We've gotten good feedback from customers on these new product offerings. That offset, a decline in net new account production, which was driven by our no-longer offering the totally-free checking product. Total commercial core deposits were up 12% sequentially and 28% from a year ago. Commercial DDAs increased 10% from the third quarter and 46% from last year, while commercial interest checking increased 22% sequentially and 47% from last year. I would note that average public fund balances in interest checking increased by $1 billion on a sequential basis, and as tax refunds are issued, we would expect some of that growth to reverse. Otherwise, the growth has been driven by higher average balances, which reflects cautiousness and excess liquidity among our customers.As I noted earlier, our liquidity remains very strong. Wholesale funding levels were reduced again this quarter by $3.8 billion or 15%, and we've now paid down $17.5 billion of wholesale funding since a year ago. Let me give a quick update on FTPS, the deconversion process continues and we've completed transitioning of a number of core HR functions over to the joint venture. Retained card and processing fee income was up modestly on a sequential basis coming in at $76 million for the quarter compared with $74 million last quarter. Card and processing expense of $27 million compares to $25 million last quarter, and includes about $10 million of retained expense as well as $17 million in charges from FTPS related to their providing of processing services to the bank.We also had a $39 million of revenue from the FTPS transition services agreement or TSA, which covers cost of a similar amount incurred by Fifth Third in providing services to the processing JV. Net revenue is recorded in other non-interest income. Last quarter, we had about $38 million of TSA-related revenue. We would expect approximate $12 million to $15 million of TSA revenue in the first quarter and between $45 million and $50 million for all of 2010. We would expect first quarter expenses to decline in the like fashion.Finally, we recognized equity method income of $8 million related to our 49% interest in the joint venture through the other income line. That compares with about $7 million last quarter and the $8 million did not include the warrant mark-to-market adjustment, which I talked about earlier.Moving on now to the income statement, starting with net interest income. Net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis increased $8 million sequentially to $882 million. That was driven primarily by deposit repricing and partially offset by lower loan balances. Net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 3.55%, a little better than we expected on wider deposit and in loan spreads. We currently expect margin to expand another five to 10 basis points in the first quarter, with solid growth in net interest income, perhaps in the $15 million range, including about $10 million effect from adding the assets that we talked abut earlier related to FAS 166 and 167. As we move further into the year, we'd expect earning asset growth driven by modest growth in loans and securities and a margin that is likely to be stable after the first quarter in the near term.Moving onto fees. Third quarter noninterest income was $651 million. Non-core items in noninterest income are outlined pretty thoroughly in the earnings release, I won't go through those in detail. But on a core basis, fee income increased $30 million or 5% from the third quarter and $73 million or 13% from the fourth quarter of 2008. Credit-related charges that roll through noninterest income fell on the quarter from $45 million last quarter to approximately $30 million this quarter.The strong year-over-year results come primarily from the increases in mortgage banking revenue. Corporate banking revenue of $98 million for the quarter was up $12 million from a seasonally soft third quarter or about 15%. Sequential growth was driven by institutional sales, interest rate derivatives revenue and business lending fees, and partially offset by declines in foreign exchange revenue.We expect solid results again in the first quarter, although they will likely be lower than the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Deposit service charges were down 3% from the third quarter and 2% from a year ago. Consumer deposit fees were down approximately $6 million on a sequential basis, which more than offset a $1 million increase in commercial deposit fees.We continue to position our checking account offerings for changes on the regulatory environment, which contributed to the lower consumer deposit fees this quarter, as well as to an anticipated similar decline in the first quarter. We'd expect some positive seasonality in the second quarter and additional account growth to offset these effects after the first quarter.We've been proactive in adjusting our offerings, and we believe we're well positioned in terms of regulatory developments and offering value to our customers. Investment advisory revenue increased 4% sequentially and declined 2% on a year-over-year basis. Recent market performance has benefited the trust asset management and brokerage groups, and we're expecting strong growth again in the first quarter.As mentioned earlier, mortgage origination volume remain robust during the quarter at about $4.4 billion. Net mortgage revenue of $132 million was down $8 million from last quarter.We continue to capture greater market share, and purchase originations increased to 36% of our volumes in the fourth quarter. Right now, we expect net mortgage banking revenue to decline about $20 million or so in the first quarter. Obviously, that could move significantly, but overall, we've been very pleased with the continued strength of this business.We currently expect fee income for the first quarter to be about $580 million, give or take. Relative to the fourth quarter, that would reflect three main drivers. First, the decline in TSA revenue, I outlined earlier, which is about $25 million. Second is the effect of the $20 million gain on warrants that was recorded in the third quarter. And third, we expect mortgage banking revenue to be down about $20 million. Beyond the first quarter, which is a seasonally low quarter, we expect fee growth to pick up on positive seasonality in the second quarter and growth across our fee businesses through the remainder of the year.Turning to expenses. Non-interest expense of $967 million was up 10% sequentially. However, fourth quarter results included the $22 million litigation reserve that I mentioned earlier, while third quarter results included a net $73 million reduction in expense due to Visa. Exclude these items, expenses were $945 million in the fourth quarter, down just slightly from core expenses of $949 million in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, total credit-related costs within operating expenses includes the provision for unfunded commitments or $55 million versus $100 million last quarter. This positive variance was partially offset by the effects of a $14 million tax related accrual and $8 million in growth and marketing expense.We currently expect non-interest expense in the first quarter to be consistent with that $945 million in the fourth quarter core expenses, and expect the $20 million increase in seasonal FICA and unemployment expense will be offset by the reduction in FTPS support expenses that I mentioned earlier, which is primarily personnel related. Let me stop for a moment and just do a quick reconciliation of pre-provision net revenue. Reported pretax pre-provision earnings were $562 million in the fourth quarter and that's consistent with the core number. Last quarter, core PPNR was about $530 million. We would anticipate PPNR to be down about $20 million to $30 million in the first quarter given the expectations for a reduction in mortgage banking revenue and the effect of the $20 million in seasonal benefits expense I mentioned just a minute ago. Offsetting those negative variances, we'd be pretty solid growth in net interest income. We currently expect PPNR results at subsequent quarters to rebound and exceed fourth quarter levels, driven by net interest income grows, growth in fee businesses and lower credit related operating expenses.Let me add to my comments on the implementation of FAS 166 and 167 this quarter. We will record a cumulative effective adjustment to retain earnings in the first quarter, which we currently estimate to be a charge of approximately $90 million. That will reflect the valuation marks and the net difference in the carrying value of assets recognized and derecognized as part of that adoption. That charge would include in addition to the loan loss reserve of approximately $10 million for loans that are being added to the balance sheet, as well as a portion of the reserve for unfunded commitments will also be reclassified as a reserve for loan losses to reflect the conduit assets that are being added to the loan portfolio.Now moving on to capital. Our quarter-end capital ratios remain strong. The TCE ratio excluding $240 million of unrealized securities gains was 6.5%. Tier one common equity was 7% and tier one capital was 13.3%. The effect of incorporating the net $1.4 billion of assets under the balance sheet and a charge to equity will reduce our TCE ratio by about 15 basis points. We already carry those assets in our risk-weighted asset calculations for regulatory purposes and thus the effect on tier one and total capital ratios will be less than five basis points. I think with that, I'll open it up for questions."

So I think our overall tax provision this quarter was really reflective of just working through those year end calculations. And it's kind of the final true up for the year. There was not any significant adjustment included in there. We did have some significant period items related to leasing litigation and bank-owned life insurance that were in the first quarter that impacted the overall effective rate for the year and contributed to a very low effective tax rate overall. I think as you look forward, the best way to look at our taxes is that we have about $100 million in tax credits that we would anticipate for 2010. And then our marginal tax rate on income that we earned is about 36%. So depending on the level of income, if you put that $100 million in tax credits with a provision of 36% of expected income, you'd come up with a tax rate. It won't be 36%, would likely be less than that given the impact of the credits. But exactly what that rate would end up being will be a function of what taxable income for the year end would be."

Clearly, one factor would be the overall economic trends within the footprint. We also would evaluate whether we're seeing any particular themes in certain industry segments within the C&I portfolio. And actually in the past, we have called out a couple of segments of the portfolio more specifically as we saw the segments driving higher losses. The best example for that being real estate related industries within C&I, as well as the dealer portion of the portfolio. We've continue to see an improvement in those areas. And so as we look at the economic factors, as we look at the industry segments, we don't see any particular theme coming out from an industry standpoint, but there's a fairly broad base that we look at. So at this point in time, that would be some of the consideration that would give rights to our comments. The other thing that I would point out in terms of loss severities is there's really kind of a descending priority if you will, with respect to loss severities. Starting first in the commercial portfolio with the nature of the construction product and/or the homebuilder portfolio. Looking then in other elements of the non-owner occupied portfolio going from there to the owner occupied portfolio. And then finally going to the C&I portion of the portfolio. And because of the characteristics of the C&I portfolio, even as we may still see some additional trust there, the expectation would be that the loss severities in that portion of the portfolio would be far less than what we experienced earlier in the cycle."

I'll make some opening comments and then hand the call over to Mary and Dan for a more detailed discussion of our credit and financial performance. For the past two years, credit trends have dominated our results. They've obscured positive developments resulting from our continued focus on our strategic plans and core operations. And while credit remains difficult and its impact remains significant, we are very pleased with the improvement in trends we saw in the fourth quarter. Charge-offs were $708 million, down $48 million from last quarter and NPAs were up just 1%. Total delinquencies were down 33%, including early and late stage. Those are welcome improvements from recent trends. We saw a drop in commercial net charge-offs from the third quarter, which as you'll recall, included the effect of the annual Shared National Credit exam. We expect commercial charge-offs to decline significantly on the first quarter. And overall improved performance for all of 2010 as new problem assets generally have lower loss content than what we've been dealing with the past 12 or 18 months.We also have made great progress in dealing with commercial delinquencies this quarter. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were down 46% sequentially and loans past due 90 days or more were down 68% sequentially. This represented both improved flows during the quarter as well as the efforts of our commercial banking and Special Assets Groups to address delinquencies, get them resolved and current or to further the workout process.Commercial nonperforming assets were down about 1% in the quarter, which is the first drop we've seen in quite some time. We do expect commercial NPAs to increase in the first quarter, but we continue to believe the general trend is slowing. NPA inflows are continuing to shift to products where loss severities are lower and workout options are greater, like C&I and income-producing real estate.Consumer charge-offs also declined in most categories and were down for the second consecutive quarter. We expect first quarter consumer charge-offs to increase modestly given the effect of bringing consumer securitizations back on balance sheet and normal seasonality. We currently expect consumer charge-offs for the remainder of the year to remain relatively stable and below the levels we saw in mid 2009 based on migration trends and our current outlook for the economy.  Our reserve position remains strong and nearly 5% of loans and 127% of NPLs. We expect losses in 2010 to be below 2009 levels and given our current executions, we don't expect any significant further reserve bills to be necessary.The implementation of FAS 166, 167 will result in a small increase to the reserve in the first quarter as we bring assets on balance sheet. Mary and Dan will talk about that more in their remarks. Overall we feel good about where we are with the reserve and that's a good position to be in as we head into 2010. Now let me give you some high-level operating results.The net interest margin increased 12 bps sequentially, a little better than we expected, which reflects good discipline on rates and the rolling off of high-cost CDs we put on last year. Net interest income was up modestly, about 1%, reflecting good net interest margin and deposit trends largely offset by difficult environment for asset generation. Transaction deposits were up 6% from last quarter, with $1.1 billion of growth in DDA balances and $1.5 billion of growth in interest checking. Our strong deposit growth and muted asset trends have created a lot of liquidity and we've reduced wholesale funding by $17.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. Mortgage business continues to perform very well and we generated another $4.4 billion of originations during the quarter. This was a record year for both mortgage banking revenue and origination volume. And we've been pleased with our ability to continue that momentum throughout the year even as the refinancing boom began to wane.Finally, last quarter, we discussed the significant impact of credit related charges recorded in revenue and expenses. These totaled $145 million in the third quarter of which $45 million was provisioned for unfunded commitments. This quarter, those charges dropped to $85 million with $10 million in unfunded provision. While it's difficult to predict the impact from quarter-to-quarter, I believe this is a more representative starting place for those costs as we move into 2010. Dan will talk later about the impact of those charges and where they appear in more detail.Finally, let me just make a couple of comments on the environment. We're starting to see some additional positive indicators in the economy. For example, recent data showing that economic conditions improved in 10 of the 12 Fed Reserve Districts. Home sales and GDP both showed positive growth in the latter part of 2009. And the competitive environment is also much more rational than we experienced a year ago which creates a more stable operating environment. Economic activity is still mixed. Many of our commercial clients are very nervous about investing in new projects. Commercial line utilization at 33% is the lowest I've seen in my career, as customers are being conservative at extending themselves even when they have committed financing.Retail customers are continuing to deleverage, which is healthy for the economy in the long term, but will likely lead to a slower recovery than we've seen after other recent recessions. Housing prices remain well off their highs and while we've seen a small recovery in prices in some markets, a 5% increase after double-digit decreases still leaves a lot of people underwater. All told, a much better operating environment that we've seen in some time, the economy is not yet firing on all cylinders and improvement will likely be measured in the next several quarters.We continue to remain focused on our core operations and the things we can control, like customer satisfaction, deepening our relationships and investing in the company's future while remaining disciplined on expenses and driving higher revenue and profitability. We're confident these actions and those we've taken in the credit front will serve us well in 2010 and the future. With that, let me turn it over to Mary to discuss credit trends in more detail. Mary?"
270961,84102665,46556,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-21-2010",2010-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. As Kevin mentioned, overall credit trends were better than expected. Let me walk through results starting with charge-offs. Total net charge-offs was $708 million, decreased $48 million sequentially. Commercial net charge offs declined $32",2509,"Thanks, Kevin. As Kevin mentioned, overall credit trends were better than expected. Let me walk through results starting with charge-offs. Total net charge-offs was $708 million, decreased $48 million sequentially. Commercial net charge offs declined $32 million to $468 million from $500 million last quarter. If you'll recall, third quarter charge-offs were elevated due to higher losses related to the Shared National Credit exam. Florida and Michigan continue to represent a disproportionate share of charge-offs and while Florida will remain a challenging market for sometime, parts of our Michigan portfolio have begun to show signs of bottoming out.C&I net losses this quarter totaled $183 million, down $73 million with a sequential decline attributable to a broad base of industry segments and the effects of the SNC exam in the third quarter. Michigan and Florida accounted for 52% of C&I losses during the quarter while representing 23% of C&I loans.Commercial construction net charge-offs were $135 million, up $9 million with Michigan and Florida generating 61% of losses. Commercial mortgage losses of $142 million, increased $24 million from the third quarter with Michigan and Florida contributing 56% of losses. Across the portfolio, homebuilder/developer losses totaled $110 million, which was flat versus the third quarter. You'll recall that we suspended homebuilder originations two years ago, have already recognized significant charge-offs in that portfolio and work to reduce our exposure. Portfolio balances are $1.6 billion, less than half of their peak level. We expect losses there to come down given the work we've done on that portfolio.As Kevin touched on earlier, our current expectations are for commercial charge-offs to come down again in the first quarter. While commercial charge-offs can be somewhat lumpy, we believe they'll be down about 100 million in the first quarter, give or take, from $468 million this quarter and that they should remain well below the levels we experienced in the latter part of 2009.Turning to the consumer portfolio, consumer net charge-offs decreased $16 million during the quarter, totaling $240 million. Improvement was broad-based. Net charge-offs on the residential mortgage portfolio were $78 million, a decrease of $14 million from the third quarter. Michigan and Florida accounted for 73% of losses from 42% of the total mortgage portfolio.Home equity losses increased $2 million, sequentially to $82 million, including $34 million of losses in the brokered portfolio. The net charge-offs rate on brokered home equity was about 7% annualized, which is almost four times the loss rate on our branch originated books.The brokered equity portfolio is $1.9 billion of outstanding, down from about $3.5 billion a couple of years ago and continues to runoff. Auto loan net charge-offs were down $2 million sequentially, reflecting higher values received at auction. Performance has been very good in this portfolio throughout the cycle and reflects a number of improvements in underwriting in the past couple of years.Credit card losses were flat compared with the third and second quarters. Total card balances are about $2 billion and as we've discussed previously, this is a branch originated in footprint relationship product for us. We'd expect card charge-offs to trend with unemployment and bankruptcy filings over time. We expect first quarter consumer charge-offs to increase modestly about $10 million or so from the fourth quarter. That reflects the effect of bringing consumer securitizations on balance sheet due to FAS 166 and 167 and seasonality. Beyond that, current migration trends and expectations would suggest that consumer losses should remain pretty stable in the remainder of 2010.We continually update our stress test model and have outlined the result of those scenarios, which I just described on one of the slides in our normal earnings presentation posted on the website. Taking our commercial and consumer charge-offs expectations together, we currently expect 2010 charge-offs to be lower than the $2.6 billion we experienced in 2009.To place that into a broader context, in our SCAP [Supervisory Capital Assessment Program] submission, we submitted baseline credit losses of $2.9 billion for 2009 and $2.8 billion in 2010. Our actual charge-offs in 2009 were about $300 million lower than our baseline submission. And as I just noted, we currently expect charge-offs to be lower than $2.6 billion in 2010. In our revised current view of 2010 trust scenario losses, which we don't believe is likely, is actually much closer to our original SCAP baseline scenario than the SCAP adverse scenario published in May.  We've also posted the extensive portfolio stratification we have traditionally published to provide as much transparency as we can into our credit results and expectations. Now moving on to NPAs. NPAs including held for sale, totaled $3.5 billion at quarter end, down 1% from the third quarter. Excluding $224 million of NPAs in our held-for-sale portfolio where the loans have already been fully marked, portfolio NPAs totaled $3.2 billion. That represented growth of just $24 million or 1%. Florida and Michigan remained the most challenged geographies and account for 44% of NPAs in the portfolio.Portfolio commercial NPAs declined by $20 million or 1% from the third quarter, which was better than we originally expected. That was due to a variety of factors: Improved financial performance, less deterioration than we expected during the quarter, and higher pay downs than we expected. That's a reflection of improving migration trends and the effects of shifting from a period of high sustained growth to an environment that shows signs of beginning to stabilize.Within NPAs, commercial TDRs, our non-accrual status increased to $47 million from $18 million last quarter. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans where it makes good economic sense for the bank. For credits where cash flow support the rework structure. Commercial construction NPAs decreased to $44 million. Florida and Michigan were down $50 million combined. Commercial mortgage NPAs were up $16 million. C&I NPAs were down $9 million from the third quarter with Florida the biggest driver of the decrease.Across the portfolios, residential builder and developer NPAs at $548 million, represented 22% of total commercial NPAs and were down $52 million sequentially. As Kevin discussed, based on current migration expectations, we expect commercial NPAs to be up moderately in the first quarter with commercial NPA inflows lower than fourth quarter inflows.Of NPAs inflows currently forecasted in the first quarter, a majority were current at year end, and we believe that's indicative of a reasonable workout potential for these NPAs in many cases. We anticipate commercial NPAs over the course of the year to generally reflect the broader slowing trend that we've seen in the past several quarters. Improved early stage delinquency results are encouraging in this respect. And liquidity has improved from moving distressed assets and that adds another method of managing NPAs as we move into 2010.Moving to consumer NPA trends, NPAs totaled $704 million at the end of the quarter, a $44 million or 7% sequential increase from the third quarter. Non-accrual consumer TDR were $33 million of the increase. Residential mortgage NPAs increased $38 million during the quarter to $523 million with TDRs representing $26 million of the sequential growth. Home equity NPAs totaled $71 million at the end of the fourth quarter, down $1 million from third quarter level.Auto NPAs were flat and credit card NPAs were up $7 million with the increase attributable to TDRs. In terms of overall consumer TDR activity, we've modified about $2.7 billion of loan since the third quarter of 2007, of which $258 million were carried as non-accruals at December 31.A little over a quarter of the loans we've restructured to date have redefaulted. On a lags basis, as you would expect, redefault rates are higher but remains below 40% of modified loans. We believe that experience is generally in line with the industry. As this portfolio matures, we'd expect TDR redefault to continue to increase due to seasoning. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of our loss mitigation efforts.In the first quarter, we expect consumer NPAs to grow in the mid-single digits, consistent with fourth quarter trends or perhaps a little better. We would expect modest consumer NPA growth going forward, driven primarily by increased TDRs, the result of our active modification program. To wrap up the NPA discussion, we believe we've been as aggressive as anyone in ensuring that we've written problem loans down to realistic and realizable value. Total NPAs, commercial and consumer, are being carried at approximately 59% of their original face value through the process of taking charge offs, marks and specific reserves recorded through the fourth quarter.Moving to delinquency trends. Commercial loans, 30 to 89 days past due, were $367 million and declined by $318 million or 46% from the third quarter. Commercial loans 90 days past due were about $200 million and dropped $414 million compared with the third quarter, a 68% decline. As noted last quarter, we had a number of delinquencies with the loan with past maturity but still current, which have since then resolved. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect the seasonal increase in delinquencies from these very low levels experienced in the fourth quarter but for growth to be moderate. As we discussed last quarter, consumer delinquency trends overall have continued to moderate. Three key drivers of those trends are the seasoning of loans made in 2005, significant underwriting improvements in home equity and auto portfolios and the runoff of mortgages due to our 95% salability strategy. These factors are having an increasing impact on the performance of the portfolio. Consumer delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due increased 4% sequentially to $528 million. Consumer loans over 90 days past due were $369 million, down $12 million, with Florida representing the largest decline for the second consecutive quarter. We expect delinquencies to be up modestly in the first quarter, with 30 to 89 relatively stable and over 90s, reflecting the growth in early-stage delinquencies in the fourth quarter.A couple of comments on provision expense and the allowance. Provision expense for the quarter was $776 million and exceeded net charge offs by $68 million, this increase to the allowance to $3.75 billion. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong, covering non-performing loans by 127% and fourth quarter annualized net charge off by 132%, and we feel we are well positioned here, absent unexpected development.Let me spend a moment on a couple of other topics. First, an update on the non-performing loans we've moved to held-for-sale status. Those balances were originally $473 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and they're down to $216 million at the end of 2009. In the fourth quarter, we also moved $9 million into held-for-sale from the portfolio. During the quarter, we received payments of $16 million and wrote down principal balances of retained loans by $13 million. We also sold, settled or closed $61 million these NPAs during the quarter and realized about $4 million of gains on those sales and transferred $3 million to OREO. Since we moved these loans, our realization of gains and write-downs largely offset and these values overall are consistent with our original mark. We currently carry the remaining loans in this pool at about $0.33 on the dollar of their original contractional balances. To sum up, we're encouraged by recent trends but we're also realistic about the environment. Unemployment is high and is expected to remain high. Home prices have stopped declining precipitously but has not turned around yet. And in some markets, they continue to be under significant pressure. Those forces suggest that consumer losses will remain elevated for some time. Additionally, while we've been very pleased with the results of our consumer loan modifications, not all of those modifications are going to be successful. And we'll see some NPAs and losses developed from those loans even as we see improvement in overall trends. But we've taken that into account in our outlook and believe these actions will reduce the losses the company ultimately experiences.On the commercial side, we've been through a part of the cycle where loss severity has been very high due to the nature and type of products involved, namely, commercial construction and residential development. Those areas dominated our NPA inflows and charge offs through 2008 and 2009. Our current inflows have been more reflective of typical cycle development, including C&I and commercial mortgage.There's been a lot of justified focus on commercial real estate at this stage of the cycle, so let me make a few comments on that front. Our commercial real estate loans are about $15.6 billion or 20% of the loan portfolio, which is a relatively low percentage compared with other regional banks. Of that $15.6 billion, $11.8 billion is in commercial mortgage and $3.8 billion is in commercial construction. Obviously, the construction portfolio has been under the most stress. And we've been very proactive managing this portion of the loan portfolio. We suspended homebuilder and developer loans back in 2007 and non-owner occupied real estate lending in early 2008. While we expect to see continued stress in the area, these credits were affected earlier in the cycle given the issues in residential real estate and shortfalls on adequate cash flow to bring projects to fruition.The current stage of the cycle is marked by a shift in NPA inflows toward income-producing properties backed by mortgages. Of our $11.8 billion commercial mortgage portfolio, about half of non-owner occupied that is income producing. The cash flow from these properties gives us a much greater ability to work these loans out. And as a result, we tend to experience lower loss severities in the loans that created most of the issues earlier in the cycle. But they do typically take time to work out. And so like consumer, we expect commercial charge-off to remain elevated in 2010. But we do expect to see significant improvement in loss experienced during the year versus what we saw during the past couple of quarters. The burden of provisioning on earnings and on capital generation has been pretty material over the past couple of years. In 2008 and 2009, we incurred provision expense of almost $3 billion in excess of charge-offs. The elimination of that additional burden should have a significant positive effect on results, even if charge-offs remain higher than we'd like. We experienced pain from this credit cycle earlier than others, given our geographies and given some product areas where we frankly made some loans we shouldn't have made. Brokered home equity and homebuilder lending were two areas that stand out. But there are others we've discussed over the past several years. Because of these factors, particularly the early cycles in Michigan and in Florida, we adjusted our underwriting earlier, we charged loans off earlier and we built reserves earlier and more significantly than many of our peers.We've tried to be aggressive in recognizing issues and getting them resolved and behind us. As a result, we don't believe we have an overhang or any catch-up to deal with. And we feel well positioned as we move into 2010. With that, I'll turn things over to Dan to discuss operating trends. Dan?"
270961,84102665,46556,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-21-2010",2010-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Mary. As Kevin noted, while this quarter still reflects a difficult environment, we did see significant progress, not only on the credit front, but in operating results as well. For the quarter, we reported a net loss of $98 million and paid prefe",2793,"Thanks, Mary. As Kevin noted, while this quarter still reflects a difficult environment, we did see significant progress, not only on the credit front, but in operating results as well. For the quarter, we reported a net loss of $98 million and paid preferred dividends of $62 million, which resulted in a loss of $160 million on available-to-common-shareholders basis.Last quarter, our net loss was $97 million or $159 million to common [ph]. Excluding the effects of Visa, on a core basis the net loss last quarter, was $303 million compared with this quarter's $98 million net loss.A $200 million after-tax improvement was driven by three factors. The first was a lower provision, which was down $176 million pretax, reflecting both lower charge-offs as well as a lower reserve build. The second was lower credit related cost in revenues and expenses, which was down $60 million pretax. And then the third was our favorable operating trends. As Kevin and Mary noted, we expect the first quarter charge-offs to come down again. And we don't expect much of a reserve build, if any, next quarter beyond the effect of FAS 166 and 167. So we're currently expecting earnings trends to improve, again, in the first quarter as we move closer to turning that bottom line positive. Some of the major themes for the quarter outside of credit were continued net interest margin expansion, lower credit-related costs and strong deposit growth. Net interest margin increased 12 basis points sequentially to 3.55%. As of previous quarters, the expansion was driven by maturities of high rate CDs put on the sheet in the fall of 2008. Net interest income was up $8 million or 1%, with the margin benefit of strong deposit growth, offset by asset growth headwinds that we've been experiencing recently.Average core deposits grew by 3% sequentially and 11% on a year-over-year basis, with strong growth in transaction accounts. Compared with last quarter, credit costs recognized through fee income and operating expense were down significantly, totaling $85 million this quarter compared with $145 million last quarter. That positive variance was driven by a lower provision for unfunded commitments, lower credit-related derivative losses and lower fair value adjustments on loans held for sale. I'll talk about the revenue and expense included [ph] on these charges in a moment.Going forward, we expect these costs to remain elevated but this quarter's number is closer to a run rate that should improve over time. Overall it's a pretty clean quarter, although there were two significant items that largely offset one another. We recorded a mark-to-market gain on warrants we hold from the FTPS transaction, which are valued based on a set of publicly traded proxies. That gain was $20 million and was recorded in other income. We also recorded a $22 million reserve for litigation risks associated with one of our bank card association memberships and that was recorded in other expense.With that context, let's go through the balance sheet in a bit more detail. Average earning assets were down about 2% compared with last quarter, and 4% on a year-over-year basis. This trend continues to be driven by soft commercial loan demand and the continued impact of our strategy of targeting the sale of about 95% of our mortgage production. Let me mention here the prospective effect on our balance sheet of FAS 166 and 167, which we implement on January 1, 2010. This was a fairly minor event for Fifth Third, but it will result in loans in the first quarter increasing by about $2.3 million and securities being reduced by about $900 million.The loans come from the consolidation of approximately $1.5 billion in consumer loan securitizations and from $800 million of commercial loan conduit assets, which will be added to loans. Offsetting that will be our previous investments of $800 million in the conduits commercial paper and a net of $100 million in other securities, which will go away. Thus, the net effect on earning assets overall will be about $1.4 billion.Now looking at the fourth quarter. Average loans held for investment were down 3% sequentially and 10% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to the $2.3 billion effect of FAS 166 and 167, we believe that C&I balances are reaching a bottom and will begin to see some organic growth soon. CRE loans on the other hand will likely continue to decline for at least several more quarters. For the year, we'd expect loan balances to begin to grow modestly, although it's a little early to say how much that growth may be over the course of the year.Now to give a little more detail by product types. In the fourth quarter, average commercial loans decreased 4% or $2.1 billion, with the majority of that decline reflecting lower line utilization as well as charge-offs. Line utilization was down $1 billion sequentially and was down $3.9 million from a year ago.This lower line utilization reflects customer caution. We still have those relationships, and as their confidence returns, this will represent some built-in loan growth as line usage returns. Average consumer loans were down 1% sequentially and 3% on a year-over-year basis. Auto loan balances increased 1% sequentially and 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. We're pleased to see growth continue here beyond the third quarter benefit from the Cash for Clunkers program. Auto loan demand remains solid and credit performance has been good. Going forward, loan balances will reflect the inclusion of about $1.2 billion in auto loans that will be consolidated on January 1, 2010. Credit card balances were up 1% on a sequential basis and 13% on a year-over-year basis. Residential mortgages were down 3% sequentially and 13% from a year ago, as we continue to sell most of our new production. Flow sales during the quarter were $4.2 billion. Home equity loans were down 1% sequentially and 3% on a year-over-year basis. We currently expect home equity loan balances to be relatively stable in 2010, which reflects relatively low demand but some stabilization in home prices in a number of our markets.Average securities increased by about $800 million during the quarter, with proceeds primarily invested agency mortgage-backed securities. We'll continue to evaluate securities investments in the context of loan growth, in the context of excess funding and of course, the overall interest rate environment.We remain very thoughtful about taking these positions, given our expectation for future rate increases, although the risk reward profile has improved recently. We supplemented our balance sheet hedges to reflect these purchases, and to maintain our overall relatively neutral interest rate risk position. Moving on to deposits. We saw a continued strong deposit growth momentum this quarter with a significant positive shift in mix toward lower-cost deposits. Average core deposit growth was 3% sequentially and 11% on a year-over-year basis. Transaction account showed the strongest growth with DDA balances up 6% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. We also had significant growth in interest checking deposits, which increased 10% sequentially and a 19% on a year-over-year basis. Looking forward to the first quarter, we expect core deposit growth to be fairly similar to the fourth. Given the low rate environment, customers continue to value liquidity and we expect that will continue in the near term. Retail core deposits were flat sequentially and increased 6% on a year-over-year basis. Our new higher value and bundled product offerings are attracting higher average balances.We've gotten good feedback from customers on these new product offerings. That offset, a decline in net new account production, which was driven by our no-longer offering the totally-free checking product. Total commercial core deposits were up 12% sequentially and 28% from a year ago. Commercial DDAs increased 10% from the third quarter and 46% from last year, while commercial interest checking increased 22% sequentially and 47% from last year. I would note that average public fund balances in interest checking increased by $1 billion on a sequential basis, and as tax refunds are issued, we would expect some of that growth to reverse. Otherwise, the growth has been driven by higher average balances, which reflects cautiousness and excess liquidity among our customers.As I noted earlier, our liquidity remains very strong. Wholesale funding levels were reduced again this quarter by $3.8 billion or 15%, and we've now paid down $17.5 billion of wholesale funding since a year ago. Let me give a quick update on FTPS, the de-conversion process continues and we've completed transitioning of a number of core HR functions over to the joint venture. Retained card and processing fee income was up modestly on a sequential basis coming in at $76 million for the quarter compared with $74 million last quarter. Card and processing expense of $27 million compares to $25 million last quarter, and includes about $10 million of retained expense as well as $17 million in charges from FTPS related to their providing of processing services to the bank.We also had a $39 million of revenue from the FTPS transition services agreement or TSA, which covers cost of a similar amount incurred by Fifth Third in providing services to the processing JV. Net revenue is recorded in other non-interest income. Last quarter, we had about $38 million of TSA-related revenue. We would expect approximate $12 million to $15 million of TSA revenue in the first quarter and between $45 million and $50 million for all of 2010. We would expect first quarter expenses to decline in the like fashion.Finally, we recognized equity method income of $8 million related to our 49% interest in the joint venture through the other income line. That compares with about $7 million last quarter and the $8 million did not include the warrant mark-to-market adjustment, which I talked about earlier.Moving on now to the income statement, starting with net interest income. Net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis increased $8 million sequentially to $882 million. That was driven primarily by deposit repricing and partially offset by lower loan balances. Net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 3.55%, a little better than we expected on wider deposit and in loan spreads. We currently expect margin to expand another five to 10 basis points in the first quarter, with solid growth in net interest income, perhaps in the $15 million range, including about $10 million effect from adding the assets that we talked abut earlier related to FAS 166 and 167. As we move further into the year, we'd expect earning asset growth driven by modest growth in loans and securities and a margin that is likely to be stable after the first quarter in the near term.Moving onto fees. Third quarter noninterest income was $651 million. Non-core items in noninterest income are outlined pretty thoroughly in the earnings release, I won't go through those in detail. But on a core basis, fee income increased $30 million or 5% from the third quarter and $73 million or 13% from the fourth quarter of 2008. Credit-related charges that roll through noninterest income fell on the quarter from $45 million last quarter to approximately $30 million this quarter.The strong year-over-year results come primarily from the increases in mortgage banking revenue. Corporate banking revenue of $98 million for the quarter was up $12 million from a seasonally soft third quarter or about 15%. Sequential growth was driven by institutional sales, interest rate derivatives revenue and business lending fees, and partially offset by declines in foreign exchange revenue.We expect solid results again in the first quarter, although they will likely be lower than the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Deposit service charges were down 3% from the third quarter and 2% from a year ago. Consumer deposit fees were down approximately $6 million on a sequential basis, which more than offset a $1 million increase in commercial deposit fees.We continue to position our checking account offerings for changes on the regulatory environment, which contributed to the lower consumer deposit fees this quarter, as well as to an anticipated similar decline in the first quarter. We'd expect some positive seasonality in the second quarter and additional account growth to offset these effects after the first quarter.We've been proactive in adjusting our offerings, and we believe we're well positioned in terms of regulatory developments and offering value to our customers. Investment advisory revenue increased 4% sequentially and declined 2% on a year-over-year basis. Recent market performance has benefited the trust asset management and brokerage groups, and we're expecting strong growth again in the first quarter.As mentioned earlier, mortgage origination volume remain robust during the quarter at about $4.4 billion. Net mortgage revenue of $132 million was down $8 million from last quarter.We continue to capture greater market share, and purchase originations increased to 36% of our volumes in the fourth quarter. Right now, we expect net mortgage banking revenue to decline about $20 million or so in the first quarter. Obviously, that could move significantly, but overall, we've been very pleased with the continued strength of this business.We currently expect fee income for the first quarter to be about $580 million, give or take. Relative to the fourth quarter, that would reflect three main drivers. First, the decline in TSA revenue, I outlined earlier, which is about $25 million. Second is the effect of the $20 million gain on warrants that was recorded in the third quarter. And third, we expect mortgage banking revenue to be down about $20 million. Beyond the first quarter, which is a seasonally low quarter, we expect fee growth to pick up on positive seasonality in the second quarter and growth across our fee businesses through the remainder of the year.Turning to expenses. Non-interest expense of $967 million was up 10% sequentially. However, fourth quarter results included the $22 million litigation reserve that I mentioned earlier, while third quarter results included a net $73 million reduction in expense due to Visa. Exclude these items, expenses were $945 million in the fourth quarter, down just slightly from core expenses of $949 million in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, total credit-related costs within operating expenses includes the provision for unfunded commitments or $55 million versus $100 million last quarter. This positive variance was partially offset by the effects of a $14 million tax related accrual and $8 million in growth and marketing expense.We currently expect non-interest expense in the first quarter to be consistent with that $945 million in the fourth quarter core expenses, and expect the $20 million increase in seasonal FICA and unemployment expense will be offset by the reduction in FTPS support expenses that I mentioned earlier, which is primarily personnel related. Let me stop for a moment and just do a quick reconciliation of pre-provision net revenue. Reported pretax pre-provision earnings were $562 million in the fourth quarter and that's consistent with the core number. Last quarter, core PPNR was about $530 million. We would anticipate PPNR to be down about $20 million to $30 million in the first quarter given the expectations for a reduction in mortgage banking revenue and the effect of the $20 million in seasonal benefits expense I mentioned just a minute ago. Offsetting those negative variances, we'd be pretty solid growth in net interest income. We currently expect PPNR results at subsequent quarters to rebound and exceed fourth quarter levels, driven by net interest income grows, growth in fee businesses and lower credit related operating expenses.Let me add to my comments on the implementation of FAS 166 and 167 this quarter. We will record a cumulative effective adjustment to retain earnings in the first quarter, which we currently estimate to be a charge of approximately $90 million. That will reflect the valuation marks and the net difference in the carrying value of assets recognized and derecognized as part of that adoption. That charge would include in addition to the loan loss reserve of approximately $10 million for loans that are being added to the balance sheet, as well as a portion of the reserve for unfunded commitments will also be reclassified as a reserve for loan losses to reflect the conduit assets that are being added to the loan portfolio.Now moving on to capital. Our quarter-end capital ratios remain strong. The TCE ratio excluding $240 million of unrealized securities gains was 6.5%. Tier one common equity was 7% and tier one capital was 13.3%. The effect of incorporating the net $1.4 billion of assets under the balance sheet and a charge to equity will reduce our TCE ratio by about 15 basis points. We already carry those assets in our risk-weighted asset calculations for regulatory purposes and thus the effect on tier one and total capital ratios will be less than five basis points. I think with that, I'll open it up for questions."

So I think our overall tax provision this quarter was really reflective of just working through those year end calculations. And it's kind of the final true up for the year. There was not any significant adjustment included in there. We did have some significant period items related to leasing litigation and bank-owned life insurance that were in the first quarter that impacted the overall effective rate for the year and contributed to a very low effective tax rate overall. I think as you look forward, the best way to look at our taxes is that we have about $100 million in tax credits that we would anticipate for 2010. And then our marginal tax rate on income that we earned is about 36%. So depending on the level of income, if you put that $100 million in tax credits with a provision of 36% of expected income, you'd come up with a tax rate. It won't be 36%, would likely be less than that given the impact of the credits. But exactly what that rate would end up being will be a function of what taxable income for the year ends up being."

And so as we look at the economic factors, as we look at the industry segments, we don't see any particular theme coming out from an industry standpoint, but there's a fairly broad base that we look at. So at this point in time, that would be some of the consideration that would give rise to our comments. The other thing that I would point out in terms of loss severities is there's really kind of a descending priority if you will, with respect to loss severities. Starting first in the commercial portfolio with the nature of the construction product and/or the homebuilder portfolio. Looking then in other elements of the non-owner occupied portfolio going from there to the owner occupied portfolio. And then finally going to the C&I portion of the portfolio. And because of the characteristics of the C&I portfolio, even as we may still see some additional trust there, the expectation would be that the loss severities in that portion of the portfolio would be far less than what we experienced earlier in the cycle."

Good morning and thanks for joining us. I’ll make some opening comments and then hand the call over to Mary and Dan for more detailed discussion of our credit and financial performance.
Overall results continue to show good progress in both credit trends and continued operating momentum. Credit results were significantly better in the first quarter, following improved results in the fourth quarter as well.
On a sequential basis, net charge-offs were $582 million, down $126 million from last quarter. NPAs were down $115 million and loans 90 days past due were down $131 million.
Commercial NPL inflows of $405 million fell roughly $200 million on a sequential basis. The consumer inflows of $137 million fell by $15 million, so good positive momentum in all three of the key credit metrics.
Our current expectation is for net charge-offs to be down again next quarter by another $100 million or so, with $15 million to $20 million of that coming from consumer and the rest in commercial.
Our outlook for the year, generally, is for stable to improving credit results although we may see particular credit metrics bounce around from quarter-to-quarter; let assume the economy continues to cooperate.
Our reserve position remained strong at 4.9% of loans and 139% of NPLs. Given the trajectory of delinquency and loss trends, we currently expect loan loss reserves to decline beginning in the second quarter.
Obviously, we'll have to evaluate reserves in the context of actual credits trends at the end of the quarter, the modeling of reserves is fairly complex as you know and the results of that exercise is not something that I can really predict as we stand here today.
We'd expect the need for reserves to decline over time, provided that loss content in the portfolio continues to improve and assuming economic conditions remain consistent with our current outlook.
Let me give you some high level operating results. Our pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue came in better than expected, rising $6 million on a sequential basis to $568 million. PPNR is up 11% on a reported basis from the first quarter a year ago. That growth was 15% excluding revenue and expenses. We deconsolidated in the processing transaction of $54 million pre-tax BOLI charge last year and securities gains and losses from both periods. That’s a strong result over a pretty challenging time period.
We currently expect second quarter PPNR to be consistent with the first quarter and Dan will talk more about the components of our operating expectations in his remarks.
The net interest margin increased 8 bps sequentially coming in at 3.63% and net interest income increased $19 million sequentially.
Fees of $627 million were down $24 million sequentially. That reflects typical seasonality as well as a number of moving parts, which Dan will outline. Underlying fee trends, however, remained favorable.
Average transaction deposits were up 9% on a sequential basis with about $700 million of growth in DDA balances and $3.2 billion of growth in interest checking. Our strong deposit growth and muted asset trends have created a lot of liquidity. Wholesale funding was down $1.9 million sequentially and $14.7 billion on a year-over-year basis.
Credit related cost recognized in revenue and expenses remained elevated. They totaled $92 million this quarter, compared with $103 million last quarter and $155 million in the third quarter of '09. We built our reserves for mortgage repurchases by about $25 million this quarter, which was offset by gains on loan sales.
Otherwise, credit costs were down modestly this quarter, and Dan will discuss those moving parts in more detail.
We continued to make progress on our customer satisfaction initiatives. Survey results put our satisfaction at the top of the industry. I think we are seeing tangible results from these improvements. We are now averaging more than four products per retail customer compared to less than three a couple of years ago.
We ranked first in the nation for the sixth straight month in mortgage refinance retention, that is, when our customers refinance their mortgage they did it with us. As we continue to implement new technology and processes, we are confident that we can continue our household penetration and profitability results even further.
This quarter’s results are starting to reflect in a significant way the actions we have taken over the past two years to improve our underwriting and management of credit and to identify and address problems. I believe, we will continue to see progress both on the credit front and from operating results.
The economy has improved from last year, although growth is not great and unemployment remains very high, housing prices have stabilized and there is more activity. Many borrowers have lost their equity and their homes and they continue to retrench.
We haven’t seen a pickup in commercial loan demand yet, but the rate of decline has slowed considerably. Line utilization seems to have stabilized for us this year consistent with fourth quarter levels at around 34%. If the economy maintains its progress, we would expect to begin to see growth soon. Consumer spending has started to pickup a bit and that’s a key element increasing business confidence.
That being said, there are number of items on the horizon that could have a meaningful impact on the industry. The upcoming financial reform bill in Congress, Basel III, and other regulatory changes all have the potential to impact industry pricing and profitability.
We support many of the proposals and support industry efforts to improve others. With that being said, we are going to focus on what we can control. Continued focus on credit quality, aggressive portfolio management and loss mitigation strategies, executing on our customer satisfaction initiatives and improving customer loyalty, enhancing the breadth and profitability of our offerings and relationships through holistic relationship management, and making Fifth Third an employer of choice in the industry by continuing to enhance the engagement of our employees.
I would like to thank Fifth Third employees for their focus and dedication, both on helping us address the issues presented over the past couple of years from a credit standpoint, but also in staying focused on blocking and tackling and continuing to generate strong operating results.
It hasn’t been easy and I'm proud of what you are doing for the company.
With that, let me turn it over to Mary to discuss credit results in more detail.

As Kevin discussed, overall credit trends were better than expected. I'll get started with charge-offs. Total net charge-offs of $582 million decreased $126 million sequentially, with commercial charge-offs accounting for all of the improvement.
First quarter results included $26 million in charge-offs we recorded in moving loans held for sale. While charge-offs remained elevated in Michigan and Florida, losses in Florida were significantly lower than in the fourth quarter and losses in Michigan continue to show signs of stabilization with charge-offs relatively flat versus both, fourth quarter and third quarter level.
Commercial net charge-offs were $342 million versus $468 million last quarter, down $126 million. The biggest driver of the decrease was Florida, down $93 million. Commercial charge-offs in Michigan were down $8 million, and rest of the footprint was down $25 million combined.
C&I net losses this quarter totaled $161 million, down $22 million with a sequential decline attributable to a broad base of industry segment. Michigan and Florida accounted for 44% of C&I losses during the quarter, while representing 22% of C&I loans. Florida losses were down, sequentially.
Commercial mortgage losses of $99 million decreased $43 million from the fourth quarter with Michigan and Florida contributing 53% of losses, although losses were lower in both states.
Commercial construction net charge-offs were $78 million, down $57 million from the fourth quarter with Michigan and Florida, both down but still generating 40% of losses.
Across the portfolio, homebuilder developer losses totaled $81 million, down $29 million from last quarter. You will recall that we suspended homebuilder originations over two years ago, have already recorded significant charge-offs against that portfolio and worked to reduce our [exposure].
Portfolio balances declined $239 million sequentially to $1.3 billion, which compared with a peak balance of $3.3 billion back in mid-2008. We expect losses from this portfolio to continue to decrease over time.
As Kevin noted earlier, we expect commercial net charge-offs to come down again in the second quarter. Our current outlook would be down about $75 million to $100 million with lower charge-offs in both C&I and commercial real estate.
Turning to the consumer portfolio, net charge-offs of $240 million were flat compared with the prior quarter and included the effect of about $5 million in charge-offs on loans consolidated under FAS 167.
Looking at individual product lines, net charge-offs on the residential mortgage portfolio were $88 million, an increase of $10 million from the fourth quarter. Florida accounted for 53% of losses from 28% of the total mortgage portfolio.
Home equity losses decreased $9 million sequentially to $73 million, including $29 million of losses in the brokered portfolio. The net charge-off rate on brokered home equity was about 6% annualized, which is almost four times the loss rate on our branch originated books.
The brokered equity portfolio is $1.9 billion, down from about $3.5 billion, a couple of years ago and it continues to run off.
Auto and credit card net charge-offs were both relatively flat compared with the third and fourth quarter of 2009. Auto charge-offs included $4 million in charge-offs from loans consolidated under FAS 167.
Looking forward, we effect credit card charge-offs to continue to trend with the unemployment rate and we would expect auto charge-offs to begin to decline modestly, reflecting improved underwriting and better values received at auction.
We expect second quarter consumer charge-offs to be down about $15 million to $20 million, give or take. Beyond that, current migration trends and expectation would suggest that consumer losses should remain pretty stable over the remainder of 2010.
Delinquency trends remain favorable in each of the four main consumer loan categories; this I will discuss later.
Now, moving on to NPAs, NPAs, including held-for-sale, totaled $3.4 billion at quarter end, down about $100 million, or 3% from the fourth quarter. 
Excluding $243 million of NPAs in our held-for-sale portfolio, where the loans have already been fully marked, portfolio NPAs totaled $3.1 billion. Portfolio non-performing loans were down over $200 million sequentially, a 7% decline, while OREO was up about $100 million largely commercial OREO.
That was a really positive move for non-performing loans and as you would expect we are seeing some continued growth in OREO, which represents the combination of treatment strategies on problem loans, with those typically having moved into non-performing status in the year ago timeframe.
I would note that only 10% of our OREO has been carried as OREO for more than 12 months.
Overall, Florida and Michigan remained the most challenged geographies from an NPA standpoint and accounted for 45% of NPAs in the portfolio.
Portfolio commercial NPAs declined by $126 million or 5% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than we originally expected.
Commercial construction was the biggest driver with NPAs down $138 million, or 20%. Florida and Michigan accounted for almost half of the decline.
Commercial mortgage NPAs were up $17 million. Increases in Florida and Michigan more than offset improvement in most other geographic areas.
C&I NPAs were up $7 million from the fourth quarter with an $18 million increase in Florida, more than offsetting generally positive variances across the rest of the footprint.
Across the portfolios, residential builder and developer NPAs of $520 million were down $28 million sequentially and represented 21% of total commercial NPAs.
Within NPAs, commercial TDRs on non-accrual status decreased to $39 million from $47 million last quarter.
We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans where it makes good economic sense for the bank. We currently anticipate commercial NPAs to remain relatively stable in the second quarter.
The significant decline in 90-day past due credits, which I'll talk about in a moment, is a good development in that regard. Liquidity has improved from moving distressed assets and we may choose to utilize that avenue more frequently, if terms become more favorable. 
In terms of our commercial held-for-sale portfolio, total held-for-sale NPAs of $243 million were carried at $0.32 on the $1 at the end of the quarter. Of the $473 million we originally transferred in the fourth quarter of 2008, $169 million remained, is carried at $0.30 on the $1.
During the quarter, we transferred $80 million of additional loans in held-for-sale. The majority of which were either sold or under a contract or letter of intent to be sold. Those loans sold or under a contract for sale were sold or marked at $0.51 on the dollar, relative to their original balance.
On the consumer side, NPAs totaled $715 million at the end of the quarter, a $10 million or 1% sequential increase from the fourth quarter. Non-accrual consumer TDRs accounted for $13 million of the increase, with the remainder of the consumer NPA portfolio declining $3 million.
Residential mortgage NPAs decreased $2 million during the quarter to $521 million, with TDRs up $5 million sequentially and the remainder of the portfolio down $7 million.
Home equity NPAs totaled $70 million at the end of the first quarter, down $1 million from fourth quarter levels. Auto NPAs were down $1 million and credit card NPAs were up $40 million with the increase attributable to TDRs.
Looking forward for consumer NPAs, we expect second quarter growth to be modest and generally consistent with first quarter trends. Consumer NPA trends will continue to reflect the seasoning of more recent TDRs, as well as the favorable delinquency and migration trends we have been seeing.
In terms of overall consumer TDRs, we have $1.8 billion of TDRs on the book of which $1.5 billion are accruing loans and $271 million were non-accrual at March 31st.
About a quarter of the loans we have restructured to date have re-defaulted. On a [lags] basis, re-default rates are just under 30% on modified loans, which is a bit better than industry data. We have updated our vintage default rate so that you can see the tendency towards default by vintage.
More recent vintages have shown lower re-default rates than loans we restructured earlier in the cycle and also constitute a larger proportion of the aggregate TDR pool.
I would like to spend a couple of additional minutes discussing a few nuances of the TDR process that are probably worth mentioning. If a loan has an interest rate concession made on it relative to market rate, it usually will remain in the accruing TDR bucket until it matures. As a result, TDRs will increase for us and for the industry as long as we continue these types of modification.
What is important to note is that of the $1.5 billion of accruing TDRs we had at the end of the quarter, $1.3 billion are current and of those over $900 million are current annual restructured more than six months ago.
In the case of that $900 million, the vast majority will stay current but many will remain TDRs indefinitely because we have made an interest rate concession and therefore they can’t be removed from the TDR category.
We have provided some aging data in our credit presentation that indicates the age of our TDRs and what proposition is current or delinquent after varying lengths of time.
For most of these loans, we took our losses upfront when we modified them and from that time on, they will perform just fine.
Overall, we continue to be pleased with results of our loss mitigation efforts and I think the information we have provided demonstrates that they are working and improving. Hopefully, this data provides you with the information you need to do your own evaluation of how to view these credits.
Let me stop for a minute and point you to the role forward of our non-performing loans that was added to our credit trends presentation that was included in the materials we released this morning. I would point to a couple of trends worth mentioning. 
The first is that our commercial non-performing loan inflows were the lowest we've seen in quite sometime at $405 million, which compares with $602 million last quarter in a quarterly range of about $550 to $830 million in 2009.
On the consumer side, inflows totaled $137 million, which was down $15 million on a sequential basis and the lowest since the second quarter of 2009. Total inflows were $542 million, down from $754 million last quarter and the lowest we've seen since 2008.
To wrap up the NPA discussion, we've been proactive in addressing problem loans and writing them down to realistic and realizable values. Total NPAs, commercial and consumer, are being carried at approximately 59% of their original face value through the process of taking charge-offs marked in specific reserves recorded through the first quarter.
We believe that's appropriate and I think our recent charge-off trends continue to be indicative of lower severities on new NPAs and reasonable carrying values overall.
Moving to delinquency trends. Commercial loans 90 days past due were $120 million and dropped 40% or $78 million from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans 30 to 89 days past due were $401 million, and increased by $34 million from the low levels experienced in the fourth quarter.
As we discussed last quarter, consumer delinquency trends overall have continued to moderate. Three key drivers of those trends are the seasoning of loans made in 2005, significant underwriting improvements in home equity and auto portfolios, and the run off of mortgages due our 95% salability strategy. These factors are having an increasing impact on the performance of the portfolio.
Consumer loans over 90 days past due were $316 million, down $53 million with Florida representing the largest decline for the fourth consecutive quarter. Consumer delinquencies, 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2% sequentially to $516 million.
Total delinquencies this quarter were down 15% from last quarter and were at the lowest levels since mid-2007. We believe we are seeing signs of stabilization and don’t currently expect significant movement next quarter, although delinquencies can move around a bit given seasonality and timing issues.
A couple of comments on provision in the allowance. Provision expense for the quarter was $590 million and exceeded net charge-offs by $8 million. The allowance was also increased by $45 million as a result of the consolidation of off-balance sheet assets.
Our allowance coverage ratios remained strong, covering non-performing loans by 139% and first quarter annualized net charge-offs by 161%.
One last item before I turn it over to Dan. We have updated our stress test model to give effect to actual results in recent trends as well as changes to forecast for the macro-economy. Those macro forecasts are derived from moodyseconomy.com base case and recession case scenarios. We have provided the results of those models and macro assumptions once again in the credit trends presentation.
You will note that the results are better than those we have provided in January reflecting several factors. There has been some improvement in the macro-economic assumptions. Also, first quarter results were generally better than expected in January and the adjusting for the effect of the improvement we have seen in result roll rates et cetera is reflected in remainder of the year expectation.
As you will see under the updated base case scenario, losses would be expected to remain significantly below our 2009 losses. In both, the new base case and recession case remains much better than the SCAP adverse scenario results and the recession case is actually more consistent with our baseline SCAP submission.
With that, I will turn things over to Dan to discuss operating trends. Dan?

As Kevin and Mary have discussed, we are seeing a lot of positive momentum in both our credit trends and our operating trends.

As Kevin and Mary have discussed, we are seeing a lot of positive momentum in both our credit trends and our operating trends. For the quarter, we reported a net loss of $10 million and paid preferred dividends of $62 million, which resulted in a loss of $72 million on an available per common share basis.
Last quarter, our net loss was $98 million or $160 million (inaudible). The biggest driver for the improvement was clearly lower provision expense, which was down a $186 million on a pre-tax basis.
However, there were several other major themes for the quarter. The first was improved net interest income and net interest margin. NII increased by $19 million sequentially and NIM grew 8 basis points to 3.63%.
The second one is the decline in fee income, although less than expected, which was down $24 million. There were a number of items in both fourth quarter and first quarter results that affected that and I will talk about those later.
Underlying fee trends remained consistent with our expectations and are favorable, although Reg E will create a bit of headwind for fees in a couple of quarters.
The third was continued deposit growth. Average core deposits grew by 6% sequentially and 14% on year-over-year basis with strong growth in transaction accounts. Wholesale funding fell by another $2 billion sequentially and $15 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our liquidity position remains very strong. Core deposits continue to fund a 100% of our loan portfolio.
And last was lower non-provisioning credit costs. Compared with last quarter, credit costs recognized through fee income and operating expenses were down $11 million and totaled $92 million. Gains on loan sales offset increased mortgage repurchase expense, and we experienced improvement in OREO expense, losses on OREO sales and workout and collection costs.
With that context, let's go through the balance sheet in more detail. Average earning assets were up about 2% compared with last quarter, but were down 3% on a year-over-year basis. This trend continues to be driven by weak loan demand, particularly on the commercial side.
During the quarter, we adopted FAS 167, which increased earning assets by $1.3 billion on a net basis. In terms of the balance sheet geography of that, this reduced available-for-sale securities by $1 billion, while on the loan side it increased C&I loans by about $700 million, auto loans by $1.2 billion and home equity loans by $300 million.
Loan balances were down slightly net of the impact of FAS 167, although we've seen a notable deceleration in the rate of decline, and we currently expect that to turn positive as 2010 progresses.
As Kevin noted, commercial line utilization remained consistent with the fourth quarter after four quarters of consecutive declines. Right now, we'd expect loan balances to be relatively stable in the second quarter, but to see some modest growth in the second half of the year as business, investment and working capital needs begin to reflect economic trends.
Average commercial loans were flat compared to the fourth quarter with the effect of charge-offs and weak loan demand offsetting the impact of FAS 167. Average consumer loans increased 3%, sequentially, although they were down 1% compared with the year-ago.
Auto loan balances increased 14% from last quarter and 17% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of consolidation, balances were up about $100 million sequentially. Credit card balances were down 2% on a sequential basis and up 6% year-over-year.
Home equity loans were flat sequentially and down 3% on a year-over-year basis. And residential mortgages were down 7% from the fourth quarter and 13% from a year ago as we continue to sell most of our new production. Flow sales during the quarter were $3.3 billion.
Average securities increased by $1.7 billion during the quarter, driven by excess liquidity.
Short-term investments, primarily held with the Fed increased in average of $2 billion. The remaining $300 million decrease in securities reflected the consolidation of our off-balance sheet conduits and the reduction in variable rate demand notes, which combined to reduce securities by about $1 billion. That more than offset the full quarter effect of mortgage-backed securities that were purchased in the fourth quarter.
Now moving on to deposits. We saw continued strong deposit momentum this quarter, with a continued positive mix shift toward lower cost deposits. Average core deposit growth was 6% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Transaction account balance growth remained strong.
DDA balances were up 4% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, while interest checking deposits increased 20% from last quarter and 37% on a year-over-year basis.
Retail core deposits increased 1% sequentially and increased 3% year-over-year. Our net new account production was double the level we have seen in the first quarter of 2009 and was driven by our new relationship savings product that provides greater value based on the depth of relationship a customer has with Fifth Third.
We also saw 3% sequential growth in average retail deposit account balances, which is atypical for the first quarter and it was driven by the migration of our deposit book from products like free checking and a more relationship oriented products as well as higher consumer savings levels overall nationally.
Total commercial core deposits were up 20% sequentially and 46% from a year ago. Growth has been driven primarily by higher average balances, which reflects cautiousness and excess liquidity among our customers.
Commercial DDAs increased 8% from the fourth quarter and 46% year-over-year, while commercial interest checking increased 39% sequentially and 89% from last year. As we noted last quarter, public fund balances have driven a significant amount of recent growth.
We expect core deposits in the second quarter to be consistent with the first quarter as additional growth is offset by the effect of federal tax payments and lower public funds balances after-tax season.
Let me make a few comments on FTPS. As of the beginning of the year, the majority of FTPS employees were officially transitioned to the joint venture and off of our payroll. After our reduction in transition services agreement or TSA revenue as expected from $39 million last quarter to $13 million this year and that’s recorded in other non-interest income in the income statement.
That revenue covered cost of a similar amount that we incurred each quarter to provide those services to the process in JV. That $13 million number is probably a good quarterly run rate for the rest of 2010.
Finally, we recognized equity method income of $5 million related to our 49% interest in the joint venture through the other income line item, which compared, was about $8 million last quarter.
Now, moving on to the income statement, starting with net interest income. NII on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $19 million, sequentially to $901 million. We continued to see the benefit of a shift toward lower cost deposits as well as wider loan spreads.
The total cost of interest bearing liability spend fell 10 basis points sequentially, while average loan and leas yields expanded 10 basis points. The adoption of FAS 167 also contributed about 10 million to net interest income as we expected.
Net interest margin increased 8 basis points to 3.63%, driven by the factors I just outlined. With the consolidation of assets having no real meaningful impact on NIM.
Second quarter NII and NIM will be negatively affected by premium amortization on delinquent mortgage securities repurchased by Fannie Mae. That one-time negative impact to the second quarter is about $10 million to NII and 4 basis points to NIM.
Despite that, we currently expect second quarter NII and NIM to be consistent with the first quarter or perhaps up modestly. We currently expect NII and NIM trends to remain favorable in the second half of the year.
Moving onto fees. First quarter non-interest income was $627 million, down $24 million from last quarter, but significantly better than we expected. Results reflected three items that I want to comment on.
First, as I noted, TSA revenue was $30 million versus $39 million last quarter, due to the year end transfer of employees to the JV. Second, we had a $2 million negative valuation adjustment on our warrants in FTPS and that compares with the $20 million gain on that same item last quarter, and third, we had a $9 million negative valuation adjustment on the total returned swap related to estimated VISA litigation expense, and that swap was part of the sale of our VISA shares last summer.
Those items add up to a negative swing of $57 million between quarters. Excluding those factors, fee income was up $33 million or 6%, with negative effects of seasonality more than offset by higher mortgage banking revenue and lower credit-related cost realized in non-interest income.
Corporate banking revenue of $81 million was down $8 million from the fourth quarter or 8%, sequentially, as we expected. Results in this line are correlated with commercial loan origination volume, which has been weak. We expect modest growth in the second quarter in this area.
Deposit service charges were down 11% from the fourth quarter and 3% from a year ago. Commercial deposit fees were down $4 million and consumer deposit fees were down $13 million on a sequential basis. About half of the decline in consumer fees was related to seasonality with the remainder due to lower overdraft activity.
Last quarter, we stopped charging for overdrafts under $5 and this is the first full quarter of the impact from that change. We would expect normal, positive seasonality as well as additional account growth to drive an increase in consumer service charges in the second quarter, perhaps $10 million to $15 million or so.
One other thing on the horizon for the industry is the upcoming change to overdraft charges or Reg E. It's difficult to estimate the effect of this change, given that they depend on future customer choices and behavior, but let me take a stab at it.
We currently estimate the impact of Reg E to be about $20 million per quarter, with about $10 million to $15 million of that being realized in the third quarter and then the full rate of $20 million impact in the fourth quarter.
We've been proactive in developing deposit products that generate alternative revenue streams through voluntary customer adoption, which we think is preferable to both us and to our customers. We’ve had a lot of success in fee-based bundled products like our secured checking and reward checking products.
We also believe that a number of our customers will elect to setup overdraft protection by linking their checking account to savings account, credit card or home equity line. We've seen this on the horizon for a while, we were one of the first banks to stop offering a totally free checking account, and we have absorbed some of the impact of that already and we work continually to proactively develop new value-added products to help mitigate the impact of these developments.
Investment advisory revenue increased 5%, sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Recent market performance has benefited the trust, asset management and brokerage groups. The first quarter also benefit seasonally from trust tax preparation fees and as we expect this line item to be relatively flat in the second quarter.
Card and processing fee income was down modestly on a sequential basis coming, in at $73 million for the quarter, which compares to $76 million last quarter. That was a good result given the seasonality we experienced in the first quarter of every year.
Net mortgage revenue of $152 million was up $20 million from last quarter that included the benefit of gains on MSR hedges of $51 million. Right now, we expect net mortgage banking revenue to decline by $25 million or so in the second quarter, and this is probably the fourth or fifth straight quarter we have predicted lower mortgage banking revenue, but I have decided that I’m going to keep saying it until I’m right, so that’s our guidance again this quarter.
Credit-related costs recorded in fee income were just $1 million for the first quarter, down from $30 million last quarter. The biggest driver of the improvement was $25 million in gains on loan sales.
Next quarter, we'd expect to see those costs closer to $25 million, which is primarily the ongoing effect of losses on OREO sales. As a result, we expect the line item, other non-interest income to be about $25 million lower in the second quarter than the first. This line can move around some, but that's our current expectation.
We currently expect fee income in the second quarter to be about $600 million, give or take. We expect a sequential decline to be driven primarily by lower mortgage banking revenue and higher credit cost realized in fee income, but that should be partially offset by a generally stronger quarter from a seasonality perspective.
Turning to expenses. Non-interest expense of $956 million was down $11 million or 1%, sequentially. On the positive side, TSA expenses were down $26 million and litigation expenses were down $18 million.
On the negative side, FICA and unemployment benefits expense was up $16 million seasonally and credit-related expenses were up $18 million. Net of those items, non-interest expenses were flat.
In the first quarter, credit-related costs within operating expenses were $91 million compared with $73 million last quarter. The increase was driven by higher expenses related to mortgage repurchases, $39 million in this quarter compared with $18 million last quarter.
I would note that the majority of that expense was related to a repurchase reserve build. Actual realized repurchase losses were consistent at $13 million this quarter versus $14 million last quarter.
We would expect the repurchase expense to be about half of that $39 million level next quarter, maybe something in the $20 million range and for total credit-related cost recognized in expense to be down $20 million to $25 million as a consequence. Along with the industry, we have seen an increase in mortgage repurchase requests in the past couple of quarters.
[File] request trends seem to be stabilizing and while we currently expect demands for repurchases to remain at an elevated level, that [file] request activity trend suggests that demands and realized losses in the near term should be generally consistent with first quarter levels. Total repurchase reserves are about $80 million, against losses realized in the first quarter of $13 million, so we think we are in pretty good shape here.
In terms of overall expense expectations for the second quarter, we expect non-interest expense to be down $10 million to $15 million driven by lower benefits expense and lower credit related costs, partially offset by the ongoing effect of investments in strategic initiatives.
Let me stop for a moment and just do a quick recap of PPNR. Reported pre-tax pre-provision earnings were $568 million in the first quarter. Our current expectation is that second quarter PPNR will be consistent with the first quarter with mortgage banking revenue down about $25 million but without that being offset by growth in NII and other fee income lines as well as lower expenses.
Let me spend just a minute on taxes. At our current level of earnings, which are very close to zero, it could be difficult to estimate the expected tax rate. Given the effect of our tax credits, which we estimate to be about $125 million a year, we expect our full year tax rate to be below 10% and the second quarter should be in that ballpark as well. The first quarter tax rate was 53%, but that rate is not very meaningful given the level of our earnings are so close to breakeven.
Now, moving on to capital. Our quarter end capital ratio has remained strong. The TCE ratio was 6.4%, excluding $288 million of unrealized securities gains on an after-tax basis. Tier 1 common equity was 7%, and Tier 1 capital was 13.4%.
I note that the implementation of FAS 167 led to a $77 million charge to equity this quarter. We currently anticipate that these capital ratios would be stable to modestly higher in the second quarter depending on asset growth.
I think with that, we'll open it up for questions.

Whereas the allowance is driven by generally accepted account principles, which is more based on the situation as it exist today without necessarily guessing or predicting what the future will hold, so while I would share your views with respect to what the trends look like going forward, that doesn't necessarily fully make it into the allowance methodologies that we are required to have under generally accepted accounting principles.
Those methodologies are generally more backward looking, they are based on historical results, tempered somewhat perhaps by recent trends, but we're not permitted under generally accepted accounting principles to bake into our allowance forecast, a lot of expectations about what future developments might be in the economy or for our customers and portfolio.
So as Kevin mentioned in his comments, we do anticipate that reserve levels will tend to come down and that that would likely begin in the second quarter but at this point its difficult to put a dollar range on that.
That will depend upon our execution of those methodologies based on what trends actually materializes in the second quarter.

Our overall approach continues to be the same, though. We do look for opportunities to restructure when it makes good economic sense for us and that's typically driven by cash flow trends that we think are strong enough in the long term to drive that kind of an economic decision for the bank and also for the borrower.
With respect to our restructuring trends on the consumer portfolio, although we have been an active restructurer, if you will, of loans over the last couple of years, we do continue to look at our overall strategy in light of where we are at in the credit cycle today, versus where we were a couple of years ago and we continue to look at a variety of options to again determine what today makes the best economic sense for the bank as well as for the borrower.
That would include things like the borrower situation as it relates to a long-term situation as opposed to a short-term situation, where perhaps we have got some additional stress in their life style. We will look at the possibility for extensions to terms. We will look possibility for interest rate concession and in general as we have noted in our credit presentation, we have also seen that our restructuring for the latter vintages has had a higher performance rate at this point in time. So, we will take all of those factors in to account as we continue to evaluate our strategy.

I think if you look at this quarter's results for instance and take a normalized provision level and then just reduce our credit-related expenses, which were about some $90 million in this quarter. If you reduce that by half, you get the numbers that are north of 1% even before considering any other impacts of the cycle continuing to run and the impact of that has on asset generation and the impact that that has on margin or the impact that has on fee income growth, so we're pretty comfortable with that range.
Obviously, in the long run, normalized ROA is going to be dependent up on a lot of factors that are difficult for any of us to predict right now relative to regulation and kind of what the normalized environment looks like as we come out of the cycle, but that's our best estimate at this particular point in time.

Clearly on the GAAP basis, we at least have a set of rules, although they are subject to interpretation and there is a lot of judgment involved in it, at least there is a broad set of guidelines that we have to follow.
Regulatory expectations tend to flush away somewhat and are more responsive to general economic conditions and what they are trying to accomplish from a safety and soundless perspective.
Obviously, regulatory expectations would probably be generally higher going forward at least in the short run than they have been historically, and that’s one element that will have to deal with as we move into the future and perhaps there is a divergence of pressures like we saw at the end of the last cycle where the banking regulators had one view and the SEC and the accountants had another view.
That will be a tension that may well develop again and we will just have to see how that tension is resolved in terms of whether any new guidance comes out, either from the regulatory side or from the accounting side that guides us in terms of what our reserves will need to be, as we go forward.

I'm joined on the call by several people: Kevin Kabat, our Chairman, President and CEO; Chief Financial Officer, Dan Poston; Chief Risk Officer, Mary Tuuk; Treasurer, Mahesh Sankaran; and Jim Eglseder of Investor Relations. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and announce your firm to the operator. With that I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?"

I'll make some opening comments and then hand the call over to Mary and Dan for a more detailed discussion of our credit and financial performance. Overall results continue to show good progress, in b",1060,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. I'll make some opening comments and then hand the call over to Mary and Dan for a more detailed discussion of our credit and financial performance. Overall results continue to show good progress, in both credit trends and continued operating momentum. Credit results were significantly better in the first quarter following improved results in the fourth quarter as well. 
On a sequential basis, net charge-offs were $582 million, down $126 million from last quarter. NPAs were down $115 million and loans 90 days past due were down $131 million. Commercial NPL inflows of $405 million fell roughly $200 million on a sequential basis, and consumer inflows of $137 million fell by $15 million, so good positive momentum in all three of the key credit metrics. 
Our current expectation is for net charge-offs to be down again next quarter by another $100 million or so, with $15 million to $20 million of that coming from consumer and the rest in commercial. Our outlook for the year, generally, is for stable-to-improving credit results, although, we may see particular credit metrics bounce around from quarter-to-quarter, that assumes the economy continues to cooperate. 
Our reserve position remains strong at 4.9% of loans and 139% of NPLs. Given the trajectory of delinquency and loss trends, we currently expect loan loss reserves to decline beginning in the second quarter. Obviously, we'll have to evaluate reserves in the context of actual credit trends at the end of the quarter. The modeling of reserves is fairly complex as you know, and the results of that exercise is not something I can really predict as we stand here today. We'd expect the need for reserves to decline over time, provided that loss content in the portfolio continues to improve and assuming economic conditions remain consistent with our current outlook. 
Let me give you some high level operating results. Our pretax, pre-provision net revenue came in better than expected, rising $6 million on a sequential basis to $568 million. PPNR is up 11% on a reported basis from the first quarter a year ago. That growth was 15% excluding revenue and expenses. We deconsolidated in the processing transaction of 54 million pretax BOLI charge last year and securities gains and losses from both periods. That's a strong result over a pretty challenging time period. We currently expect second quarter PPNR to be consistent with the first quarter, and Dan will talk more about the components of our operating expectations in his remarks. 
The net interest margin increased eight bps sequentially, coming in at 363 and net interest income increased 19 million sequentially. Fees of $627 million were down $24 million sequentially. That reflects typical seasonality, as well as a number of moving parts, which Dan will outline. Underlying fee trends however, remain favorable. Average transaction deposits were up 9% on a sequential basis, with about $700 million of growth in DDA balances and $3.2 billion of growth in interest checking. Our strong deposit growth and muted asset trends have created a lot of liquidity. Wholesale funding was down $1.9 million sequentially and $14.7 billion on a year-over-year basis. 
Credit-related costs recognized in revenue and expenses remain elevated. They totaled $92 million this quarter, compared with $103 million last quarter and $155 million in the third quarter of '09. We built our reserves for mortgage repurchases by about $25 million this quarter, which was offset by gains on loan sales. Otherwise, credit costs were down modestly this quarter, and Dan will discuss those moving parts in more detail. 
We continue to make progress on our customer satisfaction initiatives. Survey results put our satisfaction at the top of the industry. I think we're seeing tangible results from these improvements. We're now averaging more than four products per retail customer compared with less than three a couple of years ago. We ranked first in the nation for the sixth straight month in mortgage refinance retention. That is, when our customers refinance their mortgage, they did it with us. As we continue to implement new technology and processes, we're confident that we can continue our household penetration and profitability results even further. 
This quarter's results are starting to reflect, in a significant way, the actions we've taken over the past two years to improve our underwriting and management of credit and to identify and address problems. I believe we'll continue to see progress, both on the credit front and from operating results. The economy has improved from last year, although growth is not great and unemployment remains very high, housing prices have stabilized and there's more activity. Many borrowers have lost their equity and their homes and they continue to retrench. We haven't seen a pick-up in commercial loan demand yet, but the rate of decline has slowed considerably. Line utilization seems to have stabilized for us this quarter consistent with fourth quarter levels at around 34%. If the economy maintains its progress, we would expect to begin to see growth soon. Consumer spending has started to pick up a bit, and that's a key element in increasing business confidence. 
That being said, there are a number of items on the horizon that could have a meaningful impact on the industry. The upcoming financial reform bill in Congress, Basel 3 and other regulatory changes, all have the potential to impact industry pricing and profitability. We support many of the proposals and support industry efforts to improve others. That being said, we're going to focus on what we can control; continued focus on credit quality, aggressive portfolio management and loss mitigation strategies, executing on our customer satisfaction initiatives and improving customer loyalty, enhancing the breadth and profitability of our offerings and relationships through holistic relationship management and making Fifth Third an employer of choice in the industry by continuing to enhance the engagement of our employees. 
And on that, I'd like to thank Fifth Third employees for their focus and dedication, both in helping us address the issues presented over the past couple of years from a credit standpoint, but also in staying focused on blocking and tackling, and continuing to generate strong operating results. It hasn't been easy, and I'm proud of what you're doing for the company. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mary to discuss credit results in more detail. Mary?"

As Kevin discussed, overall credit trends were better than expected. I'll get started with charge-offs. Total net charge-offs of $582 million decreased $126 million sequentially with commercial charge-offs accounting for all of the improvement. First quarter results included $26 million in charge-offs we recorded in moving loans to held-for-sale. While charge-offs remain elevated in Michigan and Florida, losses in Florida were significantly lower than in the fourth quarter, and losses in Michigan continue to show signs of stabilization with charge-offs relatively flat versus the fourth quarter and third quarter levels. 
Commercial net charge-offs were $342 million versus $468 million last quarter, down $126 million. The biggest driver of the decrease was Florida, down $93 million. Commercial charge-offs in Michigan were down $8 million, and the rest of the footprint was down $25 million combined. 
C&I net losses this quarter totaled $161 million, down $22 million with a sequential decline attributable to a broad-base of industry segments. Michigan and Florida accounted for 44% of C&I losses during the quarter, while representing 22% of C&I loans. Florida losses were down sequentially. 
Commercial mortgage losses of $99 million decreased to $43 million from the fourth quarter, with Michigan and Florida contributing 53% of losses, although losses were lower in both states. 
Commercial construction net charge-offs were $78 million, down $57 million from the fourth quarter, with Michigan and Florida both down, but still generating 40% of losses. Across the portfolio, homebuilder/developer losses totaled $81 million, down $29 million from last quarter. You'll recall that we suspended homebuilder originations over two years ago, have already recorded significant charge-offs against that portfolio and worked to reduce our exposure. 
Portfolio balances declined to $239 million sequentially to $1.3 billion, which compares with a peak balance of $3.3 billion back in mid-2008. We expect losses from this portfolio to continue to decrease over time. 
As Kevin noted earlier, we expect commercial net charge-offs to come down again in the second quarter. Our current outlook would be down about $75 million to $100 million, with lower charge-offs in both C&I and commercial real estate. 
Turning to the consumer portfolio, net charge-offs of $240 million were flat compared with the prior quarter and included the effect of about $5 million in charge-offs on loans consolidated under FAS 167. 
Looking at individual product lines. Net charge-offs on the residential mortgage portfolio were $88 million, an increase of $10 million from the fourth quarter. Florida accounted for 53% of losses from 28% of the total mortgage portfolio. Home equity losses decreased $9 million sequentially, to $73 million, including $29 million of losses in the brokerage portfolio. The net charge-off rate on brokered home equity was about 6% annualized which is almost four times the loss rate on our branch-originated book. The brokered equity portfolio is $1.9 billion, down from about $3.5 billion a couple of years ago, and it continued to run off. 
Auto and credit card net charge-offs were both relatively flat, compared with the third and fourth quarter of 2009. Auto charge-offs included $4 million in charge-offs from loans consolidated under FAS 167. Looking forward, we expect credit card charge-offs to continue to trend with the unemployment rate, and we'd expect auto charge-offs to begin to decline modestly, reflecting improved underwriting and better value through seeded [ph] auctions. We expect second quarter consumer charge-offs to be down about $15 million to $20 million, give or take. Beyond that, current migration trends and expectations would suggest that consumer losses should remain pretty stable over the remainder of 2010. Delinquency trends remain favorable in each of the four main consumer loan categories, as I'll discuss later. 
Now moving on to NPAs. NPAs, including held-for-sale totaled $3.4 billion at quarter end, down about $100 million or 3% from the fourth quarter. Excluding $243 million of NPAs in our held-for-sale portfolio, where the loans have already been fully marked, portfolio NPAs totaled $3.1 billion. Portfolio nonperforming loans were down over $200 million sequentially, a 7% decline, while OREO was up about $100 million, largely commercial OREO. That was a really positive move for nonperforming loans. And as you'd expect, we're seeing some continued growth in OREO, which represents the culmination of treatment strategies on problem loans, with those typically having moved into nonperforming status in the year-ago timeframe. I would note that only 10% of our OREO has been carried as OREO for more than 12 months. 
Overall, Florida and Michigan remain the most challenged geographies from an NPA standpoint and accounted for 45% of NPAs in the portfolio. Portfolio commercial NPAs declined by $126 million or 5% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than we originally expected. 
Commercial construction was the biggest driver with NPAs down $198 million or 20%. Florida and Michigan accounted for almost half of the decline. Commercial mortgage NPAs were up $17 million, increases in Florida and Michigan more than offset improvement in most other geographic areas. 
 
C&I NPAs were up $7 million from the fourth quarter with an $18 million increase in Florida, more than upsetting generally positive variances across the rest of the footprint. 
Across the portfolios, residential builder and developer NPAs of $520 million were down $28 million sequentially and represented 21% of total commercial NPAs. Within NPAs, commercial TDRs on non accrual status decreased to $39 million from $47 million last quarter. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans where it makes good economic sense for the bank. 
We currently anticipate commercial NPAs to remain relatively stable in the second quarter. The significant decline in 90 day past due credits, which I'll talk about in a moment, is a good development in that regard. And liquidity has improved from moving the trust asset, and we may choose to utilize that avenue more frequently if terms become more favorable. 
In terms of our commercial held-for-sale portfolio, total held-for-sale NPAs of $243 million were carried at $0.32 on the dollar at the end of the quarter. Of the $473 million, we originally transferred in the fourth quarter of 2008, $169 million remains, and it carried at $0.30 on the dollar. During the quarter, we transferred $80 million of additional loans in the held-for-sale, the majority of which were either sold or are under contract or letter of intent to be sold. Those loans sold, or under contract for sale, were sold or marked at $0.51 on the dollar relative to their original balance. 
On the consumer side, NPAs totaled $715 million at the end of the quarter, a $10 million or 1% sequential increase from the fourth quarter. Non accrual consumer TDRs accounted for $13 million of the increase with the remainder of the consumer NPA portfolio declining $3 million. Residential mortgage NPAs decreased $2 million during the quarter to $521 million with TDRs up $5 million sequentially and the remainder of the portfolio down $7 million. 
Home equity NPAs totaled $70 million at the end of the first quarter, down $1 million from fourth quarter levels. Auto NPAs were down $1 million, and credit card NPAs were up $14 million with the increase attributable to TDRs. 
Looking forward for consumer NPAs, we expect second quarter growth to be modest and generally consistent with first quarter trends. Consumer NPA trends will continue to reflect the seasoning of more recent TDRs as well as the favorable delinquency and migration trends we've been seeing. 
In terms of overall consumer TDRs, we have $1.8 billion of TDRs on the book, of which $1.5 billion are accruing loans and $271 billion were non accrual at March 31. About a quarter of the loans we've restructured to date have re-defaulted. 
On a lagged basis, re-default rates are just under 30% on modified loans, which is a bit better than industry data. We have updated our vintage default rate curve so that you can see the tendencies toward default by vintage. More recent vintages have shown lower re-default rates than loans we restructured earlier in the cycle and also constitute a larger proportion of the aggregate TDR pool. 
I'd like to spend a couple of additional minutes discussing a few nuances of the TDR process that are probably worth mentioning. If a loan has an interest rate concession made on it relative to market rates, it usually will remain in the accruing TDR bucket until it matures. As a result, TDRs will increase for us and for the industry as long as we continue these types of modifications. What is important to note is that of the $1.5 billion of accruing TDRs we had at the end of the quarter, $1.3 billion are current, and of those, over 900 million are current and were restructured more than six months ago. In the case of that $900 million, the vast majority will stay current but many will remain TDRs indefinitely because we made in interest rate concession, and therefore, they can't be removed from the TDR category. We've provided some aging data in our credit presentation that indicates the age of our TDRs and what proportion is current or delinquent after varying lengths of time. For most of these loans, we took our losses upfront when we modified them, and from that point on, they'll perform just fine. 
Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of our loss-mitigation efforts. And I think the information we've provided demonstrates that they're working and improving. Hopefully, this data provides you with the information you need to do your own evaluation of how to view these credits. 
Let me stop for a minute and point you to the roll-forward of our nonperforming loans that we've added to our credit trends presentation that was included in the materials we released this morning. I would point to a couple of trends worth mentioning. The first is that our commercial nonperforming loan inflows were the lowest we've seen in quite some time at $405 million, which compares with $602 million last quarter and a quarterly range of about $550 million to $830 million in 2009. On the consumer side, inflows totaled $137 million, which was down $15 million on a sequential basis and the lowest since the second quarter of 2009. Total inflows were $542 million, down from $754 million last quarter and the lowest we've seen since 2008. 
To wrap up the NPA discussion, we've been proactive in addressing problem loans and writing them down to realistic and realizable value. Total NPAs, commercial and consumer are being carried at approximately 59% of their original face value through the process of taking charge-offs, marks and specific reserves recorded through the first quarter. We believe that's appropriate, and I think our recent charge-off trends continue to be indicative of lower severities on new NPAs and reasonable carrying values overall. 
Moving to delinquency trends. Commercial loans 90 days past due were $120 million and dropped 40%, or $78 million from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans 30 to 89 days past due were $401 million and increased by $34 million from the low levels experienced in the fourth quarter. As we discussed last quarter, consumer delinquency trends overall have continued to moderate. Three key drivers of those trends are the seasoning of loans made in 2005, significant underwriting improvements in home equity and auto portfolios and the run off of mortgages due to our 95% salability strategy. These factors are having an increasing impact on the performance of the portfolio. 
Consumer loans over 90 days past due were $316 million, down $53 million, with Florida representing the largest decline for the fourth consecutive quarter. Consumer delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2% sequentially to $516 million. Total delinquencies this quarter were down 15% from last quarter and were at the lowest levels since mid-2007. We believe we're seeing signs of stabilization and don't currently expect significant movement next quarter, although delinquencies can move around a bit given seasonality and timing issues. 
A couple of comments on provision and the allowance. Provision expense for the quarter was $590 million and exceeded net charge-offs by $8 million. The allowance was also increased by $45 million as a result of the consolidated of off-balance sheet assets. Our allowance coverage ratios remains strong, covering nonperforming loans by 139% and first quarter annualized net charge-offs by 161%. 
One last item before I turn it over to Dan. We've updated our stress test models to give effect to actual results and recent trends as well as changes to forecast for the macro economy. Those macro forecasts are derived from Moody's economy .com base-case and recession-case scenarios. We've provided the results of those models and macro assumptions once again in the credit trends presentation. You'll note that the results are better than those we provided in January, reflecting several factors. There's been some improvement in the macroeconomic assumptions. Also, first quarter results were generally better than expected in January, and the adjusting for the effect of the improvement we've seen in results, rural rates, et cetera is reflected in remainder of the year expectation. As you'll see, under the updates and base-case scenario, losses would be expected to remain significantly below our 2009 losses. In both the new base-case and recession-case remains much better than the F-Cap [ph] adverse scenario results and the recession-case is actually more consistent with our baseline F-Cap submission.  
With that, I'll turn things over to Dan to discuss operating trends. Dan?"

As Kevin and Mary have discussed, we're seeing a lot of positive momentum in both our credit trends and our operating trends.

As Kevin and Mary have discussed, we're seeing a lot of positive momentum in both our credit trends and our operating trends. For the quarter, we reported a net loss of $10 million and paid preferred dividends of $62 million which resulted in a loss of $72 million on an available per common share basis. Last quarter, our net loss was $98 million or $160 million to comp. The biggest driver for the improvement was clearly lower provision expense, which was down $186 million on a pretax basis. 
However, there were several other major themes for the quarter. The first was improved net interest income and net interest margin. NII increased by $19 million sequentially and NIM grew eight basis points to 3.63%. The second one's a decline in fee income, although less than expected, which was down $24 million. There were a number of items in both fourth quarter and first quarter results that affected that and I'll talk about those later. 
Underlying fee trends remain consistent with our expectations and are favorable, although REGI [ph] will create a bit of headwind for fees in a couple of quarters. 
The third was continued deposit growth. Average quarter deposits grew by 6% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis, with strong growth in transaction accounts. Wholesale funding fell by another $2 billion sequentially and $15 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our liquidity position remains very strong. Core deposits continue to fund 100% of our loan portfolio. 
And last was lower non-provision credit costs. Compared with last quarter, credit costs recognized through fee income and operating expenses were down $11 million and totaled $92 million. Gains on loan sales offset increased mortgage repurchase expense and we experienced improvement in OREO expense, losses on OREO sales and work out in collection costs. 
With that context, let's go through the balance sheet in more detail. Average earning assets were up about 2% compared with last quarter but were down 3% on a year-over-year basis. This trend continues to be driven by weak loan demand, particularly on the commercial side. 
During the quarter, we adopted FAS 167, which increased earning assets by $1.3 billion on a net basis. In terms of the balance sheet geography of that, this reduced available-for-sale securities by $1 billion, while on the loan side, it increased C&I loans by about $700 million, auto loans by $1.2 billion and home equity loans by $300 million. 
Loan balances were down slightly, net of the impact of FAS 167, although we've seen a notable deceleration in the rate of decline. And we currently expect that to turn positive as 2010 progresses. As Kevin noted, commercial line utilization remained consistent with fourth quarter after four quarters of consecutive declines. Right now, we'd expect loan balances to be relatively stable in the second quarter but to see some modest growth in the second half of the year, as business investment and working capital needs begin to reflect economic trends.
Average commercial loans were flat compared to the fourth quarter, with the effect of charge-offs and weak loan demand offsetting the impact of FAS 167. Average consumer loans increased 3% sequentially, although they were down 1% compared with a year ago. 
Auto loan balances increased 14% from last quarter and 17% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of consolidation, balances were up about $100 million sequentially. Credit card balances were down 2% on a sequential basis and up 6% year-over-year. Home equity loans were flat sequentially and down 3% on a year-over-year basis. And residential mortgages were down 7% from the fourth quarter and 13% from a year ago, as we continue to sell most of our new production. Flow sales during the quarter were $3.3 billion. 
Average securities increased by $1.7 billion during the quarter, driven by excess liquidity. Short-term investments primarily held at the Fed, increased an average of $2 billion. The remaining $300 million decrease in securities reflected the consolidation of our off-balance sheet conduits and the reduction in variable rate demand notes, which combined to reduce securities by about $1 billion. That more than offset the full quarter effect of mortgage-backed securities that were purchased in the fourth quarter.  
Now moving on to deposits. We saw continued strong deposit momentum this quarter with a continued positive mix-shift toward lower cost deposits. Average core deposit growth was 6% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Transaction account balance growth remained strong. DDA balances were up 4% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, while interest checking deposits increased 20% from last quarter and 37% on a year-over-year basis. 
Retail core deposits increased 1% sequentially and increased 3% year-over-year. Our net new account production was double the level we've seen in the first quarter of 2009 and was driven by our new relationship savings product that provides greater value based on the depth of the relationship a customer has at Fifth Third. We also saw a 3% sequential growth in average retail deposit account balances, which is atypical for the first quarter and is driven by the migration of our deposit book from products like free checking, in the more relationship-oriented products, as well as higher consumer savings levels overall nationally. 
Total commercial core deposits were up 20% sequentially and 46% from a year ago. Growth has been driven primarily by higher average balances, which reflects cautiousness and excess liquidity among our customers. Commercial DDAs increased 8% from the fourth quarter and 46% year-over-year, while commercial interest checking increased 39% sequentially and 89% from last year. 
As we noted last quarter, public fund balances have driven the significant amount of recent growth. We expect core deposits in the second quarter to be consistent with the first quarter as additional growth is offset by the effective federal tax payments and lower public funds balances after tax season. 
Let me make a few comments on FTPS. As of the beginning of the year, the majority of FTPS employees were officially transitioned to the joint venture and off of our payroll. That drove a reduction in transition services agreement, or TSA revenue, as expected, from $39 million last quarter to $13 million this quarter and that's recorded in other non-interest income in the income statement. That revenue covered costs of a similar amount that we incur each quarter to provide those services to the processing JV. That $13 million number is probably a good quarterly run rate for the rest of 2010. 
Finally, we recognized equity method income of $5 million related to our 49% interest in the joint venture through the other income line item which compares with about $8 million last quarter. 
Now moving on to the income statement starting with net interest income. NII on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $19 million sequentially to $901 million. We continue to see the benefit of a shift toward lower cost deposits, as well as wider loan spreads. The total cost of interest-bearing liability fell 10 basis points sequentially, while average loan and lease yields expanded 10 basis points. The adoption of FAS 167 also contributed about $10 million to net interest income as we expected. 
Net interest margin increased eight basis points to 3.63%, driven by the factors I just outlined, with the consolidation of assets having no real meaningful impact on yield. 
Second quarter NII and NIM will be negatively affected by premium amortization on delinquent mortgage securities repurchased by Fannie May. That one-time negative impact to the second quarter is about $10 million to NII and four basis points to NIM. Despite that, we currently expect second quarter NII and NIM to be consistent with the first quarter, or perhaps up modestly. We currently expect NII and NIM trends to remain favorable in the second half of the year. 
Moving on to fees. First quarter non-interest income was $627 million, down $24 million from last quarter but significantly better than we expected. Results reflected three items that I want to comment on. First, as I noted, TSA revenue was $13 million this quarter versus $39 million last quarter due to the year-end transfer of employees to the JV. Second, we had a $2 million negative valuation adjustment on our warrants and FTPS and that compares with a $20 million gain on that same item last quarter. And third, we had a $9 million negative valuation adjustment on the total return swap related to estimated Visa litigation expense. And that swap was part of the sale of our Visa shares last summer. 
Those items add up to a negative swing of $57 million between quarters. Excluding those factors, fee income was up $33 million or 6% with negative effects of seasonality more than offset by higher mortgage banking revenue and lower credit related costs realized in non-interest income. 
Corporate banking revenue of $81 million was down $8 million from the fourth quarter or 8% sequentially, as we expected. Results in this line are correlated with commercial loan origination volume, which has been weak. We expect modest growth in the second quarter in this area. Positive service charges were down 11% from the fourth quarter and 3% from a year ago. Commercial deposit fees were down $4 million, and consumer deposit fees were down $13 million on a sequential basis. About half of the decline in consumer fees was related to seasonality with the remainder due to lower overdraft activity. 
Last quarter, we stopped charging for overdrafts under $5, and this the first full quarter of the impact from that change. We would expect normal positive seasonality, as well as additional account growth, to drive an increase in consumer service charges in the second quarter, perhaps $10 million to $15 million or so. 
More of that [ph]on the horizon for the industry is the upcoming change to overdraft charges or REGI [ph]. It's difficult to estimate the effect of this change, given that they depend on future customer choices and behavior, but let me take a stab at it. We currently estimate the impact of REGI [ph] to be about $20 million per quarter, with about $10 million to $15 million of that being realized in the third quarter and then the full run rate of $20 million impact in the fourth quarter. 
We've been proactive in developing deposit products that generate alternative revenue streams through voluntary customer adoption, which we think is preferable to both us and to our customers. We've had a lot of success in fee-based bundled products like our secure checking and rewards checking products. We also believe that a number of our customers will elect to set up overdraft protection by linking their checking account to a savings account, credit card or home-equity line. 
We've seen this on the horizon for a while. We were one of the first banks to stop offering a totally free checking account and we've absorbed some of the impact of that already, and we work continually to proactively develop new value-added products to help mitigate the impact of these developments. 
Investment advisory revenue increased 5% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Recent market performance has benefited the trust asset management and brokerage groups. The first quarter also benefit seasonally from trust tax preparation fees, and thus we expect this line item to be relatively flat in the second quarter. Card and processing fee income was down modestly on a sequential basis, coming in at $73 million for the quarter, which compares to $76 million last quarter. That was a good result given the seasonality we experienced in the first quarter of every year. 
Net mortgage revenue of $152 million was up $20 million from last quarter. That included the benefit of gains on MSR hedges of $51 million. Right now, we expect net mortgage banking revenue to decline by $25 million or so in the second quarter. 
Now this is probably the fourth or fifth straight quarter we've predicted lower mortgage banking revenue, but I've decided that I'm going to keep saying it until I'm right, so that's our guidance again this quarter. 
Credit-related costs reported in fee income were just $1 million for the first quarter, down from $30 million last quarter. The biggest driver of the improvement was $25 million in gains on loan sales. Next quarter, we'd expect to those costs closer to $25 million, which is primarily the ongoing effect of losses on OREO sales. As a result, we expect a line item, other non-interest income, to be about $25 million lower in the second quarter than the first. This line can move around some, but that's our current expectation. 
We currently expect fee income in the second quarter to be about $600 million, give or take. We expect this sequential decline to be driven primarily by lower mortgage banking revenue and higher credit cost realized in fee income, but that should be partially offset by a generally stronger quarter from a seasonality perspective. 
Turning to expenses. Non-interest expense of $956 million was down $11 million or 1% sequentially. On the positive side, TSA expenses were down $26 million, and litigation expenses were down $18 million. On the negative side, FICA and unemployment benefits expense was up $16 million seasonally and credit-related expenses were up $18 million. Net of those items, non-interest expenses were flat. 
In the first quarter, credit-related costs within operating expenses were $91 million compared with $73 million last quarter. The increase was driven by higher expenses related to mortgage repurchases, $39 million this quarter compared with $18 million last quarter. I would note that the majority of that expense was related to a repurchase reserve build. Actual realized repurchase losses were consistent at $13 million this quarter versus $14 million last quarter. We would expect the repurchase of the expense to be about half of that $39 million level next quarter, maybe something in the $20 million range. And for total credit related cost recognized in expense to be down $20 million to $25 million as a consequence. 
Along with the industry, we've seen an increase in mortgage repurchase requests in the past couple of quarters. File request trends seem to be stabilizing, and while we currently expect demands for repurchases to remain at an elevated level, that file request activity trend suggests that demands and realized losses in the near term should be generally consistent with first quarter levels. Total repurchase reserves are about $80 million against losses realized in the first quarter of $13 million, so we think we're in pretty good shape here. 
In terms of overall expense expectations for the second quarter, we expect non-interest expense to be down $10 million to $15 million driven by lower benefits expense and lower credit-related costs, partially offset by the ongoing effect of investments and strategic initiatives. 
Let me stop for a moment and just do a quick recap of PPNR. Reported pretax pre-provision earnings were $568 million in the first quarter. Our current expectation is that second quarter PPNR will be consistent with the first quarter, with mortgage banking revenue down about $25 million, but with that being offset by growth in NII and other fee income lines as well as lower expenses. 
Let me spend just a minute on taxes. At our current level of earnings, which are very close zero, it could be difficult to estimate the expected tax rate. Given the effect of our tax credits, which we estimate to be about $125 million a year, we expect our full year tax rate to be below 10% and the second quarter should be in that ballpark as well. The first quarter tax rate was 53%, but that rate is not very meaningful given the level of our earnings is so close to breakeven. 
Now moving on to capital. Our quarter-end capital ratios remain strong. The TCE ratio was 6.4%, excluding $288 million of unrealized securities gains on an after-tax basis. Tier I common equity was 7%, and Tier I capital was 13.4%. I'd note that the implementation of FAS 167 led to a $77 million charge to equity this quarter. We currently anticipate that these capital ratios would be stable to modestly higher in the second quarter, depending on asset growth. I think with that, we'll open it up for questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre with Bernstein."

So, while I would share your views with respect to what the trends look like going forward, that doesn't necessarily fully make it into the allowance methodologies that we're required to have under generally accepted accounting principles. Those methodologies are generally more backward looking, they're based on historical results, tempered somewhat perhaps by recent trends. But we're not permitted, under generally accepted accounting principles, to bake into our allowance forecast. A lot of expectations about what future developments might be in the economy or for our customers and portfolio. So as Kevin mentioned in his comments, we do anticipate that reserve levels will begin to come down, and that, that would likely begin in the second quarter. But at this point, it's difficult to put a dollar range on that. That will depend upon our execution of those methodologies based on what trends actually materialize in the second quarter."

Our overall approach continues to be the same now. We do look for opportunities to restructure when it makes a good economic sense for us, and that's typically driven by cash flow trends that we think are strong enough in the long term to drive that kind of an economic decision for the bank and also for the borrower.

And we continue to look at a variety of options, to again, determine what makes best economic sense for the bank as well as for the borrower. That would include things like the borrowers situation as it relates to a long term situation as opposed to a short-term situation where perhaps they've got some additional stress in their lifestyle. We'll look at the possibility for extensions of terms. We'll look at the possibility for interest rate concessions.

I'll make some opening comments and then hand the call over to Mary and Dan for a more detailed discussion of our credit and financial performance. Overall results continue to show good progress, in both credit trends and continued operating momentum. Credit results were significantly better in the first quarter following improved results in the fourth quarter as well. 
On a sequential basis, net charge-offs were $582 million, down $126 million from last quarter. NPAs were down $115 million and loans 90 days past due were down $131 million. Commercial NPL inflows of $405 million fell roughly $200 million on a sequential basis, and consumer inflows of $137 million fell by $15 million, so good positive momentum in all three of the key credit metrics. 
Our current expectation is for net charge-offs to be down again next quarter by another $100 million or so, with $15 million to $20 million of that coming from consumer and the rest in commercial. Our outlook for the year, generally, is for stable-to-improving credit results, although, we may see particular credit metrics bounce around from quarter-to-quarter that assumes the economy continues to cooperate. 
Our reserve position remains strong at 4.9% of loans and 139% of NPLs. Given the trajectory of delinquency and loss trends, we currently expect loan loss reserves to decline beginning in the second quarter. Obviously, we'll have to evaluate reserves in the context of actual credit trends at the end of the quarter. The modeling of reserves is fairly complex as you know, and the results of that exercise is not something I can really predict as we stand here today. We'd expect the need for reserves to decline over time, provided that loss content in the portfolio continues to improve and assuming economic conditions remain consistent with our current outlook. 
Let me give you some high level operating results. Our pretax, pre-provision net revenue came in better than expected, rising $6 million on a sequential basis to $568 million. PPNR is up 11% on a reported basis from the first quarter a year ago. That growth was 15% excluding revenue and expenses. We deconsolidated in the processing transaction of 54 million pretax BOLI charge last year and securities gains and losses from both periods. That's a strong result over a pretty challenging time period. We currently expect second quarter PPNR to be consistent with the first quarter, and Dan will talk more about the components of our operating expectations in his remarks. 
The net interest margin increased eight bps sequentially, coming in at 363 and net interest income increased 19 million sequentially. Fees of $627 million were down $24 million sequentially. That reflects typical seasonality, as well as a number of moving parts, which Dan will outline. Underlying fee trends however, remain favorable. Average transaction deposits were up 9% on a sequential basis, with about $700 million of growth in DDA balances and $3.2 billion of growth in interest checking. Our strong deposit growth and muted asset trends have created a lot of liquidity. Wholesale funding was down $1.9 million sequentially and $14.7 billion on a year-over-year basis. 
Credit-related costs recognized in revenue and expenses remain elevated. They totaled $92 million this quarter compared with $103 million last quarter and $155 million in the third quarter of '09. We built our reserves for mortgage repurchases by about $25 million this quarter, which was offset by gains on loan sales. Otherwise, credit costs were down modestly this quarter, and Dan will discuss those moving parts in more detail. 
We continue to make progress on our customer satisfaction initiatives. Survey results put our satisfaction at the top of the industry. I think we're seeing tangible results from these improvements. We're now averaging more than four products per retail customer compared with less than three a couple of years ago. We ranked first in the nation for the sixth straight month in mortgage refinance retention. That is, when our customers refinance their mortgage, they did it with us. As we continue to implement new technology and processes, we're confident that we can continue our household penetration and profitability results even further. 
This quarter's results are starting to reflect, in a significant way, the actions we've taken over the past two years to improve our underwriting and management of credit and to identify and address problems. I believe we'll continue to see progress, both on the credit front and from operating results. The economy has improved from last year, although growth is not great and unemployment remains very high, housing prices have stabilized and there's more activity. Many borrowers have lost their equity and their homes and they continue to retrench. We haven't seen a pick-up in commercial loan demand yet, but the rate of decline has slowed considerably. Line utilization seems to have stabilized for us this quarter consistent with fourth quarter levels at around 34%. If the economy maintains its progress, we would expect to begin to see growth soon. Consumer spending has started to pick up a bit, and that's a key element in increasing business confidence. 
That being said, there are a number of items on the horizon that could have a meaningful impact on the industry. The upcoming financial reform bill in Congress, Basel 3 and other regulatory changes, all have the potential to impact industry pricing and profitability. We support many of the proposals and support industry efforts to improve others. That being said, we're going to focus on what we can control; continued focus on credit quality, aggressive portfolio management and loss mitigation strategies, executing on our customer satisfaction initiatives and improving customer loyalty, enhancing the breadth and profitability of our offerings and relationships through holistic relationship management and making Fifth Third an employer of choice in the industry by continuing to enhance the engagement of our employees. 
And on that, I'd like to thank Fifth Third employees for their focus and dedication, both in helping us address the issues presented over the past couple of years from a credit standpoint, but also in staying focused on blocking and tackling, and continuing to generate strong operating results. It hasn't been easy, and I'm proud of what you're doing for the company. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mary to discuss credit results in more detail. Mary?"

As Kevin discussed, overall credit trends were better than expected. I'll get started with charge-offs. Total net charge-offs of $582 million decreased $126 million sequentially with commercial charge-offs accounting for all of the improvement. First quarter results included $26 million in charge-offs we recorded in moving loans to held-for-sale. While charge-offs remain elevated in Michigan and Florida, losses in Florida were significantly lower than in the fourth quarter, and losses in Michigan continue to show signs of stabilization with charge-offs relatively flat versus the fourth quarter and third quarter levels. 
Commercial net charge-offs were $342 million versus $468 million last quarter, down $126 million. The biggest driver of the decrease was Florida, down $93 million. Commercial charge-offs in Michigan were down $8 million, and the rest of the footprint was down $25 million combined. 
C&I net losses this quarter totaled $161 million, down $22 million with a sequential decline attributable to a broad base of industry segments. Michigan and Florida accounted for 44% of C&I losses during the quarter, while representing 22% of C&I loans. Florida losses were down sequentially. 
Commercial mortgage losses of $99 million decreased to $43 million from the fourth quarter, with Michigan and Florida contributing 53% of losses, although losses were lower in both states. 
Commercial construction net charge-offs were $78 million, down $57 million from the fourth quarter, with Michigan and Florida both down, but still generating 40% of losses. Across the portfolio, homebuilder/developer losses totaled $81 million, down $29 million from last quarter. You'll recall that we suspended homebuilder originations over two years ago, have already recorded significant charge-offs against that portfolio and worked to reduce our exposure. 
Portfolio balances declined to $239 million sequentially to $1.3 billion, which compares with a peak balance of $3.3 billion back in mid-2008. We expect losses from this portfolio to continue to decrease over time. 
As Kevin noted earlier, we expect commercial net charge-offs to come down again in the second quarter. Our current outlook would be down about $75 million to $100 million, with lower charge-offs in both C&I and commercial real estate. 
Turning to the consumer portfolio, net charge-offs of $240 million were flat compared with the prior quarter and included the effect of about $5 million in charge-offs on loans consolidated under FAS 167. 
Looking at individual product lines. Net charge-offs on the residential mortgage portfolio were $88 million, an increase of $10 million from the fourth quarter. Florida accounted for 53% of losses from 28% of the total mortgage portfolio. Home equity losses decreased $9 million sequentially, to $73 million, including $29 million of losses in the brokerage portfolio. The net charge-off rate on brokered home equity was about 6% annualized which is almost four times the loss rate on our branch-originated book. The brokered equity portfolio is $1.9 billion, down from about $3.5 billion a couple of years ago, and it continued to run off. 
Auto and credit card net charge-offs were both relatively flat compared with the third and fourth quarters of 2009. Auto charge-offs included $4 million in charge-offs from loans consolidated under FAS 167. Looking forward, we expect credit card charge-offs to continue to trend with the unemployment rate, and we'd expect auto charge-offs to begin to decline modestly, reflecting improved underwriting and better values received at auctions. We expect second quarter consumer charge-offs to be down about $15 million to $20 million, give or take. Beyond that, current migration trends and expectations would suggest that consumer losses should remain pretty stable over the remainder of 2010. Delinquency trends remained favorable in each of the four main consumer loan categories, as I'll discuss later. 
Now moving on to NPAs. NPAs, including held-for-sale, totaled $3.4 billion at quarter end, down about $100 million or 3% from the fourth quarter. Excluding $243 million of NPAs in our held-for-sale portfolio, where the loans have already been fully marked, portfolio NPAs totaled $3.1 billion. Portfolio nonperforming loans were down over $200 million sequentially, a 7% decline, while OREO was up about $100 million, largely commercial OREO. That was a really positive move for nonperforming loans. And as you'd expect, we're seeing some continued growth in OREO, which represents the culmination of treatment strategies on problem loans, with those typically having moved into nonperforming status in the year-ago time frame. I would note that only 10% of our OREO has been carried as OREO for more than 12 months. 
Overall, Florida and Michigan remain the most challenged geographies from an NPA standpoint and accounted for 45% of NPAs in the portfolio. Portfolio commercial NPAs declined by $126 million or 5% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than we originally expected. 
Commercial construction was the biggest driver with NPAs down $198 million or 20%. Florida and Michigan accounted for almost half of the decline. Commercial mortgage NPAs were up $17 million. Increases in Florida and Michigan more than offset improvement in most other geographic areas. 
 
C&I NPAs were up $7 million from the fourth quarter with an $18 million increase in Florida, more than offsetting generally positive variances across the rest of the footprint.
Across the portfolios, residential builder and developer NPAs of $520 million were down $28 million sequentially and represented 21% of total commercial NPAs. Within NPAs, commercial TDRs on non#accrual status decreased to $39 million from $47 million last quarter. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans where it makes good economic sense for the bank. 
We currently anticipate commercial NPAs to remain relatively stable in the second quarter. The significant decline in 90-day past-due credits, which I'll talk about in a moment, is a good development in that regard. And liquidity has improved from moving the trust assets, and we may choose to utilize that avenue more frequently if terms become more favorable. 
In terms of our commercial held-for-sale portfolio, total held-for-sale NPAs of $243 million were carried at $0.32 on the dollar at the end of the quarter. Of the $473 million we originally transferred in the fourth quarter of 2008, $169 million remains and is carried at $0.30 on the dollar. During the quarter, we transferred $80 million of additional loans in the held-for-sale, the majority of which were either sold or are under a contract or letter of intent to be sold. Those loans sold or are under contract for sale were sold or marked at $0.51 on the dollar relative to their original balance. 
On the consumer side, NPAs totaled $715 million at the end of the quarter, a $10 million or 1% sequential increase from the fourth quarter. Non#accrual consumer TDRs accounted for $13 million of the increase with the remainder of the consumer NPA portfolio declining $3 million. Residential mortgage NPAs decreased $2 million during the quarter to $521 million with TDRs up $5 million sequentially and the remainder of the portfolio down $7 million. 
Home equity NPAs totaled $70 million at the end of the first quarter, down $1 million from fourth quarter levels. Auto NPAs were down $1 million, and credit card NPAs were up $14 million with the increase attributable to TDRs. 
Looking forward for consumer NPAs, we expect second quarter growth to be modest and generally consistent with first quarter trends. Consumer NPA trends will continue to reflect the seasoning of more recent TDRs as well as the favorable delinquency and migration trends we've been seeing. 
In terms of overall consumer TDRs, we have $1.8 billion of TDRs on the book, of which $1.5 billion are accruing loans and $271 billion were non-accrual at March 31. About a quarter of the loans we've restructured to date have re-defaulted. 
On a lagged basis, re-default rates are just under 30% on modified loans, which is a bit better than industry data. We have updated our vintage default rate curve so that you can see the tendencies toward default by vintage. More recent vintages have shown lower re-default rates than loans we restructured earlier in the cycle and also constitute a larger proportion of the aggregate TDR pool. 
I'd like to spend a couple of additional minutes discussing a few nuances of the TDR process that are probably worth mentioning. If a loan has an interest rate concession made on it relative to market rates, it usually will remain in the accruing TDR bucket until it matures. As a result, TDRs will increase for us and for the industry as long as we continue these types of modifications. What is important to note is that of the $1.5 billion of accruing TDRs we had at the end of the quarter, $1.3 billion are current, and of those, over 900 million are current and were restructured more than six months ago. In the case of that $900 million, the vast majority will stay current but many will remain TDRs indefinitely because we made in interest rate concession, and therefore, they can't be removed from the TDR category. We've provided some aging data in our credit presentation that indicates the age of our TDRs and what proportion is current or delinquent after varying lengths of time. For most of these loans, we took our losses upfront when we modified them, and from that point on, they'll perform just fine. 
Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of our loss-mitigation efforts. And I think the information we've provided demonstrates that they're working and improving. Hopefully, this data provides you with the information you need to do your own evaluation of how to view these credits. 
Let me stop for a minute and point you to the roll-forward of our nonperforming loans that we've added to our credit trends presentation that was included in the materials we released this morning. I would point to a couple of trends worth mentioning. The first is that our commercial nonperforming loan inflows were the lowest we've seen in quite some time at $405 million, which compares with $602 million last quarter and a quarterly range of about $550 million to $830 million in 2009. On the consumer side, inflows totaled $137 million, which was down $15 million on a sequential basis and the lowest since the second quarter of 2009. Total inflows were $542 million, down from $754 million last quarter and the lowest we've seen since 2008. 
To wrap up the NPA discussion, we've been proactive in addressing problem loans and writing them down to realistic and realizable value. Total NPAs, commercial and consumer are being carried at approximately 59% of their original face value through the process of taking charge-offs, marks and specific reserves recorded through the first quarter. We believe that's appropriate, and I think our recent charge-off trends continue to be indicative of lower severities on new NPAs and reasonable carrying values overall. 
Moving to delinquency trends. Commercial loans 90 days past due were $120 million and dropped 40%, or $78 million from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans 30 to 89 days past due were $401 million and increased by $34 million from the low levels experienced in the fourth quarter. As we discussed last quarter, consumer delinquency trends overall have continued to moderate. Three key drivers of those trends are the seasoning of loans made in 2005, significant underwriting improvements in home equity and auto portfolios and the run off of mortgages due to our 95% salability strategy. These factors are having an increasing impact on the performance of the portfolio. 
Consumer loans over 90 days past due were $316 million, down $53 million, with Florida representing the largest decline for the fourth consecutive quarter. Consumer delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2% sequentially to $516 million. Total delinquencies this quarter were down 15% from last quarter and were at the lowest levels since mid-2007. We believe we're seeing signs of stabilization and don't currently expect significant movement next quarter, although delinquencies can move around a bit given seasonality and timing issues. 
A couple of comments on provision and the allowance. Provision expense for the quarter was $590 million and exceeded net charge-offs by $8 million. The allowance was also increased by $45 million as a result of the consolidated of off-balance sheet assets. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong, covering nonperforming loans by 139% and first quarter annualized net charge-offs by 161%. 
One last item before I turn it over to Dan. We've updated our stress test models to give effect to actual results and recent trends as well as changes to forecast for the macro economy. Those macro forecasts are derived from moodyseconomy.com base-case and recession-case scenarios. We've provided the results of those models and macro assumptions once again in the credit trends presentation. You'll note that the results are better than those we provided in January, reflecting several factors. There's been some improvement in the macroeconomic assumptions. Also, first quarter results were generally better than expected in January, and the adjusting for the effect of the improvement we've seen in results, rural rates, et cetera is reflected in remainder of the year expectations. As you'll see, under the updated base-case scenario, losses would be expected to remain significantly below our 2009 losses. And both the new base-case and recession-case remains much better than the SCAP adverse scenario results, and the recession-case is actually more consistent with our baseline SCAP submission. 
With that, I'll turn things over to Dan to discuss operating trends. Dan?"

As Kevin and Mary have discussed, we're seeing a lot of positive momentum in both our credit trends and our operating trends. For the quarter, we reported a net loss of $10 million and paid preferred dividends of $62 million, which resulted",2728,"Thanks, Mary. As Kevin and Mary have discussed, we're seeing a lot of positive momentum in both our credit trends and our operating trends. For the quarter, we reported a net loss of $10 million and paid preferred dividends of $62 million, which resulted in a loss of $72 million on an available per common share basis. Last quarter, our net loss was $98 million or $160 million to comp. The biggest driver for the improvement was clearly lower provision expense, which was down $186 million on a pretax basis. 
However, there were several other major themes for the quarter. The first was improved net interest income and net interest margin. NII increased by $19 million sequentially and NIM grew eight basis points to 3.63%. The second was a decline in fee income, although less than expected, which was down $24 million. There were a number of items in both fourth quarter and first quarter results that affected that and I'll talk about those later. 
Underlying fee trends remained consistent with our expectations and are favorable, although Reg E will create a bit of headwind for fees in a couple of quarters. 
The third was continued deposit growth. Average core deposits grew by 6% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis, with strong growth in transaction accounts. Wholesale funding fell by another $2 billion sequentially and $15 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our liquidity position remains very strong. Core deposits continue to fund 100% of our loan portfolio. 
And last was lower non-provision credit costs. Compared with last quarter, credit costs recognized through fee income and operating expenses were down $11 million and totaled $92 million. Gains on loan sales offset increased mortgage repurchase expense and we experienced improvement in OREO expense, losses on OREO sales and work out in collection costs. 
With that context, let's go through the balance sheet in more detail. Average earning assets were up about 2% compared with last quarter but were down 3% on a year-over-year basis. This trend continues to be driven by weak loan demand, particularly on the commercial side. 
During the quarter, we adopted FAS 167, which increased earning assets by $1.3 billion on a net basis. In terms of the balance sheet geography of that, this reduced available-for-sale securities by $1 billion, while on the loan side, it increased C&I loans by about $700 million, auto loans by $1.2 billion and home equity loans by $300 million. 
Loan balances were down slightly, net of the impact of FAS 167, although we've seen a notable deceleration in the rate of decline. And we currently expect that to turn positive as 2010 progresses. As Kevin noted, commercial line utilization remained consistent with fourth quarter after four quarters of consecutive declines. Right now, we'd expect loan balances to be relatively stable in the second quarter but to see some modest growth in the second half of the year, as business investment and working capital needs begin to reflect economic trends.
Average commercial loans were flat compared to the fourth quarter, with the effect of charge-offs and weak loan demand offsetting the impact of FAS 167. Average consumer loans increased 3% sequentially, although they were down 1% compared with a year ago. 
Auto loan balances increased 14% from last quarter and 17% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of consolidation, balances were up about $100 million sequentially. Credit card balances were down 2% on a sequential basis and up 6% year-over-year. Home equity loans were flat sequentially and down 3% on a year-over-year basis. And residential mortgages were down 7% from the fourth quarter and 13% from a year ago, as we continue to sell most of our new production. Flow sales during the quarter were $3.3 billion. 
Average securities increased by $1.7 billion during the quarter, driven by excess liquidity. Short-term investments primarily held at the Fed, increased an average of $2 billion. The remaining $300 million decrease in securities reflected the consolidation of our off-balance sheet conduits and the reduction in variable rate demand notes, which combined to reduce securities by about $1 billion. That more than offset the full quarter effect of mortgage-backed securities that were purchased in the fourth quarter. 
Now moving on to deposits. We saw continued strong deposit momentum this quarter with a continued positive mix-shift toward lower cost deposits. Average core deposit growth was 6% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Transaction account balance growth remained strong. DDA balances were up 4% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, while interest checking deposits increased 20% from last quarter and 37% on a year-over-year basis. 
Retail core deposits increased 1% sequentially and increased 3% year-over-year. Our net new account production was double the level we've seen in the first quarter of 2009 and was driven by our new relationship savings product that provides greater value based on the depth of the relationship a customer has at Fifth Third. We also saw a 3% sequential growth in average retail deposit account balances, which is atypical for the first quarter and is driven by the migration of our deposit book from products like free checking, in the more relationship-oriented products, as well as higher consumer savings levels overall nationally. 
Total commercial core deposits were up 20% sequentially and 46% from a year ago. Growth has been driven primarily by higher average balances, which reflects cautiousness and excess liquidity among our customers. Commercial DDAs increased 8% from the fourth quarter and 46% year-over-year, while commercial interest checking increased 39% sequentially and 89% from last year. 
As we noted last quarter, public fund balances have driven the significant amount of recent growth. We expect core deposits in the second quarter to be consistent with the first quarter as additional growth is offset by the effective federal tax payments and lower public funds balances after tax season. 
Let me make a few comments on FTPS. As of the beginning of the year, the majority of FTPS employees were officially transitioned to the joint venture and off of our payroll. That drove a reduction in transition services agreement, or TSA revenue, as expected, from $39 million last quarter to $13 million this quarter and that's recorded in other non-interest income in the income statement. That revenue covered costs of a similar amount that we incur each quarter to provide those services to the processing JV. That $13 million number is probably a good quarterly run rate for the rest of 2010. 
Finally, we recognized equity method income of $5 million related to our 49% interest in the joint venture through the other income line item which compares with about $8 million last quarter. 
Now moving on to the income statement starting with net interest income. NII on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $19 million sequentially to $901 million. We continue to see the benefit of a shift toward lower cost deposits, as well as wider loan spreads. The total cost of interest-bearing liability fell 10 basis points sequentially, while average loan and lease yields expanded 10 basis points. The adoption of FAS 167 also contributed about $10 million to net interest income as we expected. 
Net interest margin increased eight basis points to 3.63%, driven by the factors I just outlined, with the consolidation of assets having no real meaningful impact on yield. 
Second quarter NII and NIM will be negatively affected by premium amortization on delinquent mortgage securities repurchased by Fannie May. That one-time negative impact to the second quarter is about $10 million to NII and four basis points to NIM. Despite that, we currently expect second quarter NII and NIM to be consistent with the first quarter, or perhaps up modestly. We currently expect NII and NIM trends to remain favorable in the second half of the year. 
Moving on to fees. First quarter non-interest income was $627 million, down $24 million from last quarter but significantly better than we expected. Results reflected three items that I want to comment on. First, as I noted, TSA revenue was $13 million this quarter versus $39 million last quarter due to the year-end transfer of employees to the JV. Second, we had a $2 million negative valuation adjustment on our warrants and FTPS and that compares with a $20 million gain on that same item last quarter. And third, we had a $9 million negative valuation adjustment on the total return swap related to estimated Visa litigation expense. And that swap was part of the sale of our Visa shares last summer. 
Those items add up to a negative swing of $57 million between quarters. Excluding those factors, fee income was up $33 million or 6% with negative effects of seasonality more than offset by higher mortgage banking revenue and lower credit related costs realized in non-interest income. 
Corporate banking revenue of $81 million was down $8 million from the fourth quarter or 8% sequentially, as we expected. Results in this line are correlated with commercial loan origination volume, which has been weak. We expect modest growth in the second quarter in this area. Positive service charges were down 11% from the fourth quarter and 3% from a year ago. Commercial deposit fees were down $4 million, and consumer deposit fees were down $13 million on a sequential basis. About half of the decline in consumer fees was related to seasonality with the remainder due to lower overdraft activity. 
Last quarter, we stopped charging for overdrafts under $5, and this the first full quarter of the impact from that change. We would expect normal positive seasonality, as well as additional account growth, to drive an increase in consumer service charges in the second quarter, perhaps $10 million to $15 million or so. 
One event on the horizon for the industry is the upcoming change to overdraft charges or Reg E. It's difficult to estimate the effect of this change, given that they depend on future customer choices and behavior, but let me take a stab at it. We currently estimate the impact of Reg E to be about $20 million per quarter, with about $10 million to $15 million of that being realized in the third quarter and then the full run rate of $20 million impact in the fourth quarter. 
We've been proactive in developing deposit products that generate alternative revenue streams through voluntary customer adoption, which we think is preferable to both us and to our customers. We've had a lot of success in fee-based bundled products like our secure checking and rewards checking products. We also believe that a number of our customers will elect to set up overdraft protection by linking their checking account to a savings account, credit card or home-equity line. 
We've seen this on the horizon for a while. We were one of the first banks to stop offering a totally free checking account and we've absorbed some of the impact of that already. And we work continually to proactively develop new value-added products to help mitigate the impact of these developments. 
Investment advisory revenue increased 5% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Recent market performance has benefited the trust, asset management and brokerage groups. The first quarter also benefit seasonally from trust tax preparation fees, and thus we expect this line item to be relatively flat in the second quarter. Card and processing fee income was down modestly on a sequential basis, coming in at $73 million for the quarter, which compares to $76 million last quarter. That was a good result given the seasonality we experienced in the first quarter of every year. 
Net mortgage revenue of $152 million was up $20 million from last quarter. That included the benefit of gains on MSR hedges of $51 million. Right now, we expect net mortgage banking revenue to decline by $25 million or so in the second quarter. 
Now this is probably the fourth or fifth straight quarter we've predicted lower mortgage banking revenue, but I've decided that I'm going to keep saying it until I'm right, so that's our guidance again this quarter. 
Credit-related costs reported in fee income were just $1 million for the first quarter, down from $30 million last quarter. The biggest driver of the improvement was $25 million in gains on loan sales. Next quarter, we'd expect to those costs closer to $25 million, which is primarily the ongoing effect of losses on OREO sales. As a result, we expect a line item, other non-interest income, to be about $25 million lower in the second quarter than the first. This line can move around some, but that's our current expectation. 
We currently expect fee income in the second quarter to be about $600 million, give or take. We expect this sequential decline to be driven primarily by lower mortgage banking revenue and higher credit cost realized in fee income, but that should be partially offset by a generally stronger quarter from a seasonality perspective. 
Turning to expenses. Non-interest expense of $956 million was down $11 million or 1% sequentially. On the positive side, TSA expenses were down $26 million, and litigation expenses were down $18 million. On the negative side, FICA and unemployment benefits expense was up $16 million seasonally and credit-related expenses were up $18 million. Net of those items, non-interest expenses were flat. 
In the first quarter, credit-related costs within operating expenses were $91 million compared with $73 million last quarter. The increase was driven by higher expenses related to mortgage repurchases, $39 million this quarter compared with $18 million last quarter. I would note that the majority of that expense was related to a repurchase reserve build. Actual realized repurchase losses were consistent at $13 million this quarter versus $14 million last quarter. We would expect the repurchase of the expense to be about half of that $39 million level next quarter, maybe something in the $20 million range. And for total credit related cost recognized in expense to be down $20 million to $25 million as a consequence. 
Along with the industry, we've seen an increase in mortgage repurchase requests in the past couple of quarters. File request trends seem to be stabilizing, and while we currently expect demands for repurchases to remain at an elevated level, that file request activity trend suggests that demands and realized losses in the near term should be generally consistent with first quarter levels. Total repurchase reserves are about $80 million against losses realized in the first quarter of $13 million, so we think we're in pretty good shape here. 
In terms of overall expense expectations for the second quarter, we expect non-interest expense to be down $10 million to $15 million driven by lower benefits expense and lower credit-related costs, partially offset by the ongoing effect of investments and strategic initiatives. 
Let me stop for a moment and just do a quick recap of PPNR. Reported pretax pre-provision earnings were $568 million in the first quarter. Our current expectation is that second quarter PPNR will be consistent with the first quarter, with mortgage banking revenue down about $25 million, but with that being offset by growth in NII and other fee income lines as well as lower expenses. 
Let me spend just a minute on taxes. At our current level of earnings, which are very close zero, it could be difficult to estimate the expected tax rate. Given the effect of our tax credits, which we estimate to be about $125 million a year, we expect our full year tax rate to be below 10% and the second quarter should be in that ballpark as well. The first quarter tax rate was 53%, but that rate is not very meaningful given the level of our earnings is so close to breakeven. 
Now moving on to capital. Our quarter-end capital ratios remain strong. The TCE ratio was 6.4%, excluding $288 million of unrealized securities gains on an after-tax basis. Tier I common equity was 7%, and Tier I capital was 13.4%. I'd note that the implementation of FAS 167 led to a $77 million charge to equity this quarter. We currently anticipate that these capital ratios would be stable to modestly higher in the second quarter, depending on asset growth. I think with that, we'll open it up for questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre with Bernstein."

So while I would share your views with respect to what the trends look like going forward, that doesn't necessarily fully make it into the allowance methodologies that we're required to have under generally accepted accounting principles. Those methodologies are generally more backward looking, they're based on historical results, tempered somewhat perhaps by recent trends. But we're not permitted, under generally accepted accounting principles, to bake into our allowance forecast. A lot of expectations about what future developments might be in the economy or for our customers and portfolio. So as Kevin mentioned in his comments, we do anticipate that reserve levels will begin to come down, and that, that would likely begin in the second quarter. But at this point, it's difficult to put a dollar range on that. That will depend upon our execution of those methodologies based on what trends actually materialize in the second quarter."

I'll make some opening comments and then hand the call over to Mary and Dan for a more detailed discussion of our credit and financial performance. Overall results continue to show good progress, in both credit trends and continued operating momentum. Credit results were significantly better in the first quarter following improved results in the fourth quarter as well. 
On a sequential basis, net charge-offs were $582 million, down $126 million from last quarter. NPAs were down $115 million and loans 90 days past due were down $131 million. Commercial NPL inflows of $405 million fell roughly $200 million on a sequential basis, and consumer inflows of $137 million fell by $15 million, so good positive momentum in all three of the key credit metrics. 
Our current expectation is for net charge-offs to be down again next quarter by another $100 million or so, with $15 million to $20 million of that coming from consumer and the rest in commercial. Our outlook for the year, generally, is for stable-to-improving credit results, although, we may see particular credit metrics bounce around from quarter-to-quarter that assumes the economy continues to cooperate. 
Our reserve position remains strong at 4.9% of loans and 139% of NPLs. Given the trajectory of delinquency and loss trends, we currently expect loan loss reserves to decline beginning in the second quarter. Obviously, we'll have to evaluate reserves in the context of actual credit trends at the end of the quarter. The modeling of reserves is fairly complex as you know, and the results of that exercise is not something I can really predict as we stand here today. We'd expect the need for reserves to decline over time, provided that loss content in the portfolio continues to improve and assuming economic conditions remain consistent with our current outlook. 
Let me give you some high level operating results. Our pretax, pre-provision net revenue came in better than expected, rising $6 million on a sequential basis to $568 million. PPNR is up 11% on a reported basis from the first quarter a year ago. That growth was 15% excluding revenue and expenses. We deconsolidated in the processing transaction of 54 million pretax BOLI charge last year and securities gains and losses from both periods. That's a strong result over a pretty challenging time period. We currently expect second quarter PPNR to be consistent with the first quarter, and Dan will talk more about the components of our operating expectations in his remarks. 
The net interest margin increased eight bps sequentially, coming in at 363 and net interest income increased 19 million sequentially. Fees of $627 million were down $24 million sequentially. That reflects typical seasonality, as well as a number of moving parts, which Dan will outline. Underlying fee trends however, remain favorable. Average transaction deposits were up 9% on a sequential basis, with about $700 million of growth in DDA balances and $3.2 billion of growth in interest checking. Our strong deposit growth and muted asset trends have created a lot of liquidity. Wholesale funding was down $1.9 million sequentially and $14.7 billion on a year-over-year basis. 
Credit-related costs recognized in revenue and expenses remain elevated. They totaled $92 million this quarter compared with $103 million last quarter and $155 million in the third quarter of '09. We built our reserves for mortgage repurchases by about $25 million this quarter, which was offset by gains on loan sales. Otherwise, credit costs were down modestly this quarter, and Dan will discuss those moving parts in more detail. 
We continue to make progress on our customer satisfaction initiatives. Survey results put our satisfaction at the top of the industry. I think we're seeing tangible results from these improvements. We're now averaging more than four products per retail customer compared with less than three a couple of years ago. We ranked first in the nation for the sixth straight month in mortgage refinance retention. That is, when our customers refinance their mortgage, they did it with us. As we continue to implement new technology and processes, we're confident that we can continue our household penetration and profitability results even further. 
This quarter's results are starting to reflect, in a significant way, the actions we've taken over the past two years to improve our underwriting and management of credit and to identify and address problems. I believe we'll continue to see progress, both on the credit front and from operating results. The economy has improved from last year, although growth is not great and unemployment remains very high, housing prices have stabilized and there's more activity. Many borrowers have lost their equity and their homes and they continue to retrench. We haven't seen a pick-up in commercial loan demand yet, but the rate of decline has slowed considerably. Line utilization seems to have stabilized for us this quarter consistent with fourth quarter levels at around 34%. If the economy maintains its progress, we would expect to begin to see growth soon. Consumer spending has started to pick up a bit, and that's a key element in increasing business confidence. 
That being said, there are a number of items on the horizon that could have a meaningful impact on the industry. The upcoming financial reform bill in Congress, Basel 3 and other regulatory changes, all have the potential to impact industry pricing and profitability. We support many of the proposals and support industry efforts to improve others. That being said, we're going to focus on what we can control; continued focus on credit quality, aggressive portfolio management and loss mitigation strategies, executing on our customer satisfaction initiatives and improving customer loyalty, enhancing the breadth and profitability of our offerings and relationships through holistic relationship management and making Fifth Third an employer of choice in the industry by continuing to enhance the engagement of our employees. 
And on that, I'd like to thank Fifth Third employees for their focus and dedication, both in helping us address the issues presented over the past couple of years from a credit standpoint, but also in staying focused on blocking and tackling, and continuing to generate strong operating results. It hasn't been easy, and I'm proud of what you're doing for the company. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mary to discuss credit results in more detail. Mary?"

As Kevin discussed, overall credit trends were better than expected. I'll get started with charge-offs. Total net charge-offs of $582 million decreased $126 million sequentially with commercial charge-offs accounting for all of the improvement. First quarter results included $26 million in charge-offs we recorded in moving loans to held-for-sale. While charge-offs remain elevated in Michigan and Florida, losses in Florida were significantly lower than in the fourth quarter, and losses in Michigan continue to show signs of stabilization with charge-offs relatively flat versus the fourth quarter and third quarter levels. 
Commercial net charge-offs were $342 million versus $468 million last quarter, down $126 million. The biggest driver of the decrease was Florida, down $93 million. Commercial charge-offs in Michigan were down $8 million, and the rest of the footprint was down $25 million combined. 
C&I net losses this quarter totaled $161 million, down $22 million with a sequential decline attributable to a broad base of industry segments. Michigan and Florida accounted for 44% of C&I losses during the quarter, while representing 22% of C&I loans. Florida losses were down sequentially. 
Commercial mortgage losses of $99 million decreased to $43 million from the fourth quarter, with Michigan and Florida contributing 53% of losses, although losses were lower in both states. 
Commercial construction net charge-offs were $78 million, down $57 million from the fourth quarter, with Michigan and Florida both down, but still generating 40% of losses. Across the portfolio, homebuilder/developer losses totaled $81 million, down $29 million from last quarter. You'll recall that we suspended homebuilder originations over two years ago, have already recorded significant charge-offs against that portfolio and worked to reduce our exposure. 
Portfolio balances declined to $239 million sequentially to $1.3 billion, which compares with a peak balance of $3.3 billion back in mid-2008. We expect losses from this portfolio to continue to decrease over time. 
As Kevin noted earlier, we expect commercial net charge-offs to come down again in the second quarter. Our current outlook would be down about $75 million to $100 million, with lower charge-offs in both C&I and commercial real estate. 
Turning to the consumer portfolio, net charge-offs of $240 million were flat compared with the prior quarter and included the effect of about $5 million in charge-offs on loans consolidated under FAS 167. 
Looking at individual product lines. Net charge-offs on the residential mortgage portfolio were $88 million, an increase of $10 million from the fourth quarter. Florida accounted for 53% of losses from 28% of the total mortgage portfolio. Home equity losses decreased $9 million sequentially, to $73 million, including $29 million of losses in the brokerage portfolio. The net charge-off rate on brokered home equity was about 6% annualized which is almost four times the loss rate on our branch-originated book. The brokered equity portfolio is $1.9 billion, down from about $3.5 billion a couple of years ago, and it continued to run off. 
Auto and credit card net charge-offs were both relatively flat compared with the third and fourth quarters of 2009. Auto charge-offs included $4 million in charge-offs from loans consolidated under FAS 167. Looking forward, we expect credit card charge-offs to continue to trend with the unemployment rate, and we'd expect auto charge-offs to begin to decline modestly, reflecting improved underwriting and better values received at auctions. We expect second quarter consumer charge-offs to be down about $15 million to $20 million, give or take. Beyond that, current migration trends and expectations would suggest that consumer losses should remain pretty stable over the remainder of 2010. Delinquency trends remained favorable in each of the four main consumer loan categories, as I'll discuss later. 
Now moving on to NPAs. NPAs, including held-for-sale, totaled $3.4 billion at quarter end, down about $100 million or 3% from the fourth quarter. Excluding $243 million of NPAs in our held-for-sale portfolio, where the loans have already been fully marked, portfolio NPAs totaled $3.1 billion. Portfolio nonperforming loans were down over $200 million sequentially, a 7% decline, while OREO was up about $100 million, largely commercial OREO. That was a really positive move for nonperforming loans. And as you'd expect, we're seeing some continued growth in OREO, which represents the culmination of treatment strategies on problem loans, with those typically having moved into nonperforming status in the year-ago time frame. I would note that only 10% of our OREO has been carried as OREO for more than 12 months. 
Overall, Florida and Michigan remain the most challenged geographies from an NPA standpoint and accounted for 45% of NPAs in the portfolio. Portfolio commercial NPAs declined by $126 million or 5% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than we originally expected. 
Commercial construction was the biggest driver with NPAs down $198 million or 20%. Florida and Michigan accounted for almost half of the decline. Commercial mortgage NPAs were up $17 million. Increases in Florida and Michigan more than offset improvement in most other geographic areas. 
 
C&I NPAs were up $7 million from the fourth quarter with an $18 million increase in Florida, more than offsetting generally positive variances across the rest of the footprint.
Across the portfolios, residential builder and developer NPAs of $520 million were down $28 million sequentially and represented 21% of total commercial NPAs. Within NPAs, commercial TDRs on non#accrual status decreased to $39 million from $47 million last quarter. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans where it makes good economic sense for the bank. 
We currently anticipate commercial NPAs to remain relatively stable in the second quarter. The significant decline in 90-day past-due credits, which I'll talk about in a moment, is a good development in that regard. And liquidity has improved from moving the trust assets, and we may choose to utilize that avenue more frequently if terms become more favorable. 
In terms of our commercial held-for-sale portfolio, total held-for-sale NPAs of $243 million were carried at $0.32 on the dollar at the end of the quarter. Of the $473 million we originally transferred in the fourth quarter of 2008, $169 million remains and is carried at $0.30 on the dollar. During the quarter, we transferred $80 million of additional loans in the held-for-sale, the majority of which were either sold or are under a contract or letter of intent to be sold. Those loans sold or are under contract for sale were sold or marked at $0.51 on the dollar relative to their original balance. 
On the consumer side, NPAs totaled $715 million at the end of the quarter, a $10 million or 1% sequential increase from the fourth quarter. Non#accrual consumer TDRs accounted for $13 million of the increase with the remainder of the consumer NPA portfolio declining $3 million. Residential mortgage NPAs decreased $2 million during the quarter to $521 million with TDRs up $5 million sequentially and the remainder of the portfolio down $7 million. 
Home equity NPAs totaled $70 million at the end of the first quarter, down $1 million from fourth quarter levels. Auto NPAs were down $1 million, and credit card NPAs were up $14 million with the increase attributable to TDRs. 
Looking forward for consumer NPAs, we expect second quarter growth to be modest and generally consistent with first quarter trends. Consumer NPA trends will continue to reflect the seasoning of more recent TDRs as well as the favorable delinquency and migration trends we've been seeing. 
In terms of overall consumer TDRs, we have $1.8 billion of TDRs on the book, of which $1.5 billion are accruing loans and $271 billion were non-accrual at March 31. About a quarter of the loans we've restructured to date have re-defaulted. 
On a lagged basis, re-default rates are just under 30% on modified loans, which is a bit better than industry data. We have updated our vintage default rate curve so that you can see the tendencies toward default by vintage. More recent vintages have shown lower re-default rates than loans we restructured earlier in the cycle and also constitute a larger proportion of the aggregate TDR pool. 
I'd like to spend a couple of additional minutes discussing a few nuances of the TDR process that are probably worth mentioning. If a loan has an interest rate concession made on it relative to market rates, it usually will remain in the accruing TDR bucket until it matures. As a result, TDRs will increase for us and for the industry as long as we continue these types of modifications. What is important to note is that of the $1.5 billion of accruing TDRs we had at the end of the quarter, $1.3 billion are current, and of those, over 900 million are current and were restructured more than six months ago. In the case of that $900 million, the vast majority will stay current but many will remain TDRs indefinitely because we made in interest rate concession, and therefore, they can't be removed from the TDR category. We've provided some aging data in our credit presentation that indicates the age of our TDRs and what proportion is current or delinquent after varying lengths of time. For most of these loans, we took our losses upfront when we modified them, and from that point on, they'll perform just fine. 
Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of our loss-mitigation efforts. And I think the information we've provided demonstrates that they're working and improving. Hopefully, this data provides you with the information you need to do your own evaluation of how to view these credits. 
Let me stop for a minute and point you to the roll-forward of our nonperforming loans that we've added to our credit trends presentation that was included in the materials we released this morning. I would point to a couple of trends worth mentioning. The first is that our commercial nonperforming loan inflows were the lowest we've seen in quite some time at $405 million, which compares with $602 million last quarter and a quarterly range of about $550 million to $830 million in 2009. On the consumer side, inflows totaled $137 million, which was down $15 million on a sequential basis and the lowest since the second quarter of 2009. Total inflows were $542 million, down from $754 million last quarter and the lowest we've seen since 2008. 
To wrap up the NPA discussion, we've been proactive in addressing problem loans and writing them down to realistic and realizable value. Total NPAs, commercial and consumer are being carried at approximately 59% of their original face value through the process of taking charge-offs, marks and specific reserves recorded through the first quarter. We believe that's appropriate, and I think our recent charge-off trends continue to be indicative of lower severities on new NPAs and reasonable carrying values overall. 
Moving to delinquency trends. Commercial loans 90 days past due were $120 million and dropped 40%, or $78 million from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans 30 to 89 days past due were $401 million and increased by $34 million from the low levels experienced in the fourth quarter. As we discussed last quarter, consumer delinquency trends overall have continued to moderate. Three key drivers of those trends are the seasoning of loans made in 2005, significant underwriting improvements in home equity and auto portfolios and the run off of mortgages due to our 95% salability strategy. These factors are having an increasing impact on the performance of the portfolio. 
Consumer loans over 90 days past due were $316 million, down $53 million, with Florida representing the largest decline for the fourth consecutive quarter. Consumer delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2% sequentially to $516 million. Total delinquencies this quarter were down 15% from last quarter and were at the lowest levels since mid-2007. We believe we're seeing signs of stabilization and don't currently expect significant movement next quarter, although delinquencies can move around a bit given seasonality and timing issues. 
A couple of comments on provision and the allowance. Provision expense for the quarter was $590 million and exceeded net charge-offs by $8 million. The allowance was also increased by $45 million as a result of the consolidated of off-balance sheet assets. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong, covering nonperforming loans by 139% and first quarter annualized net charge-offs by 161%. 
One last item before I turn it over to Dan. We've updated our stress test models to give effect to actual results and recent trends as well as changes to forecast for the macro economy. Those macro forecasts are derived from moodyseconomy.com base-case and recession-case scenarios. We've provided the results of those models and macro assumptions once again in the credit trends presentation. You'll note that the results are better than those we provided in January, reflecting several factors. There's been some improvement in the macroeconomic assumptions. Also, first quarter results were generally better than expected in January, and the adjusting for the effect of the improvement we've seen in results, rural rates, et cetera is reflected in remainder of the year expectations. As you'll see, under the updated base-case scenario, losses would be expected to remain significantly below our 2009 losses. And both the new base-case and recession-case remains much better than the SCAP adverse scenario results, and the recession-case is actually more consistent with our baseline SCAP submission. 
With that, I'll turn things over to Dan to discuss operating trends. Dan?"

As Kevin and Mary have discussed, we're seeing a lot of positive momentum in both our credit trends and our operating trends. For the quarter, we reported a net loss of $10 million and paid preferred dividends of $62 million, which resulted",2728,"Thanks, Mary. As Kevin and Mary have discussed, we're seeing a lot of positive momentum in both our credit trends and our operating trends. For the quarter, we reported a net loss of $10 million and paid preferred dividends of $62 million, which resulted in a loss of $72 million on an available per common share basis. Last quarter, our net loss was $98 million or $160 million to comp. The biggest driver for the improvement was clearly lower provision expense, which was down $186 million on a pretax basis. 
However, there were several other major themes for the quarter. The first was improved net interest income and net interest margin. NII increased by $19 million sequentially and NIM grew eight basis points to 3.63%. The second was a decline in fee income, although less than expected, which was down $24 million. There were a number of items in both fourth quarter and first quarter results that affected that and I'll talk about those later. 
Underlying fee trends remained consistent with our expectations and are favorable, although Reg E will create a bit of headwind for fees in a couple of quarters. 
The third was continued deposit growth. Average core deposits grew by 6% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis, with strong growth in transaction accounts. Wholesale funding fell by another $2 billion sequentially and $15 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our liquidity position remains very strong. Core deposits continue to fund 100% of our loan portfolio. 
And last was lower non-provision credit costs. Compared with last quarter, credit costs recognized through fee income and operating expenses were down $11 million and totaled $92 million. Gains on loan sales offset increased mortgage repurchase expense and we experienced improvement in OREO expense, losses on OREO sales and work out in collection costs. 
With that context, let's go through the balance sheet in more detail. Average earning assets were up about 2% compared with last quarter but were down 3% on a year-over-year basis. This trend continues to be driven by weak loan demand, particularly on the commercial side. 
During the quarter, we adopted FAS 167, which increased earning assets by $1.3 billion on a net basis. In terms of the balance sheet geography of that, this reduced available-for-sale securities by $1 billion, while on the loan side, it increased C&I loans by about $700 million, auto loans by $1.2 billion and home equity loans by $300 million. 
Loan balances were down slightly, net of the impact of FAS 167, although we've seen a notable deceleration in the rate of decline. And we currently expect that to turn positive as 2010 progresses. As Kevin noted, commercial line utilization remained consistent with fourth quarter after four quarters of consecutive declines. Right now, we'd expect loan balances to be relatively stable in the second quarter but to see some modest growth in the second half of the year, as business investment and working capital needs begin to reflect economic trends.
Average commercial loans were flat compared to the fourth quarter, with the effect of charge-offs and weak loan demand offsetting the impact of FAS 167. Average consumer loans increased 3% sequentially, although they were down 1% compared with a year ago. 
Auto loan balances increased 14% from last quarter and 17% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of consolidation, balances were up about $100 million sequentially. Credit card balances were down 2% on a sequential basis and up 6% year-over-year. Home equity loans were flat sequentially and down 3% on a year-over-year basis. And residential mortgages were down 7% from the fourth quarter and 13% from a year ago, as we continue to sell most of our new production. Flow sales during the quarter were $3.3 billion. 
Average securities increased by $1.7 billion during the quarter, driven by excess liquidity. Short-term investments primarily held at the Fed, increased an average of $2 billion. The remaining $300 million decrease in securities reflected the consolidation of our off-balance sheet conduits and the reduction in variable rate demand notes, which combined to reduce securities by about $1 billion. That more than offset the full quarter effect of mortgage-backed securities that were purchased in the fourth quarter. 
Now moving on to deposits. We saw continued strong deposit momentum this quarter with a continued positive mix-shift toward lower cost deposits. Average core deposit growth was 6% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Transaction account balance growth remained strong. DDA balances were up 4% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, while interest checking deposits increased 20% from last quarter and 37% on a year-over-year basis. 
Retail core deposits increased 1% sequentially and increased 3% year-over-year. Our net new account production was double the level we've seen in the first quarter of 2009 and was driven by our new relationship savings product that provides greater value based on the depth of the relationship a customer has at Fifth Third. We also saw a 3% sequential growth in average retail deposit account balances, which is atypical for the first quarter and is driven by the migration of our deposit book from products like free checking, in the more relationship-oriented products, as well as higher consumer savings levels overall nationally. 
Total commercial core deposits were up 20% sequentially and 46% from a year ago. Growth has been driven primarily by higher average balances, which reflects cautiousness and excess liquidity among our customers. Commercial DDAs increased 8% from the fourth quarter and 46% year-over-year, while commercial interest checking increased 39% sequentially and 89% from last year. 
As we noted last quarter, public fund balances have driven the significant amount of recent growth. We expect core deposits in the second quarter to be consistent with the first quarter as additional growth is offset by the effective federal tax payments and lower public funds balances after tax season. 
Let me make a few comments on FTPS. As of the beginning of the year, the majority of FTPS employees were officially transitioned to the joint venture and off of our payroll. That drove a reduction in transition services agreement, or TSA revenue, as expected, from $39 million last quarter to $13 million this quarter and that's recorded in other non-interest income in the income statement. That revenue covered costs of a similar amount that we incur each quarter to provide those services to the processing JV. That $13 million number is probably a good quarterly run rate for the rest of 2010. 
Finally, we recognized equity method income of $5 million related to our 49% interest in the joint venture through the other income line item which compares with about $8 million last quarter. 
Now moving on to the income statement starting with net interest income. NII on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $19 million sequentially to $901 million. We continue to see the benefit of a shift toward lower cost deposits, as well as wider loan spreads. The total cost of interest-bearing liability fell 10 basis points sequentially, while average loan and lease yields expanded 10 basis points. The adoption of FAS 167 also contributed about $10 million to net interest income as we expected. 
Net interest margin increased eight basis points to 3.63%, driven by the factors I just outlined, with the consolidation of assets having no real meaningful impact on yield. 
Second quarter NII and NIM will be negatively affected by premium amortization on delinquent mortgage securities repurchased by Fannie May. That one-time negative impact to the second quarter is about $10 million to NII and four basis points to NIM. Despite that, we currently expect second quarter NII and NIM to be consistent with the first quarter, or perhaps up modestly. We currently expect NII and NIM trends to remain favorable in the second half of the year. 
Moving on to fees. First quarter non-interest income was $627 million, down $24 million from last quarter but significantly better than we expected. Results reflected three items that I want to comment on. First, as I noted, TSA revenue was $13 million this quarter versus $39 million last quarter due to the year-end transfer of employees to the JV. Second, we had a $2 million negative valuation adjustment on our warrants and FTPS and that compares with a $20 million gain on that same item last quarter. And third, we had a $9 million negative valuation adjustment on the total return swap related to estimated Visa litigation expense. And that swap was part of the sale of our Visa shares last summer. 
Those items add up to a negative swing of $57 million between quarters. Excluding those factors, fee income was up $33 million or 6% with negative effects of seasonality more than offset by higher mortgage banking revenue and lower credit related costs realized in non-interest income. 
Corporate banking revenue of $81 million was down $8 million from the fourth quarter or 8% sequentially, as we expected. Results in this line are correlated with commercial loan origination volume, which has been weak. We expect modest growth in the second quarter in this area. Positive service charges were down 11% from the fourth quarter and 3% from a year ago. Commercial deposit fees were down $4 million, and consumer deposit fees were down $13 million on a sequential basis. About half of the decline in consumer fees was related to seasonality with the remainder due to lower overdraft activity. 
Last quarter, we stopped charging for overdrafts under $5, and this the first full quarter of the impact from that change. We would expect normal positive seasonality, as well as additional account growth, to drive an increase in consumer service charges in the second quarter, perhaps $10 million to $15 million or so. 
One event on the horizon for the industry is the upcoming change to overdraft charges or Reg E. It's difficult to estimate the effect of this change, given that they depend on future customer choices and behavior, but let me take a stab at it. We currently estimate the impact of Reg E to be about $20 million per quarter, with about $10 million to $15 million of that being realized in the third quarter and then the full run rate of $20 million impact in the fourth quarter. 
We've been proactive in developing deposit products that generate alternative revenue streams through voluntary customer adoption, which we think is preferable to both us and to our customers. We've had a lot of success in fee-based bundled products like our secure checking and rewards checking products. We also believe that a number of our customers will elect to set up overdraft protection by linking their checking account to a savings account, credit card or home-equity line. 
We've seen this on the horizon for a while. We were one of the first banks to stop offering a totally free checking account and we've absorbed some of the impact of that already. And we work continually to proactively develop new value-added products to help mitigate the impact of these developments. 
Investment advisory revenue increased 5% sequentially and 14% on a year-over-year basis. Recent market performance has benefited the trust, asset management and brokerage groups. The first quarter also benefit seasonally from trust tax preparation fees, and thus we expect this line item to be relatively flat in the second quarter. Card and processing fee income was down modestly on a sequential basis, coming in at $73 million for the quarter, which compares to $76 million last quarter. That was a good result given the seasonality we experienced in the first quarter of every year. 
Net mortgage revenue of $152 million was up $20 million from last quarter. That included the benefit of gains on MSR hedges of $51 million. Right now, we expect net mortgage banking revenue to decline by $25 million or so in the second quarter. 
Now this is probably the fourth or fifth straight quarter we've predicted lower mortgage banking revenue, but I've decided that I'm going to keep saying it until I'm right, so that's our guidance again this quarter. 
Credit-related costs reported in fee income were just $1 million for the first quarter, down from $30 million last quarter. The biggest driver of the improvement was $25 million in gains on loan sales. Next quarter, we'd expect to those costs closer to $25 million, which is primarily the ongoing effect of losses on OREO sales. As a result, we expect a line item, other non-interest income, to be about $25 million lower in the second quarter than the first. This line can move around some, but that's our current expectation. 
We currently expect fee income in the second quarter to be about $600 million, give or take. We expect this sequential decline to be driven primarily by lower mortgage banking revenue and higher credit cost realized in fee income, but that should be partially offset by a generally stronger quarter from a seasonality perspective. 
Turning to expenses. Non-interest expense of $956 million was down $11 million or 1% sequentially. On the positive side, TSA expenses were down $26 million, and litigation expenses were down $18 million. On the negative side, FICA and unemployment benefits expense was up $16 million seasonally and credit-related expenses were up $18 million. Net of those items, non-interest expenses were flat. 
In the first quarter, credit-related costs within operating expenses were $91 million compared with $73 million last quarter. The increase was driven by higher expenses related to mortgage repurchases, $39 million this quarter compared with $18 million last quarter. I would note that the majority of that expense was related to a repurchase reserve build. Actual realized repurchase losses were consistent at $13 million this quarter versus $14 million last quarter. We would expect the repurchase of the expense to be about half of that $39 million level next quarter, maybe something in the $20 million range. And for total credit related cost recognized in expense to be down $20 million to $25 million as a consequence. 
Along with the industry, we've seen an increase in mortgage repurchase requests in the past couple of quarters. File request trends seem to be stabilizing, and while we currently expect demands for repurchases to remain at an elevated level, that file request activity trend suggests that demands and realized losses in the near term should be generally consistent with first quarter levels. Total repurchase reserves are about $80 million against losses realized in the first quarter of $13 million, so we think we're in pretty good shape here. 
In terms of overall expense expectations for the second quarter, we expect non-interest expense to be down $10 million to $15 million driven by lower benefits expense and lower credit-related costs, partially offset by the ongoing effect of investments and strategic initiatives. 
Let me stop for a moment and just do a quick recap of PPNR. Reported pretax pre-provision earnings were $568 million in the first quarter. Our current expectation is that second quarter PPNR will be consistent with the first quarter, with mortgage banking revenue down about $25 million, but with that being offset by growth in NII and other fee income lines as well as lower expenses. 
Let me spend just a minute on taxes. At our current level of earnings, which are very close zero, it could be difficult to estimate the expected tax rate. Given the effect of our tax credits, which we estimate to be about $125 million a year, we expect our full year tax rate to be below 10% and the second quarter should be in that ballpark as well. The first quarter tax rate was 53%, but that rate is not very meaningful given the level of our earnings is so close to breakeven. 
Now moving on to capital. Our quarter-end capital ratios remain strong. The TCE ratio was 6.4%, excluding $288 million of unrealized securities gains on an after-tax basis. Tier I common equity was 7%, and Tier I capital was 13.4%. I'd note that the implementation of FAS 167 led to a $77 million charge to equity this quarter. We currently anticipate that these capital ratios would be stable to modestly higher in the second quarter, depending on asset growth. I think with that, we'll open it up for questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre with Bernstein."

Those methodologies are generally more backward looking, they're based on historical results, tempered somewhat perhaps by recent trends. But we're not permitted, under generally accepted accounting principles, to bake into our allowance forecast. A lot of expectations about what future developments might be in the economy or for our customers and portfolio.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'll make some opening comments and then hand the call over to Dan and Mary for a more detailed discussion of our financial and credit performance.

I'll make some opening comments and then hand the call over to Dan and Mary for a more detailed discussion of our financial and credit performance. We also developed a presentation this quarter to facilitate that discussion, which we hope you find helpful. 
Obviously, this quarter marks an important turning point for us. Although the first quarter's loss was very small, it's still a loss. For the second quarter, we reported significantly stronger results, particularly from a credit standpoint. That resulted in a profit of $192 million to the $130 million or $0.16 per common shareholder. 
The environment remains challenging, but I'm pleased with the progress we've demonstrated in both credit trends and continued strong operating metrics. We've seen fairly sharp improvements in credit results, which I believe is the result of our aggressive actions earlier in the cycle. And while the pace of that improvement is obviously not sustainable, we do believe that credit should trend favorably as we move forward. 
Now taking a look at a few trends in credit. We saw a very significant move in charge-offs this quarter, down 25% or $148 million from last quarter to $434 million. That was better than expected, and it's the lowest level of charge-offs we've seen since the second quarter of 2008. 
Charge-offs peaked in the third quarter of last year at $756 million. We've seen a reduction of over 40% in just three quarters. NPAs were down $160 million or 5% sequentially, and NPLs were down 7%. Delinquent loans, 90 days past due, were down another $39 million or 9%. So problem loan levels had loss content had both moved solidly in the right direction, and this contributed to a reduction in loan loss reserves. Still, our reserve position remains very strong at 4.85% of loans, and with coverage actually improving to 146% of NPLs and over 2x annualized charge-offs. 
Looking forward to the third quarter, given the size of the decline in charge-offs we just saw and have seen in the past several quarters, it'll probably be difficult to beat the second quarter charge-off level. Right now, our expectation would be for charge-offs to be stable to a bit higher in the third quarter. We're probably looking at net charge-offs of something like $450 million, plus or minus $10 million or $15 million. 
Commercial will probably up modestly, and consumer losses should be flat or down a little. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be significantly lower in the second half of the year than the first half of 2010, and for them generally to follow a stable-to-declining trend line. NPAs and delinquencies have declined recently, and we expect those to slowly improve over time. We don't currently expect a significant move one way or the other in the third quarter. And finally, we would expect the reserve to continue to come down based upon our current views for credit trends in the economic environment. 
I want to give some high-level operating results. Pre-provision net revenue of $567 million was consistent with that reported last quarter and was in line with expectations, reflecting better-than-expected fee income results and lower expenses. That was partially offset by lower net interest income resulting from weaker-than-expected loan demand and the decline in market interest rates.
Fee income results were strong, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue as expected. Total non-interest income was down 1% sequentially. Corporate banking revenue, and card and processing revenue both showed mid-teens growth. Average core deposits were up 1% sequentially and 12% over 2009 levels. That included $1.8 billion in runoff of public funds deposits, without significant other relationship aspects, as expected. We'll continue to focus on gathering households and long-term core funding. And we'll continue to manage our balance sheet and funding by minimizing our high cost non-relationship deposits. 
Average loans were down 2% from last quarter. We came into the quarter expecting better results than that, but commercial borrowers became more cautious as the European crisis developed and the U.S. equity markets declined in the middle part of the quarter. Loan production was up from last quarter, and we continue to gain market share. However, that was more than offset by higher-than-expected prepayment levels as companies continue to de-leverage and defer investments. 
Line utilization hasn't increased, but it did remain stable. The economy seemed to take a pause during the quarter, still growing, but perhaps less than expected a quarter ago, and borrowers have reacted to that. Expenses were down $21 million from last quarter as expected, driven by a lower credit-related cost and lower FICA. 
We continue to invest in the business for the long-term, which you can see in our FTE growth. Our strategic plan is focused on improving our core franchise and strengthening our financial performance as we move through the end of the cycle. Our strategic initiatives are focused on continuing to improve the customer experience at Fifth Third, which will result in deeper customer relationships and improved retention. This includes the rollout of new products, like the Relationship Savings product and other new product bundles such as our Secure Checking package, but also includes additional investments in our sales force. 
Since September of last year, we've added almost 200 personal bankers to our high-traffic branches. We have expanded our branch hours on weeknights and weekends at most locations, which has continued to improve customer service levels. We hired 125 new business banking officers and five affiliate market pilots, with an expanded small business banking sales force focused on customers in the $1 million to $3 million revenue channel. 
We plan to open a number of new branches in the second half of 2010, as we selectively refresh and add to our network to improve our presence and delivery in those markets. We brought in several commercial loan teams from competitors in recent months, which we expect to better position us long term in key markets. We've seen early positive impact from these initiatives, specifically in better deposit account production, deposit balance growth for both new and existing customers and solid loan production, which is helping to offset weak loan demand otherwise. 
We think that the right step to take for our future, although it will take some time and a better environment to see the payoff. We'll keep a close eye on the performance of these initiatives in the economy, and we'll dial them up or back as appropriate. 
We still see a lot of opportunity in our markets today, and our sales force continues to do a good job winning new business and clients throughout our footprint. My expectation is that this should continue, particularly as we add value to services and products. Dan and Mary will talk about our outlook in more detail. But we expect bottom-line results to remain favorable in the third quarter and as we continue the organic growth in capital.
Our return to profitability is a major step of the progress of the company as of the events of the past couple of years. I'd like to thank Fifth Third's employees for their focus and dedication in helping us turn the corner on our credit issues and for staying focused on our customer relationships. The quality of work they've done has been fantastic and has enabled us to produce these solid results. 
Our fee income businesses are performing well, and expenses remain well controlled. Despite that, market developments during the quarter, particularly in Europe and the U.S. equity markets resulted in some moderation of economic expectations at higher levels of caution among potential borrowers. We hope that greater certainty around legislative and regulatory developments and the general direction of the economy will begin to more fully translate into customer comfort with borrowing and investing in their businesses again. 
Then I'll walk through some of the key features of financial reform legislation, the way we believe some of its elements may affect us, and some of the things we expect to do in response. We're good businesspeople. And while this will certainly presents some challenges as we adapt, we believe it'll be manageable. I really do think that the net result of these developments, most of which are supposed to be addressed toward reducing systemic risk, will play the Fifth Third's strengths. I've noted that we saw no key business at Fifth Third impaired or eliminated by the crisis. By the same token, there are no key businesses that are eliminated for us through financial reform. 
Business activity is fairly sluggish right now, but our balance sheet and expense base are under leverage relative to what they can support, as things improve, as they will. We'll have to adopt to new costs and ways of doing business, but they're consistent with the ways we've always tried to do business. And I expect us to be a winner as we move ahead. With that let me turn it over to Dan to discuss operating results. Dan?"
270961,107907357,68583,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. As Kevin discussed, we've seen positive trends on both the credit and the operational fronts. And I'd like to spend some time discussing our performance in a little more detail.  Overall, we're very pleased with the results for the quarter.",3402,"Thanks, Kevin. As Kevin discussed, we've seen positive trends on both the credit and the operational fronts. And I'd like to spend some time discussing our performance in a little more detail.  Overall, we're very pleased with the results for the quarter. Fee results were significantly better than anticipated, offset somewhat by lower-than-expected net interest income due to weak loan growth on higher-than-expected cash balances. 
Turning to the presentation, Page 3 just summarizes the quarter for you. So if you'll turn to Slide 4, I'll start there.  In the second quarter, we reported net income of $192 million and paid preferred dividends of $62 million, which resulted in a $130 million net income on an available per common share basis, which is $0.16 per share. PPNR is $567 million, consistent with strong first quarter levels. The reduction on our net charge-offs and the overall stabilization and improvement of credit trends contributed to a reduction in the loan loss allowance of $109 million. 
Let me start with NII, which is shown on Slide 5.  Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased $14 million sequentially to $887 million, while net interest margin decreased six basis points to 3.57%. The decrease in NII was primarily balance-sheet-driven. 
Loans during the quarter were lower than we expected, particularly from mid-quarter on. Commercial customers are also holding record levels of cash, as the euro's own crisis and domestic policy uncertainty have led them to adopt or maintain a cautious posture. 
Long-term investment securities were also lower than expected. We didn't reinvest portfolio cash flows, which were elevated by the pick up in prepayments during the quarter driven by GSE [government-sponsored entities] buyouts of delinquent loans at the mortgage-backed securities, which also resulted in higher premium amortization. These factors led to an increase in excess liquidity, where obviously, we're not earning much right now. This was partially offset by the benefit of deposit mix shift in CD repricing as well as wider LIBOR spreads during the quarter and impact of day count. 
Net interest margin benefited from lower deposit rates as our mix continued to shift to lower cost deposits. But that was largely offset by the drag created by low-yielding excess liquidity. Outside of those factors, the six basis point decline was largely attributable to increased premium amortization, resulting mainly from the impact of GSE repurchases, as well as day count and a reduction in purchase accounting accretion. 
With that context, I'm turning to Slide 6. Let's go through the balance sheet in a little more detail.  Average earning assets were down about $1 billion sequentially or 1%. Taxable investment securities balances declined about $800 million on a sequential basis. We defer reinvestment of cash flows, as we were concerned about the impact of the termination of the Fed's mortgage-backed securities purchase program. 
We continue to be very careful about managing the interest rate risk profile of our balance sheet. Although maintaining a neutral position in this environment, co-assessing current period earnings, we believe that posture will serve us better with respect to long-term earnings quality and growth.  Average total loan balances were down 2% sequentially. 
While we would like to see better net results, we are pleased with our core production. We've always been a C&I-focused lender. And we are growing share in seeing good business opportunities there. We're also growing our customer base. And while pay downs and de-leveraging continue, we know it will turn around, and we will benefit from better activity and growth. 
Average commercial loans were down 2% from last quarter, driven primarily by a 15% sequential decline in commercial construction loans. Loan production was up significantly from the first quarter, but paydowns also increased. 
Let me make a few comments on specific components of the commercial portfolio. We suspended new homebuilder and non-owner occupied loan several years ago, and we expect runoff in those portfolios to continue. Commercial mortgage balances were flat sequentially, and we'd expect those balances to drift down in the near term as well. 
We also have lower CRE concentrations than most of our peers, so we do have some capacity. However, our appetite there will remain limited in the near term, as we wait for the absorption of overcapacity to take place. C&I loans were flat sequentially, whereas, we'd seen declines in the previous five quarters. So that was a positive development. 
Period and line utilization was 32.1% this quarter compared with 32.6% and 32.7% in the previous two quarters, so still fairly stable there. But that is down from about 39% a year ago and from normal levels in the low to mid-40s. Average consumer loans decreased 2% from the first quarter. Auto loan balances were flat sequentially, but we would expect some modest growth in the auto loan portfolio in the third quarter. 
Credit card balances were down 4% from the first quarter and flat year-over-year. Home equity loans were down 2% sequentially and 4% from a year ago. Residential mortgages were down 2% from the first quarter and 10% from last year, as we continue to sell most of our new production. Deliveries during the quarter were $3.1 billion.
Looking forward, it's somewhat difficult to predict borrower behavior in this environment. Our loan pipelines remain intact and are building, indicating that there's interest in investment, but borrowers are watching and waiting and are willing to defer borrowing decisions. Continued economic growth will require further capital investments and working capital financing.  So to see continued economic growth, we believe the companies will need to start borrowing. 
We're seeing reasonable stability in loan balances, which is better than the industry trend. C&I loans and line utilization were relatively flat during the quarter, as were most consumer-owned categories. Looking ahead, we would expect C&I loans to be fairly stable in the third quarter and auto loan balances to be up slightly. Mortgage balances should be flat to down, reflecting our sales strategy. Commercial real estate loans will continue to decline in the near term due to lack of demand and tighter lending standards. 
For us, all that adds up to an expectation that loans will be relatively flat next quarter or perhaps down modestly. Our best guess currently is that the economy has enough momentum to start to generate some additional borrowing in the near term. We've been close enough to flat, that it wouldn't take much in the way of increased originations or lower repayments to tip that balance. 
Moving on to deposits. Average core deposits were up 1% on a sequential basis and up 12% year-over-year. Consumer CDs included in core deposits declined 6% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. Excluding those consumer CDs, transaction deposits were up 2% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. The main driver there was demand deposits, which were up 3% from last quarter and 16% from a year ago. 
Retail transaction deposits increased 5% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. We continue to have great success with our Relationship Savings product, which has now attracted over $6 billion of balances since inception. In total, net new account production increased 22% sequentially and 56% on a year-over-year basis. 
Total commercial transaction deposits were down 2% from last quarter and up 41% from a year ago.  Excluding public funds balances, average commercial transaction deposits increased 8% sequentially and 46% from a year ago, reflecting excess liquidity among commercial customers and good account production. 
Average public funds balances were down about $1.8 billion sequentially, as we adjusted our pricing due to our excess liquidity position. We expect public funds balances to continue to run down as we manage our non-relationship account pricing given our liquidity in the current environment for investing that liquidity. As a result, we'd expect deposit balances to be lower in the third quarter.  
Overall, the number of commercial deposit accounts is up and average balances per account are up as well. 
With that background, our outlook for third quarter NII is for growth of $10 million to $20 million to the $900 million range. We'd expect that to be driven by loan balances that are stable to modestly lower, CD run off, continued deposit pricing discipline and lower premium amortization expense. 
Turning to NIM. We expect NIM to increase in the third quarter. But how much, depends on the composition of our balance sheet. As you know, NIMs in the industry right now are highly sensitive to the levels of liquidity. We currently expect our third quarter NIM to increase 10 to 15 basis points or so to around 370 basis points, plus or minus a few basis points. The increases is expected to be driven by lower excess liquidity, primarily from public funds deposit runoff, which is grossing up the balance sheet without really producing any NII. Those drivers should be in place in the fourth quarter as well, although NIM improvement likely won't be significant as in the third quarter. 
Moving on to fees, as outlined on Slide 7. Second quarter non-interest income was $620 million, down $7 million from last quarter but better than the $25 million decline we expected. Mortgage banking net revenue was down $38 million, a little more than our outlook. The key driver of this sequential decline was the net positive MSR valuation adjustment of $51 million last quarter. 
Fee income this quarter also benefited $10 million in gains on the FTPS warrants and puts. Last quarter, we had $11 million in losses on the warrants and the total return swap related to Visa litigation. If you exclude those items, fees were up $27 million, and we're pleased with that. 
Payment processing revenue was $84 million, up $11 million from last quarter, which was driven by higher transaction volumes. That reflects some seasonality but was better than we expected off a pretty good first quarter result. We expect similar levels of processing revenue in the third quarter. Deposit and service charges increased 5% sequentially. Commercial deposit fees were relatively flat, while consumer deposit fees increased $8 million from the first quarter. 
As you know, Reg E [Regulation E] went into effect for all new accounts in July and will go into effect for existing accounts in August. So far, we're seeing opt-in rates in line with our expectations. And we still feel that a $20 million quarterly run rate effect is a good estimate. 
We expect third quarter deposit fees to be down about $5 million, with $10 million to $15 million in decline in electronic overdraft charges, partially being offset by growth in commercial and other consumer account service fees. And then we would expect another $5 million to $10 million drop in electronic overdraft charges in the fourth quarter. 
We've been proactive in developing deposit products that generate alternative revenue streams. We've eliminated free checking unless a customer has a sizable direct deposit or a minimum account balance. And revenue from alternative products will also mitigate these changes over time. 
Investment advisory revenue decreased 4% sequentially but increased 10% on a year-over-year basis. The sequential decline is attributable to a seasonal benefit from tax preparation fees that occurs in the first quarter and the affect of lower asset values during the second quarter. We're expecting modest investment advisory revenue growth in the third quarter. 
Corporate banking revenue of $93 million was up $12 million or 14% from the first quarter. The sequential growth reflected strong syndication in lease re-marketing fees and higher FX and institutional sales revenue, partially offset by declines in business lending fees and interest rate derivatives revenue. We're not likely to match that level of revenue in the third quarter, which is typically seasonally soft. And we expect corporate banking revenue to be lower by about $5 million or so in the third quarter. 
Mortgage banking revenue, as I mentioned, was down $38 million. The MSR hedge and valuation adjustments produced revenue of $51 million in the first quarter compared to a $4 million negative adjustment this quarter. Gains on sales were $89 million this quarter versus $70 million last quarter due to the affect of rates on refinancing activity, as well as the expiration of tax credits on new home purchases. We expect third quarter mortgage revenue to be strong as well, given that deliveries of second quarter applications and the current rate environment, up perhaps $10 million to $15 million. 
Within other income, credit-related costs recorded in fee income were $14 million in the second quarter, up from $1 million in the first. That was better than expected in April, primarily due to lower negative valuation adjustments on loans held for sale and lower losses on sales of OREO properties. We currently expect higher credit-related cost to impact non-interest income in the third quarter, with our current estimate being about $25 million. 
We recorded equity income of $6 million from our interest in the processing JV in the quarter compared with $5 million last quarter. Revenue from the transition services agreement was $13 million during the quarter, the same level as last quarter, and those offset similar amounts of expenses. 
As I mentioned earlier, we had $10 million in positive marks on FTPS warrants and puts. Last quarter, those marks were a negative $2 million, and we also had a mark in the first quarter on the Visa total return swap, which was a negative $9 million. We are projecting a repeat of this quarter's warrant benefit in the third quarter. 
Overall, we currently expect fee income in the third quarter to be down about $20 million to $25 million to somewhere around the $600 million range or just below it. And that includes the initial Reg E impact that I talked about earlier.
Turning now to expenses on Slide 8. Non-interest expense of $935 million was down $21 million or 2% sequentially. In the second quarter, credit-related cost within operating expense declined to $55 million from $91 million last quarter. The improvement came from lower mortgage repurchase expense, which was $18 million down from $39 million in the first quarter. 
We currently expect credit-related operating expenses to be relatively flat in the third quarter, with about $20 million or so in mortgage repurchase expense.  In total, we expect third quarter expenses to be relatively stable compared with the $935 million we just reported. 
A quick recap of PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $567 million in the second quarter, consistent with the $568 million reported last quarter. Our current expectation is that third quarter PPNR will be down slightly but remain in the $560 million range. 
We'll see in the release that the effective tax rate this quarter was about 20%. That's a bit higher than we expected last quarter. The upward adjustment was really just driven by higher earnings than we had previously expected, both for the quarter and for the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to capital on Slide 9. Our capital levels remain very strong. Tangible common equity was 6.55%, an 18 basis point improvement from the end of the first quarter. That ratio, the way we calculated, excludes unrealized securities gains, which totaled about $440 million. TCE was 6.9%, including those unrealized gains. Tier 1 common increased about 25 basis points to 7.22% and the Tier 1 ratio increased 35 basis points to 13.75%, while the total capital ratio increased 56 basis points to 18.11%. We'd expect those ratios to continue to grow with ongoing profitability.
Regarding TARP, I don't really have any updates on TARP repayment. Obviously, our results are progressing more favorably than we expected, and we're building capital. We'll have discussions with the regulators as we move forward. Our aim is a result that is anchored to an appropriate level and composition of capital, and that makes sense for us and our shareholders, as well as the regulators. 
We said that we thought a resolution in the second half of 2010 seemed reasonable, and that remains the case. That said, we are willing to be patient. We believe that continued clarity on our results through continued positive trends and on future capital requirements, through Basel III and other regulatory developments, will provide us and the regulators with a better sense of what is an appropriate repayment plan. 
Finally, turning to Slide 10. The President just signed the financial reform legislation yesterday, and we've outlined some of the key provisions here. Obviously, this is not an exhaustive list of all the elements of the reformed bill or their potential impacts, especially given that most of the regulations to implement this law yet to be written. But I do want to highlight two elements in my remarks here. 
One of the more significant potential issues, at least from a direct financial standpoint, is the debit interchange piece. Under the legislation, the Fed is to study the cause of providing debit services and then set rates that are reasonable and proportional to these costs. Obviously, we don't know, and no one knows, what those costs will include or what reasonable and proportional will mean. 
We obviously expect rates to come down, that's what the legislation intends. But we don't have any evidence of that, for example, they will set rates where banks actually lose money providing debit card services. That's what pricing at marginal cost would do, and that certainly wouldn't seem reasonable and proportional. No one  would benefit from that kind of disruption in the debit services that, that would cause. Not us, not consumers, not even major retailers. 
The Fed's study will highlight the pros and cons of the legislation, which will be used in determining the appropriate interchange rates. Until all that takes place, we don't really know what we're dealing with. We've disclosed our interchange revenue and also the part that's related to debit, which is shown on Slide 10. 
Every 10 basis points reduction in interchange rates would cost us about $15 million annually. And now, that's before any steps that we would take in mitigation. And we do believe that much of this could be mitigated overtime, as we and our customers adapt to whatever rules are written. 
Another element of the bill is the Collins amendment, which calls for the phasing out of the trust preferred securities as a qualifying source of Tier 1 capital. We currently have about 280 basis points of trust preferreds within our Tier 1 capital structure. Excluding TARP, total non-common Tier 1 capital at Fifth Third is about 320 basis points. 
Given the evolution in capital standards and expectations for higher common capital levels, that may be more than we need long-term in terms of non-common tier 1. We'll adjust our capital structure over time as the new operating rules become clear. We are comfortable with our ability to manage this change in a way that we don't really expect to be that costly or disruptive, so that in the end, we have a mix of common and non-common capital that is appropriate under the new standards. We do have a healthy capital position and a fairly long phase-in period for the trust preferred rules. 
Turning now to Slide 11. As I noted earlier, a lot of financial reform is aimed at reducing or eliminating activities that aren't related to traditional banking. Activities that are inherently volatile and that creates systemic interconnections across financial companies and across borders. Fifth Third has a traditional banking model that includes very few of those activities or a very small scales. To cite one fact that I think is pretty telling, our daily VaR or Value at Risk is less than $500,000. That's because we just don't conduct the kinds of trading activities that are targeted by the legislation. 
There are any number of more qualitative aspects of the bill, and I can't begin to forecast how all of those will play out. The new Consumer Financial Protection Agency and the way the new preemption rules will work are both major unknowns at this point. That being said, we've never originated so-called exotic consumer loans, like option arms or some prime mortgages. We aim to provide good products and services that are relatively straightforward and had a fair price, which is what the legislation is supposed to ensure. As we develop more clarity on all these issues, we will continue to share our thoughts with you. 
That wraps up my remarks. I will turn it over to Mary to discuss credit trends and results. Mary?"

Overall, credit results continue to show broad-based improvement. I'll get started with charge-offs on Slide 12. 
Total net charge-offs of $434 million, decreased $148 million sequentially, with commercial charge-offs, accounting for $117 million of the improvement. Losses in Florida were significantly lower than in the first quarter. And losses in Michigan continue to show stabilization, with charge-offs relatively flat versus our first quarter and fourth quarter levels. 
Commercial net charge-offs for $225 million, down $117 million. Florida and Michigan accounted for $42 million of the decline. C&I net losses this quarter totaled $104 million, down $57 million, with a sequential decline attributable to a broad base of industry segments. C&I losses in Michigan and Florida fell $20 million sequentially. 
Commercial mortgage and commercial construction losses both showed significant improvements this quarter, which reflects several factors: First, the impact of this extension of non-owner-occupied commercial real estate in homebuilder lending two or three years ago; second, we've we burned through a lot of our more significant problems by dealing with problem credits aggressively during the cycle; finally, lost severities, in general, have also improved with greater economic stability and more liquid markets. 
Commercial mortgage net charge-offs of $78 million, decreased $21 million from last quarter. Commercial construction net charge-offs for $43 million, down $35 million.  I'd note that our commercial construction balances are down over 50% since this time two years ago, as we reduced balances and the risks in that portfolio. 
Across both commercial real estate portfolios, Michigan and Florida represented $20 million of the improvement but still produced 52% of losses. Total homebuilder, developer losses were $48 million, down $33 million from last quarter. You'll recall that we suspended homebuilder originations over two years ago, have already recorded significant charge-offs against that portfolio and have worked to reduce our exposure.
Portfolio balances declined $117 million sequentially to $1.2 billion, which compares with the peak balance of $3.3 billion back in mid-2008. We continue to expect losses from this portfolio to generally decline over time. 
Given the fairly dramatic decrease in commercial charge-offs seen over the past three quarters, we currently expect commercial net charge-offs to be flat to up modestly, given our outperformance this quarter and a fairly stable outlook for trends. 
As you know, the results of industry exam are also provided to banks in the third quarter. Based on our own exam, beyond the more stable credit environment during industry exam, we don't have any reason to expect any negative surprises and haven't assumed any in our outlook. Our outlook does include our own assessment of all portfolio credits, including mix agented by other banks. 
Turning to the consumer portfolio. Net charge-offs of $209 million were down $31 million or 13% compared with the prior quarter. Net charge-offs in the residential mortgage portfolio were $85 million, a $3 million sequential decline. This reflected improving early stage delinquencies seen late last year and through this year. 
Home equity losses decreased $12 million sequentially to $61 million, which included $24 million of losses in the brokered portfolio. The net charge-off rate on brokered home equity was about 5.3% annualized, which is down from earlier peak, but it's still almost 4x the loss rate on our branch originated book. The brokered equity portfolio is $1.8 billion, down from about $3.5 billion a couple of years ago, and continues to run off. We saw improvement in both auto and credit card charge-offs as well, with auto losses falling $11 million or 36% sequentially to $20 million. This is largely due to better values received at auction, underwriting improvements and seasonality. Credit card losses decreased to $2 million or 5% sequentially to $42 million. We expect consumer losses to trend down slightly in the third quarter.
Now, moving to NPAs on Slide 13. NPAs, including held for sale, totaled $3.1 billion at quarter end, down $236 million or 7% from the first quarter. Portfolio NPAs, excluding held for sale, totaled $3 billion, down $160 million or 5%. Nonperforming loans were down over $200 million sequentially over a 7% decline, while OREO was up about $48 million, largely commercial OREO. Overall, Florida and Michigan remained our most challenged geographies from an NPAs standpoint and accounted for 46% of NPAs in the portfolio, although NPAs in those two states were down $51 million sequentially. Portfolio commercial NPAs were $2.3 billion, and declined $140 million from the first quarter, which was frankly better than we are expecting. Improvement in the commercial construction portfolio was the biggest driver, with NPAs down $87 million or 15%. This follows the drop last quarter of $138 million. Lower NPAs in Florida and Michigan accounted for almost half the decline. Commercial mortgage NPAs were down $47 million, with improvement broad-based across the entire footprint.
C&I NPAs were stable, up $4 million from the first quarter. Across the commercial portfolios, residential builder and developer NPAs are $431 million or down $90 million sequentially, and represented about 19% of total commercial NPAs. Within NPAs, commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status increased to $48 million from $39 million last quarter. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans where it makes good economic sense for the bank.
We currently expect commercial NPAs to remain relatively stable in the third quarter. We saw pretty significant improvement in delinquencies overall during the quarter, which I'll talk about in a minute, and so we're pleased with the overall trend. 
On the consumer side, NPAs totaled $695 million at the end of the quarter, a decrease of $20 million or 3% from the first quarter. Nonaccrual consumer TDRs declined $25 million, with the remainder of the consumer NPA portfolio increasing $5 million. Residential mortgage NPAs increased $28 million during the quarter to $549 million, with TDRs up $11 million sequentially. That did include the effect of a change in our recognition of mortgage NPAs from after 150 days to 150 days, which brought a month of NPAs into the second quarter. This addresses the monthly day count issue, that you'll recall last year, caused the swing or increase in NPAs from the second to third quarter. Home equity NPAs totaled $65 million at the end of the second quarter, down $5 million from first quarter levels. Auto NPAs were down $5 million, and credit card NPAs were down $37 million with the improvement in the card portfolio attributable to TDR's return to performing status.
We expect third quarter consumer NPAs to be stable with the second quarter. Consumer NPA trends should continue to reflect the seasoning of more recent TDRs as well as the favorable delinquency in migration trends we've been seeing.
Turning to Slide 14. We've provided some data on our consumer troubled debt restructurings. We have $1.8 billion of TDRs on the books as of June 30, of which $1.6 billion were accruing loans and $246 million were nonaccrual. Of the $1.6 billion of accruing TDRs, $1.4 billion were current. And of current loans, over $1 billion were current and were restructured six months ago or more. Based on that experience in our redefault rates overall, we expect the vast majority of that $1.4 billion pool to stay current. In total, about a quarter of the loans we've restructured today have redefaulted. 
On a lagged basis, redefault rates are just under 30% unmodified loans, which is better than industry data. We've updated our vintage default rate curves on the slides, so that you can see the tendencies toward default by vintage. More recent vintages have shown lower redefault rates than loans we restructured earlier in the cycle and also constitute a larger proportion of the aggregate TDR pool. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of our loss mitigation efforts, and I think the information we've provided demonstrates that they're working and improving. 
Let me stop for a minute and point you to Slide 15, which is the roll forward of our nonperforming loans that we've included in the materials we released this morning. Our commercial nonperforming loan inflows were the lowest we've seen in quite some time at $310 million compared with $405 million last quarter and a quarterly range of about $550 million to $830 million in 2009. Consumer inflows increased to $200 million, although we'd expect that to be down in the third quarter. The increase this quarter included the acceleration of mortgage NPA recognition I mentioned earlier. Total inflows, commercial and consumer, were $515 million, down from $542 million last quarter, and the lowest we've seen since 2008. 
To wrap up the NPA discussion, we've been proactive in addressing problem loans and writing them down to realistic and realizable values. Total NPAs, commercial and consumer, are being carried at approximately 56% of their original face value through the process of taking charge-off, marks and specific reserves recorded through the second quarter. We believe that's appropriate, and I think our recent charge-off trends continue to be indicative of lower severities on new NPAs and reasonable carrying values overall.
Moving to Slide 16, which outlines delinquency trends. Commercial loans 90 days past due were $142 million, up $22 million from the first quarter. Last quarter's level was down $79 million to the lowest level we've seen in several years. And so we're pleased with the continuing low level of 90-day delinquencies. 
Commercial loans 30 to 89 days past due were $277 million and decreased by $124 million from the already low levels experienced in the first quarter. As we discussed last quarter, consumer delinquency trends overall have continued to improve. Three key drivers of those trends are the seasoning of loans made in 2005, significant underwriting improvements in home equity and auto portfolios and the run off of mortgages due to our saleability strategy. These factors are having an increasing impact on the performance of the portfolio.
Consumer loans over 90 days past due were $255 million, down $61 million. Consumer delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased sequentially by 13% or $62 million to $416 million. Total delinquencies this quarter were down 17% from last quarter and were at the lowest level since mid-2007. We believe we're seeing signs of stabilization and don't currently expect a lot of movement next quarter, although delinquencies can move around a bit, given seasonality and timing issues.
Now for a couple of comments on provision and the allowance, which is outlined on Slide 17. Provision expense for the quarter was $325 million and reflects the reduction to the allowance from loan and lease losses of $109 million. Our allowance coverage ratios remains strong and actually increased sequentially despite the reduction in the dollar reserve. Coverage of nonperforming loans improved to 146%, and coverage of second quarter annualized net charge-offs increased to 212%. 
We have also updated our stress test models on Slide 18. The macro forecast are derived from the Moody's economy.com base case and recession case scenarios. As you can see, under the updated base case scenario, 2010 losses would be expected to come in below $2 billion, significantly below our 2009 losses of $2.6 billion. Losses under the recession case would not only be much better than the SCAP adverse scenario results, but also better than our baseline SCAP submission for 2010. While current levels of losses are elevated, they're much lower than 30 years ago, and our expectations for losses continue to be materially better than we are modeling coming into the year

And therefore, we guided to a fairly significant decrease in mortgage banking revenue overall. I think we talked about something in the $30 million range. It came in at $38 million. I think our hedging results for the second quarter are more in line with what one would normally expect. We had about $100 million in negative valuation adjustments on MSRs. Our hedges operated the way one would think they would, and offset virtually all that. We had about a $4 million net MSR hedging valuation item in the fourth quarter. So I think that was the key driver.

But what we still are seeing, particularly in the segment that you talk about, which is the manufacturing segment, has been holding up very, very strong. Our manufacturers feel good about how they're positioned and are seeing some slight growth in terms of their wares, and so they're well positioned. Their balance sheets are strong. But we did see a pause, particularly more toward the middle of the quarter as things got a little more elevated relative to Europe and the credit issues here. So people really have stepped back from that standpoint, but they still are in very sound position. We think that when there's a bit of confidence that bleeds in, that they're going to be well positioned to be able to take advantage of that. We'll be there to help them. And from our standpoint, while we are seeing still the effects of some of that deleveraging going on, we think we're expanding our core base. We're getting some good clients onboard. Our core production has been good. I think it'll show up in a couple of different ways that I think it will begin to contribute to us in terms of overall growth going forward. And so we feel well positioned from that standpoint as does the marketplace. So that's kind of the trends we're seeing. That's kind of the feelings that we're getting as we talk to our clients and prospects, and we try to put that in. But it just makes for a very difficult time to predict or to talk about how soon we're going to see some of the benefit to us."

We've talked in the past about maintaining an overall approximately neutral position from an interest rate risk respective. That continues to be our objective, and I think that continues to be how we are positioned. That likely caused us somewhat in the short run in terms of current earnings, but I think it positions us better for the future.

I'm joined in the call by several people: Kevin Kabat, our President and CEO; Chief Financial Officer, Dan Poston; Chief Risk Officer, Mary Tuuk; Treasurer, Mahesh Sankaran; and Jim Eglseder of Investor Relations. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?"

Good morning, and thanks for joining us, everyone. I'll make some opening comments, and then hand the call over to Dan and Mary for a more detailed discussion of our financial credit performance. We've again posted a presentation on our webs",1375,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, and thanks for joining us, everyone. I'll make some opening comments, and then hand the call over to Dan and Mary for a more detailed discussion of our financial credit performance. We've again posted a presentation on our website to facilitate our discussion. For the third quarter, we reported strong earnings results, which built upon solid second quarter levels. Net income was $238 million, up 24% with $175 million or $0.22 available to common shareholders, and now was up 38% sequentially. Third quarter results included the effect of credit actions we took during the quarter to further reduce risk in our portfolio. Those actions reduced pretax earnings by approximately $175 million in the form of higher provision expenses.
Results also included the positive effect of a net $127 million litigation settlement, stemming from one of our BOLI policies that was announced during the quarter. Return on average assets was 84 basis points and the best performance we've posted since the first quarter of 2008. We talk a little bit about some high level operating results, pre-provision net revenue of $760 million increased 34% compared with last quarter, driven by very strong mortgage revenue in the BOLI settlement I just mentioned. 
Excluding the BOLI related benefit, PPNR was $633 million, 12% better than the second quarter. This was driven by strong mortgage revenue and growth in investment advisory revenue. Additionally, net interest income increased $29 million, and the margin expanded 13 basis points to 370. We continue to benefit from repricing of our CD book and the management of deposits in general, given our significant excess liquidity. As expected, we also saw some loan growth during the quarter particularly in higher-yielding C&I and consumer books, which is a good sign. We've been pleased with our lending volumes throughout the year particularly in C&I, which has always been one of our strengths. Origination volumes were offset in the first half of the year, with higher paydowns are normal. During the third quarter, our C&I origination volumes exceeded paydowns. In fact, C&I originations were more than $1.1 billion per month in the quarter, which is the highest we've ever seen, up from just under $1 billion per month of originations last quarter.
Paydowns remain high, but we seem to have reached a point of equilibrium. We're hopeful we're beginning the first signs of sustained loan growth. I think this is a direct result of continued focus on core business activity by our loan officers and sales people. Originations were broad-based, high-quality and diversified by both geographically and by asset class, driven particularly by growth of healthcare manufacturing, two industries that are recovering well. We aim during the crisis to ensure that we are well-positioned when things began to turn, I believe we've done just that. As I noted, third quarter fee income results were also very strong, driven by significantly higher mortgage banking revenue. Total noninterest income was up 33% sequentially, including the BOLI benefit. And excluding this benefit, noninterest income was up 9%. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $232 million increased $118 million from last quarter as historically low mortgage rates drove a high level of refinancings during the quarter. Our total originations were $5.6 billion, up nearly $2 billion from last quarter. Deposit fees were down just 4% despite Reg E, which was a pretty good result and investment advisory revenue was up 4% from the second quarter, as improved sales production and better markets resulted in strong net asset and account growth. Average loans were flat on a percentage basis compared with the quarter, period-end balances grew almost $1 billion before our credit actions at the end of the quarter. Growth in C&I contributed to positive loan momentum, as well as auto loans and mortgages.
Average core deposits were down 2% sequentially, and up 8% over 2009 levels. As expected, the sequential decline included $1.1 billion of CD runoff and a reduction in non-relationship public funds deposits of about $1.2 billion. Excluding public funds and CDs, transaction deposits increased 1% sequentially and increased 19% year-over-year. Expenses were up $44 million from last quarter, driven by $25 million of expenses related to the BOLI settlement and higher mortgage repurchase cost, which included a $15 million build and repurchase reserves. Otherwise, expenses were consistently with last quarter, and continue to reflect ongoing investments in our sales forces' strategic initiatives.
Let me talk a little bit about credit, which Mary will go into more detail a little bit later. At the end of the third quarter, we undertook $0.02 of actions that significantly affected credit quality trends including net charge offs, nonperforming assets and loan loss allowance. First, we sold $228 million of residential mortgage loans, which resulted in $123 million of net charge offs being recorded to reflect the sale. Additionally, we transferred $961 million of commercial loans to help resale, which resulted in $387 million of net charge-offs being recorded to reflect their estimated sales price. These loans represented situations where we believe the near-term sale was a better solution at a long-term workout with a potential for rehabilitating the relationship. 
Their disposition further reduces our exposure to future real estate losses, and what's anticipated to be a slow recovery. I'd note that even before the sales and transfers during the quarter, our NPA balances were stable and net charge-offs were $446 million, both in line with our expectations. These actions reduced nonperforming loans by about 40%. The loans involved represented about half of our residential mortgage nonperforming loans and over a third of our commercial nonperforming loans. Excluding the effect of these credit actions, charge offs of $446 million were relatively stable compared with last quarter at $434 million. Portfolio NPAs were down almost $900 million, largely as a result of our credit actions. As a result, our third quarter NPA ratio was 2.7% and the NPL ratio was 2.1%, the lowest levels we've seen in two years. 
Our reserve position remains very strong at 4.2% of loans, with coverage increasing to over 200% of NPLs. Dan and Mary will talk about our outlook in more detail, what we expect further earnings improvement in the fourth quarter. We should see annualized charge offs move south of 2% of loans, and significantly lower provision expense as a result. We also expect PPNR results to remain robust. As a result, we expect our return on assets to move north of 1%, and to post a return on common equity in the 10% vicinity. That's not what we want those numbers to be long-term, but they would be relatively strong for this environment. 
Now turning to capital. With the release of the new Basel proposals, there have been questions about what that means in the TARP repayment context, clearly our capital position is very strong relative to the Basel proposals with or without TARP. Common equity already exceeds the proposed buffered minimum and if anything, we expect our common ratios to be a little higher after adjusting for the Basel common capital definitions. We said that we though the TARP resolution in the second half of 2010 seemed reasonable for us. While it's still the case, we've also expressed that we've been willing to be patient. It has always been about the right result rather than a particular time frame. We believe and continue to believe that improvement in our results, continuing positive trends in our credit performance and additional clarity on future capital requirements provide us and our regulators with a better sense of what is an appropriate repayment plan. We also have a lot more clarity on the economy than in the early part of the year. All of those have been constructive developments from a TARP context. 
As the basis of our thinking, we certainly don't view TARP as cheap capital or funding despite of what you've read in the papers. We're paying 5% after-tax on it, and essentially reinvesting it at 0.25% before tax. We'll continue to approach this thoughtfully and in the context of capital requirements and take the appropriate steps for Fifth Third. We look forward to resolving this and putting it behind us. With that, let me turn it over to Dan to discuss operating results. Dan?"

As Kevin discussed, we continue to see positive trends on a number of fronts. And I'd like to spend some time discussing our performance in a little more detail. If you turn to Slide 4 of the presentation. In the third quarter, we reporte",2796,"Thanks, Kevin. As Kevin discussed, we continue to see positive trends on a number of fronts. And I'd like to spend some time discussing our performance in a little more detail. 
If you turn to Slide 4 of the presentation. In the third quarter, we reported net income of $238 million, and paid preferred dividends of $63 million, which resulted in $175 million of net income on an available for common share basis or $0.22 per share. Earnings per share were up 38% from last quarter. Our results included about $950 million in net charge-offs. Of that, $510 million was attributable to loans that were sold or moved and held for sale during the quarter. Reserve reductions related to a loan sold or transferred were about $337 million and reserve reductions related to the held-for-investment portfolio were about $162 million.  PPNR was $760 million, which included $127 million net benefit of the BOLI settlement. Excluding that, PPNR was a strong $633 million, much better than we originally forecasted, and reflected strong fee and net interest income results. 
If you turn to Slide 5, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $29 million sequentially to $916 million. While the interest margin increased 13 basis points to 370 basis points. The increases in NII and NIM were attributable to a number of factors, including continued deposit pricing discipline, CD run-off and repricing, a mixed shift toward higher yielding loans and a decline in excess cash balances held at the Fed. These benefits were partially offset by lower LIBOR and swap rates compared with the prior quarter, as well as the decline in the average investment securities. Additionally, you'll remember that the GSC buyouts of delinquent loans for mortgage-backed securities resulted in elevated premium amortization expense in the second quarter. 
With that context, turning to Slide 6. Let's go through the balance sheet in a little more detail. Average earning assets were down $1.5 billion sequentially or 2%, which was almost entirely driven by the decline in investment balances in the previous quarter. Short-term investments declined about $800 million, primarily driven by lower cash balances held at the Fed, as we reduced excess liquidity, the run off of CDs and public funds. Average taxable investment securities balances declined about $680 million due to portfolio cash flows not being reinvested during the second quarter. The outlook for a longer period of low rates has become clear in the past several months. As a result, we've reinvested portfolio cash flows during the third quarter, but we chose not to grow the portfolio despite our capacity to do so. We continue to be very careful about managing interest rate risk in our balance sheet. Obviously, maintaining a modestly asset sensitive position in this kind of environment cost us current period earnings. But we believe that, that posture will serve us better with respect to long-term earnings quality and growth.
Average total loan balances were flat sequentially. We're pleased with our core production, particularly in the C&I area. As Kevin mentioned, commercial originations were higher than previous quarters, and that contributed to a more positive loan balance trend. But paydowns do continue to be elevated. We continue to focus on developing deeper customer relationships and growing our customer base, which is driving our relative success in this environment, and will benefit us going forward. 
Average commercial loans were down 1% from last quarter, which was driven by a 4% sequential decline in commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a 1% increase in C&I loans. Period end commercial loans were down $785 million, but they were up about $200 million, if you exclude the transfers of held for sale.  Period end C&I loans increased 1% sequentially and were up 2% prior to the transfers. That's the best organic growth and balances we've seen in a couple of years. We're seeing particular strength in manufacturing and healthcare, reflecting growth across the footprint in both sectors. Commercial line utilization remained stable this quarter, although still very low at 32.4% compared with 32.1% last quarter. That's down from 36% a year ago at normal levels in the low to mid-forties. We saw continued runoff in the commercial mortgage and commercial construction portfolios. In aggregate, on a period-end basis, those portfolios were down 8% sequentially and down 3%, excluding the transfers. We would expect these balances to continue to trend down over the near term. Average consumer loans were flat sequentially, but increased 2% on a period-end basis.
Average residential mortgage balances were flat sequentially and up 3% on a period-end basis. That increase was driven by higher jumbo mortgages, which increased due to the high levels of production during the quarter and by branch-originated mortgages. During the quarter, we began retaining simplified refi [refinanced] mortgages, originated through our retail branch system. This is a product we've offered for several years, and which has lower LTVs, shorter durations and higher average rates, and the conforming loan that we sell to agencies. We currently view retaining these assets as a good way to re-extend the overall duration of our earning asset portfolio in the face of higher prepayment speeds, as we work to maintain a balanced interest rate risk position. 
The retention of these loans contributed about $400 million to period-end loan balances. Auto loan balances increased 3% sequentially, and 19% from last year due to continued strong originations. The loans we brought back onto the balance sheet in the first quarter contributed to the year-over-year increase. Our auto portfolio has continued to perform very well, and spreads have remained attractive. We've been able to maintain high FICO scores on our originations, while improving spreads at the same time. Credit card balances were down 1% from the second quarter and 6% year-over-year, while home equity loans were down 2% sequentially and 4% from a year ago.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter for loans, on a period-end basis, we expect commercial loans to be relatively flat versus the third quarter levels, with growth of $500 million or more, offset by the effect of an expected refinancing of our loan to FTPS. As you'll recall, the loan to FTPS included in the original transactions structure was about $1.25 billion. FTPS is acquiring national processing company, with that acquisition expected to close sometime in the middle of the quarter. In connection with that acquisition, FTPS is increasing the size of it's loan facility, which are being syndicated through a group of banks, and which will result in an ultimate reduction in the size of our loan. 
On the consumer side, loan balances should be up modestly on the period-end basis. Net-net, period-end loan should be relatively flat versus the third quarter, or perhaps up modestly with good underlying growth trends. Average loans will reflect the timing of the FTPS refinancing, as well as the effect of the $1.2 billion in loans sold or transferred to help-for-sale at the end of this quarter. We currently expect solid organic growth trends to take over again as we move into 2011. 
Moving on to deposits. Average core deposits were down 2% on a sequential basis, but up 8% year-over-year. Consumer CDs included in core deposit declined 9% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. This reflects a continuation of the repricing of our CD portfolio, including higher rate CDs originated in the second half of 2008. We still have roughly $2 billion of those CDs, which have rates in excess of 4%, with $0.5 billion maturing next quarter and another $1.5 billion maturing in 2011. 
Excluding consumer CDs, average transaction deposits were down 1% sequentially and up 17% year-over-year. The main driver of this sequential decline was public funds balances as expected, which were down 19% from the previous quarter. Transaction deposits would've otherwise been up $648 million or 1%.
Retail transaction deposits increased 1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We continue to have great success with our relationship savings product, which now has attracted over $8 billion of balances since its inception. These balance have doubled in the last six months. Total commercial transaction deposits were down 4% from last quarter, and up 25% from a year ago. Average public fund balances were down about $1.2 billion sequentially, as we adjusted our pricing due to our excess liquidity position. 
If you exclude public funds balances, average commercial transaction deposits increased 1% sequentially and 37% from a year ago, reflecting continued strong liquidity among commercial customers. We currently expect about $1.5 billion to $2 billion in total CD run-off in the fourth quarter, partially offset by continued solid growth in transaction account balances. 
With that background, let me circle back now to our overall outlook for NII and NIM. We expect NII to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter compared with the pretty strong levels in the third quarter. We'd also expect NIM to be stable in the 370 basis point kind of range. 
Moving on to fees, as outlined on Slide 7. Third quarter noninterest income was $827 million, an increase of $207 million from last quarter. Fee income included $152 million gain from the settlement of the BOLI litigation. We also incurred about $25 million of expenses associated with that settlement, which are recorded in other expense.
Excluding the BOLI gain, fee income was $675 million and increased 9%, largely driven by very strong mortgage results. Fee growth was 13% on an apples-to-apples basis, taking into account several items, which are detailed in the release. Deposit service charges decreased 4% sequentially. Commercial deposit fees were up 6%, reflecting lower customer attrition, while consumer deposit fees were down 13%. As you know, Reg E went into effect for all accounts in July and August. The effects on the third quarter was about $10 million. We're seeing opt-in rates in line with our expectations, and we still believe that a $15 million to $20 million effect is a pretty good estimate of the impact on the fourth quarter and on the ongoing run rate.
We expect fourth quarter deposit fees to be down about $5 million to $10 million, with the full quarter impact of Reg E being partially offset by seasonally strong deposit fees. Investment advisory revenue increased 4% sequentially and 10% on a year-over-year basis. The sequential increase was the result of improved production, particularly in brokerage and insurance. These also contributed to the increase over the prior year, and it did an overall lift in the equity and bond markets. We expect investment advisory revenue to increased modestly in the fourth quarter.
Corporate banking revenue of $86 million was down 8% from a strong second quarter, but up 11% from last year. The sequential decline was a result of strong lease re-marketing results in the second quarter, as well as lower FX and institutional sales revenue this quarter. Those effects were partially offset by increased interest rate derivatives revenue, attributable to higher commercial loan origination volume during the third quarter. Compared with last year, revenue from interest rate derivatives sales and business lending fees were the primary drivers of the increase. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect corporate banking revenues to be consistent with the third quarter. Mortgage banking revenue of $232 million increased $118 million sequentially. Gains on deliveries were $173 million this quarter versus $89 million last quarter due to the very strong origination volume from refinancing activity. Servicing fees of $56 million were up modestly. And as our hedge gains, net of MSR impairment were $46 million for the quarter, and offset the MSR amortization of $43 million. We expect mortgage revenue to remain strong in the fourth quarter, but lower than the third. That would be driven by lower gains on deliveries, perhaps down $15 million to $20 million. And of course, we're not currently forecasting MSR hedge gains. Payment processing revenue was $77 million, down 9% from last quarter. We expect processing revenue to increase to the mid-$80 million range in the fourth quarter.
Turning to other income within fee income. I mentioned earlier the $152 million gain associated with the BOLI settlement, which is recorded in other income. We also incurred $5 million in negative marks on the FTPS warrants and puts, which last quarter was positive by $10 million. Equity income from our interest and the processing joint venture was $7 million compared with $6 million in the second quarter, while revenue from the transition services agreement was $13 million during the quarter, same level we saw last quarter, and that offsets a similar amount of expenses. Credit related cost recorded in fee income were $40 million in the third quarter compared with $14 million last quarter. This was mainly due to increased losses on OREO properties, which were about $29 million this quarter versus $13 million last quarter. 
Losses on loans previously held for sale were about $10 million. We expect a more moderate level of credit cost and fee income in the fourth quarter, driven by continued OREO losses in the neighborhood of $20 million to $25 million. Overall, we currently expect fee income in the fourth quarter to be in the $650 million range, give or take, with the decline driven by lower mortgage revenue and of course, the BOLI gain. 
Turning to expenses on Slide 8. Noninterest expense of $979 million was up $44 million or 5% sequentially. Third quarter expense included $25 million in legal cost associated with the BOLI settlement.  Also, as you would expect in this environment, we continue to see elevated credit-related cost. Third quarter credit related cost within operating expense were $67 million versus $55 million last quarter. The increase was driven by higher expenses related to mortgage repurchases, which were $45 million this quarter compared to $18 million last quarter. About $15 million of that expense was related to a repurchase reserve build, while actual realized repurchase losses were $30 million during the quarter versus $18 million last quarter. Total repurchased reserves are now about $100 million.
FIO [Federal Insurance Office] request and repurchase demands have been volatile and very difficult to predict, although repurchase demand did come down this quarter from high second quarter levels. We currently expect demands for repurchases as well as loss severities to remain high, and that near-term mortgage repurchase expense will remain elevated as a result.  Our current expectation for repurchase expense is about $30 million to $35 million for the fourth quarter. 
Reserves related to unfunded commitments declined $23 million in the quarter compared with a $6 million reduction in the second quarter. We currently expect total credit-related cost recognized in expense in the fourth quarter to be pretty consistent with the $68 million realized in the third quarter. 
In total, we expect fourth quarter expenses to be relatively stable with the $979 million we just reported, with higher revenue-based compensation expense, offset in the effect of the BOLI expense, which would go away in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9 and looking at PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $760 million in the second quarter. If you exclude the net gain we have from the BOLI settlement, PPNR was $633 million, up 12% from the second quarter. As I outlined, total credit cost within fees and expenses were $107 million, up $37 million from last quarter, but that was more than offset by very strong mortgage results, as well as our NII growth.
Our current expectation is that fourth-quarter PPNR will be in the $580 million range, plus or minus, based on some of the moving parts that I outlined earlier. You'll see in the release that the effective tax rate was about 21%, which was consistent with last quarter, and is about what we would expect for the fourth quarter as well. 
Moving on to capital, which is on Slide 10. Capital levels remained very strong. Tangible common equity was 6.7%, a 15 basis point improvement from the end of the second quarter. That ratio, when we calculated, excludes unrealized securities gains, which totaled $432 million at the end of the quarter. All in, TCE ratio was about 7.1%. Tier 1 common increased 17 basis points to 7.3%, and the Tier 1 ratio also increased 20 basis points to 13.9%, while the total capital ratio was 18.3%, up 29 basis points. 
Kevin touched on some of the developments under Basel. I would just reiterate that we would expect Fifth Third to already meet, if we don't, already exceed whatever standards are set for U.S. banks. And then going forward, we will manage our capital of composition appropriately, given those capital requirements as well as our expectation of capital will continue to build through profitable results. That wraps up my remarks. So I'll turn it over to Mary to discuss credit results and trends. Mary?"
270961,113574603,80732,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Dan. I'll get started with discussing the credit actions we took during the quarter, as summarized on Slide 11. In terms of the residential mortgage nonperforming loan sale, we identified a pool of mortgage loans that were either nonperforming or",2485,"Thanks, Dan. I'll get started with discussing the credit actions we took during the quarter, as summarized on Slide 11. In terms of the residential mortgage nonperforming loan sale, we identified a pool of mortgage loans that were either nonperforming or delinquent, but still accruing. 
We continue in monitoring market, which will become more liquid and determine that pricing will become more realistic, relative to expected real estate values, work-out cost and a reasonable return on the result. The loans we sold included $228 million in balances, $205 million of which were nonperforming, with the remainder delinquent. Approximately 62% of the loans were located in Florida. We incurred charge-off of $123 million on the sale. Reserves were reduced by approximately $44 million. In terms of the nonperforming loans we retained, those would generally be loans with higher probabilities of loss, mitigation or tier, higher levels of collateral support or were market values that are well below realizable value. 
On the commercial side, as you know, we have a workout group known as the Special Assets Group or SAG. That group has been very focused on higher risk portfolios such as non-owner-occupied real estate. They worked hard overtime to achieve the best solutions possible on troubled credit. As part of that process, they continually identified the loans most likely to result in a successful workout, given enough time and with loans that are less likely to result in an acceptable outcome. 
For that latter group of loans, our options include a long-term workout strategy or a shorter term solution. One of which is the possibility of selling a loan and redeploying the resources that would be devoted to a longer-term solution. We continually evaluate our short and long term options, our view of economics, the resources devoted to workout, the probability of success in workout legal cost and etc., other things. 
In comparing those factors to potential values in the marketplace, we determined that the sale of those loans would produce a better overall short and long term outcome for the company, all things considered. We're marketing this loans in several pools targeted at particular buyer basis, land loans in one pool, vertical CRE in another, syndicated loans in another and a final pool that we intend to sell to investors loan by loan.
These loans, particularly the nonperforming ones, would generally represent the more troubled parts of our commercial portfolio, with a high content of commercial real estate in general, particularly land and construction. Of the $961 million in balances transferred, $694 million were nonperforming, and the remainder were accruing. 
About 19% or $181 million was related to residential real estate developer. $515 million was non-owner-occupied real estate. $138 million was owner-occupied real estate and $308 million was C&I. Geographically, about 27% of the loans were in Florida and 10% were in Michigan. We incurred $387 million in charge-off on the transfer of these loans to held for sale, $202 million on commercial mortgages, $77 million on commercial construction and $108 million on C&I. 
About $21 million of the C&I losses were in real estate related industries, with much of the remainder in sectors such as accommodations or retail, where real estate trends are significant negative factors. 
This slide provides some additional cost of the data. Reserves were reduced by approximately $293 million, with the transfer of these loans to held for sale status. We expect to sell most of these loans in the fourth quarter, and believe that our marks are conservative and reflect near-term realizable market values of these properties. 
Now moving onto charge off. I'd like to note otherwise, the following discussion will focus on the ongoing or held for investment portfolio, starting with net charge off on Slide 12. Total net charge off for the third quarter were $956 million, $510 million related to the actions I've just described, and we incurred $446 million in net charge-offs otherwise compared with $434 million in the second quarter. 
Total commercial net charge-offs were $627 million. They were $240 million, excluding the losses due to the held for sale transfers compared with $225 million last quarter. C&I portfolio net charge-offs were $129 million, up from $104 million in the second quarter. Commercial mortgage portfolio charge-offs were $66 million for the quarter compared with $78 million in the second quarter. About 2/3 of the $66 million was attributable to Michigan and Florida. Commercial construction portfolio net charge-offs were $44 million, essentially flat compared with the second quarter. I'd note that commercial construction balances are down to $2.3 billion compared with $4.1 billion a year ago. 
Homebuilder losses totaled $32 million for the quarter compared with $48 million last quarter. You'll recall that we suspended homebuilder originations over two years ago, have already recorded significant charge-offs against that portfolio, and have worked to reduce our exposure. Portfolio balances are now $824 million, which compares with the peak balance of $3.3 billion back in mid-2008. We continue to expect losses from this portfolio to decline over time. Additionally, as you know, the third quarter is also when we receive SCAP [Supervisory Capital Assessment Program] exam annual results. And as we communicated previously, there were no significant surprises on that front.
We currently anticipate that fourth quarter commercial net charge-offs will be in the $160 million to $175 million range, down about $70 million to $80 million from the third quarter charges realized before the effects of moving loans to held for sale. Total consumer net charge-offs were $329 million and were $206 million, excluding the residential mortgage sale compared with $209 million last quarter. Excluding losses from the sale, residential mortgage net charge-offs were $81 million, down $4 million from the second quarter. 
Home-equity losses increased slightly to $66 million, with about 40% of that coming from the brokered portfolio, which represents 15% of the total home-equity portfolio. The charge-off rate was 549 basis points for the brokered book, and 147 basis points for the retail originated books. We discontinued broker productions in 2007. Auto net charge-offs remained low, and declined by $3 million sequentially to $17 million or 65 basis points. Credit card net charge-offs declined to $36 million or a relatively low 7.7% compared with 9% in the second quarter.  We currently expect consumer net charge-offs to be between $190 million and $200 million in the third quarter, down about $10 million to $15 million before the losses incurred from the sale. 
Now moving to NPAs on Slide 13. NPAs including held for sale totaled $2.8 billion at quarter end, down $353 million or 11% from the second quarter. NPAs, excluding held for sale, totaled $2.1 billion or 2.72% of loan, down $887 million or 30% sequentially, and NPLs were $1.6 billion or 2.08% of loans, down $946 million or 37% sequentially. 
My next comments will focus on the held for investment portfolio, unless otherwise noted. Overall, Florida and Michigan remained our most challenged geographies from an NPA standpoint, and accounted for 44% of NPAs in the commercial and consumer portfolios. However, NPAs in those two states were down $430 million sequentially due in large part to our portfolio actions. 
Commercial portfolio NPAs were $1.6 billion or 3.71% of loans, and declined $670 million from the second quarter. NPAs were relatively flat prior to the effects of the sale. Commercial construction NPAs declined $190 million, commercial mortgage NPAs declined $276 million, and C&I NPAs declined $198 million. 
Across the commercial portfolios, residential builder and developer NPAs of $280 million were down 35% sequentially and represented about 10% of total commercial NPA. Within NPAs, commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status declined to $31 million this quarter from $48 million last quarter. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loan, where it makes good economic sense for the bank. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect commercial portfolio NPAs to be stable versus current levels. Nonperforming loan inflows in the third quarter were $290 million, which is the lowest level since 2007. Given an outlook for continued gradual improvement in the economy, we expect inflows to continue to generally trend downward, which they've done now for four straight quarters. 
Obviously, outflows going forward will be lower because of the removal of charge-off content from our NPA pool due to the transfers. On the consumer side, portfolio NPAs totaled $478 million at the end of the quarter or 1.44% of loan, a decrease of $217 million or 31% from the second quarter. Residential mortgage NPAs decreased $221 million during the quarter to $328 million, driven by the sale, which accounted for $205 million of that $221 million. Home-equity NPAs totaled $74 million at the end of the third quarter, a $9 million increase from second quarter level. 
Auto NPAs were up $2 million and credit card NPAs were down $7 million. We expect fourth quarter consumer portfolio NPAs to be up modestly compared with the third quarter, $30 million to $40 million perhaps. We currently expect consumer nonperforming loan inflows to continue to trend down in the fourth quarter with lower outflows due to our credit actions. To wrap up the NPA discussion, we've been proactive in addressing problem loans and writing them down to realistic and realizable values. Total portfolio NPAs, commercial and consumer, are being carried at approximately 58% of their original face value through the process of taking charge-offs, marks and specific reserves recorded through the third quarter. 
We believe that's appropriate, and I think our recent charge-off trends continue to be indicative of lower severities on new NPAs. The next slide, Slide 14 includes the roll forward of nonperforming loans. As I mentioned earlier, our commercial nonperforming loan inflows were the lowest that we've seen in quite some time at $290 million. Consumer inflows decreased to $157 million. Total inflows, commercial and consumer, were $447 million, down $68 million or 14% from last quarter and the lowest that we've seen since 2008. I would note that this inflow data also includes loans that became nonperforming during the quarter that were sold or transferred to held for sale at the end of the quarter. As you can see, on Slide 15, our level of inflows is relatively low versus peers, after being higher than peers during 2008. I think that's a reflection of our geographies, which were impacted earlier than others and aggressively recognizing issues as they occurred.
Turning to Slide 16. We provide some data on our consumer trouble debt restructuring. We have $1.8 billion of consumer TDRs on the books as of September 30, of which $1.65 billion were accruing loans and $175 million were nonaccrual. Out of that $1.65 billion of accruing TDRs, approximately $1.3 billion were current. And of current loans, about $1 billion were current and were restructured six months or more ago. Based on that experience in our re-default rates overall, we expect the vast majority of that $1 billion pool to stay current. 
Over time, we've learned more about what works and doesn't work in modifying loans. As a result, more recent modification vintages have shown lower re-default rates than loans we restructured earlier in the cycle, and also constitute a larger proportion of the aggregate TDR pool. As you can see from the slide, while 2008 vintages peaked at higher re-default levels, where recent vintages are trending towards the 20% to 25% range. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of our loss mitigation efforts, and I think the information we've provided demonstrates that they're working and improving.
Moving to Slide 17, which outlines delinquency trends. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were $666 million, down $26 million from last quarter, with consumer down $1 million and commercial down $25 million. Loans 90 days past due were $316 million, down $80 million from the second quarter, with consumer down $1 million and commercial down $79 million. 
Total delinquencies this quarter were down 27% from last quarter, and were at the lowest level since 2007. We believe we're seeing signs of stabilization, and don't currently expect a lot of movement next quarter, although delinquencies can move around a bit, given seasonality and timing issues. 
Now for a couple of comments on provision and the allowance, which is outlined on Slide 18. Provision expense for the quarter was $457 million, and reflects a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses of $499 million. Our allowance coverage ratios remained very strong, and increased sequentially despite the reduction in the dollar reserve. Coverage of nonperforming loans improved to 202%. 
Slide 19 contains our expectation for charge-offs in 2010, relative to the SCAP scenario. As you can see, 2010 losses are expected to come in between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, below 2009 losses of $2.6 billion, and significantly below SCAP assumptions. This is despite a recognition of more than $400 million of charge-offs this quarter that likely wouldn't have been recognized until 2011, absent our disposition plan. 
Before I wrap up, I want to take a minute to comment on developments in the mortgage market, namely foreclosure process concerned and repurchases. With respect to foreclosures, as you all know, the focus has primarily been on the accuracy of affidavit and related documents utilized in affecting foreclosure through the judicial process. We have reviewed our processes and procedures in light of current industry issues, and we are comfortable that those are sound. There's nothing at this point that would lead us to believe that this will be significant issue to Fifth Third. 
Also, to anticipate a question, at Fifth Third, our process is for foreclosure analysts to be assigned to accounts, who prepare documents and affidavits for each foreclosure file. There's a lot of additional concern about this issue in the context of private label mortgages, mortgage securitizations and CDOs. Fifth Third was never in the business of creating CDOs or securitizing mortgages on behalf of others. 
We don't have any first mortgage securitizations of our own outstandings, and only one small pillar [ph] (58:23) of securitizations from since 2003, where the loans are performing well, and which has less than $150 million remaining. We're not a complex company, and we don't have complex businesses that will take risk, and we tried to be as transparent as we can about our risk. On repurchases, this is an ongoing issue for us in the industry. However, as we have disclosed for a number of quarters, mortgage repurchase cost for us have been manageable, and we expect that to remain the case. Repurchased losses have been $20 million or $30 million for quarter four the past several quarters. Losses have been subject to some volatility based on GSE activity, but we don't have any reason currently to think that this will change in terms of order of magnitude on an overall basis. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you for any closing comments before we go to Q&A."

Our PPNR results were very strong, up 12% sequentially and up 20% from a year ago, excluding the BOLI and Visa gains in the third quarters of this year and last. Credit trends remained stable with a positive outlook. We marked $1 billion in nonperforming loans per sale earned through it. We expect a majority of the loans to be off our books by the end of next quarter. As a result of previous declines in NPAs on these actions, our problem asset levels are at relatively low levels from an industry perspective. Our reserves and coverage levels remained strong, and we generated ROA approaching 1% even while absorbing these losses and look for better bottom line results moving forward. 
I want to thank our employees for working hard during this time, and helping the company deal with the challenges we face in maintaining a strong focus on customers and providing good service to them and developing new business. We're not yet generating the kind of results we can generate, but we're beginning to develop a lot more visibility on that. Admittedly, there are a lot of regulatory developments that require additional clarity, but we're confident that we'll be able to deal with those changes, adapt to them and ultimately, earn through them as well.

So at 7.3% and generating capital organically, we feel very good about our capital position and our ability to manage within those kinds of parameters. Relative to risk-weighted assets and the impact, the equity definitions and the risk-weighted asset definitions and so forth embedded in Basel will actually probably work to our benefit by a small amount, probably adding 20, 30 basis points or so or perhaps a little more to our Tier 1 common ratio. Really, the only negative of any significance with respect to what's included in the Basel proposals would be a repeat of what was already in Dodd-Frank by the time those proposals came out with respect to the disallowance of troughs.

I'll make some opening comments, and then hand the call over to Dan and Mary for a more detailed discussion of our financial credit performance. We've again posted a presentation on our website to facilitate our discussion. For the third quarter, we reported strong earnings results, which built upon solid second quarter levels. Net income was $238 million, up 24%, with $175 million or $0.22 available to common shareholders, and that was up 38% sequentially. Third quarter results included the effect of credit actions we took during the quarter to further reduce risk in our portfolio. Those actions reduced pretax earnings by approximately $175 million in the form of higher provision expenses.
Results also included the positive effect of a net $127 million litigation settlement, stemming from one of our BOLI policies that was announced during the quarter. Return on average assets was 84 basis points and the best performance we've posted since the first quarter of 2008. Let me talk a little bit about some high level operating results. Pre-provision net revenue of $760 million increased 34% compared with last quarter, driven by very strong mortgage revenue and the BOLI settlement I just mentioned. 
Excluding the BOLI related benefit, PPNR was $633 million, 12% better than the second quarter. This was driven by strong mortgage revenue and growth in investment advisory revenue. Additionally, net interest income increased $29 million, and the margin expanded 13 basis points to 370. We continue to benefit from repricing of our CD book and the management of deposits in general, given our significant excess liquidity. As expected, we also saw some loan growth during the quarter, particularly in higher-yielding C&I and consumer books, which is a good sign. We've been pleased with our lending volumes throughout the year, particularly in C&I, which has always been one of our strengths. Origination volumes were offset in the first half of the year, with higher paydowns than normal. During the third quarter, our C&I origination volumes exceeded paydowns. In fact, C&I originations were more than $1.1 billion per month in the quarter, which is the highest we've ever seen, up from just under $1 billion per month of originations last quarter.
Paydowns remain high, but we seem to have reached a point of equilibrium. We're hopeful we're beginning the first signs of sustained loan growth. I think this is a direct result of continued focus on core business activity by our loan officers and sales people. Originations were broad-based, high-quality and diversified both geographically and by asset class, driven particularly by growth of healthcare manufacturing, two industries that are recovering well. We aimed during the crisis to ensure that we were well-positioned when things began to turn; I believe we've done just that. As I noted, third quarter fee income results were also very strong, driven by significantly higher mortgage banking revenue. Total noninterest income was up 33% sequentially, including the BOLI benefit. And excluding this benefit, non-interest income was up 9%. 
Mortgage banking net revenue of $232 million increased $118 million from last quarter as historically low mortgage rates drove a high level of refinancings during the quarter. Our total originations were $5.6 billion, up nearly $2 billion from last quarter. Deposit fees were down just 4% despite Reg E, which was a pretty good result, and investment advisory revenue was up 4% from the second quarter, as improved sales production and better markets resulted in strong net asset and account growth. Average loans were flat on a percentage basis compared with the quarter, period-end balances grew almost $1 billion before our credit actions at the end of the quarter. Growth in C&I contributed to positive loan momentum, as well as auto loans and mortgages.
Average core deposits were down 2% sequentially, and up 8% over 2009 levels. As expected, the sequential decline included $1.1 billion of CD runoff and a reduction in non-relationship public funds deposits of about $1.2 billion. Excluding public funds and CDs, transaction deposits increased 1% sequentially and increased 19% year-over-year. Expenses were up $44 million from last quarter, driven by $25 million of expenses related to the BOLI settlement and higher mortgage repurchase cost, which included a $15 million build and repurchase reserves. Otherwise, expenses were consistently with last quarter, and continue to reflect ongoing investments in our sales forces' strategic initiatives.
Let me talk a little bit about credit, which Mary will go into more detail a little bit later. At the end of the third quarter, we undertook two sets of actions that significantly affected credit quality trends including net charge offs, nonperforming assets and loan loss allowance. First, we sold $228 million of residential mortgage loans, which resulted in $123 million of net charge-offs being recorded to reflect the sale. Additionally, we transferred $961 million of commercial loans to help resale, which resulted in $387 million of net charge-offs being recorded to reflect their estimated sales price. These loans represented situations where we believe the near-term sale was a better solution than a long-term workout with a potential for rehabilitating the relationship. 
Their disposition further reduces our exposure to future real estate losses, in what's anticipated to be a slow recovery. I'd note that even before the sales and transfers during the quarter, our NPA balances were stable and net charge-offs were $446 million, both in line with our expectations. These actions reduced nonperforming loans by about 40%. The loans involved represented about half of our residential mortgage nonperforming loans and over a third of our commercial nonperforming loans. Excluding the effect of these credit actions, charge offs of $446 million were relatively stable compared with last quarter at $434 million. Portfolio NPAs were down almost $900 million, largely as a result of our credit actions. As a result, our third quarter NPA ratio was 2.7% and the NPL ratio was 2.1%, the lowest levels we've seen in two years. 
Our reserve position remains very strong at 4.2% of loans, with coverage increasing to over 200% of NPLs. Dan and Mary will talk about our outlook in more detail, but we expect further earnings improvement in the fourth quarter. We should see annualized charge-offs move south of 2% of loans, and significantly lower provision expense as a result. We also expect PPNR results to remain robust. As a result, we expect our return on assets to move north of 1%, and to post a return on common equity in the 10% vicinity. That's not where we want those numbers to be long-term, but they would be relatively strong for this environment. 
Now turning to capital. With the release of the new Basel proposals, there have been questions about what that means in the TARP repayment context. Clearly our capital position is very strong relative to the Basel proposals with or without TARP. Common equity already exceeds the proposed buffered minimum and if anything, we expect our common ratios to be a little higher after adjusting for the Basel common capital definitions. We said that we thought a TARP resolution in the second half of 2010 seemed reasonable for us. While it's still the case, we've also expressed that we've been willing to be patient. It has always been about the right result rather than a particular time frame. We believed and continue to believe that improvement in our results, continuing positive trends in our credit performance and additional clarity on future capital requirements provide us and our regulators with a better sense of what is an appropriate repayment plan. We also have a lot more clarity on the economy than in the early part of the year. All of those have been constructive developments from a TARP context. 
As the basis of our thinking, we certainly don't view TARP as cheap capital or funding in spite of what you've read in the papers. We're paying 5% after-tax on it, and essentially reinvesting it at 0.25% before tax. We'll continue to approach this thoughtfully and in the context of capital requirements and take the appropriate steps for Fifth Third. We look forward to resolving this and putting it behind us. With that, let me turn it over to Dan to discuss operating results. Dan?"

As Kevin discussed, we continue to see positive trends on a number of fronts. And I'd like to spend some time discussing our performance in a little more detail.

And I'd like to spend some time discussing our performance in a little more detail. 
If you turn to Slide 4 of the presentation. In the third quarter, we reported net income of $238 million, and paid preferred dividends of $63 million, which resulted in $175 million of net income on an available per common share basis, or $0.22 per share. Earnings per share were up 38% from last quarter. Our results included about $950 million in net charge-offs. Of that, $510 million was attributable to loans that were sold or moved and held-for-sale during the quarter. Reserve reductions related to a loans sold or transferred were about $337 million and reserve reductions related to the held-for-investment portfolio were about $162 million. PPNR was $760 million, which included the $127 million net benefit of the BOLI settlement. Excluding that, PPNR was a strong $633 million, much better than we originally forecasted, and reflected strong fee and net interest income results. 
If you turn to Slide 5, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $29 million sequentially to $916 million, while the interest margin increased 13 basis points to 370 basis points. The increases in NII and NIM were attributable to a number of factors, including continued deposit pricing discipline, CD run-off and repricing, a mixed shift toward higher yielding loans and a decline in excess cash balances held at the Fed. These benefits were partially offset by lower LIBOR and swap rates compared with the prior quarter, as well as a decline in the average investment securities. Additionally, you'll remember that the GSC buyouts of delinquent loans for mortgage-backed securities resulted in elevated premium amortization expense in the second quarter. 
With that context, turning to Slide 6. Let's go through the balance sheet in a little more detail. Average earning assets were down $1.5 billion sequentially or 2%, which was almost entirely driven by the decline in investment balances in the previous quarter. Short-term investments declined about $800 million, primarily driven by lower cash balances held at the Fed, as we reduced excess liquidity through run off of CDs and public funds. Average taxable investment securities balances declined about $680 million due to portfolio cash flows not being reinvested during the second quarter. The outlook for a longer period of low rates has become clear in the past several months. As a result, we've reinvested portfolio cash flows during the third quarter, but we chose not to grow the portfolio despite our capacity to do so. We continue to be very careful about managing interest rate risk in our balance sheet. Obviously, maintaining a modestly asset-sensitive position in this kind of environment cost us current period earnings. But we believe that, that posture will serve us better with respect to long-term earnings quality and growth.
Average total loan balances were flat sequentially. We're pleased with our core production, particularly in the C&I area. As Kevin mentioned, commercial originations were higher than previous quarters, and that contributed to a more positive loan balance trend. But paydowns do continue to be elevated. We continue to focus on developing deeper customer relationships and growing our customer base, which is driving our relative success in this environment, and will benefit us going forward. 
Average commercial loans were down 1% from last quarter, which was driven by a 4% sequential decline in commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a 1% increase in C&I loans. Period-end commercial loans were down $785 million, but they were up about $200 million, if you exclude the transfers to held-for-sale. Period-end C&I loans increased 1% sequentially and were up 2% prior to the transfers. That's the best organic growth and balances we've seen in a couple of years. We're seeing particular strength in manufacturing and healthcare, reflecting growth across the footprint in both sectors. Commercial line utilization remained stable this quarter, although still very low at 32.4% compared with 32.1% last quarter. That's down from 36% a year ago and normal levels in the low to mid-forties. We saw continued runoff in the commercial mortgage and commercial construction portfolios. In aggregate, on a period-end basis, those portfolios were down 8% sequentially and down 3% excluding the transfers. We would expect these balances to continue to trend down over the near term. Average consumer loans were flat sequentially, but increased 2% on a period-end basis.
Average residential mortgage balances were flat sequentially and up 3% on a period-end basis. That increase was driven by higher jumbo mortgages, which increased due to the high levels of production during the quarter and by branch-originated mortgages. During the quarter, we began retaining simplified refi [refinanced] mortgages, originated through our retail branch system. This is a product we've offered for several years, and which has lower LTVs, shorter durations and higher average rates than the conforming loans that we sell to agencies. We currently view retaining these assets as a good way to re-extend the overall duration of our earning asset portfolio in the face of higher prepayment speeds, as we work to maintain a balanced interest rate risk position. 
The retention of these loans contributed about $400 million to period-end loan balances. Auto loan balances increased 3% sequentially, and 19% from last year due to continued strong originations. The loans we brought back onto the balance sheet in the first quarter contributed to the year-over-year increase. Our auto portfolio has continued to perform very well, and spreads have remained attractive. We've been able to maintain high FICO scores on our originations, while improving spreads at the same time. Credit card balances were down 1% from the second quarter and 6% year-over-year, while home equity loans were down 2% sequentially and 4% from a year ago.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter for loans, on a period-end basis, we'd expect commercial loans to be relatively flat versus the third quarter levels, with growth of $500 million or more, offset by the effect of an expected refinancing of our loan to FTPS. As you'll recall, the loan to FTPS included in the original transactions structure was about $1.25 billion. FTPS is acquiring a national processing company, with that acquisition expected to close sometime in the middle of the quarter. In connection with that acquisition, FTPS is increasing the size of it's loan facility, which are being syndicated through a group of banks, and which will result in an ultimate reduction in the size of our loans. 
On the consumer side, loan balances should be up modestly on the period-end basis. Net-net, period-end loan should be relatively flat versus the third quarter, or perhaps up modestly with good underlying growth trends. Average loans will reflect the timing of the FTPS refinancing, as well as the effect of the $1.2 billion in loans sold or transferred to held-for-sale at the end of this quarter. We currently expect solid organic growth trends to take over again as we move into 2011. 
Moving on to deposits. Average core deposits were down 2% on a sequential basis, but up 8% year-over-year. Consumer CDs included in core deposits declined 9% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. This reflects a continuation of the repricing of our CD portfolio, including higher-rate CDs originated in the second half of 2008. We still have roughly $2 billion of those CDs, which have rates in excess of 4%, with $0.5 billion maturing next quarter and another $1.5 billion maturing in 2011. 
Excluding consumer CDs, average transaction deposits were down 1% sequentially and up 17% year-over-year. The main driver of this sequential decline was public funds balances, as expected, which were down 19% from the previous quarter. Transaction deposits would've otherwise been up $648 million or 1%.
Retail transaction deposits increased 1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We continue to have great success with our relationship savings product, which now has attracted over $8 billion of balances since its inception. These balance have doubled in the last six months. Total commercial transaction deposits were down 4% from last quarter, and up 25% from a year ago. Average public fund balances were down about $1.2 billion sequentially, as we adjusted our pricing due to our excess liquidity position. 
If you exclude public funds balances, average commercial transaction deposits increased 1% sequentially and 37% from a year ago, reflecting continued strong liquidity among commercial customers. We currently expect about $1.5 billion to $2 billion in total CD run-off in the fourth quarter, partially offset by continued solid growth in transaction account balances. 
With that background, let me circle back now to our overall outlook for NII and NIM. We expect NII to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter compared with the pretty strong levels in the third quarter. We'd also expect NIM to be stable in the 370 basis point kind of range. 
Moving on to fees, as outlined on Slide 7. Third quarter noninterest income was $827 million, an increase of $207 million from last quarter. Fee income included $152 million gain from the settlement of the BOLI litigation. We also incurred about $25 million of expenses associated with that settlement, which are recorded in other expense.
Excluding the BOLI gain, fee income was $675 million and increased 9%, largely driven by very strong mortgage results. Fee growth was 13% on an apples-to-apples basis, taking into account several items, which are detailed in the release. Deposit service charges decreased 4% sequentially. Commercial deposit fees were up 6%, reflecting lower customer attrition, while consumer deposit fees were down 13%. As you know, Reg E went into effect for all accounts in July and August. The effect on the third quarter was about $10 million. We're seeing opt-in rates in line with our expectations, and we still believe that a $15 million to $20 million effect is a pretty good estimate of the impact on the fourth quarter and on the ongoing run rate.
We'd expect fourth quarter deposit fees to be down about $5 million to $10 million, with the full quarter impact of Reg E being partially offset by seasonally strong deposit fees. Investment advisory revenue increased 4% sequentially and 10% on a year-over-year basis. The sequential increase was the result of improved production, particularly in brokerage and insurance. These also contributed to the increase over the prior year, as did an overall lift in the equity and bond markets. We expect investment advisory revenue to increased modestly in the fourth quarter.
Corporate banking revenue of $86 million was down 8% from a strong second quarter, but up 11% from last year. The sequential decline was a result of strong lease re-marketing results in the second quarter, as well as lower FX and institutional sales revenue this quarter. Those effects were partially offset by increased interest rate derivatives revenue, attributable to higher commercial loan origination volume during the third quarter. Compared with last year, revenue from interest rate derivatives sales and business lending fees were the primary drivers of the increase. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect corporate banking revenues to be consistent with the third quarter. Mortgage banking revenue of $232 million increased $118 million sequentially. Gains on deliveries were $173 million this quarter versus $89 million last quarter due to the very strong origination volume from refinancing activity. Servicing fees of $56 million were up modestly. MSR hedge gains, net of MSR impairment were $46 million for the quarter, and offset the MSR amortization of $43 million. We'd expect mortgage revenue to remain strong in the fourth quarter, but lower than the third. That would be driven by lower gains on deliveries, perhaps down $15 million to $20 million. And of course, we're not currently forecasting MSR hedge gains. Payment processing revenue was $77 million, down 9% from last quarter. We expect processing revenue to increase to the mid-$80 million range in the fourth quarter.
Turning to other income within fee income. I mentioned earlier the $152 million gain associated with the BOLI settlement, which is reported in other income. We also incurred $5 million in negative marks on the FTPS warrants and puts, which last quarter was positive by $10 million. Equity income from our interest and the processing joint venture was $7 million compared with $6 million in the second quarter, while revenue from the transition service agreement was $13 million during the quarter, same level we saw last quarter, and that offsets a similar amount of expenses. Credit-related costs recorded in fee income were $40 million in the third quarter compared with $14 million last quarter. This was mainly due to increased losses on OREO properties, which were about $29 million this quarter versus $13 million last quarter. 
Losses on loans previously held-for-sale were about $10 million. We expect a more moderate level of credit costs and fee income in the fourth quarter, driven by continued OREO losses in the neighborhood of $20 million to $25 million. Overall, we currently expect fee income in the fourth quarter to be in the $650 million range, give or take, with the decline driven by lower mortgage revenue and, of course, the BOLI gain. 
Turning to expenses on Slide 8. Noninterest expense of $979 million was up $44 million or 5% sequentially. Third quarter expense included $25 million in legal costs associated with the BOLI settlement.  Also, as you would expect in this environment, we continue to see elevated credit-related cost. Third quarter credit related costs within operating expense were $67 million versus $55 million last quarter. The increase was driven by higher expenses related to mortgage repurchases, which were $45 million this quarter compared to $18 million last quarter. About $15 million of that expense was related to a repurchase reserve build, while actual realized repurchase losses were $30 million during the quarter versus $18 million last quarter. Total repurchased reserves are now about $100 million.
FIO [Federal Insurance Office] requests and repurchase demands have been volatile and very difficult to predict, although repurchase demand did come down this quarter from high second quarter levels. We currently expect demands for repurchases, as well as loss severities, to remain high, and that near-term mortgage repurchase expense will remain elevated as a result. Our current expectation for repurchase expense is about $30 million to $35 million for the fourth quarter. 
Reserves related to unfunded commitments declined $23 million in the quarter compared with a $6 million reduction in the second quarter. We currently expect total credit-related cost recognized in expense in the fourth quarter to be pretty consistent with the $68 million realized in the third quarter. 
In total, we expect fourth quarter expenses to be relatively stable with the $979 million we just reported, with higher revenue-based compensation expense offsetting the effect of the BOLI expense, which would go away in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9 and looking at PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $760 million in the second quarter. If you exclude the net gain we have from the BOLI settlement, PPNR was $633 million, up 12% from the second quarter. As I outlined, total credit cost within fees and expenses were $107 million, up $37 million from last quarter, but that was more than offset by very strong mortgage results, as well as our NII growth.
Our current expectation is that fourth-quarter PPNR will be in the $580 million range, plus or minus, based on some of the moving parts that I outlined earlier. You'll see in the release that the effective tax rate was about 21%, which was consistent with last quarter, and is about what we would expect for the fourth quarter as well. 
Moving on to capital, which is on Slide 10. Capital levels remained very strong. Tangible common equity was 6.7%, a 15 basis point improvement from the end of the second quarter. That ratio, the way we calculate it, excludes unrealized securities gains, which totaled $432 million at the end of the quarter. All in, TCE ratio was about 7.1%. Tier 1 common increased 17 basis points to 7.3%, and the Tier 1 ratio also increased 20 basis points to 13.9%, while the total capital ratio was 18.3%, up 29 basis points. 
Kevin touched on some of the developments under Basel. I would just reiterate that we would expect Fifth Third to readily meet, if we don't already exceed whatever standards are set for U.S. banks. And then going forward, we will manage our capital as composition appropriately, given those capital requirements as well as our expectation that capital will continue to build through profitable results. That wraps up my remarks. So I'll turn it over to Mary to discuss credit results and trends. Mary?"
270961,113574603,80809,"Fifth Third Bancorp, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Fifth Third Bancorp","Executives","Thanks, Dan. I'll get started with discussing the credit actions we took during the quarter, as summarized on Slide 11. In terms of the residential mortgage nonperforming loan sale, we identified a pool of mortgage loans that were either nonperforming or",2457,"Thanks, Dan. I'll get started with discussing the credit actions we took during the quarter, as summarized on Slide 11. In terms of the residential mortgage nonperforming loan sale, we identified a pool of mortgage loans that were either nonperforming or delinquent, but still accruing. 
We continually monitor markets which have become more liquid and determine that pricing had become more realistic relative to expected real estate values, work-out costs and a reasonable return on the result. The loans we sold included $228 million in balances, $205 million of which were nonperforming, with the remainder delinquent. Approximately 62% of the loans were located in Florida. We incurred charge-offs of $123 million on the sale. Reserves were reduced by approximately $44 million. In terms of the nonperforming loans we retained, those would generally be loans with higher probabilities of loss, mitigation or tier, higher levels of collateral support or where market values were well below realizable value. 
On the commercial side, as you know, we have a workout group known as the Special Assets Group or SAG. That group has been very focused on higher-risk portfolios such as non-owner-occupied real estate. They worked hard overtime to achieve the best solutions possible on troubled credit. As part of that process, they continually identified the loans most likely to result in a successful workout, given enough time, and which loans that are less likely to result in an acceptable outcome. 
For that latter group of loans, our options include a long-term workout strategy or a shorter term solution, one of which is the possibility of selling a loan and redeploying the resources that would be devoted to a longer-term solution. We continually evaluate our short and long term options, our view of economics, the resources devoted to workout, the probability of success in workout legal cost and et cetera, other things. 
In comparing those factors to potential values in the marketplace, we determined that the sale of those loans would produce a better overall short and long term outcome for the company, all things considered. We're marketing this loans in several pools, targeted at particular buyer bases, land loans in one pool, vertical CRE in another, syndicated loans in another and a final pool that we intend to sell to investors loan by loan.
These loans, particularly the nonperforming ones, would generally represent the more troubled parts of our commercial portfolio, with a high content of commercial real estate in general, particularly land and construction. Of the $961 million in balances transferred, $694 million were nonperforming, and the remainder were accruing. 
About 19% or $181 million was related to residential real estate developers. $515 million was non-owner-occupied real estate. $138 million was owner-occupied real estate and $308 million was C&I. Geographically, about 27% of the loans were in Florida and 10% were in Michigan. We incurred $387 million in charge-offs on the transfer of these loans to held-for-sale, $202 million on commercial mortgages, $77 million on commercial construction and $108 million on C&I. 
About $21 million of the C&I losses were in real estate-related industries, with much of the remainder in sectors such as accommodations or retail, where real estate trends are significant negative factors. 
The slide provides some additional cuts of the data. Reserves were reduced by approximately $293 million, with the transfer of these loans to held-for-sale status. We expect to sell most of these loans in the fourth quarter, and believe that our marks are conservative and reflect near-term realizable market values of these properties. 
Now moving onto charge-offs. Except where I note otherwise, the following discussion will focus on the ongoing or held-for-investment portfolio, starting with net charge off on Slide 12. Total net charge-offs for the third quarter were $956 million, $510 million related to the actions I've just described, and we incurred $446 million in net charge-offs otherwise compared with $434 million in the second quarter. 
Total commercial net charge-offs were $627 million. They were $240 million, excluding the losses due to the held-for-sale transfers compared with $225 million last quarter. C&I portfolio net charge-offs were $129 million, up from $104 million in the second quarter. Commercial mortgage portfolio charge-offs were $66 million for the quarter compared with $78 million in the second quarter. About 2/3 of the $66 million was attributable to Michigan and Florida. Commercial construction portfolio net charge-offs were $44 million, essentially flat compared with the second quarter. I'd note that commercial construction balances are down to $2.3 billion compared with $4.1 billion a year ago. 
Homebuilder losses totaled $32 million for the quarter compared with $48 million last quarter. You'll recall that we suspended homebuilder originations over two years ago, have already recorded significant charge-offs against that portfolio and have worked to reduce our exposure. Portfolio balances are now $824 million, which compares with a peak balance of $3.3 billion back in mid-2008. We continue to expect losses from this portfolio to decline over time. Additionally, as you know, the third quarter is also when we receive SCAP [Supervisory Capital Assessment Program] exam annual results. And as we communicated previously, there were no significant surprises on that front.
We currently anticipate that fourth quarter commercial net charge-offs will be in the $160 million to $175 million range, down about $70 million to $80 million from the third quarter charges realized before the effects of moving loans to held-for-sale. Total consumer net charge-offs were $329 million and were $206 million excluding the residential mortgage sale, compared with $209 million last quarter. Excluding losses from the sale, residential mortgage net charge-offs were $81 million, down $4 million from the second quarter. 
Home-equity losses increased slightly to $66 million, with about 40% of that coming from the brokered portfolio, which represents 15% of the total home-equity portfolio. The charge-off rate was 549 basis points for the brokered book, and 147 basis points for the retail-originated book. We discontinued broker productions in 2007. Auto net charge-offs remained low, and declined by $3 million sequentially to $17 million or 65 basis points. Credit card net charge-offs declined to $36 million or a relatively low 7.7% compared with 9% in the second quarter.  We currently expect consumer net charge-offs to be between $190 million and $200 million in the third quarter, down about $10 million to $15 million before the losses incurred from the sale. 
Now moving to NPAs on Slide 13. NPAs, including held-for-sale, totaled $2.8 billion at quarter end, down $353 million or 11% from the second quarter. NPAs, excluding held-for-sale, totaled $2.1 billion or 2.72% of loan, down $887 million or 30% sequentially, and NPLs were $1.6 billion or 2.08% of loans, down $946 million or 37% sequentially. 
My next comments will focus on the held-for-investment portfolio, unless otherwise noted. Overall, Florida and Michigan remained our most challenged geographies from an NPA standpoint, and accounted for 44% of NPAs in the commercial and consumer portfolios. However, NPAs in those two states were down $430 million sequentially due in large part to our portfolio actions. 
Commercial portfolio NPAs were $1.6 billion or 3.71% of loans, and declined $670 million from the second quarter. NPAs were relatively flat prior to the effects of the sale. Commercial construction NPAs declined $190 million, commercial mortgage NPAs declined $276 million and C&I NPAs declined $198 million. 
Across the commercial portfolios, residential builder and developer NPAs of $280 million were down 35% sequentially and represented about 10% of total commercial NPAs. Within NPAs, commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status declined to $31 million this quarter from $48 million last quarter. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans, where it makes good economic sense for the bank. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect commercial portfolio NPAs to be stable versus current levels. Nonperforming loan inflows in the third quarter were $290 million, which is the lowest level since 2007. Given an outlook for continued gradual improvement in the economy, we expect inflows to continue to generally trend downward, which they've done now for four straight quarters. 
Obviously, outflows going forward will be lower because of the removal of charge-off content from our NPA pool due to the transfers. On the consumer side, portfolio NPAs totaled $478 million at the end of the quarter or 1.44% of loans, a decrease of $217 million or 31% from the second quarter. Residential mortgage NPAs decreased $221 million during the quarter to $328 million, driven by the sale, which accounted for $205 million of that $221 million. Home-equity NPAs totaled $74 million at the end of the third quarter, a $9 million increase from second quarter levels. 
Auto NPAs were up $2 million and credit card NPAs were down $7 million. We expect fourth quarter consumer portfolio NPAs to be up modestly compared with the third quarter, $30 million to $40 million perhaps. We currently expect consumer nonperforming loan inflows to continue to trend down in the fourth quarter with lower outflows due to our credit actions. To wrap up the NPA discussion, we've been proactive in addressing problem loans and writing them down to realistic and realizable values. Total portfolio NPAs, commercial and consumer, are being carried at approximately 58% of their original face value through the process of taking charge-offs, marks and specific reserves recorded through the third quarter. 
We believe that's appropriate, and I think our recent charge-off trends continue to be indicative of lower severities on new NPAs. The next slide, Slide 14, includes the roll-forward of nonperforming loans. As I mentioned earlier, our commercial nonperforming loan inflows were the lowest that we've seen in quite some time, at $290 million. Consumer inflows decreased to $157 million. Total inflows, commercial and consumer, were $447 million, down $68 million or 14% from last quarter and the lowest that we've seen since 2008. I would note that this inflow data also includes loans that became nonperforming during the quarter that were sold or transferred to held-for-sale at the end of the quarter. As you can see, on Slide 15, our level of inflows is relatively low versus peers, after being higher than peers during 2008. I think that's a reflection of our geographies, which were impacted earlier than others and aggressively recognizing issues as they occurred.
Turning to Slide 16. We provide some data on our consumer troubled debt restructuring. We have $1.8 billion of consumer TDRs on the books as of September 30, of which $1.65 billion were accruing loans and $175 million were nonaccrual. Out of that $1.65 billion of accruing TDRs, approximately $1.3 billion were current. And of current loans, about $1 billion were current and were restructured six months or more ago. Based on that experience in our re-default rates overall, we expect the vast majority of that $1 billion pool to stay current. 
Over time, we've learned more about what works and doesn't work in modifying loans. As a result, more recent modification vintages have shown lower re-default rates than loans we restructured earlier in the cycle, and also constitute a larger proportion of the aggregate TDR pool. As you can see from the slide, while 2008 vintages peaked at higher re-default levels, more recent vintages are trending towards the 20% to 25% range. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the results of our loss mitigation efforts, and I think the information we've provided demonstrates that they're working and improving.
Moving to Slide 17, which outlines delinquency trends. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were $666 million, down $26 million from last quarter, with consumer down $1 million and commercial down $25 million. Loans 90 days past due were $316 million, down $80 million from the second quarter, with consumer down $1 million and commercial down $79 million. 
Total delinquencies this quarter were down 27% from last quarter, and were at the lowest level since 2007. We believe we're seeing signs of stabilization, and don't currently expect a lot of movement next quarter, although delinquencies can move around a bit, given seasonality and timing issues. 
Now for a couple of comments on provision and the allowance, which is outlined on Slide 18. Provision expense for the quarter was $457 million, and reflects a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses of $499 million. Our allowance coverage ratios remained very strong, and increased sequentially despite the reduction in the dollar reserve. Coverage of nonperforming loans improved to 202%. 
Slide 19 contains our expectations for charge-offs in 2010, relative to the SCAP scenario. As you can see, 2010 losses are expected to come in between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, below 2009 losses of $2.6 billion, and significantly below SCAP assumptions. This is despite a recognition of more than $400 million of charge-offs this quarter that likely wouldn't have been recognized until 2011, absent our disposition plan. 
Before I wrap up, I want to take a minute to comment on developments in the mortgage market, namely foreclosure process concerns and repurchases. With respect to foreclosures, as you all know, the focus has primarily been on the accuracy of affidavits and related documents utilized in affecting foreclosure through the judicial process. We have reviewed our processes and procedures in light of current industry issues, and we are comfortable that those are sound. There's nothing at this point that would lead us to believe that this will be significant issue to Fifth Third. 
Also, to anticipate a question, at Fifth Third, our process is for foreclosure analysts to be assigned to accounts, who prepare documents and affidavits for each foreclosure file. There's a lot of additional concern about this issue in the context of private label mortgages, mortgage securitizations and CDOs. Fifth Third was never in the business of creating CDOs or securitizing mortgages on behalf of others. 
We don't have any first mortgage securitizations of our own outstandings, and only one small pillar [ph] (58:23) securitization from 2003, where the loans are performing well, and which has less than $150 million remaining. We're not a complex company, and we don't have complex businesses with opaque risk, and we try to be as transparent as we can about our risk. On repurchases, this is an ongoing issue for us in the industry. However, as we have disclosed for a number of quarters, mortgage repurchase cost for us has been manageable, and we expect that to remain the case. Repurchased losses have been $20 million or $30 million for quarter four the past several quarters. Losses have been subject to some volatility based on GSC activity, but we don't have any reason currently to think that this will change in terms of order of magnitude on an overall basis. Kevin, I'll turn it back to you for any closing comments before we go to Q&A."

Our PPNR results were very strong, up 12% sequentially and up 20% from a year ago, excluding the BOLI and Visa gains in the third quarters of this year and last. Credit trends remained stable with a positive outlook. We marked $1 billion in nonperforming loans per sale earned through it. We expect a majority of those loans to be off our books by the end of next quarter. As a result of previous declines in NPAs on these actions, our problem asset levels are at relatively low levels from an industry perspective. Our reserves and coverage levels remained strong, and we generated ROA approaching 1% even while absorbing these losses and look for better bottom line results moving forward. 
I want to thank our employees for working hard during this time, and helping the company deal with the challenges we face and maintaining a strong focus on customers and providing good service to them and developing new business. We're not yet generating the kind of results we can generate, but we're beginning to develop a lot more visibility on that.

We're waiting to see what final regulations will look like, and how the US regulators will deal with the Basel proposals.

So at 7.3% and generating capital organically, we feel very good about our capital position and our ability to manage within those kinds of parameters. Relative to risk-weighted assets and the impact, the equity definitions and the risk-weighted asset definitions and so forth embedded in Basel will actually probably work to our benefit by a small amount, probably adding 20, 30 basis points or so or perhaps a little more to our Tier 1 common ratio. Really, the only negative of any significance with respect to what's included in the Basel proposals would be a repeat of what was already in Dodd-Frank by the time those proposals came out with respect to the disallowance of troughs.

I’ll make some opening comments and then hand the call over to Dan and Mary for a more detailed discussion of our financial and credit performance. We've again posted a presentation on our website to facilitate our discussion.
For the third quarter, we reported strong earnings results which built upon solid second quarter levels. Net income was $238 million, up 24% with $175 million or $0.22 available to common shareholders and that was up 38% sequentially. Third quarter results included the effective credit actions we took during the quarter to further reduce risk in our portfolio. Those actions reduced pre-tax earnings by approximately $175 million in the form of higher provision expenses.
Results also included a positive effect of a net $127 million litigation settlement stemming from one of our BOLI policies that was announced during the quarter. Return on average assets was 84 basis points and the best performance we’ve posted since the first quarter of 2008.
Let me talk a little bit about some high level operating results. Pre-provision net revenue of $760 million increased 34% compared with last quarter driven by very strong mortgage revenue in the BOLI settlement I just mentioned. Excluding the BOLI-related benefit, PPNR was $633 million, 12% better than the second quarter. This was driven by strong mortgage revenue and growth in investment advisory revenue.
Additionally, net interest income increased $29 million and the margin expanded 13 basis points to 370. We continued to benefit from re-pricing of our CD book and the management of deposits in general given our significant excess liquidity. As expected, we also saw some loan growth during the quarter particularly in higher yielding C&I and consumer books which is a good sign. We’ve been pleased with our lending volumes throughout the year, particularly in the C&I, which has always been one of our strengths.
Originations volumes were offset in the first half of the year with higher pay downs than normal. During the third quarter, our C&I origination volumes exceeded pay downs. In fact, C&I originations were more than $1.1 billion per month in the quarter which is the highest we've ever seen, up from just under $1 billion per month of originations last quarter.
Pay downs remain high, but we seem to have reached a point of equilibrium. We're hopeful we're beginning to see the first signs of sustained loan growth. I think this is direct result of continued focus on core business activity by our loan officers and sales people. Originations were broad-based, high quality and diversified both geographically and by asset class, driven particularly by growth in healthcare and manufacturing, two industries that are recovering well. We aimed during the crisis to ensure that we were well-positioned when things begin to turn; I believe we've done just that. 
As I noted, third quarter fee income results were also very strong, driven by a significantly higher mortgage banking revenue. Total noninterest income was up 33% sequentially, including the BOLI benefit and excluding this benefit noninterest income was up 9%.
Mortgage banking net revenue of $232 million increased $118 million from last quarter as historically low mortgage rates drove a high level of refinancings during the quarter. Our total originations were $5.6 billion, up nearly $2 billion from last quarter.
Deposit fees were down just 4% despite Reg E, which was a pretty good result and investment advisory revenue was up 4% from the second quarter has improved sales production in better markets resulted in strong net asset and account growth.
Average loans were flat on a percentage basis compared with the quarter. Period end balances grew almost $1 billion before our credit actions at the end of the quarter. Growth in C&I contributed the positive loan momentum as well as auto loans and mortgages.
Average core deposits were down 2% sequentially and up 8% over 2009 levels. As expected, the sequential decline included $1.1 billion in CD runoff and a reduction in non-relationship pub funds deposits of about $1.2 billion. Excluding public funds and CDs, transaction deposits increased 1% sequentially and increased 19% year-over-year.
Expenses were up $44 million from last quarter driven by $25 million of expenses related to the BOLI settlement and higher mortgage repurchase costs which included a $15 million build in repurchase reserves. Otherwise, expenses were consistent with last quarter and continued to reflect ongoing investments in our sales force and strategic initiatives.
Let me talk a little bit about credit which Mary will go into more detail a little bit later. At the end of the third quarter, we undertook two sets of actions that significantly affected credit quality trends, including net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and loan loss allowance.
First, we sold $228 million of residential mortgage loans, which resulted in $123 million of net charge-offs being recorded to reflect the sale. Additionally, we transferred $961 million of commercial loans to help our sale, which resulted in $387 million of net charge-offs being recorded to reflect their estimated sales price.
These loans represented situations where we believe the near-term sale was a better solution than a long-term workout or the potential for rehabilitating the relationship. Their disposition further reduces our exposure to future real estate losses in what's anticipated to be a slow recovery. I'd note that even before the sales and transfers during the quarter, our NPA balances were stable and net charge-offs were $446 million both in line with our expectations.
These actions reduced nonperforming loans by about 40%. The loans involved represented about half of our residential mortgage nonperforming loans and over a third of our commercial nonperforming loans. Excluding the effect of these credit actions, charge offs of $446 million were relatively stable compared with last quarter at $434 million.
Portfolio NPAs were down almost $900 million, largely as a result of our credit actions. As a result, our third quarter NPA ratio was 2.7% and the NPL ratio was 2.1%, the lowest levels we've seen in two years. Our reserve position remains very strong at 4.2% of loans with coverage increasing to over 200% of NPLs.
Dan and Mary will talk about our outlook in more detail but we expect further earnings improvement in the fourth quarter. We should see annualized charge-offs move south to 2% of loans and significantly lower provision expense as a result. We also expect PPNR results to remain robust. As a result, we expect our return on assets to move north of 1% and to post a return on common equity in the 10% vicinity. That’s not where we want those numbers to be long-term, but they would be relatively strong for this environment.
Turning to capital, with the release of the new Basel proposals, there have been questions about that what that means in the TARP repayment context. Clearly, our capital position is very strong relative to the Basel proposals with or without TARP. Common equity already exceeds the proposed buffered minimum and if anything, we expect our common ratios to be a little higher after adjusting for the Basel common capital definitions. We said that we thought a TARP resolution in the second half of 2010 seemed reasonable for us. While that’s still the case, we've also expressed that we've been willing to be patient.
It has always been about the right result rather than a particular timeframe. We believed and continue to believe that improvement in our results, continuing positive trends in our credit performance and additional clarity on future capital requirements provide us and our regulators with a better sense of what is an appropriate repayment plan. We also have a lot more clarity on the economy than in the early part of the year. All those have been constructed developments from a TARP context.
As to basis of our thinking, we certainly don't view TARP as cheap capital or funding. In spite of what we've read in the papers, we’re paying 5% after-tax on it and essentially reinvesting it at 0.25% before tax. We’ll continue to approach this thoughtfully and in the context of capital requirements, take the appropriate steps for Fifth Third. We look forward to resolving this and putting it behind us.
With that, let me turn it over to Dan to discuss operating results. Dan?

As Kevin discussed, we continue to see positive trends on a number of fronts and I’d like to spend some time discussing our performance in a little more detail.If you turn to slide four for the presentation, in the third quarter we repo",2788,"Thanks, Kevin. As Kevin discussed, we continue to see positive trends on a number of fronts and I’d like to spend some time discussing our performance in a little more detail.
If you turn to slide four for the presentation, in the third quarter we reported net income of $238 million and paid preferred dividends of $63 million, which resulted in $175 million of net income on an available per common share basis, or $0.22 per share. Earnings per share were up 38% from last quarter.
Our results included about $950 million in net charge-offs. Of that $510 million was attributable to loans that were sold or moved to held-for-sale during the quarter. Reserve reductions related to the loans sold or transferred were about $337 million and reserve reductions related to the held-for-investment portfolio were about $162 million.
PPNR was $760 million which included the $127 million net benefit of the BOLI settlement. Excluding that PPNR was a strong $633 million, much better than we originally forecasted and reflected strong fee and net interest income results.
Turn to slide five, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis, increased $29 million sequentially to $916 million, while the net interest margin increased 13 basis points to 370 basis points. The increases in NII and NIM were attributable to a number of factors, including continued deposit pricing discipline, CD runoff and re-pricing, a mix shift toward higher yielding loans and a decline in excess cash balances held at the Fifth. These benefits were partially offset by lower LIBOR and swap rates compared with the prior quarter as well as a decline in the average investment securities. Additionally, you'll remember that the GSE buyouts of delinquent loans from mortgage-backed securities resulted in elevated premium amortization expense in the second quarter.
With that context, turning to slide six, let's go through the balance sheet in a little more detail. Average earning assets were down $1.5 billion sequentially or 2% which was almost entirely driven by the decline in investment balances from the previous quarter. Short-term investments declined about $800 million, primarily driven by lower cash balances held at the Fifth as we reduced excess liquidity through runoffs of CDs and public funds. Average taxable investment securities balances declined about $680 million, due to portfolio of cash flows not being reinvested during the second quarter.
The outlook for our longer period low rates has become clear in the past several months. As a result, we've reinvested portfolio cash flows during the third quarter, but we chose not to grow the portfolio despite our capacity to do so. We continue to be very careful about managing interest rate risk in our balance sheet, obviously maintaining a modestly asset-sensitive position in this kind of environment costs us current period earnings, but we believe that that posture will serve us better with respect to long-term earnings quality and growth.
Average total loan balances were flat sequentially. We're pleased with our core production, particularly in the C&I area. As Kevin mentioned, commercial originations were higher than previous quarters and that contributed to a more positive loan balance trend, but pay downs do continue to be elevated. We continue to focus on developing deeper customer relationships and growing our customer base, which is driving our relative success in this environment and will benefit us going forward.
Average commercial loans were down 1% from last quarter which was driven by a 4% sequential decline in commercial real estate loans, partially offset by 1% increase in C&I loans. Period end commercial loans were down $785 million, but they were up about $200 million if you exclude the transfers to held-for-sale. Period end C&I loans increased 1% sequentially and were up 2% prior to the transfers. That's the best organic growth in balances we've seen in a couple of years.
We're seeing particular strength in manufacturing and healthcare, reflecting growth across the footprint in both sectors. Commercial line utilization remained stable this quarter, although still very low at 32.4% compared with 32.1% last quarter. That's down from 36% a year ago at normal levels in the low-to-mid 40s.
We saw continued runoff in the commercial mortgage and commercial construction portfolios. In aggregate, on a period end basis, those portfolios were down 8% sequentially and down 3% excluding the transfers. We would expect these balances to continue to trend down over the near term.
Average consumer loans were flat sequentially, but increased 2% on a period end basis. Average residential mortgage balances were flat sequentially and up 3% on the period end basis. That increase was driven by higher jumbo mortgages which increased due to the high levels of production during the quarter and by branch originated mortgages.
During the quarter, we began retaining simplified [refi] mortgages originated through our retail brand system. This is a product we've offered for several years and which has lower LTVs, shorter durations and higher average rates in the conforming loan that we sell to agencies. We currently (view) retaining these assets as a good way to re-extend the overall duration of our earnings asset portfolio, in the face of higher pre-payments speeds as we work to maintain a balanced interest rate risk position. The retention of these loans contributed about $400 million to period end loan balances.
Auto loan balances increased 3% sequentially and 19% from last year due to continued strong originations. The loans we brought back onto the balance sheet in the first quarter contributed to the year-over-year increase. Our auto portfolio has continued to perform very well and spreads have remained attractive. We've been able to maintain high FICO scores on our originations, while improving spreads at the same time.
Credit card balances were down 1% from the second quarter and 6% year-over-year, while home equity loans were down 2% sequentially and 4% from a year ago.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter for loans, on a period end basis, we'd expect commercial loans to be relatively flat versus the third quarter levels, with growth of $500 million or more offset by the effect of an expected refinancing of our loan to FTPS.
As you'll recall, the loan - the FTPS included in the original transaction structure was about $1.25 billion. FTPS is acquiring National Processing Company. With that acquisition expected to close sometime in the middle of fourth quarter. In connection with that acquisition, FTPS is increasing the size of its loan facility which are being syndicated through a group of banks and which will result in an ultimate reduction in the size of our loan.
On the consumer side, loan balances should be up modestly on a period-end basis. Net-net, period-end loan should be relatively flat versus the third quarter or perhaps up modestly with good underlying growth trends. Average loans will reflect the timing of the FTPS refinancing as well as the effect of the $1.2 billion in loans sold or transferred to held-for-sale at the end of this quarter. We currently expect solid organic growth trends to take over again as we move into 2011.
Moving on to deposits, average core deposits were down 2% on a sequential basis, but up 8% year-over-year. Consumer CDs included in core deposits declined 9% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. This reflects a continuation of the repricing of CD portfolio including higher rate CDs originated in the second half of 2008.
We still have roughly 2 billion of those CDs which have rates in excess of 4% with 0.5 billion maturing next quarter and another 1.5 billion maturing in 2011. Excluding consumer CDs, average transaction deposits were down 1% sequentially and up 17% year-over-year. The main driver of the sequential decline was public funds balances as expected, which were down 19% from the previous quarter. Transaction deposits would have otherwise been up $648 million or 1%. Retail transaction deposits increased 1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We continue to have great success with our Relationship Savings products which now has attracted over $8 billion of balances since its inception. These balances have doubled in the last six months.
Total commercial transaction deposits were down 4% from last quarter and up 25% from a year ago. Average public fund balances were down about $1.2 billion sequentially as we adjusted our pricing to our excess liquidity position. If you exclude public funds balances, average commercial transaction deposits increased 1% sequentially and 37% from a year ago, reflecting continued strong liquidity among commercial customers. We currently expect about $1.5 billion to $2 billion in total CD runoff in the fourth quarter, partially offset by continued solid growth in transaction account balances.
With that background, let me circle back now to our overall outlook for NII and NIM. We expect NII to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter compared with the pretty strong levels in the third quarter. We'd also expect NIM to be stable in the 370 basis point kind of range.
Moving on to fees, as outlined on slide seven. Third quarter noninterest income was $827 million, an increase of $207 million from last quarter. Fee income included $152 million gain from the settlement of the BOLI litigation. We also incurred about $25 million of expenses associated with that settlement which are recorded in other expense. Excluding the BOLI gain, fee income was $675 million and increased 9%, largely driven by very strong mortgage results. Fee growth was 13% on an apples-to-apples basis taking into account several items which are detailed in the release.
Deposit service charges decreased 4% sequentially. Commercial deposit fees were up 6%, reflecting lower customer attrition while consumer deposit fees were down 13%. As you know, Reg E went into effect for all accounts in July and August. The effect on third quarter was about $10 million. We are seeing opt-in rates in line with our expectations and we still believe that a $15 million to $20 million effect is a pretty good estimate of the impact on the fourth quarter and on the ongoing run rate. We would expect fourth quarter deposit fees to be down about $5 million to $10 million with the full quarter impact of Reg E being partially offset by seasonally strong deposit fees.
Investment advisory revenue increased 4% sequentially and 10% on a year-over-year basis. The sequential increase was the result of improved production, particularly in brokerage and insurance. These also contributed to the increase over the prior year as did an overall lift in the equity and bond markets. We expect investment advisory revenue to increase modestly in the fourth quarter.
Corporate banking revenue of $86 million was down 8% from a strong second quarter but up 11% from last year. The sequential decline was a result of strong lease remarketing results in the second quarter as well as lower FX and institutional sales revenue this quarter. Those effects were partially offset by increased interest rate derivatives revenue attributable to higher commercial loan origination volume during the third quarter. Compared with last year, revenue from interest rate derivatives sales and business lending fees were the primary drivers of the increase. For the fourth quarter, we expect corporate banking revenues to be consistent with the third quarter.
Mortgage banking revenue of $232 million increased $118 million sequentially. Gains on deliveries were $173 million this quarter versus $89 million last quarter due to the very strong originations volume from refinancing activity. Servicing fees of $56 million were up modestly. MSR hedge gains, net of MSR impairment, were $46 million for the quarter and offset the MSR amortization of $43 million. We'd expect mortgage revenue to remain strong in the fourth quarter, but lower than the third. That will be driven by lower gains on deliveries, perhaps down $15 million to $20 million and, of course, we're not currently forecasting MSR hedge gains. Payment processing revenue was $77 million down 9% from last quarter. We expect processing revenue to increase to the mid $80 million range in the fourth quarter.
Turning to other income within fee income. I mentioned earlier the $152 million gain associated with the BOLI settlement which is reported in other income. We also incurred $5 million in negative marks on the FTPS warrants and puts which last quarter were positive by $10 million. Equity income from our interest in the processing joint venture was $7 million compared with $6 million in the second quarter, while revenue from the transition service agreement was $13 million during the quarter, the same level we saw last quarter and that offsets a similar amount of expenses.
Credit related cost recorded in fee income were $40 million in the third quarter compared with $14 million last quarter. This was mainly due to increased losses on OREO properties, which were about $29 million this quarter versus $13 million last quarter. Losses on loans previously held-for-sale were about $10 million. We expect a more moderate level of credit cost and fee income in the fourth quarter driven by continued OREO losses in the neighborhood of $20 million to $25 million. Overall, we currently expect fee income in the fourth quarter to be in $650 million give-or-take with the decline driven by lower mortgage revenue and, of course, the BOLI gain.
Turning to expenses on slide eight. Noninterest expense of $979 million was up $44 million or 5% sequentially. Third quarter expense included $25 million in legal cost associated with the BOLI settlement. Also, as you would expect in this environment, we continue to see elevated credit-related costs. Third quarter credit-related costs within operating expense were $67 million versus $55 million last quarter. The increase was driven by higher expenses related to mortgage repurchases, which were $45 million this quarter compared to $18 million last quarter. About $15 million of that expense was related to a repurchase reserve build, while actual realized repurchase losses were $30 million during the quarter versus $18 million last quarter.
Total repurchase reserves are now about $100 million. (File) requests and repurchase demands have been volatile and very difficult to predict, although repurchase demand did come down this quarter from high second quarter levels. We currently expect demands for repurchases as well as loss severities to remain high and that near term mortgage repurchase expense will remain elevated as a result. Our current expectation for repurchase expense is about $30 million to $35 million for the fourth quarter. Reserves related to unfunded commitments declined $23 million in the quarter compared with a $6 million reduction in the second quarter. We currently expect total credit-related cost recognized and expense in the fourth quarter to be pretty consistent with the $68 million realized in the third quarter. In total, we expect fourth quarter expenses to be relatively stable with $979 million we just reported, with higher revenue-based compensation expense offsetting the effect of the BOLI expense which would go away in the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide nine and looking at PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $760 million in the second quarter. If you exclude the net gain we have from the BOLI settlement, PPNR was $633 million, up 12% from the second quarter. As I outlined, total credit costs within fees and expenses were $107 million, up $37 million from last quarter but that was more than offset by very strong mortgage results as well as our NII growth. Our current expectation is that fourth quarter PPNR will be in the $580 million range, plus or minus, based on some of the moving parts that I outlined earlier. You'll see in the release that the effective tax rate was about 21%, which was consistent with last quarter and is about what we would expect for the fourth quarter as well.
Moving on the capital, which is on slide 10. Capital levels remain very strong. Tangible common equity was 6.7%, up 15 basis point improvement from the end of the second quarter. That ratio, the way we calculated excludes unrealized securities gains, which totaled about $432 million at the end of the quarter. All in, TCE ratio was about 7.1%. Tier 1 common increased about 17 basis points to 7.3% and the Tier 1 ratio also increased 20 basis points to 13.9%, while the total capital ratio was 18.3%, up 29 basis points.
Kevin touched on some of the developments under Basel, I would just reiterate that we would expect Fifth Third to readily meet, if we don't already exceed, whatever standards are set for U.S. banks and then going forward, we will manage our capital and its composition appropriately given those capital requirements as well as our expectation that capital will continue to build through profitable results.
That wraps up my remarks. So, I'll turn it over to Mary to discuss credit results and trends. Mary?

I'll get started with discussing the credit actions we took during the quarter as summarized on slide 11. In terms of the residential mortgage nonperforming loans sale, we identified a pool of mortgage loans that were either nonperforming or",2461,"Thanks, Dan. I'll get started with discussing the credit actions we took during the quarter as summarized on slide 11. In terms of the residential mortgage nonperforming loans sale, we identified a pool of mortgage loans that were either nonperforming or delinquent but still accruing. We continually monitor markets which have become more liquid and determine that pricing would become more realistic relative to expected real estate values, workout costs and a reasonable return on the results.
The loans we sold included $228 million in balances, $205 million of which were nonperforming with the remainder delinquent. Approximately 62% of the loans were located in Florida. We incurred charge-offs of $123 million on the sale. Reserves were reduced by approximately $44 million. In terms of the nonperforming loans we retained, those would generally be loans with higher probabilities of loss mitigation or cure, higher levels of collateral support or where market values were well below realizable value.
On the commercial side, as you know, we have a workout group known as the Special Assets Group or SAG. That group has been very focused on higher risk portfolios such as non-owner occupied real estate. We’ve worked hard over time to achieve the best solutions possible on troubled credits. As part of that process, they continually identify the loans most likely to result in a successful workout given enough time and which loans are less likely to result in an acceptable outcome.
For that latter group of loans, our options include a long-term workout strategy or a shorter-term solution, one of which is the possibility of selling a loan and the redeploying the resources that would be devoted to a longer-term solution. We continually evaluate out short and long-term options, our view of economics, the resources devoted to workout, the probability of success in workout legal cost and et cetera, other things. In comparing those factors to potential values in the marketplace, we determine that the sale of those loans would produce a better overall short and long term outcome for the Company, all things considered.
We are marketing these loans in several pools targeted at particular (buyer basis). Land loans in one pool, vertical CRE in another, syndicated loans in another and a final pool that we intend to sell to investors, loan-by-loan. These loans, particularly the nonperforming ones, would generally represent the more troubled parts of our commercial portfolio with a high content of commercial real estate in general, particularly land and construction. Of the $961 million in balances transferred, $694 million were nonperforming and the remainder were accruing. About 19% or $181 million was related residential real estate developer, $515 million was non-owner occupied real estate, $138 million was owner occupied real estate and $308 million was C&I. Geographically, about 27% of the loans were in Florida and 10% were in Michigan.
We incurred $387 million in charge-offs on the transfer of these loans to held-for-sale, $202 million on commercial mortgages, $77 million on commercial construction and $108 on C&I. About $21 million of the C&I losses were in real estate-related industries with much of the remainder in sectors such as accommodation or retail where real estate trends are significant negative factors. The slide provides some additional cuts at the data. Reserves were reduced by approximately $293 million with the transfer of these loans to held-for-sale status. We expect to sell most of these loans in the fourth quarter and believe that our remarks are conservative and reflect near term realizable market values of these properties.
Now, moving on to charge-offs. Except where I note otherwise, the following discussion will focus on the ongoing or held-for-investment portfolio, starting with net charge-offs on slide 12. Total net charge-offs for the third quarter were $956 million, $510 million related to the actions I just described and we incurred $446 million in net charge-offs otherwise compared with $434 million in the second quarter. Total commercial net charge-offs were $627 million. They were $240 million excluding the losses due to the held-for-sale transfers compared with $225 million last quarter.
C&I portfolio net charge-offs were $129 million, up from $104 million in the second quarter. Commercial mortgage portfolio charge-offs were $66 million for the quarter compared with $78 million in the second quarter. About two-thirds of the $66 million was attributable to Michigan and Florida. Commercial construction portfolio net charge-offs were $44 million, essentially flat compared with the second quarter. I’d note that commercial construction balances are down to $2.3 billion compared with $4.1 billion a year ago.
Homebuilder losses totaled $32 million for the quarter compared with $48 million last quarter. You’ll recall that we’ve suspended homebuilder originations over two years ago, have already recorded significant charge-offs against that portfolio and it work to reduce our exposure. Portfolio balances are now $824 million which compared with a peak balance of $3.3 billion back in mid 2008. We continue to expect losses from this portfolio to decline over time. 
Additionally, as you know, the third quarter is also when we received (SNC) exam annual results and as we communicated previously, there were no significant surprises on that front. We currently anticipate that fourth quarter commercial net charge-offs will be in the $160 million to $175 million range down about $70 million to $80 million from the third quarter charges released before the effect of moving loans to held-for-sale. Total consumer net charge-offs were $329 million and were $206 million excluding the residential mortgage sale compared with $209 million last quarter. Excluding losses from the sale, residential mortgage net charge-offs were $81 million, down $4 million from the second quarter.
Home equity losses increased slightly to $66 million, with about 40% of that coming from the brokered portfolio which represents 15% of the total home equity portfolio. The charge-off rate was 549 basis points for the brokered book and 147 basis points for the retail originated book. We discontinued brokered productions in 2007. Auto net charge-offs remain low and declined by $3 million sequentially to $17 million or 65 basis points. Credit card net charge-offs declined to $36 million or relatively low 7.7% compared with 9% in the second quarter. We currently expect consumer net charge-offs to be between $190 million and $200 million in the third quarter, down about $10 million to $15 million before the losses incurred from the sale.
Now, moving to NPAs on Slide 13. NPAs including held-for-sale totaled $2.8 billion at quarter end, down $353 million or 11% from the second quarter. NPAs excluding held-for-sale totaled $2.1 billion or 2.72% of loans, down $887 million or 30% sequentially and NPLs were $1.6 billion or 2.08% of loans, down $946 million or 37% sequentially.
My next comments will focus on the held-for-investment portfolio unless otherwise noted. Overall, Florida and Michigan remain our most challenged geographies from an NPA standpoint and accounted for 44% of NPAs in the commercial and consumer portfolios. However, NPAs in those two states were down $430 million sequentially due in large part to our portfolio actions.
Commercial portfolio NPAs were $1.6 billion or 3.71% of loans and declined $670 million from the second quarter. NPAs were relatively flat prior to the effect of the sale. Commercial construction NPAs declined $190 million, commercial mortgage NPAs declined $276 million and C&I NPAs declined $198 million. Across the commercial portfolios, residential builder and developer NPAs of $280 million were down 35% sequentially and represented about 10% of total commercial NPAs. Within NPAs, commercial TDRs, a nonaccrual status declined to $31 million this quarter from $48 million last quarter. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans, where it makes good economic sense for the banks.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect commercial portfolio NPAs to stable versus current levels. Nonperforming loan inflows in the third quarter were $290 million which is the lowest levels of 2007. Given an outlook for continued gradual improvement in the economy, we accept inflows to continue to generally trend downwards, which they've done now for four straight quarters.
Obviously, outflows going forward will be lower because of the removal of charge-off content from our NPA pool due to the transfers. On the consumer side, portfolio NPAs totaled $478 million at the end of the quarter or 1.44 % of loans, a decrease of $217 million or 31% from the second quarter. Residential mortgage NPAs decreased $221 million during the quarter to $328 million, driven by the sale which accounted for $205 million of that $221 million.
Home equity NPAs totaled $74 million at the end of the third quarter, a $9 million increase from second quarter levels. Auto NPAs were up $2 million and credit card NPAs were down $7 million. We expect fourth quarter consumer portfolio NPAs to be up modestly compared with the third quarter, $30 million to $40 million perhaps. We currently accept consumer nonperforming loan inflows to continue to trend down in the fourth quarter with lower outflows due to our credit actions.
To wrap up the NPA discussion, we've been proactive in addressing problem loans and writing them down to realistic and realizable values. Total portfolio NPAs, commercial and consumer are being carried at approximately 58% of the original face value through the process of taking charge-offs, marks and specific reserves recorded through the third quarter. We believe that’s appropriate and I think our recent charge-off trends continue to be indicative of lower severities on new NPAs.
The next slide, slide 14, includes the roll forward of non-performing loans. As I mentioned earlier, our commercial nonperforming loans inflows were the lowest that we’ve seen in quite some time at $290 million. Consumer inflows decreased to $157 million. Total inflows commercial and consumer were $447 million, down $68 million or 14% from last quarter and the lowest that we’ve seen since 2008. I would note that this inflow data also includes loans that became nonperforming during the quarter that were sold or transferred to held-for-sale at the end of the quarter. As you can see on slide 15, our level of inflows is relatively low versus peers after being higher than peers during 2008. I think that’s a reflection of our geographies which were impacted earlier than others and aggressively recognizing issues as they occurred.
Turning to slide 16, we provide some data on our consumer troubled debt restructuring. We have $1.8 billion of consumer TDRs on the books as of September 30 of which $1.65 billion were accruing loans and $175 million non-accrual. Out of that $1.65 billion of accruing TDRs, approximately $1.3 billion were current and of current loans, about $1 billion were current and were restructured six months or more ago. Based on that experience and our redefault rates overall, we expect the vast majority of that $1 billion pool to stay current. Over time, we’ve learned more about what works and doesn’t work in modifying loans. As a result more recent modification vintages have shown lower re-default rates than loans we restructured earlier in the cycle and also constitute a larger proportion of the aggregate TDR pool.
As you can see from the slide, while 2008 vintages peaked at higher re-default level, more recent vintages are trending towards the 20% to 25% range. Overall, we continue to be pleased with results of our loss mitigation efforts and I think the information we’ve provided demonstrates that they are working and improving.
Moving to slide 17 which outlines delinquency trends. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were $666 million, down $26 million from last quarter with consumer down $1 million and commercial down $25 million. Loans 90 days past due were $316 million, down $80 million from the second quarter, with consumer down $1 million and commercial down $79 million. Total delinquencies this quarter were down 27% from last quarter and were at the lowest level since 2007. We believe we're seeing signs of stabilization and don't currently expect a lot of movement next quarter, although delinquencies can move around a bit, given seasonality and timing issues.
Now, for a couple of comments on provision in the allowance which is outlined on slide 18. Provision expense for the quarter was $457 million and reflects a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses of $499 million. Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong and increased sequentially despite the reduction in the dollar reserve. Coverage of nonperforming loans improved to 202%.
Slide 19 contains our expectation for charge-offs in 2010 relative to the SCAP scenarios. As you can see, 2010 losses are expected to come in between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, below 2009 losses of $2.6 billion and significantly below SCAP assumptions. This is despite a recognition of more than $400 million of charge-offs this quarter that likely wouldn't have been recognized until 2011 absent our disposition plans.
Before I wrap up, I want to take a minute to comment on developments in the mortgage market, namely foreclosure process concerns and repurchases. With respect to foreclosures, as you all know, the focus has primarily been on the accuracy of affidavits and related documents utilized in affecting foreclosures through the judicial process. We have reviewed our processes and procedures in light of current industry issues and we are comfortable that those are sound. There is nothing at this point that would lead us to believe that this will be a significantly issue to Fifth Third. Also, to anticipate a question at Fifth Third, our process is for foreclosure analyst to be assigned to account who prepared documents and affidavits for each foreclosure file. There is a lot of additional concern about this issue in the context of private label mortgages, mortgage securitizations, and CDOs. Fifth Third was never in the business of creating CDOs or securitizing mortgages on behalf of others.
We don't have any first mortgage securitizations of our own outstanding and only one small HELOC securitization from 2003 where the loans are performing well and which has less than a $150 million remaining. We are not a complex Company and we don't have complex businesses with opaque risks and we try to be as transparent as we can about our risks.
On repurchases, this is an ongoing issue for us in the industry. However, as we have disclosed for a number of quarters, mortgage repurchase costs for us have been manageable and we expect that to remain the case. Repurchased losses have been $20 million or $30 million per quarter for us the past several quarters. Losses have been subject to some volatility based on GSE activity, but we don’t have any reason currently to think that this will change in terms of order of magnitude on an overall basis.
Kevin, I'll turn it back to you for nay closing comments before we go to Q&A.

I think this quarter demonstrated pretty clearly the earnings power of this company and our positioning. Our PPNR results were very strong, up 12% sequentially and up 20% from a year ago excluding the BOLI and Visa gains from the third quarters of this year and last. Credit trend remains stable with a positive outlook. We marked $1 billion in nonperforming loans for sale earned through it. We expect a majority of the loans to be off our books by the end of next quarter.
As a result of previous declines in NPAs and these actions, our problem asset levels are at relatively low levels from an industry perspective. Our reserves and coverage levels remain strong and we generated ROA approaching 1% even while absorbing these losses and look for better bottom line results moving forward.
I want to thank our employees for working hard during this time and helping the Company deal with the challenges we face in maintaining a strong focus on customers and providing good service to them and developing new business. We are not yet generating kind of results we can generate. We are beginning to develop a lot of visibility on that. Admittedly, there are lot for regulatory developments that require additional clarity, but we're confident that we'll be able to deal with those changes, adapt to them and ultimately earn through them as well.
So, at this point, let me open it up for questions. Operator?

As you said in your prepared remarks, you started working on your asset quality issues a bit earlier than many of your peers.

Are you getting any guidance from the regulators on their preference for the pace or the ultimate level of loan loss reserves?

So, I would tell you there is no specific mandate that we've received from the regulators directly addressing that strategy. What we've tried to do though is make sure that we’ve got credit practices that can withstand scrutiny. So from that standpoint, they are really inscrutable but we want to make sure that by going forward we continue the practice.

But several banks have suggested that there is some demand for commercial loans over the past quarter presumably that - hopefully, that will continue in the fourth quarter. I guess specifically my question is are you seeing any signs of greater price or other levels of competition for commercial loans that in any of your markets that might cause you to think that these loans are getting a little bit aggressive in terms of either the price or the other terms.

Question one is we are as we mentioned seeing a pick up and feeling comfortable in terms of the loan demand that we're seeing in the marketplace and I wouldn't call it robust but there is demand there. As we mentioned last quarter, we've begun to see some pricing tension, but for the most part we've held the line from that standpoint and still been able to grow the balance sheet. So we feel good about how well-positioned we are and we feel good about what the competitive landscape is to continue to produce the guidance that we gave. So those would be the two things I'd comment on that.

Certainly, as we go forward, we would anticipate operating at some level above that requirement. We haven't really established specific targets at this particular point in time. We're waiting to see what final regulations will look like and how the U.S. regulators will deal with the Basel proposals. I think at this point our expectation would be that we might be managing to something closer to an 8% level from a Tier 1 Common perspective. So at 7.3% and generating capital organically, we feel very good about our capital position and our ability to manage within those kinds of parameters. Relative to risk-weighted assets and the impact, the equity definitions and the risk-weighted asset definitions and so forth embedded in Basel will actually probably work to our benefit by a small amount, probably adding 20, 30 basis points or so, or perhaps a little more to our Tier 1 Common ratio. Really the only negative of any significance with respect to what's included in the Basel proposals would be a repeat of what was already in Dodd-Frank by the time those proposals came out with respect to disallowance of TruPS. So other than that impact, I think generally our capital ratio should benefit by the applications of the Basel proposals.
