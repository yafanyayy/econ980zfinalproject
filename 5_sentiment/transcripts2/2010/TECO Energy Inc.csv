And thank you for joining us on what we know is a very busy day for utility earnings reports.  
I’ll cover our first quarter and year-to-date results and business drivers, and then I’ll update our outlook for the remainder of this year, what we’re seeing in the Florida and local economies.  And finally, update you on some of our investor communication plans. 
In the first quarter, our GAAP net income was 75 ½ million compared to 60.9 million in 2009.  Earnings per share were $0.35 in the first quarter compared to $0.29 last year.  
Net Income included a $4.1 million charge for early debt retirement completed in April.  There were no charges or gains in the 2009 quarter.  
Excluding charges, non-GAAP results were 79.6 million, or $0.37 a share this quarter compared to 60.9 million, or $0.29 a share last year.  
Year-to-date Net Income was 131.3 million, or $0.61 a share compared to 95.6 million, or $0.45 per share last year.  
Net Income in 2010 included 20.3 million of early debt retirement charges and the final 900,000 of restructuring charges.  
In 2009, Net Income included a gain of 8.7 million on the sale of our interest in the Guatemalan Telecommunications provider, Navaga, and a $3.6 million loss on auction securities held at TECO Energy.  
Excluding charges and gains, non-GAAP results were 152.5 million, or $0.72 on a per-share basis compared to 90.5 million, or $0.43 in 2009. 
I’ll briefly highlight the quarter’s drivers that were covered in our earnings release.  
Tampa Electric reported second quarter results above last year driven by favorable weather.  We didn’t really have a spring in Tampa, we went straight from winter into summer.  
Tampa Electric also had higher base rates approved in 2009, some unexpected customer growth, and higher non-fuel operations and maintenance expense.  
We estimate that weather-driven sales added 3 to 5 million to base revenues in the second quarter.  New base rates effective last year, and on January 1st of this year added 13 to 17 million to base revenues in the quarter.  
Retail Sales increased 2% in the quarter.  And this reflects warmer than normal weather with total degree days 12% above normal and 6% above 2009 second quarter.
We also saw 7/10th of a percent customer growth, which was stronger than we expected.  
Non-fuel operations and maintenance expense increased 2.4 million over 2009, driven by the accrual of performance-based incentive compensation reflecting our strong year-to-date financial results.  
Peoples Gas also reported higher results for the quarter, driven by the new base rates effective in June of last year.  We estimate that the new rates added approximately 4 million to pre-tax base revenue this quarter.  
The rates approved in 2009 have a higher fixed component, but a lower volume-related charge, which makes Peoples Gas less volume sensitive in the lower-usage months.  
The average number of gas customers increased ½% this quarter compared to last year, which we didn’t expect due to the soft Florida housing market.  
We also saw higher therm sales to commercial and industrial customers, driven by the return to service of some customers idled in 2009, and higher usage by others.  
Due to the abnormally cold winter weather, Peoples Gas expects to earn above the top it’s allowed ROE range this year.  As a result, in the second quarter, Peoples recorded a provision related to these potential earnings above the top of the range.  The final disposition of any earnings above the range would be determined by the Florida Public Service Commission after the end of the year.  
For the unregulated companies, TECO Coal’s results for the quarter were more than double last year, reflecting higher selling prices across all products.  Sales volumes were slightly higher at 2.4 million tons compared to 2.2 million tons in the second quarter of ’09. 
The average selling price for the quarter rose almost 9% over last year to almost $77 a ton, due to higher prices for MET Coal and the higher percentage of MET in the mix compared to 2009.  
The all-in cost of production was almost $67 a ton, which is within the guidance range that we provided in February.  
TECO Coal also had the benefit in the second quarter of a $2 million settlement of prior years State Income Tax issues.  
Second quarter net income at TECO Guatemala was significantly higher than their non-GAAP results last year.  The biggest driver for the improved results was the San Jose Power Station, which operated throughout this quarter, compared to last year when it was out of service for most of the quarter due to expended-unplanned outages.
The capacity payments for San Jose are calculated on a rolling 12-month availability factor and they’re reduced if that factor falls below 85%.  
In the second quarter, the capacity payment was at levels similar to the second quarter 2009 as outage days were replaced by operating days in the calculation of the 12-month rolling-average availability.  
Normal rainfall resumed in the second quarter, which increased the availability of low-cost hydroelectric power in the country.  This reduced spot sales from San Jose to more normal levels. 
Results for DECA II companies, which includes the regulated distribution company, EEGSA, and its unregulated affiliates, reflect the benefits of customer and energy sales growth and cost control measure at the utility as well as higher earnings from the affiliates.  
In the second quarter, each year we record an adjustment to previously-estimated year-end equity balances.  That adjustment was $800,000 this year, a positive $800,000 compared to a $2 ½ million benefit in 2009.  
We’ve tightened our 2010 earnings per share guidance to a range between $1.25 and $1.35 per share, excluding charges in gain.  
This range includes the $24 million one-time reduction in Tampa Electric’s customer bills under the regulatory stipulation that is before the FPSC for approval.  
Our guidance includes sales at TECO Coal at 9 million tons this year, and it assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.  
Now, turning to what we’re seeing the local and state economies and prospects for recover.  We’ve seen signs of improvement in the local housing market.  Existing home resales continued strong in the quarter and based on the Case-Shiller Index, home prices in the Tampa Metro Area improved in both April and May, but were still lower than 2009.  
We believe a significant portion of the housing market improvement was driven by the Homebuyer Tax Credit Program that effectively ended April 30th.  
The closing deadline was extended to September 30th, so it may have a positive effect on customer growth in the third quarter as home sales under contract at April 30th close.  
While we’re cautiously optimistic, there remains a degree of uncertainty about the sustainability of the improvement we’ve seen without the benefit of the Federal Tax Credit Program.  
Economists are mixed in their assessments of the timing of a recovery in Florida.  Lower unemployment is key to a recovery and most forecasts are for unemployment to improve in 2010, but they disagree as to the timing and magnitude of that improvement.  
Despite the uptick in growth we’ve seen in the past few quarters, we’re maintaining a conservative outlook for weather-normalized residential sales for the rest of the year.  And assuming slightly lower weather-normalized sales for the full year to the commercial and non-phosphate industrial customers due to the slow economic recovery.  
There have been pockets of improvement in some commercial and industrial sales, apparently driven by some of the Federal Stimulus dollars including the Homebuyer Tax Credit Program.  But it hasn’t been widespread.  
At Peoples Gas, we’re seeing increased usage by some steel processing, chemical, and glass manufacturing facilities.  
At Tampa Electric, the largest increase in industrial usage has been the phosphate industry, followed by retail and healthcare providers.  
As commercial energy sales growth historically lags residential, until we see a consistent upward trend in the residential housing market, we think it may be premature to forecast an improvement in commercial and industrial sales.  
In short, we’re encouraged by some of the positive signs, including having seen now three consecutive quarters of year-over-year customer growth, but we remain cautious in our outlook.  
The next couple of slides are graphics that demonstrate some of the positive signs and some of the mixed indicators that we’re seeing.  The first is the unemployment trends that we’ve seen over the past 18 months.  
Earlier this year, Tampa Area unemployment declined, but in June it picked pack up to 12% compared to 11.4% for the state and 9.5% for the nation as a whole.  
The most significant loss of jobs in June was in the Government Sector, and that’s a summer pattern that we’ve seen for many years, which we believe is related to schools closing for the summer.  This year we also have the temporary sensus worker effect.
The bulk of the job losses contributing to Florida’s unemployment rate has been in the construction industry and housing-related fields.  
Since the housing peak in the summer of 2006, Florida and the Tampa Area lost about 320,000 and 40,000 construction jobs respectively.  
This slide shows our electric company customer additions in a couple of different ways.  On the left is the monthly sequential customer adds.  
Starting last fall, the additions were consistently positive after repeated dips into negative territory over the past three years.  The dip in April and May of this year, which you can see here is the pattern that repeats every year, is a normal seasonal migration of winter Floridians back to their summer homes.  
The good news is that the dip was shallower than the last several years, and the return to positive sequential growth has been quicker this year.  
The graph on the right is our cumulative customer additions, which continues to show an upturn since last fall.  The important note on this slide actually is the footnote where we’ve now recovered more customers than we disconnected since the start of the housing crisis.  
On this slide, we show existing-home resales, and new single-family building permits issued in the areas served by Tampa Electric.  The existing-home resales graph continues to show a very positive trend.  Resales have rebounded strongly from a low point in early 2008.  
A lot of these resales had been vacant homes with an inactive meter.  So this rebound in resales combined with fewer disconnects has translated into real customer growth in the last three quarters.  
There are still a significant number of foreclosed properties in the market, but RealtyTrac reports the number declining from about 16,500 in the Tampa Area at the ended of the first quarter to about 14,500 currently. 
This absorption of foreclosed properties is probably attributable to the demand created by the Homebuyer Tax Credit Program.  
New single-family building permits climbed significantly in the first quarter, but they feel sharply in the second.  This appears to be Homebuyer Tax Credit driven as well, but it did put construction workers back on the job for the first has of the year.  
As I’ve said, these are positive trends that are giving us cause for optimism, but there is a degree of uncertainty about the strength of the Tampa Area housing market after the expiration of that credit program.  
Now, turning to our unregulated operations, at TECO Coal, we expect improved results in 2010 from better margins.  We know expect sales to be 9 million tons, which is above the previously provided range of 8.3 to 8.7 million tons.  
All of these sales are contracted at an average price of almost $77 a ton.  We’ve been able to sell additional tons, much of it out of inventory that built up into 2009, into the PCI market.  This will shift our sales mix closer to 40% specialty coals this year and the remainder steam.  
We’ve been able to sell some coal in the MET market that we would ordinarily sell into the steam coal market at better margins this year.  
Traditionally, we sell very little coal into this so-called crossover market.  So we’re not necessarily counting on selling into that market next year.  
On the cost side, total costs in the second quarter was in line with our guidance, and we’re projecting that for the year, we’ll be towards the high end of the $65 to $69 per ton cost range.  
This is a result of increased safety inspections which reduced productivity and higher contract miner costs.  
What we don’t know yet is the potential longer-term cost impact of the Upper Big Branch mine tragedy.  Beyond this year, there will probably be some new safety regulations that may add cost and impact productivity, but it’s too early to tell at this point.  
Despite reports that the MET coal market is weakened, we are still experiencing good demand for our High-Vol A and High-Vol B products and our customers continue to take their contracted volumes.  
We had one customer idol a blast furnace, but we were able to sell those tons elsewhere, actually at better prices.  
The operating rate for the domestic steel industry is currently at about 71%, down slightly from 74% earlier in the year, and a vast improvement from the 40% operating rate that it had experienced for much of the first half of 2008.
Asian demand for MET coal is apparently moderated somewhat, but both India and China continue to import significant tonnage.  
Some forecasts show Chinese demands slowing in the second half of the year, but still at a level that’s driving very strong prices compared to 2009.  
As strong as the MET market is, the Central App Steam Coal market continues to lag it, although the cold winter and hot summer weather have reduced utility inventories.  
Natural gas prices are a level that is encouraged fuel switching from coal to natural gas, but the summer heat is keeping the base-load coal-fired units operating.  
There have been a number of utility steam-poll RSPs in the market over the past few months, with most buyers looking for tons for deliver in 2011 and beyond.  
We’re encouraged that buyers are looking for coal but don’t foresee a significant improvement in the steam market before the end of the year at the earliest.  
This is the bar graph of contracted and price tons that we routinely provide.  You can see that there really hasn’t bee much of a change for 2011 or 2012.  The graph shows that the contracted and priced tons for 2011 are primarily steam coal, where 75% of those tons are currently priced.  
You can also see that the majority of our MET and PCI coal remains unsold for 2011.  
The real steam-coal opportunity is in 2012 when a below-market steam coal contract representing 600,000 tons rolls off.  Based on our signed contract prices, product mix, and current market conditions, we would expect our average price per ton across all products to be above $78 per ton in 2011. 
On the MET coal side, typically North American MET coal customers don’t contract for the next year until late in the third quarter or early in the fourth.  And European customers typically contract in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year, depending on market conditions.  
At TECO Guatemala, we expect the San Jose Power Station to operate more normally in 2010 following the unplanned outages we experienced last year.  
As a result of those outages, capacity payments were lower in the first half of 2010, until the outage days rolled out of the 12-month rolling average availability factor that has penalized those payment.  
In 2009, the lower capacity payments reduced net income about 4 million in the second half of the year.  
The capacity payments are now back to the normal contract levels for the remainder of 2010.  
First quarter spot sales from San Jose were stronger than expected, primarily due to high resid fuel-oil prices, which is a fuel that sets the market clearing price, and lower-than-normal output from hydroelectric sources due to a poor rainy season last year.  
Normal rainfall resumed in the second quarter so we expect that spot sales will be at more normal levels for the remainder of the year.  
At the Alborada Power Station, we have expended the power sales contract for five years at a lower capacity charge.  The lower pricing was driven by changes in the Guatemalan power market.  
When we first built the plant in 1996, the country badly needed new capacity.  And Alborada operated far more than you would expect a peaking plant to operate.  
The electricity market in Guatemala has developed significantly in the last 15 years, and the Alborada Plant now operates like a typical peaking unit.  And the revised capacity charge is reflective of that.  
The contract extension is effective September 14th and the lower capacity payments will reduce net income about 7 million over a full 12-month period and our guidance for the year includes the 3 ½-month impact of the lower pricing in 2010.  
At DECA II, which is the entity that holds our interest in EEGSA, our issue with the way the value-added distribution rate, or VAD was set in 2008 remains unresolved with no definitive timeframe for resolution despite some efforts to resolve it amicably.  
We do have the option to file under the Dominican Republic Central American Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA, but as you would expect, this is not a quick solution.  In the meantime, the management at EEGSA has taken steps to reduce costs to partially mitigate the effects of the lower VAD and EEGSA continues to experience good customer and energy sales growth.  
In addition, the small-unregulated companies at DECA II continue to contribute good earnings.  
Let me close with our plan to meet with and communicate with investors over the next two months.  We will file our Second Quarter 10Q tomorrow.  And we’ll be at the Wellington Shields Conference next week, and ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange at the end of the month in honor of our 45th year of being listed on the Exchange.  
In September, we’ll be meeting with investors in North America and Europe.  And end the month at the Banc of America Merrill Lynch Conference in New York.  
And now, I will turn it over to the Operator to open the lines for your questions.

Let me just say on the coal question, we have not put together our business plans yet, but what Sandy reported to you is kind of where we see everything coming together next year.  And our thinking is, you know, steam sales would start kind of with a 7, PCI in the mid 90s and our type of MET coal north of 120.  And that’s kind of the thinking behind that $78 number, plus what we’ve contracted that we have out there.  
At the utility, I think what we’ve been saying for a while is the old normal at about 2 1/2% growth is not what we’re expecting and planning to run our business at.  We think the more normal growth might be 1 ½ to maybe 2%.  And that’s how we’re planning to run the business, and that’s how we organized ourselves to run the business. 
The good news on the upside is to get from where we were to that new normal, we thought this year would be flat on customer growth, and next year might be ½%.  We’re already seeing that ½% for next year in the first six months of this year.  So that’s a positive thing.  
And that’s the way we’re looking at the business.  We think that’s a conservative way to run the business and if it’s more than that, it’s easier to adjust to the upside.  And that’s our longer-term view.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us so late in the day today. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and business drivers and then I'll update our expectations for 2010, what we're seeing in the Florida and local economy, and finally update you on our communications plan.
In the first quarter, our GAAP net income was $55.8 million compared to $34.7 million in 2009. Earnings per share were $0.26 in the first quarter compared to $0.16 in 2009. Net income included a $16.2 million charge for early debt retirement and the final $900,000 charge related to last year's restructuring action.
The $5.1 million of net gains in 2009 included the gain on the sale of our interest in the Guatemalan company, Navega, and a negative valuation adjustment to auction rate security. Excluding charges and gains, non-GAAP results were $72.9 million, or $0.34 on a per share basis this quarter, compared to $29.6 million or $0.14 a share in 2009.
We covered the quarter's drivers in our earnings release, so I'll just recap the highlights. Tampa Electric reported first quarter results that were substantially above last year. One of the most significant drivers for the quarter was the abnormally cold weather experienced throughout Florida. It was the coldest sustained winter weather in the Tampa area in over 40 years.
We estimate that weather-driven sales added $15 million to $20 million to base revenues in the first quarter. New base rates, effective last year and on January 1 of this year, added $25 million to $30 million to base revenues in the quarter. 
Retail sales increased 7.4% in the quarter driven by the colder-than-normal weather. And we also saw 0.4% customer growth, which is stronger than we expected in the current economy.
Total degree days were 37% above normal and 33% above 2009's first quarter. Due to the cold weather in the quarter, heating degree days were actually 150% above normal, but cooling degree days were 85% below normal. 
Non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses were 9% lower this quarter and actually slightly below 2008's first quarter level, reflecting the benefits of last year's restructuring and the timing of generating unit maintenance outages.
Peoples Gas also reported significantly higher results for the quarter, driven by the cold weather and the new base rates effective in June last year. We estimate that the cold weather added about $10 million to base revenue, and the base rate increase added about $1 million in the first quarter. 
The rates approved in 2009 have a higher fixed component but a lower volume-related charge. This shift drives the disproportionate effect to weather in the higher-volume winter months, but it makes Peoples Gas less weather-sensitive for the rest of the year.
Peoples Gas had 0.2% higher average number of customers this quarter compared to last year, but these appear to be mostly seasonal residents returning to Florida for the winter. Following the normal spring pattern, we expect many of these customers to go back to inactive status in the second quarter.
Higher therm sales to commercial and industrial customers are partially driven by the weather, and we're seeing some customers actually increase usage. For the unregulated company, TECO Coal's results for the quarter were well above last year, reflecting higher selling prices across all products and the benefit of the $3.3 million settlement of state income tax issues.
Sales volumes were slightly lower at 2.1 million tons compared to 2.3 million in the first quarter of 2009. Volumes were affected in January and February by harsh winter weather that disrupted rail service and hindered mining activities, but we were able to make up most of those tons in March. The average selling price for the quarter increased 10% over last year to more than $76 per ton due to higher prices for met coal and the higher percentage of met coal in the mix compared to 2009.
Production costs increased 4%, which is higher than expected. The higher costs were driven primarily by reclamation activities earlier in the year than planned and lower productivity due to winter weather conditions in January and February. TECO Coal's effective income tax rate varies from quarter-to-quarter due to the mine's specific effects of percentage depletion. Excluding the benefit from the income tax settlement, at 23% this quarter it was close to the expected normal 25% effective rate.
First quarter net income at TECO Guatemala was significantly higher than its non-GAAP results last year. The biggest driver for the improved results was the San Jose Power Station, which operated throughout the quarter when compared to last year, when it was out of service for most of the quarter due to extended unplanned outages.
TECO Guatemala was able to make spot sales from the San Jose plant throughout the quarter at good margins, primarily due to high residual oil prices, which set the market clearing price for spot sales. The capacity payments for San Jose are calculated on a rolling 12-month availability factor, and they are reduced if that factor falls below 85%. Thus, results for the quarter reflect $2 million lower capacity payments as a result of last year's outages.
Results for the DECA II company, which include the regulated distribution company EEGSA and its unregulated affiliates, reflect the benefits of customer and energy sales growth and cost control measures of the utility and higher earnings from the affiliates. Offsetting this was the absence of earnings from Navega, which was sold in the first quarter last year.
In the first quarter, we completed the major components of a debt management plan. We tendered foreign purchase, $300 million of 7% debt, and issued lower cost debt at a very favorable interest rate environment. We recorded a $16.2 million non-GAAP charge in the first quarter, primarily related to the tender premium.
In April, we retired $100 million of floating rate notes due in May and an additional $100 million of 2011 TECO Energy notes. We'll record an additional $4.1 million non-GAAP charge in the second quarter for the early retirement of the 2011 notes.
These actions reduced our refinancing risk associated with the significant 2011 and 2012 debt maturities. Now only $300 million of the holding company debt due on '11 and '12 remains outstanding, and we plan to retire that at maturity, consistent with our debt reduction objective. And we'll have the benefit of lower interest expense at TECO Energy. 
We're maintaining our 2010 earnings per share guidance that we provided in February in a range between $1.20 and $1.35 per share, excluding charges and gains. We've provided guidance in a range to accommodate variability and factors such as weather, where we've already seen an extreme variation from normal winter weather, the timing and strength of an economic recovery in Florida, and deliveries under our coal contract. And I'll discuss these last two factors further in a minute.
This chart clearly shows the improved earnings trajectory that TECO Energy is on. The results shown here have been adjusted to remove charges and gains, TECO merchant generation, TECO transport and sin fuel to put it on a comparable basis to our current business component. In 2009's actual results and in our forecast for 2010, you can see the benefit from the new base rates at both utilities and from improved coal margins.
Now turning to what we're seeing in the local and state economies and the prospects for recovery. We're seeing signs of improvement in the local housing market, but we believe a significant portion of that improvement may be driven by the home-buyer tax credit program that effectively ended April 30. While we're cautiously optimistic about the recovery in the housing market, there is considerable uncertainty about the sustainability of these improvements without the benefit of the tax credit program.
Economists are mixed in their assessments of the timing of a recovery in Florida. Lower unemployment is a key to a recovery. And most forecasts are for unemployment to improve in 2010, but they disagree as to the timing.
Despite the weather-driven energy sales growth in the first quarter, we're maintaining a conservative outlook for weather-normalized energy sales for the rest of the year. We're assuming slightly lower sales for the full year due to expected continued weakness among commercial and non-phosphate industrial customers. There have been pockets of improvement in some commercial and industrial sales, apparently driven by some of the federal stimulus dollars, including the home-buyer tax credit program, but it's not widespread.
We know that commercial energy sales growth lags residential on both the way up and on the way down. Until we see a consistent turn in the residential energy sales, we think it's too early to forecast an improvement in commercial and industrial. In short, although we're encouraged by some of the positive signs including some recent customer growth, it's too early to declare this a trend, and we remain cautious in our outlook.
The next couple of slides are graphics that demonstrate some of the positive signs that we've started to see. The first slide is the unemployment trends that we've seen over the last 15 months. The key point to note is the rollover in the Tampa area unemployment after January of this year. The employment rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics declines from 12.7% to 12.3% in the most recent report and is now in line with the state.
The next slide shows our electric company customer additions in a couple of different ways. On the left, is a monthly sequential customer add. Starting last fall, the additions have been consistently positive after repeated dips into negative territory over the last three years.
The graph on the right is our cumulative customer additions, which is showing a very positive upturn since last fall. The important note on this slide is actually the footnote. We've now recovered more customers than we disconnected since the start of the housing crisis.
This slide shows an important reason for the customer growth that we've reported the last two quarters. This is inactive, or percentage of inactive meters. Even in the worst month of the housing crisis, we were actually adding customers, although in lower numbers. The problem was that we were turning customers off faster than we were turning them on. So these were vacant builder inventory homes with minimal usage and some of them were foreclosures.
Starting early last fall though, the number of meters being turned off slowed, such that meter turnoffs were no longer completely canceling out new customer additions.
On this slide, we show existing home resales and new single-family building permits issued in areas served by Tampa Electric. Again, both graphs show very positive trends. Existing home resales have rebounded strongly from the low point in early 2009. And it is a combination of higher home sales and fewer disconnected meters that is now showing up as real customer growth.
There are still a significant number of foreclosed properties in the Tampa market. But the number of foreclosed properties as reported by RealtyTrac has been fairly stable at around 16,500 in the Tampa area since the first of the year. New single-family building permits have climbed significantly in the first quarter.
This activity is probably home-buyer tax credit-driven as well, but it has put construction workers back on the job. And we've seen a slight pick up in energy consumption from some of the Industrial customers that serve new construction.
As I've said, these are positive trends that are giving us cause for optimism, but there is a high degree of uncertainty about the strength of the Tampa area housing market absent the home-buyer tax credits.
Now turning to our unregulated operation. At TECO Coal, we expect improved results in 2010 from better margin. We now expect sales to be towards the high end of the 8.3 million to 8.7 million ton range that we previously provided. All of these sales are contracted at an average price of more than $75 per ton. The range was originally provided in case steam coal tons were deferred by our utility customers. We've had a couple of customers defer about 250,000 tons of steam coal, which we've been able to sell into the PCI market. This will shift our sales mix to about 35% specialty coal and the remainder, steam.
On the cost side, even though production costs were above our projections in the first quarter, we believe that the all-in total cost will still be between $65 and $69 a ton for the full year. What we don't know yet is the potential cost impact of the Upper Big Branch mine tragedy. We expect in the near term that there may be more inspections, which will impact productivity.
Longer term, there'll probably be new safety regulations that may add cost and impact productivity, but it's too early to tell.
Market conditions for met coal are very strong. The Domestic steel industry recently reported that the operating rate is up to 74%. This compares to the 40% operating rate for much of the first half of 2008. 
Asian demand for met coal has been and remains very strong, with both India and China importing significantly more tons over the past year. Some recent forecasts have shown Chinese demands slowing in the second half of the year but still at a level that's driving higher prices.
The prospect of losing 2 million tons per year of high-quality met coal from Massey's Upper Big Branch mine caused an immediate price reaction in the met coal market, which has subsequently subsided somewhat as buyers found replacement coal.
But as strong as the met market is, the Central App steam coal market continues to lag it. The cold winter weather helped reduce utility inventory, but they're still high. And natural gas prices have come down to a level that's encouraging some fuel switching from coal to natural gas.
The positive factor there is that the voracious appetite for met coal is allowing high-quality steam coal ton to crossover to that market. When the steam coal market does recover, based on better pricing in the met market, those tons will probably stay in the met market, which could lead to better pricing in the steam market. That being said, we don't foresee an improvement in the steam market until the second half of the year at the earliest.
At TECO Guatemala, we expect the San Jose Power Station to operate more normally in 2010 following the unplanned outages that we experienced in 2009. As a result of those 2009 outages, the capacity payments will be lower in the first half of the year until the outage months roll out of the 12-month rolling average availability factor that has penalized those payments.
In 2009, the lower capacity payments reduced net income about $4 million in the second half of the year. We expect the capacity payments to return to the normal contract level in the second half of 2010.
With oil prices near $80 a barrel, margins for spot energy sales can be between $20 and $40 per megawatt hour. We have 7 megawatts to 10 megawatts of capacity above our contract generation available for spot sales depending on operating conditions. First quarter spot sales were stronger than expected, primarily due to high residual fuel oil prices, which is the fuel that sets the market clearing price, and lower than normal hydroelectric resources due to a poor rainy season last year. With a return to normal rainfall, we would expect spot sales to be at more moderate levels for the remainder of the year.
At the Alborada Power Station, we're continuing our discussions with the Guatemalan regulators to extend the current contract, which expires in September, for five years. At DECA II, which is the entity that holds our interest in EEGSA, the VAD remains unresolved with no definitive timeframe for resolution despite our continued efforts to resolve it amicably. Our ultimate option is to file under the Dominican Republic's Central American Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA, but this is not a quick solution.
In the meantime, the management at EEGSA has taken steps to reduce costs to partially mitigate the effects of the lower VAD, and EEGSA continues to experience strong customer and energy sales growth. We also have the small unregulated companies at DECA II that continues to contribute very good earnings.
Let me close with our plans to meet with and communicate with investors over the next two months. Our annual shareholder meeting is tomorrow morning, and we plan to file our first quarter 10-Q on Thursday. We'll be at AGA in Palm Beach in two weeks, making a presentation that Tuesday morning, and meeting with many of you over the two days.
We'll be at the City Conference in Washington on June 7, and at the EEI financial conference in New York in late June.
Now, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the lines for your questions."

I know there is a crush of utility earnings reports ahead of the EI. Mark covered the agenda for today, so I will move right into it.
In the third quarter, our GAAP net income was $51 million or $0.24 a share compared with $64.8 million or $0.30 a share in 2009. Net income this quarter included $23.1 million of net charges and gains, including a $24.9 million tax charge on undistributed earnings as a result of the sale of DECA II and a $1.8 million benefit from the recovery of fees from the previously sold McAdams Power Station.
In the third quarter of 2009, net income included $20.6 million of charges for restructuring and a write-off of project development costs at Tampa Electric. Excluding these charges and gains, non-GAAP results were $74.1 million or $0.35 a share this quarter, compared to $85.6 million or $0.40 in 2009. And remember that non-GAAP results this quarter were negatively impacted by $14.7 million or $0.07 a share as a result of Tampa Electric's recognition of the $24 million one-time reduction in base revenue under the Florida Public Service Commission approved regulatory stipulation.
Our year-to-date net income was $182.3 million or $0.85 per share compared to $160.4 million or $0.75 per share last year. In addition to the third quarter items, net income in 2010 included the early debt retirement charges and the final item from the restructuring that was recorded in the first quarter.
In 2009, net income included a gain on the sale of our interest in Navega and a loss on auction rate securities in addition to the third quarter item. So excluding these charges and gains, non-GAAP results were $226.6 million or $1.06 on a per share basis compared to $176.1 million or $0.82 in 2009.
I will briefly highlight the quarter's drivers that were covered in detail in our earnings release today. Tampa Electric reported third quarter results below last year's non-GAAP results, reflecting the effect of the one-time base revenue reduction of $24 million recorded in the quarter. Results reflect favorable summer weather and continued customer growth. Tampa Electric also had the effect of the higher base rates related to the step increase effective January 1 of this year and slightly higher non-fuel O&M expense.
We estimate that hot summer weather added $6 million to $8 million to base revenues in the third quarter and that the new base rates effective January 1 added $7 million to $9 million. Retail sales increased 3.6% in the quarter. This reflects hotter than normal summer weather with total degree days 6% above normal and 4% above 2009 third quarter.
We also experienced 0.8% customer growth quarter-over-quarter, which is stronger than we expected. Peoples Gas reported lower results for the quarter although customer numbers and therm sales both grew.
Due to the abnormally cold winter weather earlier in the year, Peoples Gas expects to earn above the top of this allowed ROE range this year. As a result, in the second quarter, we recorded a provision related to these potential earnings above the top of that range.
In the third quarter, Peoples recorded an additional provision to reflect the expectation as of September 30th. The final disposition of any earnings above the range, of course, will be determined by the commission after the end of the year.
The average number of gas customers increased six tenth of a percent this quarter compared to last year, which we didn't expect earlier in the year. We also saw higher therm sales to commercial and industrial customers driven by the return to service of some customers idled in 2009 and higher usage by others.
For the unregulated companies, TECO Coal's results for the quarter reflected higher selling prices across all products but higher production costs as well. Sales volumes were slightly lower than last year at 2.2 million tons compared to 2.3 million tons in 2009 third quarter. The average selling price for the quarter rose to $76 per ton due to higher prices for met coal compared to $73 last year.
Due to transportation issues, there was a higher percentage of steam coal in the product mix in the third quarter than there was in the first half. The all-in cost of production was almost $71 per ton which is above the guidance range that we provided in August. The higher cost was driven by the timing of surface mine reclamation work, increased safety activities which impacted production and contract miner availability.
Third quarter GAAP net income at TECO Guatemala reflected the $24.9 million tax charge related to the undistributed earnings from DECA II due to its sale announced last week. Non-GAAP results were significantly higher than last year due to a $3.6 million insurance recovery related to the extended unplanned outages of the San José Power Station last year and capacity revenues returning to normal levels.
The capacity payments for San José are calculated on a rolling 12-month availability factor and are reduced if that factor falls below 85%. The plant has operated normally since going back into service in mid-2009. So the third quarter this year reflects a full quarter with capacity payments at normal levels compared to last year when they were reduced as a result of the outages.
Guatemala experienced record rainfall in the second and third quarters, which increased the availability of low-cost hydroelectric power in the country. This reduced spot sales from San José to below normal levels.
The Alborada Power Station contract renewal at a lower capacity price was affected in mid-September. While the impact was minimal in the third quarter, it will be a factor in the fourth quarter and in 2011. Prior to its sale, results for the DECA II companies, which includes a regulated distribution company EEGSA and its unregulated affiliates, reflected the benefits of customer and energy sales growth and cost control measures at the utility as well as higher earnings from the affiliates.
We announced last week that we sold our 30% ownership interest in DECA II, the joint venture that held an 81% ownership interest in EEGSA and the smaller affiliated companies. Our share of the sale proceeds was $181.5 million. We will record a $38 million pre-tax book gain on the sale in the fourth quarter and a total of about 440 million of U.S. and Guatemalan taxes on the transaction in combination between the third and the fourth quarters.
We recorded $24.9 million of the $40 million in the third quarter with a tax charge on the undistributed earnings from DECA II. Because these earnings were in the tax deferral structure, we recorded the taxes at September 30, recognizing that the October sale would unwind that structure.
So the after-tax gain in the fourth quarter will be approximately $23 million. Total cash to TECO Energy was 4205 million which included the net sale proceeds plus $25 million that was held offshore in the tax deferral structure.
In July, we tightened our 2010 earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share excluding charges and gains and including the $24 million one-time reduction in Tampa Electric's customer bills under the regulatory agreement. The guidance also included one quarter of lower earnings from the Alborada Power Station's reduced capacity price under the newly expanded contract.
Our guidance includes sales at TECO Coal of almost 9 million tons this year at a cost of production at the high end of our cost guidance range. And it also assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year for the utilities but October has been milder than normal. As a result of the two months of lower earnings at TECO Guatemala from the DECA II sale and margin compression at TECO Coal, we believe that it is unlikely that results will exceed the middle of our guidance range for this year.
Now, turning to what we're seeing in the local and state economies and prospects for recovery. In the first half of the year, we saw improvement in the local housing market. Existing home resales were strong and new home building permits rose.
In the third quarter, local housing market trends, mirrored national trends and both resales and new construction permits, as we expected, declined due to the expiration of the home buyer tax credit program that had boosted demand in the first half of the year. Unemployment in the state and local areas remained higher than the national levels.
From the peak in the summer of 2006 to the trough earlier this year, Florida lost 937,000 jobs and included in that total are 123,000 jobs lost in the Tampa area. Fully one-third of those job losses were in the construction industry, where the housing market contraction hit hard.
The good news is that Florida is adding jobs, but like the national economy, it is doing so slowly. Compared to the second quarter of 2009, Florida added 53,000 jobs by the second quarter of 2010.
Economists remain mixed in their assessments of the timing of a recovery in Florida. Lower unemployment is key to a recovery and most forecast are for unemployment to improve starting in late 2010 or early 2011, but they do disagree at the timing and magnitude.
We are still seeing pockets of improvement in some commercial and industrial sales. But they tend to be very customer and industry-specific, some of which is apparently driven by some federal stimulus dollars.
At Peoples Gas, we're still seeing increased usage by some steel processing, chemical and glass manufacturing facilities. So perhaps the customer growth we've seen and the pockets of improvement in some commercial and industrial sales is indicative that an upturn has begun. We're encouraged by some of the positive signs, particularly having seen now four consecutive quarters of year-over-year customer growth, but we remain cautious in our outlook.
On this slide, we show existing home resales specific to the Tampa area and new single-family building permits issued in areas served by Tampa Electric. Despite the fall of in activity in July, the existing home resales graph shows a long-term positive trend as you can see from the trend line.
There are still a significant number of foreclosed properties in the market, which are affecting home prices and inventory levels. But RealtyTrac reports the number of foreclosed properties on the market has continued to decline. In Hillsborough County which is Tampa and the surrounding area, it stands at about 13,500 currently, down from 14,500 at the end of the second quarter and 16,500 at the end of the first quarter.
New single family building permits climbed significantly in the first quarter but fell sharply in the second in anticipation of the expiration of tax credit. Following that drop, the general level of activity is higher than at the bottom of the housing market in the fall of 2008. So again, some positive trends that are giving us cause for optimism for continued growth beyond 2010.
And now turning to our unregulated operations, TECO Coal expects sales to be near 9 million tons. All of these sales are contracted at an average price of $76 per ton. That price is down slightly from our earlier expectation due to the product mix in the second half of the year shifting a little more to steam coal.
On the cost side, total costs in the third quarter exceeded our $65 to $69 per-ton cost guidance and confirms our expectation of full-year costs at the top of that range. This is a result of increased safety inspections and requirements, which reduce productivity, higher contract miner costs and some additional reclamation work.
Although the slightly different sales mix and higher costs compressed margins in the third quarter, TECO Coal continues to expect 2010 results substantially above last year. The domestic steel industry continues to operate in the 70% capacity utilization range and coke ovens are operating at high levels.
The forecast for 2011 is for steel production to increase 5% worldwide which should support continued strong met coal prices. After a dip in exports in the late summer, it appears that demand for customers in Asia has rebounded.
As strong as the met market is, the Central App steam coal market continues to lag it. Although the cold winter and hot summer weather did reduce utility inventories, they are not at levels low enough to drive utilities to contract for near-term deliveries. In addition, natural gas prices are at a level that encourages fuel switching from coal to natural gas during the fall shoulder months.
There have been utility steam coal RFPs in the market, with most buyers looking for tons for delivery beyond 2011. We are encouraged that buyers are looking for coal but don't foresee a significant improvement in the steam market before inventories come down further sometime next year.
At TECO Guatemala, we expect the San José Power Station to continue to operate normally in 2010. As a result of last year's outages, capacity payments were lower in the first half of 2010 until the outage days rolled out of the availability calculation that has penalized those payments. In 2009 the lower capacity payments reduced net income about $4 million in the second half of the year, but the capacity payments are back to the normal contract levels in the second half of this year.
First quarter spot sales from San José were stronger than expected, primarily due to high residual fuel oil prices, which is the fuel that sets the market clearing price and lower than normal output from hydroelectric resources due to a poor rainy season last year. But record rainfall in the second and third quarters has now made low-cost hydro power abundant, so we expect that spot sales will be below normal levels for the rest of the year.
Alborada Power Station results will have the fourth quarter impact of a lower capacity price in the extended power sales contract which became effective September 14. The lower capacity payments will reduce net income about $7 million over a full 12-month period and our guidance for the year includes the 3.5 month impact of the lower pricing in 2010. And finally, the sale last week of our ownership interest in DECA II reduces net income about $2 million in the fourth quarter.
And now turning to the business drivers that we see for 2011, the operating companies are in the process of developing their detailed business plans right now and so we plan to provide our formal 2011 guidance at the time of our fourth quarter earnings call in early February. For the Florida utilities, we expect them to earn within their allowed ROE bands. At Tampa Electric that's a midpoint of 11.25% and at Peoples Gas the midpoint is 10.75%.
In Florida the allowed band is plus or minus 100 basis points around that midpoint. Customer sales growth is sensitive to a continued economic recovery. So far this year the utilities have experienced better than expected growth and we anticipate growth to continue in 2011 at about the 2010 level or maybe a little stronger. The predicted slow improvement in employment should support continued economic recovery. In 2011 we don't expect any major regulatory action beyond the routine activities such as fuel filing.
In 2011 for TECO Coal, we expect sales to be between 8.5 and 9 million tons with a mix of 35% specialty coal, which includes met, PCI and a small amount of stoker coal and 65% sold to utilities steam customers. Currently about 90% of expected sales for next year are either contracted or prices have been agreed to at an average selling price across all products of $85 per ton. The remaining 10% represents mostly steam coal with lesser amounts of met and sulfur in the mix. If the market is there, we may be able to sell the uncontracted steam coal as either PCI or met coal in the crossover market.
We do expect the cost of production to rise next year. As we have seen in the past and strong markets, contract miners expect to share in the better pricing environment, so we anticipate higher rates in 2011. We've also experienced higher operating costs due to new safety requirements and increased safety inspections in 2010 and expect that trend to continue in 2011.
It is likely that there will be new rules in some fashion as a result of the Upper Big Branch mine accident, but we don't know exactly what they'll be yet. And on the surface mining side of the business, the delays in issuing new permits is expected to increase cost as we manage mining operations to maintain production. At TECO Guatemala, we expect normal power plant operations in 2011 and the full year of Alborada's lower capacity price.
This is a bar graph of contracted and priced tons that we routinely provide and you can see here the progress that we've made in contracting 2011. And we contracted a few more steam coal tons for 2012. The real steam coal opportunity is in 2012 when a below-market steam coal contract, representing 600,000 tons, rolls off.
On the met coal side, our North American met coal customers have pretty much concluded their 2011 requirements and actually taken more than in prior years. At this time we don't have significant tons available for the European customers that typically contract in late fourth quarter or the first quarter of the next year.
I'll close with our investor communications plans over the next two months. We will not be at EEI this year due to a schedule conflict with the TECO Energy Board of Directors Meeting. The logistics of getting back and forth to Palm Springs to have enough time to have meaningful meetings with investors and still meet our board meeting obligations unfortunately just did not work.
We plan to file our third quarter 10-Q next week. And after a very busy late summer and fall investor meeting schedule, the activities will be slower heading into year end. We will be at the BMO Conference in New York on November 30 and because we will not be at EEI, Mark will be coordinating meetings with investors in New York the following day on December 1.
And now I will turn it over to the operator to open up the lines for your questions.
