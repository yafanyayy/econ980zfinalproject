Good morning, everyone. 2009 was another good year for the company, and we remain confident about our future. Clearly, there were significant and very challenges to many business around the world this past year. Yet within this environmen",701,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. 2009 was another good year for the company, and we remain confident about our future. Clearly, there were significant and very challenges to many business around the world this past year. Yet within this environment, we stayed true to the strategic direction we set several years ago. We have the right strategy, the right processes and the right talent in place to meet our customers' needs and to deliver strong financial results. We believe our performance reflects the strength of our strategic planning and execution, and our company's alignment with customer priorities. We're well positioned to take advantage of the changes taking place in the world, to build on our record of performance and to create value for our customers and our shareholders.Looking at 2009, we had a book-to-bill ratio of greater than one, and we ended the year with a backlog of $37 billion, including the highest year-end funded backlog in the company's history. Our full year sales were up 7%. Our EPS was up 24%. We generated strong cash flow, and we continued to improve our return on invested capital. As we mentioned in October, we expect to deliver solid growth in 2010. Dave will provide you with more color on our financial performance, both for the quarter and for the year in a few minutes and our outlook for 2010. But I wanted to first hit a couple of the highlights. We continue to see good performance across our portfolio, which is recognized by our customers. It's clearly a major contributing factor to our growth, both in the U.S. and international markets.Within these markets, we're seeing strong demand in important areas to Raytheon. A good example is missile defense. The administration has identified our Standard Missile-3 and X-band radars as critical elements in the missile defense systems for the U.S. and our allies around the world. Other countries like the UAE, Taiwan and Japan that confirmed their need for world-class capabilities. We're seeing strong support domestically and international for our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance work, particularly in the classified arena. There's also increasing demand for our Homeland Security Solutions, which were highlighted by a $446 million international classified award in the fourth quarter. Our bookings in Homeland Security doubled in 2009, and our sales growth over the past two years have averaged just under 20%.Training also continues to be a strong area. We booked $1.3 billion in domestic and foreign operational training programs during 2009. As you would expect, there's also increasing demand for our world-class cyber solutions, which are setting new standards in the emerging market space. And our core business continued to do well. In Missiles, for example, we're seeing strong demand for AMRAAM  [Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile], Evolved SeaSparrow, Standard Missile-2, TOW [Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire-guided] and Phalanx, just to mention a few. In addition to focusing our customers to meet their priorities, as a technology company, we are able to both forward fit and backward fit our solutions to enhance our customers' capabilities. As a result, we are able to react quickly to meet our customers mission-critical needs at an affordable cost. Our broad range of customer span, the major U.S. defense and security agencies, and we do business in 80 countries around the world. 30% of our total bookings and 21% of our total sales during the year were from international customers. Going forward, we believe that our international business will continue to be a key driver in Raytheon's growth.In summary, our businesses are performing well with over 8,000 programs and 15,000 contracts. We have a diverse portfolio. We are well positioned, and we will continue to be a predictable performer. Our portfolio is built on capabilities that support and meet the global needs of our customers both today and tomorrow. With that, I'd like to recognize the entire Raytheon team for successfully executing our strategy and supporting our customer-focused mission, which is to ensure customer success.We started in 2009 with 73,000 employees, and we begin the new year with 75,000 strong. All of us are committed to our customers and our shareholders, and we're excited about the future. With that, I'll now turn it over to Dave."

And I'll discuss our outlook for 2010 and after that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our website. Okay. So if everyone would please move to Page 3, we delivered strong results in both the quarter and the full year. We booked $25.1 billion in new business, ending the year with a $36.9 billion backlog. Our 10% sales growth during the quarter and 7% sales growth for the year highlight the continued demand for our solutions and the strength of our business. Fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.30, up 29% and for the full year, $4.89, up 24%. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $2.7 billion during the year. For 2010, we expect another year of solid sales growth and strong operational performance, and we're reaffirming the guidance that we've provided you on October. I'll discuss our guidance further in just a few minutes.If you'd now turn to Page 4, I'll go through some the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. Again strong bookings of $7.1 billion in the quarter and $25.1 billion for the full year resulted in a backlog of $36.9 billion. 39% of our total bookings during the quarter and 30% of our total bookings for the year were from international customers. As a reminder, in Q4 of 2008, we had especially strong bookings primarily related to the $2.5 billion UAE Patriot contract. Our book-to-bill ratio for both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2009 was greater than one, which bodes well for our future. Here are some of the highlights during the quarter. IDS booked $990 million to provide advanced Patriot Air and Missile Defense capability for Taiwan, and $160 million related to the renewal of an international Patriot technical support contract. IDS also booked $315 million for systems design work for the Zumwalt-class destroyer for the U.S. Navy. IIS booked $153 million on a contract to provide ISR support to the U.S. Air Force, and $519 million on a number of classified contracts.Missile Systems booked $222 million for the production of SM-2 for international customers in the U.S. Navy, and a little over $100 million for the development of SM-3 for the Missile Defense Agency. MS also booked $201 million for the production of the Evolved SeaSparrow Missile for international customers in the U.S. Navy, $170 million for the production of Maverick missiles for an international customer and $111 million for the production of TOW missiles for international customers and the U.S. Army.NCS booked $446 million on an international classified program. NCS also booked an additional $127 million for a TOW system replacement program. SAS booked $122 million for the B-2 Radar program, and $131 million on a number of classified contracts. Technical Services booked $67 million for work on domestic operational training programs for the U.S. Army. If you'd move to Page 5, we continue to deliver strong sales growth, 10% on the quarter and 7% on the full year. IDS had fourth quarter 2009 net sales of $1.5 billion, up 8% for the quarter and 7% for the full year, primarily due to growth on international Patriot programs. IIS had fourth quarter 2009 net sales of $803 million. For the year, IIS net sales were up 2%, primarily the result of growth on various classified programs, partially offset as expected by lower sales on the international e-Borders program. As we said in the past, the initial development phase of this program was completed in the early part of 2009.Missile Systems net sales of $1.4 billion, up 3% for both the quarter and for the year. Missile's net sales in 2009 were driven by higher volume on the SM-3 and Maverick programs. NCS had fourth quarter 2009 net sales of $1.3 billion. For the quarter, sales were up 12% and for the year, sales were up 7%, primarily due to higher volume on various production programs mainly for the U.S. Army.Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 9% and for the year, net sales of $4.6 billion, or up 7% driven by growth on their classified business. Technical Services had fourth quarter 2009 net sales of $888 million, up 19%, full year sales of $3.2 billion, or up 22%. The sales growth of TS during both periods was due to strong growth in domestic and foreign operational training programs supporting the U.S. Army, as well as on ATCOTS [Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solution] program for the Federal Aviation Administration. Moving to Page 6, we delivered strong operational performance in both the quarter and the full year. Our total operating margin was up 130 basis points for the quarter and up 90 basis points for the year. As a reminder, our fourth quarter and full year 2008 operating margin included a $45 million after tax unfavorable CAS pension adjustment. This was due to the impact of pension asset returns on existing contracts during 2008.Looking at the business margins, IDS had solid results in both the quarter and the year. The change from 2008 was primarily driven by the change in contract mix that we discussed on prior calls. At IIS Missiles and TS, margins for the year remained consistent or slightly improved compared with 2008. NCS margin in the quarter was in line with the same period in 2008, and up 130 basis points for the year, primarily due to improved performance on a broad range of programs. And finally, SAS margin in the quarter was down about 60 basis points, primarily due to the timing of performance improvements in 2008 versus 2009. On a full year basis, SAS margin was up 80 basis points, primarily due to favorable mix as well as contractual settlements.Turning now to Page 7. Fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.30 versus $1.01 in 2008 The 29% increase was driven by operational improvements, reduced share count. The 2008 lower CAS pension adjustment, and lower FAS/CAS pension expense. We've also provided you with a summary of our one earnings per share result, excluding the impact of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment. We recognize that many analysts and investors look at FAS/CAS adjusted EPS as another important financial measure because it adjusts for the non-cash and temporary differences between FAS and CAS pension accounting. Fourth quarter 2009 FAS/CAS adjusted EPS was up 22%. We provided a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure on Page 16 in the Appendix. Turning now to Page 8, our full year EPS from continuing operations was $4 and $0.89 versus $3.93 in 2008, an increase of 24% primarily due to operational improvements and reduced share count. Full year 2009 FAS/CAS adjusted EPS was up 18%. Before moving to our 2010 outlook, let me briefly comment on cash flow and summarize 2009. The company generated strong operating cash flow of $2.7 billion in 2009, compared to $2 billion in 2008. Improved performance, and on a net basis, lower cash tax payments were the primary drivers.Summarizing 2009, it was another very strong year for the company. As we've already mentioned, our book-to-bill ratio exceeded one. This is especially notable in light of our strong 7% sales growth. We continued to deliver solid margins and earnings per share. We generated $2.7 billion of operating cash flow. We repurchased $1.2 billion of stock, and we acquired BBN Technologies, a world leader in research and development and provider of critical solutions for national defense and security missions. Our track record of delivering strong operational and financial performance, and our solid balance sheet give us confidence as we focus on the future and flexibility as we continue to grow the business.Turning now to Page 9, we are reaffirming the financial outlook for 2010 that we provided in October. We expect continued growth in sales in the range of between $25.9 billion and $26.4 billion. As for pension, we now see FAS/CAS pension expense of $220 million versus the $228 million that we projected in October. The change is primarily driven by our asset returns in 2009, which were up over 17% for the full year. Our end-of-year discount rate was 6.25% consistent with what we had assumed in October. Next, we expect net interest expense to be between $95 million and $110 million, a slight change from our prior guidance but in-line with 2009. We see average diluted shares outstanding to be between $377 million and $382 million on a full year basis. As for effective tax rate, we want to be clear that for planning purposes and consistent with our prior practice, we're assuming that the R&D credit extension gets passed in 2010 retroactive for the full year. And accordingly, we've included it in our 2010 guidance. It favorably impacts the effective tax rate by 90 basis points and is worth about $0.07 in EPS. I'd also like to remind everyone that effective January 1, 2009, we were required to adopt the new accounting standard for non-controlling interests. For Raytheon, this relates primarily to Talus Raytheon Systems Company LLC, which is included in NCS financial results. EPS and EPS from continuing operations are calculated based on net income attributable to Raytheon Company, and income from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company, both of which we report separately on our income statement.In 2010, we expect EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.90. We see our FAS/CAS adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28. You'll notice a slight change from our prior guidance on the FAS/CAS adjusted EPS line, and this is merely due to a change in the tax rate used in calculating the FAS/CAS impact. We believe using the statutory tax rate more precisely represents the tax impact of the  adjustment. Our operating cash flow guidance is unchanged from our prior guidance at $2 billion to $2.2 billion. A key driver of the difference in cash flow from 2009 is higher cash tax payments in 2010. And finally, we expect our return on invested capital to be between 12.2% and 12.6%. You should also be aware that we have updated our definition of our ROIC, which is included on Page 15, to now exclude the FAS/CAS pension adjustment. It better reflects how we measure the company's financial and operational performance.Continuing on to Page 10, I'll briefly comment on our outlook by business. First, we expect all of our businesses to grow and perform well in 2010. On a FAS/CAS adjusted basis, we expect to deliver solid margins by focusing on sales growth and operational performance across the company. If you'd move to Page 11, we've provided you with our 2010 outlook by quarter. You should note that in first quarter, we're impacted by both workdays and the timing of sales between Q4 2009 and Q1 of this year. Finally, on Page 12, we've provided you with a summary of the financial impact of pensions in 2009, as well as our assumptions for 2010. In 2010, we expect to make total cash contributions of approximately $1.1 billion, in line with what we contributed in 2009. So let me conclude by saying that we delivered strong results in 2009. We have a strong balance sheet, a diverse portfolio of innovative technologies, strong demand for our solutions, both domestically and internationally and we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver profitable growth in 2010. With that, Bill and I will open up the call to questions."

At the same time, I believe we're going to have to keep some ships floating longer than people anticipated, and so some backfit of our electronics there to keep this platform state-of-the-art. We'll probably play into that. And clearly, I know it would be me speculating, but I think the Navy is going to look at more network-centric capabilities of how they provide more data and sensor capability into the shooter, as I would call it.

So let me try to put just a little bit of color on that. First of all, all of our businesses are growing, and margins are up in each of our businesses from an operational perspective. You'll recall that SAS had claims in 2009, which amounted to about 40 basis points of improvement. So again on an operational basis, we're seeing improvement year-over-year. And the NCS is impacted by BBN and the related acquisition costs. If you stand back from all of this, growth of 4% to 6% is driven by both domestic and international sales. As for IDS, the implied growth of 3% to 7% driven by international Patriot programs. And that business benefits from production efficiencies as the volume ramps up in these programs. IIS, we see growth there coming primarily in the classified area. And we see performance improvement basically across the board in that business. You'll recall that that's where the main focus of our cyber efforts are managed. For Missile Systems, we're seeing strength in Phalanx and AMRAAM as we look to '10 and just general program efficiencies across the board. NCS, I've already addressed the impact of BBN, but they also, as Bill mentioned earlier, won an important classified program, an international classified program in the fourth quarter, that will be ramping up as well. From Technical Services standpoint, they have performed exceedingly well from a sales standpoint driven by the domestic and international training programs. We see growth on our war fighter focus efforts from roughly $1 billion in '09 to about $1.2 billion in '10, and again just general program efficiencies across the board in that business. SAS, I spoke a little bit about SAS. Their increase is driven primarily by volume on classified business, which we spoke to, and some continuing growth in international airborne tactical radars. Overall, performance is strong operationally. We've talked about SAS throughout the year, so we're confident in that business being able to deliver. I hope that gives you some color as to what we're seeing."

And that importantly assumes no harmonization."

In fact, on major classified competitive award got awarded last night. I can't tell you that amount or who it is but clearly it was one we were counting on that last year. So that affected the number. If you look, overall at our classified bookings, they were about 18% of the total last quarter. For '09, our classified bookings in total were up 14% of our total bookings. That was up a little bit over '08. Our classified sales for last year were about 13% for growth rate of about 15% over 2008. And we expect classified sales to be about 14% roughly of our total this year and a growth rate of 10% to 15%. So in engineering terms, I'd call it an RC time constant that kind of got delayed a little bit, and not that things didn't happen, they got pushed a little bit to the right, and we expect the IIS to be okay this year, if that helps."

Taiwan would probably be in late this year or '11 timeframe. Israel upgrading their fire units there and that's a little bit in '10, some in '11 and '12.

And for us, with our RACR radar and we're trying to get into other markets, on platforms that we haven't been on. So there's competition there. The ISR world has been great growth for us. We have some of the best centers in the world that are built out at SAS. There's competition but we welcome it from a standpoint of given how we compete. Command-and-control is always a competitive field. There's a lot of players there, that will be in our NCS business. But internationally, we continue to do very well there. As we go about the intelligence and information business, when Howard's question, when you look at that, that's a competitive world, they have tight budgets. So we see competition in that business. In the missile defense arena and radars, clearly having radars that are affordable, that can see things that no one else can see, differentiate us. So our standpoint, we work hard on our technology to make sure we've got something that's better than what someone else is doing at an affordable price and the ability to turn it around quickly. Technical Services, the training and support business is always competitive. People are there, margins are in the 7% range, kind of plus and minus, and so you see that. But we feel pretty good about what we're doing, we have some innovative training. We've learned from our commercial side of the business. We do a lot of the automotive training for each of the automotive companies, and they made us figure out how to due compression in training. So we think it makes us competitive there."

Whether you're seeing any rumblings of changes in the business relationship, it seem that Bob [ph] and Bill and Ashton Carter and Shay [ph], said some things need to change, I know you saw them all at AIA.

International bookings, we expect to be in the 28% to 30% range for 2010. And if I remember right, sales for 2010 ought to be in a 22% to 24% range. So that's kind of how the mix goes if we look at 2010 in classified. We expect those to be 12%, plus or minus a little, and we expect our sales next year to be about 14% of total sales for a growth rate of about 10% to 15%. So, pretty much same kind of year this year.

But I don't get hung up on the mix, what I get hung up on is having double-digit growth rate on of the volume as sales, because that's what really drives the business.

We've got a small diameter bomb where as you know, we came into that one late in the game, and we're trying to put a good effort for it to see what we can do on that.

With respect to '11, I did suggest on the last call that if the harmonization rules came out, I'd be able to add some more clarity. But let me just give you the short version. We had returns that approached 17.5% on our pension assets in 2009, so that did favorably impact '11 from what we were thinking just a few months ago. Cutting through all that, we sort of see the FAS/CAS pension adjustment in '11. And this is important, holding all the variables constant, discount rate, assumed long rate of return and other actuarial assumptions. If you hold all of those constant, it would approach about $300 million, so it could be up around $80 million. And we were thinking a little bit more than that just a few months ago. I want to repeat that doesn't include the potential favorable impact of cash harmonization. If that were to happen, it would move in the other direction, maybe to the benefit of $100 million, plus or minus. As we go to '12, it actually approaches break even. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of about a negative $50 million. And then as you go to 2013, you actually turn positive in the FAS/CAS adjusted basis."

Smallest number could be three fire units to one that up in the 20s. So that's kind of the range. But you can think of patriot as, there's always a sustaining effort. We're always doing engineering because there's obsolescence and parts that go out that you got to have a redesign effort to replenish. If you look at the UAE, there's a good redesign effort going on there with color displays, new comm, new antenna mass groups and so forth. Once we finish that development, then those will be offered to other countries. So patriot is one of the most unique systems in the world in the sense that it went through development, deployment, sustainment, and now it's starting all over again. Which means everybody that's got patriot always looks to upgrade it. So it's one of those nice hallmark systems, if that helps."

And so from that standpoint, that's where we excel. How do you net that information and provide it to others? if you look at our DCGS System 10.2, I call it Google with a clearance, you can pass data amongst your sensors and systems to anyone at various classified levels. If you look at Missile Defense, clearly, what we're trying to do at that arena with proven systems, SM-3 is the best in the world there and has one of the best test records. And our radars, as I mentioned, our X-band ground-based radars, there's nothing like them in the world, and why we feel comfortable with that. So that's getting some attention. I think the QDR will address cyber. We've live with .mil, .gov, .com. I think there may be a fourth domain here that people got to start thinking about. And we'll see what happens. But I suspect that's going to get some attention. So you look at all of that, that's what we've talking about the last few years of where we wanted to be. And I think, given our broad-based portfolio, it's helped us anticipate the future. So we look to it with optimism, not concern."

The company had bookings of $6.5 billion and sales of $6.1 billion, a book-to-bill greater than 1. Our operating profit margins were solid, driven by strong program performance. Our FAS/CAS adjusted EPS was up 17%, and we delivered good cash flow. Clearly, another solid quarter performance for the company.
As we mentioned in January, we expect to deliver continued growth for the year. Our results in the first quarter and our positive outlook are a result of our successful execution of our customer-focused strategy. There are a lot of exciting things going on in the company, so I wanted to do something a little bit different this morning and take a few minutes on this call to highlight some of them for you.
Let me start with IIS. We booked over $1.7 billion in new business, ending the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio close to 2.5x. IIS booked $886 million on a competitively awarded contract for the U.S. Air Force to develop the next generation ground control stations for GPS. We call the program GPS-OCX. The program will provide anti-jam capabilities for our war fighters, ensure future air traffic control systems and facilitate the advancement of commercial GPS applications. I'm very proud of our innovative solution, and the team is off to a great start.
IIS also booked $624 million on a number of classified contracts during the quarter, including $340 million on a major classified program. As many of you are aware, we can't say much about these programs, but it is clear that customers value the unique capabilities that we offer. The order book at IIS is very solid, and the business is well-positioned for future growth.
At our Integrated Defense Systems business, we delivered good growth and strong margins. Importantly, during the quarter, the Navy awarded initial funding for the third Zumwalt ship, a meaningful step toward addressing any questions about the outlook for this successful program. It's performing well and the advanced Technologies that we're developing will support the U.S. Navy and other navies for decades to come.
At Missile Systems, we've booked $535 million on a major classified program in the quarter. We also had a number of significant bookings for the Missile Defense Agency, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Army and international customers. Missile Systems continues to be well-positioned for future growth. 
At Raytheon, we differentiate ourselves in the market based on our technologies and our focus on continuous innovation. I want to take a few minutes on the recent key technology wins across the company.
There's a lot of exciting work that we're doing to support our customers, which will drive future growth. For example, during the quarter we won a contract with the Office of Naval Research to continue our cutting-edge work on the compound semiconductor materials on silicon, or the COSMOS program as we call it. The potential future value of this disruptive technology that we're developing is significant, both to our customers and to Raytheon. We'll be able to deliver even more affordable sensors while continue to deliver world-class performance.
In the cyber area, we won a contract to provide critical experimentation and tests for the government cybersecurity capabilities. This win is a good example of our domain knowledge and our strengthening competitive position in this growing area. We were also awarded the final phase of a DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] contract called agile to develop speech and language processing technologies to recognize, analyze and translate speech and text into readable English and real-time on-the-fly. 
On the international side, our sales were up 20% during the quarter, and the percentage of our total sales from international continue to expand. It reached 23% in Q1. For the full year, we're forecasting double-digit growth in our international sales. We expect roughly 22% to 24% of our total sales in 2010 will come from international. There is strong, broad-based international demand for each of our businesses’ innovative solutions and technologies. For example, during the quarter, SAS booked $90 million for the production at Advanced Countermeasures Electronic Systems for the Egyptian Air Force's F-16s. It's another example of our focus on increasing both the breadth and total value of Raytheon technologies on the worldwide fleet of F-16s. 
In summary, we feel good about our accomplishments. Our strategy of focusing on the customer and exceeding expectations is working. In today's competitive landscape, we believe that our focus on performance relationships and solutions will continue to translate into even more opportunities in the future. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Dave."

If everyone could please move to Page 3. As Bill noted, we performed well in the first quarter. We had strong bookings of $6.5 billion and sales of $6.1 billion. And we ended the quarter with a $37 billion backlog. EPS from continuing operations was up 6% on the quarter. Importantly, when you consider the timing related to pension accounting, our FAS/CAS adjusted EPS of $1.27 was up 17%, driven by strong operational performance and capital deployment actions. And we generated solid operating cash flow from continuing operations of $257 million, which included Federal and foreign tax payments of $59 million.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2009 was $411 million, which included a net tax refund of $323 million. Excluding these tax items, operating cash flow from continuing operations in the first quarter 2010 increased by $228 million, driven by business performance, our working capital focus, as well as timing. The company repurchased 5.5 million shares of common stock for $300 million in the quarter. And as we announced last month, the company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. At the end of the first quarter, a total of $2.6 billion remained available under the company's share repurchase programs.
In addition, the Board increased the company's annual dividend rate by 21%. We've now increased our dividend for six consecutive years. For the balance of 2010, we expect continued solid sales growth and strong operational performance. And we're reaffirming the positive guidance that we've provided in January. I'll discuss our guidance further in just a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Our total company booking for the quarter was $6.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio greater than 1, a key indicator of our future growth outlook. Bill already mentioned a couple of our larger bookings during the quarter, including GPS-OCX, Zumwalt, the major classified awards at IIS and Missile Systems and ACES [Advanced Countermeasures Electronic System] at our SAS business. In addition, IDS booked $162 million to provide engineering services support for a Patriot air and missile defense program for U.S. and international customers.
MS booked $212 million for the development of SM-3 and $111 million for development work on the EKV program for the Missile Defense Agency. MS also booked $207 million for the production of SM-2 for an international customer and the U.S. Navy, $203 million for the production of Tomahawk cruise missiles for the U.S. Navy, $102 million for the production of the JSOW for the U.S. Navy and $95 million for production of TOW missiles for international customers in the U.S. Army. Our NCS business booked $138 million to supply Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance systems for the U.S. Army. And TS booked $155 million on domestic training programs and $25 million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS [Field Operations Customer Support] activities.
TS also booked $88 million on the Security Equipment Integration Services contract for the TSA and $78 million to provide operational and logistic support to the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $37 billion compared to $36.9 billion at the end of 2009.
If you’d now move to Page 5, we continue to deliver good sales growth. You should note that the first quarter of 2010 had one less work day than the same period last year. Normalized for the one day, I'd estimate our 3% sales growth in Q1 to be closer to the 5% range. Looking at sales by business, IDS had first quarter 2010 net sales of $1.3 billion, up 6% for the quarter, primarily due to growth on international Patriot programs.
IIS had first quarter 2010 net sales of $730 million. As we expected, the change in IIS sales was driven by volume on both the classified program and an international advanced border and security program. Missile Systems and NCS net sales were in line with the same period last year. Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 5%, driven primarily by growth in classified business.
Technical services had first quarter 2010 net sales of $801 million, up 15%, driven by strength in domestic and foreign training programs supporting the U.S. Army. Our diverse portfolio of businesses all focused on customers’ priority areas is clearly driving our continued steady growth profile. 
Moving ahead to Page 6, we delivered strong operational performance in the quarter. Our margin before the FAS/CAS pension adjustment was up 70 basis points. Looking at business margins, IDS had solid results in the quarter. The increase in margin was primarily due to higher volume on international Patriot programs. At IIS, the change in margins was primarily due to an international program. Both MS and NCS margin in the quarter were in line with the same period in 2009. 
SAS margin in the quarter was up 120 basis points, primarily due to improved program performance and the change in contract mix. And finally, TS margin in the quarter was up 210 basis points, primarily due to improved performance mainly on programs nearing completion, as well as the timing and recognition of award fees on the fixed price service contract. Overall, total company margins continue to be strong.
Turning now to Page 7, first quarter EPS from continuing operations, which includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment, was $1.18 versus $1.11 in 2009. The increase in EPS was primarily driven by operational improvement and reduced share count, partially offset by higher FAS/CAS pension expense.
2010 FAS/CAS adjusted EPS was $1.27, up 17%. If you’d move to Page 8, we are reaffirming the financial outlook for 2010 that we provided in January. We expect continued growth in sales in the range of between $25.9 billion and $26.4 billion, up 4% to 6%. And FAS/CAS adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28 per share, representing growth of between 6% and 9%. You should note that our outlook now reflects the impact of some warrants being exercised earlier than we had anticipated. More specifically, we've had about $6.5 million warrants exercised to date. The expiration of these warrants was June 2011. The full year 2010 EPS impact is approximately $0.05, which we expect to offset through improved performance.
Moving on to Page 9, we’ve provided additional color on our outlook for the year by business. The key takeaway’s that our strong and diverse portfolio is driving continued sales growth and solid margins. 
On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see sales, EPS, operating cash flow from continuing operations by quarter. We saw a good performance in the first quarter compared to both Q1 2009 and also the initial outlook for Q1 2010 that we provided in January. Some of this improvement was driven by timing.
So let me summarize our first quarter performance. We delivered another strong quarter with solid bookings, sales, EPS and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we are confident as we look ahead. Our shareholder focus was again highlighted by increasing the dividend by 21%, repurchasing 300 million shares of common stock and adding an additional $2 billion of share repurchase availability going forward.
We expect our strong results, both from a program performance and a financial perspective to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We're off to an excellent start for 2010. So with that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions."

With respect to NCS, Q1 did include some performance improvements specifically on some U.S. Army programs that we had expected later in the year.

Notwithstanding, that business continues to perform well overall. There were significant operational and performance improvements that were also pulled ahead into Q1 for SAS. 
Now with respect to Technical Services, they have continued to perform well over the past few years. The results in Q1 are further attribution to that. Q1 was significantly impacted by an award fee from a fixed price service program, which we booked in Q1. It was worth a little over $5 million. If you take that out, the margins were just under 8%, still very, very healthy. That business continues to benefit from focusing on cost efficiencies and volume improvements."

Relative to CIP, there's nothing remarkable going on there. It's still running about 19% of sales on a trailing 12-month basis, which is in line with where we were at year end and last year's first quarter. Working capital turns, taken as a whole, continue to be very strong. We talked about this in the fourth quarter call. We generated close to $800 million in working capital improvements over the last four years.  Let me go back just to mention one other thing on the CIP.

John Jones was a dear friend, somebody I'd worked with for many years, and he is truly missed. He had all the core values of the company. Clearly, Raytheon is a company that works hard on succession planning. It's recognized. Fortune ranked us in the top 25 in the nation as far as the development of leaders. Clearly, for us, unfortunately for John, it happened on a Saturday night, notified first thing Sunday morning because there was a time change between California and here. Clearly, we had a team ready to go in place within a few days. And it could have been immediately, but it was out of respect. And we've got Rick Hughes, who has got a perfect background for SAS.  He’s a radar guru, technical individual, ran major programs in the Missile Defense Agency, and what I call our dinosaur radars, those are the big three-story jobbers that can see for a long way, just let me put it that way. So Rick has managed big programs, managed technology and will have a steady hand on the tiller. 
John Harris, who ran our contract supply chain, has ran operations for me. John has been a direct-report one way or another for about 15 years, a very capable individual, understands that part of the business, knows every contract in the company and a long-time Raytheon employee. So he'll do well with some real passion. 
And David Wilkins, who came out of NCS in contracts will come right in. And for us, it's same old, same old. We're off and running. There's a deep loss, while at the same time we are a company of 75,000 people and a lot of talent, and we can react quickly and keep going. Beneath them is another group of individuals that we continue to push to develop so that the company is ready for anything that's handed to it at any point in time. And as CEO, succession planning is the most important thing that I do, and we're serious about it here. Thank you for asking. It was really, really tough. John was a terrific individual, not forgotten. And Rick would be the first to tell you that his intent is to keep doing what John was doing out there, because SAS was on a good path. And by the way, Marc, if people want to meet our leadership, we find ways to make that happen. We're very proud of them and would love for people to get to know them because you see the kind of talent that's in this company real quick."

I think we demonstrate that with the thousands of programs we have and the broad-based nature of them. But we're continuing to work our GAAP analysis. I talked about investing internally. But we also look at teaming, and the last part is acquisitions. And if we can find acquisitions that help us narrow the gap quicker and they make sense and they have a good return on investment, then we're going to do them. But they're niche. They're like what we've been doing, nothing out of the ordinary. And then internationally, looking ahead strategically is staying very close to our customers and providing them solutions that they need. 
The other thing I should mention that wasn't asked is that we're really thrilled to see Secretary Gates, on the President's new export control reform initiative. The plan relies on four key reforms. There is the single export control list, the single licensing agency, and the single enforcement coordination agency and then what I'll call a single IT system controlling these critical technologies. And the crown jewels are important. Clearly, those of us in the business and our international customers believe the U.S. has one of the most stringent export regimes in the road. But stringent doesn't mean that it's effective and efficient. And so we are really welcoming what the President and Secretary Gates is doing to revamp the system. I would have liked to have seen it all done at once but that's just me as an engineer. But their three-phased approach is a very constructive way of looking at that.

So I'm wondering were there other contracts that you might have expected during the period that seem to have slipped or is this just kind of a normal lumpiness we see here?"

So if you look at it from our standpoint, we feel good about bookings for the year, the way to say it if we're upping them about $500 million here. So it's just with bookings and so many different moving pieces here, they tend to be lumpy. The congestion problem, we see things moving. Clearly, the decision process takes a little bit longer now. People are a little bit more cautious. There are protests out there. And so I can see where people might say something in that regard. We see one or two – a small one probably should have been awarded this month. It will probably be awarded next month. So, I mean, 30 days is not something I’d jump off a roof on, not unless it was something I really, really wanted, but 30 days is reasonable."

The company had bookings of $6.5 billion and sales of $6.1 billion, a book-to-bill greater than 1. Our operating profit margins were solid, driven by strong program performance. Our FAS/CAS adjusted EPS was up 17%, and we delivered good cash flow. Clearly, another solid quarter performance for the company.
As we mentioned in January, we expect to deliver continued growth for the year. Our results in the first quarter and our positive outlook are a result of our successful execution of our customer-focused strategy. There are a lot of exciting things going on in the company, so I wanted to do something a little bit different this morning and take a few minutes on this call to highlight some of them for you.
Let me start with IIS. We booked over $1.7 billion in new business, ending the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio close to 2.5x. IIS booked $886 million on a competitively awarded contract for the U.S. Air Force to develop the next generation ground control stations for GPS. We call the program GPS-OCX. The program will provide anti-jam capabilities for our war fighters, ensure future air traffic control systems and facilitate the advancement of commercial GPS applications. I'm very proud of our innovative solution, and the team is off to a great start.
IIS also booked $624 million on a number of classified contracts during the quarter, including $340 million on a major classified program. As many of you are aware, we can't say much about these programs, but it is clear that customers value the unique capabilities that we offer. The order book at IIS is very solid, and the business is well-positioned for future growth.
At our Integrated Defense Systems business, we delivered good growth and strong margins. Importantly, during the quarter, the Navy awarded initial funding for the third Zumwalt ship, a meaningful step toward addressing any questions about the outlook for this successful program. It's performing well and the advanced Technologies that we're developing will support the U.S. Navy and other navies for decades to come.
At Missile Systems, we've booked $535 million on a major classified program in the quarter. We also had a number of significant bookings for the Missile Defense Agency, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Army and international customers. Missile Systems continues to be well-positioned for future growth. 
At Raytheon, we differentiate ourselves in the market based on our technologies and our focus on continuous innovation. I want to take a few minutes on the recent key technology wins across the company.
There's a lot of exciting work that we're doing to support our customers, which will drive future growth. For example, during the quarter we won a contract with the Office of Naval Research to continue our cutting-edge work on the compound semiconductor materials on silicon, or the COSMOS program as we call it. The potential future value of this disruptive technology that we're developing is significant, both to our customers and to Raytheon. We'll be able to deliver even more affordable sensors while continue to deliver world-class performance.
In the cyber area, we won a contract to provide critical experimentation and tests for the government cybersecurity capabilities. This win is a good example of our domain knowledge and our strengthening competitive position in this growing area. We were also awarded the final phase of a DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] contract called agile to develop speech and language processing technologies to recognize, analyze and translate speech and text into readable English and real-time on-the-fly. 
On the international side, our sales were up 20% during the quarter, and the percentage of our total sales from international continue to expand. It reached 23% in Q1. For the full year, we're forecasting double-digit growth in our international sales. We expect roughly 22% to 24% of our total sales in 2010 will come from international. There is strong, broad-based international demand for each of our businesses’ innovative solutions and technologies. For example, during the quarter, SAS booked $90 million for the production at Advanced Countermeasures Electronic Systems for the Egyptian Air Force's F-16s. It's another example of our focus on increasing both the breadth and total value of Raytheon technologies on the worldwide fleet of F-16s. 
In summary, we feel good about our accomplishments. Our strategy of focusing on the customer and exceeding expectations is working. In today's competitive landscape, we believe that our focus on performance relationships and solutions will continue to translate into even more opportunities in the future. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Dave."

If everyone could please move to Page 3. As Bill noted, we performed well in the first quarter. We had strong bookings of $6.5 billion and sales of $6.1 billion. And we ended the quarter with a $37 billion backlog. EPS from continuing operations was up 6% on the quarter. Importantly, when you consider the timing related to pension accounting, our FAS/CAS adjusted EPS of $1.27 was up 17%, driven by strong operational performance and capital deployment actions. And we generated solid operating cash flow from continuing operations of $257 million, which included Federal and foreign tax payments of $59 million.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2009 was $411 million, which included a net tax refund of $323 million. Excluding these tax items, operating cash flow from continuing operations in the first quarter 2010 increased by $228 million, driven by business performance, our working capital focus, as well as timing. The company repurchased 5.5 million shares of common stock for $300 million in the quarter. And as we announced last month, the company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. At the end of the first quarter, a total of $2.6 billion remained available under the company's share repurchase programs.
In addition, the board increased the company's annual dividend rate by 21%. We've now increased our dividend for six consecutive years. For the balance of 2010, we expect continued solid sales growth and strong operational performance. And we're reaffirming the positive guidance that we've provided in January. I'll discuss our guidance further in just a few minutes.
Turning now to Page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Our total company booking for the quarter was $6.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio greater than 1, a key indicator of our future growth outlook. Bill already mentioned a couple of our larger bookings during the quarter, including GPS-OCX, Zumwalt, the major classified awards at IIS and Missile Systems and ACES [Advanced Countermeasures Electronic System] at our SAS business. In addition, IDS booked $162 million to provide engineering services support for a Patriot air and missile defense program for U.S. and international customers.
MS booked $212 million for the development of SM-3 and $111 million for development work on the EKV program for the Missile Defense Agency. MS also booked $207 million for the production of SM-2 for an international customer and the U.S. Navy, $203 million for the production of Tomahawk cruise missiles for the U.S. Navy, $102 million for the production of the JSOW for the U.S. Navy and $95 million for the production of TOW missiles for international customers and the U.S. Army. Our NCS business booked $138 million to supply Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance Systems for the U.S. Army. And TS booked $155 million on domestic training programs and $25 million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS [Field Operations Customer Support] activities.
TS also booked $88 million on the Security Equipment Integration Services contract for the TSA and $78 million to provide operational and logistic support to the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $37 billion compared to $36.9 billion at the end of 2009.
If you’d now move to Page 5, we continue to deliver good sales growth. You should note that the first quarter of 2010 had one less work day than the same period last year. Normalized for the one day, I'd estimate our 3% sales growth in Q1 to be closer to the 5% range. Looking at sales by business, IDS had first quarter 2010 net sales of $1.3 billion, up 6% for the quarter, primarily due to growth on international Patriot programs.
IIS had first quarter 2010 net sales of $730 million. As we expected, the change in IIS sales was driven by volume on both the classified program and an international advanced border and security program. Missile Systems and NCS net sales were in line with the same period last year. Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 5%, driven primarily by growth in classified business.
Technical Services had first quarter 2010 net sales of $801 million, up 15%, driven by strength in domestic and foreign training programs supporting the U.S. Army. Our diverse portfolio of businesses all focused on customers’ priority areas is clearly driving our continued steady growth profile. 
Moving ahead to Page 6, we delivered strong operational performance in the quarter. Our margin before the FAS/CAS pension adjustment was up 70 basis points. Looking at business margins, IDS had solid results in the quarter. The increase in margin was primarily due to higher volume on international Patriot programs. At IIS, the change in margins was primarily due to an international program. Both MS and NCS margin in the quarter were in line with the same period in 2009. 
SAS margin in the quarter was up 120 basis points, primarily due to improved program performance and the change in contract mix. And finally, TS margin in the quarter was up 210 basis points, primarily due to improved performance mainly on programs nearing completion, as well as the timing and recognition of award fees on the fixed price service contract. Overall, total company margins continue to be strong.
Turning now to Page 7, first quarter EPS from continuing operations, which includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment, was $1.18 versus $1.11 in 2009. The increase in EPS was primarily driven by operational improvement and reduced share count, partially offset by higher FAS/CAS pension expense.
2010 FAS/CAS adjusted EPS was $1.27, up 17%. 
If you’d move to Page 8, we are reaffirming the financial outlook for 2010 that we provided in January. We expect continued growth in sales in the range of between $25.9 billion and $26.4 billion, up 4% to 6%. And FAS/CAS adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28 per share, representing growth of between 6% and 9%. You should note that our outlook now reflects the impact of some warrants being exercised earlier than we had anticipated. More specifically, we've had about $6.5 million warrants exercised to date. The expiration of these warrants was June 2011. The full year 2010 EPS impact is approximately $0.05, which we expect to offset through improved performance.
Moving on to Page 9, we’ve provided additional color on our outlook for the year by business. The key takeaway’s that our strong and diverse portfolio is driving continued sales growth and solid margins. 
On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see sales, EPS, operating cash flow from continuing operations by quarter. We saw a good performance in the first quarter compared to both Q1 2009 and also the initial outlook for Q1 2010 that we provided in January. Some of this improvement was driven by timing.
So let me summarize our first quarter performance. We delivered another strong quarter with solid bookings, sales, EPS and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we are confident as we look ahead. Our shareholder focus was again highlighted by increasing the dividend by 21%, repurchasing 300 million shares of common stock and adding an additional $2 billion of share repurchase availability going forward.
We expect our strong results, both from a program performance and a financial perspective to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We're off to an excellent start for 2010. So with that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions."

We're expecting that in combination with productivity initiatives to move that business squarely in line with the guidance that we've put out this morning, which is in line with what we had talked about in January. With respect to NCS, Q1 did include some performance improvements specifically on some U.S. Army programs that we had expected later in the year. That's the reason why it's a little bit higher than we had expected in Q1 but will moderate, and again, we're comfortable with the guidance on a full year basis.

Notwithstanding, that business continues to perform well overall. There were significant operational and performance improvements that were also pulled ahead into Q1 for SAS.  Now with respect to Technical Services, they have continued to perform well over the past few years. The results in Q1 are further attribution to that. Q1 was significantly impacted by an award fee from a fixed price service program, which we booked in Q1. It was worth a little over $5 million. If you take that out, the margins were just under 8%, still very, very healthy. That business continues to benefit from focusing on cost efficiencies and volume improvements."

For the total year, we expect Classified bookings to be in about the 12% range of total bookings, which is in line with what we expect. But probably the most important part is we expect Classified sales to be about 14% of our total sales. That's up from 2009, and we expect the growth rate of Classified sales to be in that 10% to 15% range, to kind of help you on a volume point of view.

One of the things that I think we clearly understand is that training or educational training is a real niche for us. It's something we do well. We do it on the commercial side for a lot of automotive companies and other Fortune 100 companies, and what we seem to understand better than anybody is how you do compression in training. So that if you can deliver 40 hours of training in 30 hours, that's a benefit to a commercial company. But guess what, it's also a benefit to our military customers. And when you couple that with our virtual live and constructive training knowledge of systems in the Army, it's a home run. And for us, where we see the expansion is International, especially in places like the U.K., the Middle East and other places. So when we offer our products, we can offer the services and the training to go with them. And so we just see it as a natural extension. The other part, it's a nice business. The ROIC is good. The guys are taking good cost out of the business, doesn't require any capital, which is nice if you're a CEO. You like that kind of business. And since they execute so well, we know the margins aren't in the same category as SAS or IDS or NCS. But when you can have those kinds of margins without capital, it's a good thing.

As you kind of go forward in the year, we are continuing to gauge where we see our cash flow, but similar to what I said earlier on earnings per share, we are biased towards the higher end of the cash flow guidance that we’ve provided on a full year basis.  Relative to CIP, there's nothing remarkable going on there. It's still running about 19% of sales on a trailing 12-month basis, which is in line with where we were at year end and last year's first quarter. Working capital turns, taken as a whole, continue to be very strong. We talked about this in the fourth quarter call. We generated close to $800 million in working capital improvements over the last four years.  Let me go back just to mention one other thing on the CIP.  We sort of look at it, I think, more on a net basis, where you’ll net CIP against advances. And from that perspective, we're still running at about 10% of sales. and we have been for quite a while. So this is more just a first quarter area to look at and, again, not out of line with where we were last year."

So we've got a number of things, and I could go all day talking about technology, and the engineers would love it, but you all wouldn't.  But from my standpoint, there's some exciting things going around the company in all areas, whether it be sensors, our FX business, our command-and-control, or how we look at it, even mission support. We were using 3D analysis, virtual.  Put the Warfighter in the middle of a virtual reality situation where they can experience what it's like in Iraq or Afghanistan in real-time so that they've got a feel for it before they get over there. Those are some of the exciting things that we’re doing, and I could just go on and on about the technology. But no, no change in focus.

Jon Jones was a dear friend, somebody I'd worked with for many years, and he is truly missed. He had all the core values of the company. Clearly, Raytheon is a company that works hard on succession planning. It's recognized. Fortune ranked us in the top 25 in the nation as far as the development of leaders. Clearly, for us, unfortunately for Jon, it happened on a Saturday night, notified first thing Sunday morning because there was a time change between California and here. And clearly, we had a team ready to go and in place within a few days. And it could have been immediately, but it was out of respect. And we've got Rick Yuse, who has got a perfect background for SAS.  He’s a radar guru, technical individual, ran major programs in the Missile Defense Agency, and what I call our dinosaur radar, is also the big three-story jobbers that can see for a long way, just let me put it that way. So Rick has managed big programs, managed technology and will have a steady hand on the tiller.  John Harris, who ran our Contracts, Supply Chain [Contracts and Supply Chain] has run operations for me. John has been a direct-report one way or another for about 15 years, a very capable individual, understands that part of the business, knows every contract in the company and a long-time Raytheon employee. So he'll do well with some real passion. And David Wilkins, who came out of NCS and Contracts will come right in. And for us, it's same old, same old. We're off and running. And there's a deep loss, while at the same time we're a company of 75,000 people and a lot of talent, and we can react quickly and keep going. Beneath them is another group of individuals that we continue to push to develop so that the company is ready for anything that's handed to it at any point in time. And as CEO, succession planning is the most important thing that I do, and we're serious about it here. Thank you for asking. It was really, really tough. John was a terrific individual, not forgotten. And Rick would be the first to tell you that his intent is to keep doing what John was doing out there, because SAS was on a good path. And by the way, Marc, if people want to meet our leadership, we find ways to make that happen. We're very proud of them and would love for people to get to know them because you see the kind of talent that's in this company real quick."

I sometimes get asked, you know, what do I think about speed and agility are still very important for us to take advantage of our portfolio. I think we demonstrate that with the thousands of programs we have and the broad-based nature of them. But we're continuing to work our GAAP analysis. I talked about investing internally. But we also look at teaming, and the last part is acquisitions. And if we can find acquisitions that help us narrow the gap quicker and they make sense and they have a good return on investment, then we're going to do them. But they're niche. They're like what we've been doing, nothing out of the ordinary. And then internationally, looking ahead strategically is staying very close to our customers and providing them solutions that they need.  The other thing I should mention that wasn't asked is that we're really thrilled to see Secretary Gates, on the President's new export control reform initiative. The plan relies on four key reforms. There is the single export control list, the single licensing agency, and the single enforcement coordination agency and then what I'll call a single IT system controlling these critical technologies. And the crown jewels are important. Clearly, those of us in the business and our international customers believe the U.S. has one of the most stringent export regimes in the road. But stringent doesn't mean that it's effective and efficient. And so we are really welcoming what the President and Secretary Gates is doing to revamp the system. I would have liked to have seen it all done at once but that's just me as an engineer. But their three-phased approach is a very constructive way of looking at that. And I think that will help our industry, and given that we sell in 80 countries around the world, we're looking forward to it helping us."

Let me start by saying that our underlying results during the quarter and execution of our strategy continued to show growth for the year. Our strategy is well aligned with our customers' needs and we're well positioned for the future. Bookings in the quarter were solid, and on a year-to-date basis our book-to-bill ratio is greater than one. Our adjusted profit margin came in better than we expected, driven by continued operational improvements. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was up 11%, and we delivered good cash flow.
Overall, the business has performed as we expected. The fundamentals remain strong. As previously reported, we received some disappointing news last week. And as you saw in our press release this morning, we took a charge on the termination of a program with the U.K. Border Agency. Under accounting requirements, the company recognized this charge in Q2. Dave will provide you with a little more color on that, as well as our overall financial performance in the quarter and our full year outlook in just a moment.
It's ironic that we received this notification last week after a recent report by the Ministry of Defense in the U.K., our largest customer, ranked us in the top tier of its key suppliers; we're told, the only U.S. company. They highlighted our overall performance and our focus on continuous improvement. 
We also just wrapped up a successful air show at Farnborough. During the air show we have the opportunity to meet with many of our U.S. and international customers. In fact, we had more customer meetings at Farnborough than ever before, with over 900 meetings including 41 delegations from 34 countries. I was encouraged by what I heard about our company and the level of interest in what we do. And I wanted to share a few of those key highlights in terms of what our customers were interested in.
They were focused on our air and missile defense capabilities, especially around Global Patriot, Standard Missile-3, our TPY-2 ground-based radars, significant interest in our unique cyber capabilities, and we generated a lot of excitement with the successful test of our new Phalanx Laser System. We shot down four UAVs during an exercise in June and as we said at the show, it was a good day for lasers and a bad day for UAVs.
There was a lot of customer excitement about our use of Radar technology, not only for new aircraft going forward but also to retrofit current aircraft, like our a radar for the F-16. Our U.K. ASTOR program also attracted a lot of attention and we are pleased to have our U.K. MoD customer on-site talking about the success of ASTOR and [ph] Theatre (10:11). In fact, the aircraft did a flyover for the show. 
We generated a lot of interest in our Air Traffic Management and our Command and Control Solutions. And there were numerous discussions about our Advanced Training Solutions, and many of our customers see them as a way to help reduce their O&M costs.
The plane ride home gave me time to reflect on our accomplishments over the past several years. We have successfully reshaped and focused our portfolio and continue to see solid opportunities for future growth. We have the technology and capabilities our customers want, and that enable them to do more with not more. In other word, in my words, the things they need are the things we do and we do them well. 
Our customers are working to ensure that their budgets are priority-driven, and that programs are meeting expectations on cost, schedule, capability, all of which are key areas of expertise for us. We differentiate ourselves in the market not only based on innovative solutions, but on our performance, and that includes our internal process improvements. These have been attracting positive attention from customers around the world as they look for ways to increase their own organizations’ productivity. We streamlined our IT systems across the company, we've enhanced our shared services organizations, and we've recently announced that we're building a new standard missile production facility at Huntsville, Alabama. We're leveraging state-of-the-art automation to enhance quality and safety and deliver low-cost products to Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Navy customers and our international customers.
With that, I want to leave time for questions, so let me wrap up by saying the company's underlying performance in the quarter was solid. We expect to continue to perform well in the second half of the year, and we're optimistic about our future. 
With that, let me turn it over to Dave."
105612,109412492,70478,"Raytheon Co., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I’ll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. So if everyone could please move to Page 3. As Bill mentioned last week,",1022,"Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I’ll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. So if everyone could please move to Page 3. 
As Bill mentioned last week, the U.K.'s home office decided to terminate our efforts on a Border Agency program. This unusual event had an impact both on the second quarter and our full year outlook. Q2 net sales were reduced by $316 million, and income from continuing operations and EPS were reduced by $395 million and $0.71 per share, respectively. 
To more clearly explain our operating performance, I'll be speaking to our results and outlook on an adjusted basis. And just to clarify, the adjusted results exclude the program termination and the FAS/CAS pension adjustment.
The underlying performance of the company during the quarter was strong and our full year outlook remains on track. Adjusted operating margin was 12.6%, up 30 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 was up 11%, driven by strong operational performance as well as capital deployment actions. 
We generated solid operating cash flow from continuing operations of $400 million, which was better than expected, driven primarily by working capital management. This year's second quarter included $73 million in higher cash tax payments compared to the second quarter of 2009. The company repurchased 8.6 million shares of common stock for $475 million, bringing the year-to-date repurchases to 14.2 million shares for $775 million.
Turning to Page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $5.9 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $12.4 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio greater than one. In the second quarter, IDS booked $317 million to provide advanced Patriot Air and Missile defense capability for an international customer. IIS booked $80 million on a data and information system contract for NASA. IIS also booked $371 million on a number of classified contracts.
Missile Systems booked $234 million for SM-3 for the Missile Defense Agency; $223 million for Phalanx Weapons Systems for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army and international customers; $150 million for Miniature Air Launched Decoys for the U.S. Air Force; and $123 million for Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles for the U.S. Navy and international customers. Our NCS business booked $100 million on a Command and Control program for an international customer.
SAS booked $160 million on two international tactical radar programs. They also booked $563 million on a number of classified contracts, including $355 million on a major classified program. TS booked $399 million on domestic training programs and $136 million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS activities. TS also booked $95 million to provide operational and logistic support to the National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs. We ended the quarter with a $36 billion backlog.
If everyone could please move to Page 5. If you exclude the impact of the termination, our sales were in line with our expectations. IDS, Missile System and NCS net sales were up modestly in the second quarter compared with the same period last year. Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, up 5% on the strength of their classified business. And finally, Technical Services had second quarter 2010 net sales of $834 million, up 7%, driven by both domestic and foreign training programs. Our diverse portfolio of businesses, all focused on customers’ priority areas, supports continued positive outlook for the company.
Moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered strong operational performance in the quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points. Looking at the business margins, IDS had solid results in the quarter. The 90 basis point increase in margin was primarily due to higher volume on international Patriot programs and improved program performance.
Excluding the impact of the program termination, margins at IIS would have been up on a year-over-year basis. Missile Systems margin in the quarter was up 100 basis points, also driven by strong program performance across numerous programs. 
And NCS margins in Q2 were in line with the same period in 2009. 
At SAS, you may recall that last year's Q2 margin benefited from a favorable contractual settlement which accounted for about 50 basis points of margin. Second quarter 2010 margin at SAS was in line with our expectations. And finally, TS margin in the quarter was up 200 basis points, primarily due to improved program performance driven primarily by cost efficiencies on various training programs. You should also note that contract modifications impacting scope on certain training programs did have a positive impact on the TS margin in the quarter as well. Overall, our adjusted operating margin continues to be strong.
Turning now to Page 7. 2nd quarter 2010 adjusted EPS was $1.36, up 11% and year-to-date was up 14%, primarily driven by operational improvements. 
If you turn to Page 8, I'd like to comment on our updated outlook for the year. We expect continued growth in sales and adjusted EPS in 2010. As a reminder, we're assuming that the R&D tax credit extension gets passed in 2010 and it’s worth about $4.07 in earnings per share.
Moving on to Page 9. We've provided additional color on our outlook for the full year. Overall, our businesses are executing well and our margin profile remains strong. However, we did reduce the outlook for IIS. 
On Page 10, we provided our outlook on how we see sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations in the third and fourth quarters.
Before we open it up for questions and answers, let me summarize our second quarter performance. The impact of last week's termination of the U.K. Border Agency program obscured what was otherwise another very solid quarter with good sales, EPS and cash flow. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we're confident about our future. We're well positioned and we expect to continue to deliver solid results for our customers and for our shareholders. 
With that, we'll open up the call to questions."

That's in our terms, and you'd recognize it as IOC, initial operational capability. The system has been operating since then. We brought online a state-of-the-art facility in March of '10 this year. It's an interagency facility in the U.K., state-of-the-art, an unbelievable sight when you look at it, in what it does with the hundreds if not thousands of people that are being trained. The system’s working. It's providing operational and actionable data. I could probably say it in these terms, thousands of bad guys have been caught that shouldn't have been coming in or going out. And the next operational drop would have been just in a few months in October, and we were all set to do that drop. So I want to make sure everybody understands this is not an issue about Raytheon being able to do the job or perform. It's a different kind of issue that's taking place in the U.K. with some of the issues that they face. I think for me, it was in contrast to what I saw at the air show. We have customers that are looking for innovative solutions to doing things in a different way to give them the capability with not having to do more. And so I just want to contrast it in that I think what I would say is there is a little bit of congestion in the system from a standpoint that we have a lot of things going on. And it probably takes a little longer, but I haven't seen things disappear other than the termination; and those that have been around long enough understand that Raytheon will take all the actions necessary to show that we have done what we said we were going to do. And I won't talk about the litigation strategy in public, but you can expect someone like me to fully defend the company's honor."

I think we have the right leadership in the company to create value in that regard. And we've got ourselves ready for this. And you've got to be able to be fast and be able to do things. And I don’t think we should paint the whole world the way one country is, each country's going to be different. We see the Mideast with different wants and needs than we see in Europe. And some countries are going to have to make harder decisions. But the one thing I’ve learned, and I kind of relate it to my personal life and anybody that's got home security systems. If they're not working you're going to get them fixed. If you don't get them fixed, you're going to have to face the risk. And my point is, is I don't see nations taking huge risks with protecting their country. That's Bill Swanson's view."

Now Q3 from a sales standpoint was impacted at some level by the termination of e-Borders. We had expected some level of sales. As a matter of fact in the back half of the year, we had expected in the neighborhood of $100 million to $140 million in sales from e-Borders, split between the two quarters basically evenly. But you were right in the way you phrased your question. The timing on some of the awards between first half and second half does impact the cadence in Q3. So if you're looking at it from an earnings standpoint, there is some impact again relative to the termination and, in particular, the associated period costs of unwinding the program. There's cost and efficiency improvements that we achieved earlier in the year. Some were anticipated for Q3. We were able to move them ahead, which is obviously a plus up for the company. And I guess taking everything together, we're comfortable with the year. The cadence did shift slightly but given everything we're still positive on the outlook."

I think Secretary Gates got it right when he said export control is important. How do we streamline that? I think those of us that are in the business, we see international sales as a great way to help reduce the cost to our U.S. customers. After all, if we're putting a load into our facilities, those loads help absorb some of the overhead, which helps reduce the price. So one of the things that we’re working with and I know AIA is, is how we continue to work that because it's not the fastest system in the world. And I'm not faulting anybody, but if we could cut the time in half that would be huge savings not only to the U.S. but to our international customers because they’re looking for some kind of specificity to when they want something, when can they get approved and when can we start doing it. And we've got a lot of international stuff in the queue here. So the department's trying to designate a lead senior official to go do this. They're also trying to work on a comprehensive program licensing management model, how do we do things in 60 days or so? How do we make sure we protect the things we need to protect? Protecting everything doesn't work. And then the other aspect of it is, how do we get the notification processes done a little bit quicker out of state, into the hills, so that we can make decisions. But right now, I would say there's some congestion in the system. And we're all working really hard to get that through. And then I think we need to understand that the more of our allies that are compatible with us, the less burden it will put on us here in the U.S. I realize I’m highly biased, but for a company that does a lot on the international arena, speeding up this process would be good for us, but it's also good for others."

I think if you look at the administration and others, this started to get a lot of attention, but the attraction didn't happen as quick as what people would have anticipated. For us, we had the three-pronged approach. We wanted to protect ourselves. If you look at the amount of activity, it's probably in the billions that happened to us. And Six Sigma results don't work here, because if you have 4.6 faults per million, people are going to break into everything you have when they can attack you in the billions of attacks. So for us, we wanted to make sure we protected ourselves as part of our strategy, we wanted to make sure whatever we develop we use, which we do. We wanted to make sure that our products had all the right protection in them. We do that and the service aspect of what we could offer our customers in capability is what we're starting to see some traction on now. We've gotten some awards. Some have hit the paper. Some don't hit the paper. For us, we think we're going to be on our plan this year for the kind of growth we anticipated. We still, I think can safely say, find more Zero Day occurrences than anybody else in the industry, and that's relative to the tools we use. And we have the ability to scale because we believe in what we do so we use it here to help us internally. So I would say, in the past we expected it to move quicker. We're a little bit more pragmatic about it today. But there is growth. There’s awards starting to happen. They're small, they may be in the $10 million, $40 million, $50 million, or $100 million, but it’ll probably won’t be until next year that some bigger ones start to happen. But we're okay with the smaller ones. That’s 8,000 programs in this company, that's the way we grow and that's the way we do business.

We had obviously anticipated over time improving that, given the way we had seen our performance. But I think that's probably point one. Point two, from a cash position, overall we had seen, obviously based on the balance sheet and the cadence of the milestones, we had investments up front, which we had anticipated recovering throughout the program. We had essentially gone operational, like Bill had said, which started to trigger some positive cash flow.

From our standpoint, we see tremendous opportunity. Probably Saudi will be next in the queue. We've gone through the RSADF there, and we've gone through foreign procurement. And we've got about one more stage to go through in Saudi, and that will happen I hope soon with not too many Os -- since you've been around, you know what that means -- sooner rather than later. And we'll hear probably in the latter part of the year on Turkey, what they decide to do there. Those are all billion dollar contracts from that standpoint. UAE’s going well. We were able to display at the show, no pun intended, the new digital displays in Patriot that, if you've been around the system as long as I have, boy, are they state-of-the-art now. About 2/3 of the system has changed, all updated, new parts, and it's the best around. And so for us, we see other parts of Europe that are interested in that. Japan has continued to buy and is going to upgrade more their systems, so we have that as an international order that recently we booked some activity on Patriot.

A number of things, as you well know, happen at different periods throughout the year. But I would take the full year guidance and assume that as a good baseline for the businesses going forward. George, actually there is one last point. The costs associated with the termination are expected to run out first half, second half of this year and maybe very early into next year. So that would be a little bit of a positive as we move ahead."

But what's happening different is, I'm not faulting our customer whatsoever for what they're going through. They're making the right kind of calls. I mean my analogy is, in Raytheon when we had $13 billion of debt what did we do? I could go through the litany and I won’t on the call but we basically went from $13 billion to being debt free. And we did that by making some really hard [ph] calls (58:17), they don't happen overnight. I think our customers looks at the way they do business and realizes that they can do more. There are hard calls they have to make. They've got to be able to improve the requirements definition and ensure that the requirements and the programs have stability. When you yin and yang them, that burns money one way or another. I’ve waxed eloquently, I’m biased on streamlining the export control. That benefits both of us when we do it. The other thing is they’re trying to promote the efficient use of resources on both sides. Both of us need to do that. I mean one of the things we can figure out is how do we spend less [ph] B&P (59:04) on our proposals? I mean if you have to submit a fixed-price proposal, why do you have to put in hundreds or thousands of pages on a proposal that’s fixed-price. It's competitive as you go through it. So resources can be better. The other thing is we need to eliminate, [ph] govern (59:25) unique processes where practical. Notice I put, where practical, because there are things we do that we don't do on some of our commercial side or with other customers. And the thing I would finally add -- and I give this administration or the DoD great credit -- we're trying to understand the second and third order effects of decisions. That's something I think that has been a huge game changer for Raytheon internally, as we think through things. So when you think about cutting direct labor, the outcome of that could be that you're overheads go up because you don't have as much direct labor base to offset against it and when you do that, don't start whacking people for overheads if the [ph] PCL (1:00:13), total cost level, comes down. That needs to be understood. So when you put in your rules, you got to make sure you understand that effect. The other thing is, if you change the fee rates on make versus buy, you could end up with an outcome that you don't like, which means somebody goes vertically rather than using lower-cost suppliers. So we've got to be careful as we go through this thing. And I think what that does is it does create the congestion. And I think when you look at congestion, do you have a partner you could sit down at the table and talk with to keep things moving. And I would give Ash Carter, Bill Lynn and Secretary Gates credit. They listen. And collectively, we've got to work it shoulder to shoulder, it’s in the best interests of our country, and the way I look at it we have an obligation in our industry to provide the best we can to our war fighters. And how do we do that? As quick as we can. And my last point is, I’m a speed nut. The faster we can get things done, the less cost it will be to Raytheon and the less cost it’ll be to the government. And somehow we've got to develop that mindset by re-setting ourselves and we haven't done that yet. So we've got work to do. I'm encouraged that people are taking it on. The other is [ph] you’d (1:01:36) sit there and say, woe is me. But it’s still, everybody in the building says you perform, you get paid for it. That has not changed."

You mentioned Saudi, the borders there. That's a little different story. Our strategy was to do something a little bit different than what others would go do. Clearly, the people we worked with liked what we did. Someone else above them made a different decision. That happens when you compete. So I kind of put it in a different bin. But what we see around the world, is the ability that people want to know what's going on on the border. They need ISR capability. They want to be able to protect ports. They want to be able to do things. They’ll be smaller in scale, maybe $50 million, $100 million, $200 million jobs. Those are okay. We understand them. We've experienced about 23%, 25% growth, let me say 20% to 25%, in our homeland security. We have to make an adjustment for e-Borders. But for me, I still see double-digit growth in homeland security whether it be from a point of view of communications, which is really getting big, which is doing airports -- which is a whole other kind of market -- to being able to do Command and Control in countries. And then other customers are asking us how we net things together so that they can have high fidelity information to make decisions. It's a very active market and we see it in those size of programs as we go ahead. We still see international bookings overall, they’ll probably be in the 28% to 30% range for the year. We still expect our international sales to be around 22% to 24% and the other thing that's growing is, classified is running -- clearly going to be in mid- double digits, probably around 15% or so this year, and sales will probably be about in the same range. So classified, domestic and international, is also growing for us. So lots of pieces.

Let me start by saying that our underlying results during the quarter and execution of our strategy continued to show growth for the year. Our strategy is well aligned with our customers' needs and we're well positioned for the future. Bookings in the quarter were solid, and on a year-to-date basis our book-to-bill ratio is greater than one. Our adjusted profit margin came in better than we expected, driven by continued operational improvements. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was up 11%, and we delivered good cash flow.
Overall, the business has performed as we expected. The fundamentals remain strong. As previously reported, we received some disappointing news last week. And as you saw in our press release this morning, we took a charge on the termination of a program with the U.K. Border Agency. Under accounting requirements, the company recognized this charge in Q2. Dave will provide you with a little more color on that, as well as our overall financial performance in the quarter and our full year outlook in just a moment.
It's ironic that we received this notification last week after a recent report by the Ministry of Defense in the U.K., our largest customer, ranked us in the top tier of its key suppliers; we're told, the only U.S. company. They highlighted our overall performance and our focus on continuous improvement. 
We also just wrapped up a successful air show at Farnborough. During the air show we have the opportunity to meet with many of our U.S. and international customers. In fact, we had more customer meetings at Farnborough than ever before, with over 900 meetings including 41 delegations from 34 countries. I was encouraged by what I heard about our company and the level of interest in what we do. And I wanted to share a few of those key highlights in terms of what our customers were interested in.
They were focused on our air and missile defense capabilities, especially around Global Patriot, Standard Missile-3, our TPY-2 ground-based radars, significant interest in our unique cyber capabilities, and we generated a lot of excitement with the successful test of our new Phalanx Laser System. We shot down four UAVs during an exercise in June and as we said at the show, it was a good day for lasers and a bad day for UAVs.
There was a lot of customer excitement about our use of Radar technology, not only for new aircraft going forward but also to retrofit current aircraft, like our a radar for the F-16. Our U.K. ASTOR program also attracted a lot of attention and we are pleased to have our U.K. MoD customer on-site talking about the success of ASTOR and [ph] Theatre (10:11). In fact, the aircraft did a flyover for the show. 
We generated a lot of interest in our Air Traffic Management and our Command and Control Solutions. And there were numerous discussions about our Advanced Training Solutions, and many of our customers see them as a way to help reduce their O&M costs.
The plane ride home gave me time to reflect on our accomplishments over the past several years. We have successfully reshaped and focused our portfolio and continue to see solid opportunities for future growth. We have the technology and capabilities our customers want, and that enable them to do more with not more. In other word, in my words, the things they need are the things we do and we do them well. 
Our customers are working to ensure that their budgets are priority-driven, and that programs are meeting expectations on cost, schedule, capability, all of which are key areas of expertise for us. We differentiate ourselves in the market not only based on innovative solutions, but on our performance, and that includes our internal process improvements. These have been attracting positive attention from customers around the world as they look for ways to increase their own organizations’ productivity. We streamlined our IT systems across the company, we've enhanced our shared services organizations, and we've recently announced that we're building a new standard missile production facility at Huntsville, Alabama. We're leveraging state-of-the-art automation to enhance quality and safety and deliver low-cost products to Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Navy customers and our international customers.
With that, I want to leave time for questions, so let me wrap up by saying the company's underlying performance in the quarter was solid. We expect to continue to perform well in the second half of the year, and we're optimistic about our future. 
With that, let me turn it over to Dave."
105612,109412492,71177,"Raytheon Co., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I’ll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. So if everyone could please move to Page 3. As Bill mentioned last week,",1022,"Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I’ll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. So if everyone could please move to Page 3. 
As Bill mentioned last week, the U.K.'s home office decided to terminate our efforts on a Border Agency program. This unusual event had an impact both on the second quarter and our full year outlook. Q2 net sales were reduced by $316 million, and income from continuing operations and EPS were reduced by $395 million and $0.71 per share, respectively. 
To more clearly explain our operating performance, I'll be speaking to our results and outlook on an adjusted basis. And just to clarify, the adjusted results exclude the program termination and the FAS/CAS pension adjustment.
The underlying performance of the company during the quarter was strong and our full year outlook remains on track. Adjusted operating margin was 12.6%, up 30 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 was up 11%, driven by strong operational performance as well as capital deployment actions. 
We generated solid operating cash flow from continuing operations of $400 million, which was better than expected, driven primarily by working capital management. This year's second quarter included $73 million in higher cash tax payments compared to the second quarter of 2009. The company repurchased 8.6 million shares of common stock for $475 million, bringing the year-to-date repurchases to 14.2 million shares for $775 million.
Turning to Page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $5.9 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $12.4 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio greater than one. In the second quarter, IDS booked $317 million to provide advanced Patriot Air and Missile defense capability for an international customer. IIS booked $80 million on a data and information system contract for NASA. IIS also booked $371 million on a number of classified contracts.
Missile Systems booked $234 million for SM-3 for the Missile Defense Agency; $223 million for Phalanx Weapons Systems for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army and international customers; $150 million for Miniature Air Launched Decoys for the U.S. Air Force; and $123 million for Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles for the U.S. Navy and international customers. Our NCS business booked $100 million on a Command and Control program for an international customer.
SAS booked $160 million on two international tactical radar programs. They also booked $563 million on a number of classified contracts, including $355 million on a major classified program. TS booked $399 million on domestic training programs and $136 million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS activities. TS also booked $95 million to provide operational and logistic support to the National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs. We ended the quarter with a $36 billion backlog.
If everyone could please move to Page 5. If you exclude the impact of the termination, our sales were in line with our expectations. IDS, Missile System and NCS net sales were up modestly in the second quarter compared with the same period last year. Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, up 5% on the strength of their classified business. And finally, Technical Services had second quarter 2010 net sales of $834 million, up 7%, driven by both domestic and foreign training programs. Our diverse portfolio of businesses, all focused on customers’ priority areas, supports continued positive outlook for the company.
Moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered strong operational performance in the quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points. Looking at the business margins, IDS had solid results in the quarter. The 90 basis point increase in margin was primarily due to higher volume on international Patriot programs and improved program performance.
Excluding the impact of the program termination, margins at IIS would have been up on a year-over-year basis. Missile Systems margin in the quarter was up 100 basis points, also driven by strong program performance across numerous programs. 
And NCS margins in Q2 were in line with the same period in 2009. 
At SAS, you may recall that last year's Q2 margin benefited from a favorable contractual settlement which accounted for about 50 basis points of margin. Second quarter 2010 margin at SAS was in line with our expectations. And finally, TS margin in the quarter was up 200 basis points, primarily due to improved program performance driven primarily by cost efficiencies on various training programs. You should also note that contract modifications impacting scope on certain training programs did have a positive impact on the TS margin in the quarter as well. Overall, our adjusted operating margin continues to be strong.
Turning now to Page 7. Second quarter 2010 adjusted EPS was $1.36, up 11% and year-to-date was up 14%, primarily driven by operational improvements. 
If you turn to Page 8, I'd like to comment on our updated outlook for the year. We expect continued growth in sales and adjusted EPS in 2010. As a reminder, we're assuming that the R&D tax credit extension gets passed in 2010 and it’s worth about $0.07 in earnings per share.
Moving on to Page 9. We've provided additional color on our outlook for the full year. Overall, our businesses are executing well and our margin profile remains strong. However, we did reduce the outlook for IIS. 
On Page 10, we provided our outlook on how we see sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations in the third and fourth quarters.
Before we open it up for questions and answers, let me summarize our second quarter performance. The impact of last week's termination of the U.K. Border Agency program obscured what was otherwise another very solid quarter with good sales, EPS and cash flow. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we're confident about our future. We're well positioned and we expect to continue to deliver solid results for our customers and for our shareholders.

That's in our terms, and you'd recognize it as IOC, initial operational capability. The system has been operating since then. We brought online a state-of-the-art facility in March of '10 this year. It's an interagency facility in the U.K., state-of-the-art, an unbelievable sight when you look at it and what it does with the hundreds if not thousands of people that are being trained. The system’s working. It's providing operational and actionable data. I could probably say it in these terms, thousands of bad guys have been caught that shouldn't have been coming in or going out. And the next operational drop would have been just in a few months in October, and we were all set to do that drop. So I want to make sure everybody understands this is not an issue about Raytheon being able to do the job or perform. It's a different kind of issue that's taking place in the U.K. with some of the issues that they face. I think for me, it was in contrast to what I saw at the air show. We have customers that are looking for innovative solutions to doing things in a different way to give them the capability with not having to do more. And so I just want to contrast it in that I think what I would say is there is a little bit of congestion in the system from a standpoint that we have a lot of things going on. And it probably takes a little longer, but I haven't seen things disappear other than the termination; and those that have been around long enough understand that Raytheon will take all the actions necessary to show that we have done what we said we were going to do. And I won't talk about the litigation strategy in public, but you can expect someone like me to fully defend the company's honor."

Now Q3 from a sales standpoint was impacted at some level by the termination of e-Borders. We had expected some level of sales. As a matter of fact in the back half of the year, we had expected in the neighborhood of $100 million to $140 million in sales from e-Borders, split between the two quarters basically evenly. But you were right in the way you phrased your question. The timing on some of the awards between first half and second half does impact the cadence in Q3. So if you're looking at it from an earnings standpoint, there is some impact again relative to the termination and, in particular, the associated period costs of unwinding the program. There's cost and efficiency improvements that we achieved earlier in the year. Some were anticipated for Q3. We were able to move them ahead, which is obviously a plus up for the company. And I guess taking everything together, we're comfortable with the year. The cadence did shift slightly but given everything we're still positive on the outlook."

I think Secretary Gates got it right when he said export control is important. How do we streamline that? I think those of us that are in the business, we see international sales as a great way to help reduce the cost to our U.S. customers. After all, if we're putting a load into our facilities, those loads help absorb some of the overhead, which helps reduce the price. So one of the things that we’re working with and I know AIA is, is how we continue to work that because it's not the fastest system in the world. And I'm not faulting anybody, but if we could cut the time in half that would be huge savings not only to the U.S. but to our international customers because they’re looking for some kind of specificity to when they want something, when can they get approved and when can we start doing it. And we've got a lot of international stuff in the queue here. So the department's trying to designate a lead senior official to go do this. They're also trying to work on a comprehensive program licensing management model, how do we do things in 60 days or so? How do we make sure we protect the things we need to protect? Protecting everything doesn't work. And then the other aspect of it is, how do we get the notification processes done a little bit quicker out of state, into the hills, so that we can make decisions. But right now, I would say there's some congestion in the system. And we're all working really hard to get that through. And then I think we need to understand that the more of our allies that are compatible with us, the less burden it will put on us here in the U.S. I realize I’m highly biased, but for a company that does a lot on the international arena, speeding up this process would be good for us, but it's also good for others."

And so you kind of believe that everybody believes what you do, and that things are going to happen really quick. I think if you look at the administration and others, this started to get a lot of attention, but the attraction didn't happen as quick as what people would have anticipated. For us, we had the three-pronged approach. We wanted to protect ourselves. If you look at the amount of activity, it's probably in the billions that happened to us. And Six Sigma results don't work here, because if you have 4.6 faults per million, people are going to break into everything you have when they can attack you in the billions of attacks. So for us, we wanted to make sure we protected ourselves as part of our strategy, we wanted to make sure whatever we develop we use, which we do. We wanted to make sure that our products had all the right protection in them. We do that and the service aspect of what we could offer our customers in capability is what we're starting to see some traction on now. We've gotten some awards. Some have hit the paper. Some don't hit the paper. For us, we think we're going to be on our plan this year for the kind of growth we anticipated. We still, I think can safely say, find more Zero Day occurrences than anybody else in the industry, and that's relative to the tools we use. And we have the ability to scale because we believe in what we do so we use it here to help us internally. So I would say, in the past we expected it to move quicker. We're a little bit more pragmatic about it today. But there is growth. There’s awards starting to happen. They're small, they may be in the $10 million, $40 million, $50 million, or $100 million, but it’ll probably won’t be until next year that some bigger ones start to happen. But we're okay with the smaller ones. That’s 8,000 programs in this company, that's the way we grow and that's the way we do business. But we see people starting to realize the issue, either in infrastructure, either in products or in other offerings they have. I don't know if that helped. It's a long answer."

On the international Patriot, that was one of the highlights of the show for me. A number of customers we dealt with, Kuwait and Turkey and Israel. Of course, UAE was there. Saudi was there. From our standpoint, we see tremendous opportunity. Probably Saudi will be next in the queue. We've gone through the RSADF there, and we've gone through foreign procurement. And we've got about one more stage to go through in Saudi, and that will happen I hope soon with not too many Os -- since you've been around, you know what that means -- sooner rather than later. And we'll hear probably in the latter part of the year on Turkey, what they decide to do there. Those are all billion dollar contracts from that standpoint. UAE’s going well. We were able to display at the show, no pun intended, the new digital displays in Patriot that, if you've been around the system as long as I have, boy, are they state-of-the-art now. About 2/3 of the system has changed, all updated, new parts, and it's the best around. And so for us, we see other parts of Europe that are interested in that. Japan has continued to buy and is going to upgrade more their systems, so we have that as an international order that recently we booked some activity on Patriot. So I’m encouraged by what I see there. But then again as we make these sales, we've got to be able to put them into the system, get them approved through Congress so we can start."

Think of a [ph] McGimble (51:34) that goes back and forth to look over the horizon or to look up or look down depending on where the thread is. This new AESA radars are a fixed plate. The way I like to describe them, think about multiple flashlights on a plate and what the AESA’s allowed to do is these flashlight beams go all over the place and one of them hits the target and so I have multi-scan capability. And that one beam can hit the target, and I can either focus all my energy on it or some of my energy. So mechanically, nothing moves except electrons, which means it has unbelievable reliability. We think we're like the Maytag repairman with these AESAs. They go out there and they don't break. The good part is the cost of them with new capabilities. Our customers can get basically the newest and the best and keep their platforms current.

But what's happening different is, I'm not faulting our customer whatsoever for what they're going through. They're making the right kind of calls. I mean my analogy is, in Raytheon when we had $13 billion of debt what did we do? I could go through the litany and I won’t on the call but we basically went from $13 billion to being debt free. And we did that by making some really hard [ph] calls (58:17), they don't happen overnight. I think our customers looks at the way they do business and realizes that they can do more. There are hard calls they have to make. They've got to be able to improve the requirements definition and ensure that the requirements and the programs have stability. When you yin and yang them, that burns money one way or another. I’ve waxed eloquently, I’m biased on streamlining the export control. That benefits both of us when we do it. The other thing is they’re trying to promote the efficient use of resources on both sides. Both of us need to do that. I mean one of the things we can figure out is how do we spend less B&P [ph](59:04) on our proposals? I mean if you have to submit a fixed-price proposal, why do you have to put in hundreds or thousands of pages on a proposal that’s fixed-price? It's competitive as you go through it. So resources can be better. The other thing is we need to eliminate, [ph] govern (59:25) unique processes where practical. Notice I put, where practical, because there are things we do that we don't do on some of our commercial side or with other customers. And the thing I would finally add -- and I give this administration or the DoD great credit -- we're trying to understand the second and third order effects of decisions. That's something I think that has been a huge game changer for Raytheon internally, as we think through things. So when you think about cutting direct labor, the outcome of that could be that you're overheads go up because you don't have as much direct labor base to offset against it and when you do that, don't start whacking people for overheads if the TCL, total cost level, comes down. That needs to be understood. So when you put in your rules, you got to make sure you understand that effect. The other thing is, if you change the fee rates on make versus buy, you could end up with an outcome that you don't like, which means somebody goes vertically rather than using lower-cost suppliers. So we've got to be careful as we go through this thing. And I think what that does is it does create the congestion. And I think when you look at congestion, do you have a partner you could sit down at the table and talk with to keep things moving. And I would give Ash Carter, Bill Lynn and Secretary Gates credit. They listen. And collectively, we've got to work it shoulder to shoulder. It’s in the best interests of our country, and the way I look at it we have an obligation in our industry to provide the best we can to our war fighters. And how do we do that? As quick as we can. And my last point is, I’m a speed nut. The faster we can get things done, the less cost it will be to Raytheon and the less cost it’ll be to the government. And somehow we've got to develop that mindset by resetting ourselves and we haven't done that yet. So we've got work to do. I'm encouraged that people are taking it on. The other is you’d [ph] (1:01:36) sit there and say, woe is me. But it’s still, everybody in the building says you perform, you get paid for it. That has not changed."

You mentioned Saudi, the borders there. That's a little different story. Our strategy was to do something a little bit different than what others would go do. Clearly, the people we worked with liked what we did. Someone else above them made a different decision. That happens when you compete. So I kind of put it in a different bin. But what we see around the world, is the ability that people want to know what's going on on the border. They need ISR capability. They want to be able to protect ports. They want to be able to do things. They’ll be smaller in scale, maybe $50 million, $100 million, $200 million jobs. Those are okay. We understand them. We've experienced about 23%, 25% growth, let me say 20% to 25%, in our homeland security. We have to make an adjustment for e-Borders. But for me, I still see double-digit growth in homeland security whether it be from a point of view of communications, which is really getting big, which is doing airports -- which is a whole other kind of market -- to being able to do Command and Control in countries. And then other customers are asking us how we net things together so that they can have high fidelity information to make decisions. It's a very active market and we see it in those size of programs as we go ahead. We still see international bookings overall, they’ll probably be in the 28% to 30% range for the year. We still expect our international sales to be around 22% to 24% and the other thing that's growing is, classified is running -- clearly going to be in mid- double digits, probably around 15% or so this year, and sales will probably be about in the same range. So classified, domestic and international, is also growing for us. So lots of pieces. All I can tell you is that when I look at the mosaic it looks pretty good, about what we see and what countries are talking to us about."

Let me start by saying that our underlying results during the quarter and execution of our strategy continued to show growth for the year. Our strategy is well aligned with our customers' needs and we're well positioned for the future. Bookings in the quarter were solid, and on a year-to-date basis our book-to-bill ratio is greater than one. Our adjusted profit margin came in better than we expected, driven by continued operational improvements. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was up 11%, and we delivered good cash flow.
Overall, the business has performed as we expected. The fundamentals remain strong. As previously reported, we received some disappointing news last week. And as you saw in our press release this morning, we took a charge on the termination of a program with the U.K. Border Agency. Under accounting requirements, the company recognized this charge in Q2. Dave will provide you with a little more color on that, as well as our overall financial performance in the quarter and our full year outlook in just a moment.
It's ironic that we received this notification last week after a recent report by the Ministry of Defense in the U.K., our largest customer, ranked us in the top tier of its key suppliers; we're told, the only U.S. company. They highlighted our overall performance and our focus on continuous improvement. 
We also just wrapped up a successful air show at Farnborough. During the air show we have the opportunity to meet with many of our U.S. and international customers. In fact, we had more customer meetings at Farnborough than ever before, with over 900 meetings including 41 delegations from 34 countries. I was encouraged by what I heard about our company and the level of interest in what we do. And I wanted to share a few of those key highlights in terms of what our customers were interested in.
They were focused on our air and missile defense capabilities, especially around Global Patriot, Standard Missile-3, our TPY-2 ground-based radars, significant interest in our unique cyber capabilities, and we generated a lot of excitement with the successful test of our new Phalanx Laser System. We shot down four UAVs during an exercise in June and as we said at the show, it was a good day for lasers and a bad day for UAVs.
There was a lot of customer excitement about our use of Radar technology, not only for new aircraft going forward but also to retrofit current aircraft, like our a radar for the F-16. Our U.K. ASTOR program also attracted a lot of attention and we are pleased to have our U.K. MoD customer on-site talking about the success of ASTOR and [ph] Theatre (10:11). In fact, the aircraft did a flyover for the show. 
We generated a lot of interest in our Air Traffic Management and our Command and Control Solutions. And there were numerous discussions about our Advanced Training Solutions, and many of our customers see them as a way to help reduce their O&M costs.
The plane ride home gave me time to reflect on our accomplishments over the past several years. We have successfully reshaped and focused our portfolio and continue to see solid opportunities for future growth. We have the technology and capabilities our customers want, and that enable them to do more with not more. In other word, in my words, the things they need are the things we do and we do them well. 
Our customers are working to ensure that their budgets are priority-driven, and that programs are meeting expectations on cost, schedule, capability, all of which are key areas of expertise for us. We differentiate ourselves in the market not only based on innovative solutions, but on our performance, and that includes our internal process improvements. These have been attracting positive attention from customers around the world as they look for ways to increase their own organizations’ productivity. We streamlined our IT systems across the company, we've enhanced our shared services organizations, and we've recently announced that we're building a new standard missile production facility at Huntsville, Alabama. We're leveraging state-of-the-art automation to enhance quality and safety and deliver low-cost products to Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Navy customers and our international customers.
With that, I want to leave time for questions, so let me wrap up by saying the company's underlying performance in the quarter was solid. We expect to continue to perform well in the second half of the year, and we're optimistic about our future. 
With that, let me turn it over to Dave."
105612,109412492,72891,"Raytheon Co., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I’ll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. So if everyone could please move to Page 3. As Bill mentioned last week,",1022,"Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I’ll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. So if everyone could please move to Page 3. 
As Bill mentioned last week, the U.K.'s home office decided to terminate our efforts on a Border Agency program. This unusual event had an impact both on the second quarter and our full year outlook. Q2 net sales were reduced by $316 million, and income from continuing operations and EPS were reduced by $395 million and $0.71 per share, respectively. 
To more clearly explain our operating performance, I'll be speaking to our results and outlook on an adjusted basis. And just to clarify, the adjusted results exclude the program termination and the FAS/CAS pension adjustment.
The underlying performance of the company during the quarter was strong and our full year outlook remains on track. Adjusted operating margin was 12.6%, up 30 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 was up 11%, driven by strong operational performance as well as capital deployment actions. 
We generated solid operating cash flow from continuing operations of $400 million, which was better than expected, driven primarily by working capital management. This year's second quarter included $73 million in higher cash tax payments compared to the second quarter of 2009. The company repurchased 8.6 million shares of common stock for $475 million, bringing the year-to-date repurchases to 14.2 million shares for $775 million.
Turning to Page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $5.9 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $12.4 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio greater than one. In the second quarter, IDS booked $317 million to provide advanced Patriot Air and Missile defense capability for an international customer. IIS booked $80 million on a data and information system contract for NASA. IIS also booked $371 million on a number of classified contracts.
Missile Systems booked $234 million for SM-3 for the Missile Defense Agency; $223 million for Phalanx Weapons Systems for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army and international customers; $150 million for Miniature Air Launched Decoys for the U.S. Air Force; and $123 million for Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles for the U.S. Navy and international customers. Our NCS business booked $100 million on a Command and Control program for an international customer.
SAS booked $160 million on two international tactical radar programs. They also booked $563 million on a number of classified contracts, including $355 million on a major classified program. TS booked $399 million on domestic training programs and $136 million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS activities. TS also booked $95 million to provide operational and logistic support to the National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs. We ended the quarter with a $36 billion backlog.
If everyone could please move to Page 5. If you exclude the impact of the termination, our sales were in line with our expectations. IDS, Missile System and NCS net sales were up modestly in the second quarter compared with the same period last year. Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.2 billion in the quarter, up 5% on the strength of their classified business. And finally, Technical Services had second quarter 2010 net sales of $834 million, up 7%, driven by both domestic and foreign training programs. Our diverse portfolio of businesses, all focused on customers’ priority areas, supports continued positive outlook for the company.
Moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered strong operational performance in the quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points. Looking at the business margins, IDS had solid results in the quarter. The 90 basis point increase in margin was primarily due to higher volume on international Patriot programs and improved program performance.
Excluding the impact of the program termination, margins at IIS would have been up on a year-over-year basis. Missile Systems margin in the quarter was up 100 basis points, also driven by strong program performance across numerous programs. 
And NCS margins in Q2 were in line with the same period in 2009. 
At SAS, you may recall that last year's Q2 margin benefited from a favorable contractual settlement which accounted for about 50 basis points of margin. Second quarter 2010 margin at SAS was in line with our expectations. And finally, TS margin in the quarter was up 200 basis points, primarily due to improved program performance driven primarily by cost efficiencies on various training programs. You should also note that contract modifications impacting scope on certain training programs did have a positive impact on the TS margin in the quarter as well. Overall, our adjusted operating margin continues to be strong.
Turning now to Page 7. Second quarter 2010 adjusted EPS was $1.36, up 11% and year-to-date was up 14%, primarily driven by operational improvements. 
If you turn to Page 8, I'd like to comment on our updated outlook for the year. We expect continued growth in sales and adjusted EPS in 2010. As a reminder, we're assuming that the R&D tax credit extension gets passed in 2010 and it’s worth about $0.07 in earnings per share.
Moving on to Page 9. We've provided additional color on our outlook for the full year. Overall, our businesses are executing well and our margin profile remains strong. However, we did reduce the outlook for IIS. 
On Page 10, we provided our outlook on how we see sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations in the third and fourth quarters.
Before we open it up for questions and answers, let me summarize our second quarter performance. The impact of last week's termination of the U.K. Border Agency program obscured what was otherwise another very solid quarter with good sales, EPS and cash flow. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we're confident about our future. We're well positioned and we expect to continue to deliver solid results for our customers and for our shareholders. 
With that, we'll open up the call to questions."

That's in our terms, and you'd recognize it as IOC, initial operational capability. The system has been operating since then. We brought online a state-of-the-art facility in March of '10 this year. It's an interagency facility in the U.K., state-of-the-art, an unbelievable sight when you look at it and what it does with the hundreds if not thousands of people that are being trained. The system’s working. It's providing operational and actionable data. I could probably say it in these terms, thousands of bad guys have been caught that shouldn't have been coming in or going out. And the next operational drop would have been just in a few months in October, and we were all set to do that drop. So I want to make sure everybody understands this is not an issue about Raytheon being able to do the job or perform. It's a different kind of issue that's taking place in the U.K. with some of the issues that they face. I think for me, it was in contrast to what I saw at the air show. We have customers that are looking for innovative solutions to doing things in a different way to give them the capability with not having to do more. And so I just want to contrast it in that I think what I would say is there is a little bit of congestion in the system from a standpoint that we have a lot of things going on. And it probably takes a little longer, but I haven't seen things disappear other than the termination; and those that have been around long enough understand that Raytheon will take all the actions necessary to show that we have done what we said we were going to do. And I won't talk about the litigation strategy in public, but you can expect someone like me to fully defend the company's honor."

I think we have the right leadership in the company to create value in that regard. And we've got ourselves ready for this. And you've got to be able to be fast and be able to do things. And I don’t think we should paint the whole world the way one country is, each country's going to be different. We see the Mideast with different wants and needs than we see in Europe. And some countries are going to have to make harder decisions. But the one thing I’ve learned, and I kind of relate it to my personal life and anybody that's got home security systems. If they're not working you're going to get them fixed. If you don't get them fixed, you're going to have to face the risk. And my point is, is I don't see nations taking huge risks with protecting their country. That's Bill Swanson's view."

Now Q3 from a sales standpoint was impacted at some level by the termination of e-Borders. We had expected some level of sales. As a matter of fact in the back half of the year, we had expected in the neighborhood of $100 million to $140 million in sales from e-Borders, split between the two quarters basically evenly. But you were right in the way you phrased your question. The timing on some of the awards between first half and second half does impact the cadence in Q3. So if you're looking at it from an earnings standpoint, there is some impact again relative to the termination and, in particular, the associated period costs of unwinding the program. There's cost and efficiency improvements that we achieved earlier in the year. Some were anticipated for Q3. We were able to move them ahead, which is obviously a plus up for the company.

I think Secretary Gates got it right when he said export control is important. How do we streamline that? I think those of us that are in the business, we see international sales as a great way to help reduce the cost to our U.S. customers. After all, if we're putting a load into our facilities, those loads help absorb some of the overhead, which helps reduce the price. So one of the things that we’re working with and I know AIA is, is how we continue to work that because it's not the fastest system in the world. And I'm not faulting anybody, but if we could cut the time in half that would be huge savings not only to the U.S. but to our international customers because they’re looking for some kind of specificity to when they want something, when can they get approved and when can we start doing it. And we've got a lot of international stuff in the queue here. So the department's trying to designate a lead senior official to go do this. They're also trying to work on a comprehensive program licensing management model, how do we do things in 60 days or so? How do we make sure we protect the things we need to protect? Protecting everything doesn't work. And then the other aspect of it is, how do we get the notification processes done a little bit quicker out of state, into the hills, so that we can make decisions. But right now, I would say there's some congestion in the system. And we're all working really hard to get that through. And then I think we need to understand that the more of our allies that are compatible with us, the less burden it will put on us here in the U.S. I realize I’m highly biased, but for a company that does a lot on the international arena, speeding up this process would be good for us, but it's also good for others."

And so you kind of believe that everybody believes what you do, and that things are going to happen really quick. I think if you look at the administration and others, this started to get a lot of attention, but the attraction didn't happen as quick as what people would have anticipated. For us, we had the three-pronged approach. We wanted to protect ourselves. If you look at the amount of activity, it's probably in the billions that happened to us. And Six Sigma results don't work here, because if you have 4.6 faults per million, people are going to break into everything you have when they can attack you in the billions of attacks. So for us, we wanted to make sure we protected ourselves as part of our strategy, we wanted to make sure whatever we develop we use, which we do. We wanted to make sure that our products had all the right protection in them. We do that and the service aspect of what we could offer our customers in capability is what we're starting to see some traction on now. We've gotten some awards. Some have hit the paper. Some don't hit the paper. For us, we think we're going to be on our plan this year for the kind of growth we anticipated. We still, I think can safely say, find more Zero Day occurrences than anybody else in the industry, and that's relative to the tools we use. And we have the ability to scale because we believe in what we do so we use it here to help us internally. So I would say, in the past we expected it to move quicker. We're a little bit more pragmatic about it today. But there is growth. There’s awards starting to happen. They're small, they may be in the $10 million, $40 million, $50 million, or $100 million, but it’ll probably won’t be until next year that some bigger ones start to happen. But we're okay with the smaller ones. That’s 8,000 programs in this company, that's the way we grow and that's the way we do business. But we see people starting to realize the issue, either in infrastructure, either in products or in other offerings they have. I don't know if that helped. It's a long answer."

I mean you see it in RTSe, for example. They've got a number of opportunities in the Mideast. And even in Europe, I mean, Europe's got tough financial issues, but we've got things going on there where we expect orders. Now are they huge? No, but you get a number of smaller ones, they add up to a bigger one. So that’s the way we kind of look at it."

And the one thing I remind you and everybody else, we’re a good company and we do what's right, and it was self-initiated. On the international Patriot, that was one of the highlights of the show for me. A number of customers we dealt with, Kuwait and Turkey and Israel. Of course, UAE was there. Saudi was there. From our standpoint, we see tremendous opportunity. Probably Saudi will be next in the queue. We've gone through the RSADF there, and we've gone through foreign procurement. And we've got about one more stage to go through in Saudi, and that will happen I hope soon with not too many Os -- since you've been around, you know what that means -- sooner rather than later. And we'll hear probably in the latter part of the year on Turkey, what they decide to do there. Those are all billion dollar contracts from that standpoint. UAE’s going well. We were able to display at the show, no pun intended, the new digital displays in Patriot that, if you've been around the system as long as I have, boy, are they state-of-the-art now. About 2/3 of the system has changed, all updated, new parts, and it's the best around. And so for us, we see other parts of Europe that are interested in that. Japan has continued to buy and is going to upgrade more their systems, so we have that as an international order that recently we booked some activity on Patriot. So I’m encouraged by what I see there. But then again as we make these sales, we've got to be able to put them into the system, get them approved through Congress so we can start."

Think of a [ph] McGimble (51:34) that goes back and forth to look over the horizon or to look up or look down depending on where the thread is. This new AESA radars are a fixed plate. The way I like to describe them, think about multiple flashlights on a plate and what the AESA’s allowed to do is these flashlight beams go all over the place and one of them hits the target and so I have multi-scan capability. And that one beam can hit the target, and I can either focus all my energy on it or some of my energy. So mechanically, nothing moves except electrons, which means it has unbelievable reliability. We think we're like the Maytag repairman with these AESAs. They go out there and they don't break. The good part is the cost of them with new capabilities. Our customers can get basically the newest and the best and keep their platforms current. And so what we call our Racer that we're doing for the F-16, everybody’s excited about that, that they can put this new unbelievable higher reliability, probably around the same price, radar on their existing platform. That's the excitement that we see in the marketplace that our newer technologies both forward fit and backward fit. And we think that gives us tremendous opportunities. If I sound excited, I am."

But what's happening different is, I'm not faulting our customer whatsoever for what they're going through. They're making the right kind of calls. I mean my analogy is, in Raytheon when we had $13 billion of debt what did we do? I could go through the litany and I won’t on the call but we basically went from $13 billion to being debt free. And we did that by making some really hard [ph] calls (58:17), they don't happen overnight. I think our customers looks at the way they do business and realizes that they can do more. There are hard calls they have to make. They've got to be able to improve the requirements definition and ensure that the requirements and the programs have stability. When you yin and yang them, that burns money one way or another. I’ve waxed eloquently, I’m biased on streamlining the export control. That benefits both of us when we do it. The other thing is they’re trying to promote the efficient use of resources on both sides. Both of us need to do that. I mean one of the things we can figure out is how do we spend less B&P [ph](59:04) on our proposals? I mean if you have to submit a fixed-price proposal, why do you have to put in hundreds or thousands of pages on a proposal that’s fixed-price? It's competitive as you go through it. So resources can be better. The other thing is we need to eliminate, [ph] govern (59:25) unique processes where practical. Notice I put, where practical, because there are things we do that we don't do on some of our commercial side or with other customers. And the thing I would finally add -- and I give this administration or the DoD great credit -- we're trying to understand the second and third order effects of decisions. That's something I think that has been a huge game changer for Raytheon internally, as we think through things. So when you think about cutting direct labor, the outcome of that could be that you're overheads go up because you don't have as much direct labor base to offset against it and when you do that, don't start whacking people for overheads if the TCL, total cost level, comes down. That needs to be understood. So when you put in your rules, you got to make sure you understand that effect. The other thing is, if you change the fee rates on make versus buy, you could end up with an outcome that you don't like, which means somebody goes vertically rather than using lower-cost suppliers. So we've got to be careful as we go through this thing. And I think what that does is it does create the congestion. And I think when you look at congestion, do you have a partner you could sit down at the table and talk with to keep things moving. And I would give Ash Carter, Bill Lynn and Secretary Gates credit. They listen. And collectively, we've got to work it shoulder to shoulder. It’s in the best interests of our country, and the way I look at it we have an obligation in our industry to provide the best we can to our war fighters. And how do we do that? As quick as we can. And my last point is, I’m a speed nut. The faster we can get things done, the less cost it will be to Raytheon and the less cost it’ll be to the government. And somehow we've got to develop that mindset by resetting ourselves and we haven't done that yet. So we've got work to do. I'm encouraged that people are taking it on. The other is you’d [ph] (1:01:36) sit there and say, woe is me. But it’s still, everybody in the building says you perform, you get paid for it. That has not changed."

You mentioned Saudi, the borders there. That's a little different story. Our strategy was to do something a little bit different than what others would go do. Clearly, the people we worked with liked what we did. Someone else above them made a different decision. That happens when you compete. So I kind of put it in a different bin. But what we see around the world, is the ability that people want to know what's going on on the border. They need ISR capability. They want to be able to protect ports. They want to be able to do things. They’ll be smaller in scale, maybe $50 million, $100 million, $200 million jobs. Those are okay. We understand them. We've experienced about 23%, 25% growth, let me say 20% to 25%, in our homeland security. We have to make an adjustment for e-Borders. But for me, I still see double-digit growth in homeland security whether it be from a point of view of communications, which is really getting big, which is doing airports -- which is a whole other kind of market -- to being able to do Command and Control in countries. And then other customers are asking us how we net things together so that they can have high fidelity information to make decisions. It's a very active market and we see it in those size of programs as we go ahead. We still see international bookings overall, they’ll probably be in the 28% to 30% range for the year. We still expect our international sales to be around 22% to 24% and the other thing that's growing is, classified is running -- clearly going to be in mid- double digits, probably around 15% or so this year, and sales will probably be about in the same range. So classified, domestic and international, is also growing for us. So lots of pieces.

We delivered solid results during the quarter, with sales of $6.3 billion, adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of $413 million. Bookings during the quarter were $6",692,"Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone. 
We delivered solid results during the quarter, with sales of $6.3 billion, adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of $413 million. Bookings during the quarter were $6 billion and on a year-to-date basis, our book-to-bill ratio was around one. Our Missile business brought in over $2 billion in orders during the quarter driven by broad-based demand from U.S. and the international customers. At our other businesses, the pipeline remains healthy. 
We continue to see strong demand. We also see  a continuation of the congestion that we discussed on our prior conference calls and webcast that impacted timing of awards. I'd like to put it in perspective. We really don't see the if issue, just when, and in this environment, when is a little more difficult to predict. Given that, the onus is on us to further reduce our cycle times. We have an internal push to increase speed, and we applaud the government's efforts to increase efficiency and reform export control. I think that's good for both sides. 
Within this environment of challenges and opportunities, we continue to execute well. Our strong program performance, coupled with Six Sigma and lean processes to take cost out of our business, is reflected in our results during the quarter. Our updated outlook for the year and our competitive position also reflects this domestically and internationally. 
Our customers in the U.S. are dealing with challenges. What I'm hearing from the DoD [Department of Defense] leadership is that the Department needs to continue to invest in capabilities to defeat threats to national security. At the same time, economic conditions require an increased focus on controlling costs on both sides. We support the DoD's overall objectives to prioritize spending, improve efficiency, reward contractors that deliver strong program performance, and we stand ready to help. 
On the International side, our business is strong and continues to grow. International sales from the third quarter are up 11%, reaching 24% of our total sales. Again, the driver is the threat environment which remains high, particularly in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Our customers in these regions have the resources to support the required investments in their security.  We have a number of additional important international orders in various stages of the procurement and notification process.
If you stand back and look at world events, the threat environment remains high. It hasn't changed. For all of us, this means that we need to get even better at what we do. Raytheon's well positioned for the future. We have outstanding technology, we have a flexible portfolio, and our consistent focus on providing innovative, affordable and proven solutions will ensure that we remain well positioned.
To help put that in perspective, we've institutionalized Six Sigma and the philosophy of continuous improvement. We made the tough choices on getting the utilization rates in our factories up. We've invested in common engineering supply chain, financial, IT and HR systems that enable us to design anywhere, manufacturing anywhere and ship from anywhere. And our talent can transfer their knowledge across the company. We have a strong balance sheet for some time now so we have the financial strength to continue to make the right investments in our business and for our shareholders.
We are a company that is a consistent performer, with a strong and focused portfolio of programs, and our businesses are well managed. It's a portfolio looked on industry-leading technologies, core capabilities and on opportunities to apply both to meet our customers needs in the U.S. and in the world. Our business model enables us to benefit whether our technologies are used to build new systems or to upgrade existing systems. We support our customers in multiple ways.
In closing, we'll continue to work with our customers to deliver products and services they need for mission success. In that regard, the environment today is exactly what it was yesterday. It's all about innovation, performance, affordability and agility, and we strive to be the very best in each of these areas.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave."

During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slide that we issued earlier this morning. 
If everyone would please turn to Page 3. Strong operational performance across the company drove our margin, EPS and operating cash flow results during the quarter. Sales were $6.3 billion, which I'll discuss further in a few moments. Adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, up 60 basis points. Our adjusted EPS of $1.36 was up 9%, primarily the result of operational improvements and capital deployment actions. Third quarter 2010 adjusted EPS excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment and the favorable tax settlement that we received during the quarter related to multiple prior-year's tax filings. We delivered solid operating cash flow from continuing operations of $413 million, driven primarily by the timing of initiatives related to working capital management.
We continue to improve our working capital efficiency and by way of example, we've increased our operational working capital terms from 10.4 four years ago to 17.2 in 2010, and this translates into about $800 million in cash flow. During the quarter, the company repurchased 9.5 million shares of common stock for $425 million, bringing the year-to-date repurchases to 23.7 million shares for about $1.2 billion. After the close, we executed a number of capital deployment actions taking advantage of the favorable market environment. 
First, the company issued three tranches of long-term debt for $2 billion, 5s, 10s, and 30s with a weighted average coupon of 3.35%.  We used approximately $750 million of the net proceeds to fund the redemption of the existing notes due in 2012 and 2013. The expected close is November 5. In addition, last week, we made the $750 million discretionary cash contribution to our pension plans.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me provide some more detail on our third quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $6 billion and on a year-to-date basis, were $18.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of about one. Missile Systems was the highlight from a bookings perspective with $2.2 billion of new awards during the quarter, including $545 million for the production of AMRAAM missiles, $451 million for the competitively awarded Small Diameter Bomb II and $237million for SM-3. We also booked significant awards for RAAM missiles, the Javelin program, AIM-9X and EKV in addition to winning the competitively awarded Excalibur 1b program. IDS [Integrated Defense Systems] booked $190 million for a TPY-2 radar for the Missile Defense Agency. IDS also booked $104 million on the Zumwalt-class destroyer program and $103 million for the [indiscernible] weapon systems for the U.S. Navy.  IIS [Intelligence and Information Systems] booked $447 million on a number of classified contracts, and our NCS [Network Centric Systems] business booked $84 million for airborne tactical communications systems for multiple customers.
SAS [Space and Airborne Systems] booked $265 million on a number of classified contracts. SAS also booked $87 million for their production of AESA radars for the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard. TS booked $306 million on domestic training programs and $121 million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS activities, and we ended the quarter with a $35.7 billion backlog.
If you'd move to Page 5. Relative to our prior guidance, our third quarter sales were impacted by the timing of awards as well as our cost reduction efforts. Focusing on increasing efficiency and taking costs out of the business is part of Raytheon's culture. We're clearly focused on stepping up our efforts in this area. 
Let me put some color on this. The reduction in costs on our cost-type contracts results in savings on those programs which we pass along to our customers, but also results in lower sales for the company. Now from a margin perspective, the various cost reductions that impact fixed-price programs on our backlog drive margin improvement, and we saw some of this reflected in our Q3 results.  Space and Airborne Systems sales were up 9% in the quarter, strengthening their classified business and growth on an international tactical radar program were key contributors. Technical Services sales were up 10%, driven by both domestic and foreign training programs. IDS, IIS and NCS were the businesses most affected by the timing of contract awards. 
Now moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered strong operational performance. Continued strong program performance was reflected in our adjusted operating margin, which was up by 60 basis points. All of our businesses delivered solid results during the quarter. Missiles, SAS and TS had significant margin expansion, primarily driven by operational improvements. 
Turning to Page 7. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2010 was $1.36, up 9% and on a year-to-date basis, was up 12%. This improvement speaks directly to our continued focus on productivity and cost-efficiency actions.
If you now move to Page 8. I'd like to comment on our guidance for the year. Our sales outlook reflects both the timing of awards and the impact of our cost reduction activities. We reduced the high end by $500 million and the low end by $300 million. As we've done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of the update, FAS/CAS pension expense for the year increased by $9 million from $220 million to $229 million. We updated the range of our interest expense to be between $110 million and $115 million, which now reflects the results of our recent debt offering. We also lowered the range of our diluted share count to be between $377 million and $379 million. 
We reduced our effective tax rate to 24.3%, driven by the favorable tax settlement in Q3. As a reminder, we're assuming that the R&D tax credit extension gets passed in 2010 to work it out $0.07 in earnings per share. We increased the high end of our adjusted EPS for the year by $0.10 to reflect the increase in our expected margin for the year. We see adjusted EPS to be between $5.28 and $5.38. You should note that we also increased our 2010 guidance for GAAP EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.55, which includes the $0.75 reduction, the full year EPS from the U.K. Border Agency program termination in the second quarter, the tax related benefit of $0.45 recorded in the third quarter, the estimated $0.13 charge we'll book in the fourth quarter associated with the make whole provision of the early debt retirement and the $0.39 in full year FAS/CAS pension expense.
Our current operating cash flow outlook for the full year of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion now includes the $750 million discretionary cash contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter. And finally, we increased the low end and narrowed the range of our outlook for ROIC to between 12.3% and 12.6% Overall, our updated outlook for 2010 reflects our ability to drive earnings growth through operational improvements and capital deployment actions.
Moving on to Page 9, let me give you a little more detail. The two principal drivers for the updated sales and margin guidance are consistent with what I've already said. Compared to our prior guidance, the lower sales that IDS and NCS are the results of the timing of awards, as well as cost reductions, which again are a key driver in the increase in margins. At MS, SAS and TS, we also see an improved margin outlook. Overall, we're pleased with the results of the operational improvements and the margin we've delivered, while at the same time, passing along savings to our customers.
Now we plan to provide you with the details for our 2011 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call in January. By that time, we'll have more clarity on the FY '11 budget, the continuing resolution and the timing of some of our U.S. and international awards. Now with that said, we do want to provide you with some sense of what we're seeing at this point in time.
If we have to peg next year today, we're looking at a sales range of 2% to 4% over 2010 and for margins on an adjusted basis, we expect to be in line with this year. And from a cash perspective, we fully expect to continue to deliver strong cash flow as we have in the past. We've also provided an update on how we see FAS/CAS pension expense trending for 
2011. 
So if you would please turn Page 10. We've provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2011. The shaded area on the matrix reflects our range of estimates for the current environment. We are currently at on a year-to-date asset return basis of slightly over 7%, consistent with our return-on-asset assumption of 8.75%. Just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset return won't be known until we close out 2010.  As a reminder, the FAS/CAS adjustment is non cash and non operational. It simply reflects the temporary difference between FAS and CAS pension accounting. The key point is that pension cost is recoverable overtime through our rates.
Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize our third quarter performance and our outlook. Continued improvement in operational performance during the quarter drove margin expansion, strong growth in earnings per share and good cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to address the opportunities and also the challenges in our industry. We have the right strategy, the right capabilities and the discipline to capital deployment plans to drive growth and attractive total shareholder returns. 
With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Over to you, Marc."

Now if you go into the fourth quarter, there was a couple of things happening at some level and some of the businesses, mix does work against us a little bit overall. And secondly, we're starting to think, obviously, about next year and starting to put in place programs that will be more beneficial to next year that will be in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind though that we did improve our overall outlook for margins to 12.1% to 12.3%, and that's pretty healthy.

One is we passed along a lot of these savings to our customer, that's number one. Number two is you are right, the cost reductions will add to margins over time, because they directly impact our fixed-price backlog programs.

It's a lot of the programs we've been talking about, Bill just went through that. From an IIS perspective, they've been impacted primarily by the period costs that will incur as a result of the termination, and that's worth about 20 basis points. Q3 and year-to-date from a missile standpoint, higher than guidance, driven by, again, the timing of the productivity improvements, we're increasing the year by 20 basis points. Again, no particular issue, no particular area, it's just overall cost reductions. NCS, again, SAS continues to perform well, there's nothing unique there. I talked about SAS earlier having a little bit of favorable impact as a result of mix. TS, I mentioned the favorable contract modification earlier being worth about 20 basis points.

And so when we look at the timing on the international, we want things that we've got in our forecast to happen. And as Dave pointed out in his remarks, it's where we stand today. We need to see what's going to happen on the fiscal year '11 budget, the continuing resolution. My gut feel says that we're going to operate on that into next year. And so those things have a real effect on your domestic growth and then right on top of that, we're going to be looking at fiscal year '12.

What DCGS does is it supports multiple ISR platforms, satellites, manned, unmanned systems. To me, I refer to it in the company and outside the company, it's like Google with a clearance. No offense to Google, but DCGS allows you to move data around.

And in this tight budget, the way I look at it, it satisfies three customers, Patriot satisfies the minimum 12 around the world, and people will decide what they want to do in that process. I'm highly biased so you know my answer. But I think from our standpoint, Patriot is the most capable air defense system in the world for both air breathers, ballistic missiles, aircraft and crews and there's nothing else like it, and put Patriot up against anything in the world for that matter. So we expect Patriot to be around a long time, and so from that standpoint, there could be an upside depending on what the decision is there. But I'll let people that have to make that choice make it. Regarding Standard Missile, we have a family of Standard Missile, we have IA, IB, IIA, IIBs. The IIA was just increased in funding about 25%. It's the one that's got a very successful flight-test program. And for us, we're a company that competes every place we go, so competition really doesn't frighten us. People didn't think we were going to win Small Diameter Bomb but low and behold, the company did that. Our customers told us we significantly provide them better mission capability, making our technical approach, we won the strength of our tri-mode seeker, our innovative warhead technology and our aircraft integration and our past performance was rated exceptional. So from my standpoint, competition doesn't bother me. We're prepared to go head to head with anybody especially in the missile business. So I realize what MDA has to do, but when we start talking about something in 2020 and 2025, that's a long ways out, and a lot of things can happen between now and then."

We delivered solid results during the quarter, with sales of $6.3 billion, adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of $413 million. Bookings during the quarter were $6",692,"Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone. 
We delivered solid results during the quarter, with sales of $6.3 billion, adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of $413 million. Bookings during the quarter were $6 billion and on a year-to-date basis, our book-to-bill ratio was around one. Our Missile business brought in over $2 billion in orders during the quarter driven by broad-based demand from U.S. and the international customers. At our other businesses, the pipeline remains healthy. 
We continue to see strong demand. We also see  a continuation of the congestion that we discussed on our prior conference calls and webcast that impacted timing of awards. I'd like to put it in perspective. We really don't see the if issue, just when, and in this environment, when is a little more difficult to predict. Given that, the onus is on us to further reduce our cycle times. We have an internal push to increase speed, and we applaud the government's efforts to increase efficiency and reform export control. I think that's good for both sides. 
Within this environment of challenges and opportunities, we continue to execute well. Our strong program performance, coupled with Six Sigma and lean processes to take cost out of our business, is reflected in our results during the quarter. Our updated outlook for the year and our competitive position also reflects this domestically and internationally. 
Our customers in the U.S. are dealing with challenges. What I'm hearing from the DoD [Department of Defense] leadership is that the Department needs to continue to invest in capabilities to defeat threats to national security. At the same time, economic conditions require an increased focus on controlling costs on both sides. We support the DoD's overall objectives to prioritize spending, improve efficiency, reward contractors that deliver strong program performance, and we stand ready to help. 
On the International side, our business is strong and continues to grow. International sales from the third quarter are up 11%, reaching 24% of our total sales. Again, the driver is the threat environment which remains high, particularly in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Our customers in these regions have the resources to support the required investments in their security.  We have a number of additional important international orders in various stages of the procurement and notification process.
If you stand back and look at world events, the threat environment remains high. It hasn't changed. For all of us, this means that we need to get even better at what we do. Raytheon's well positioned for the future. We have outstanding technology, we have a flexible portfolio, and our consistent focus on providing innovative, affordable and proven solutions will ensure that we remain well positioned.
To help put that in perspective, we've institutionalized Six Sigma and the philosophy of continuous improvement. We made the tough choices on getting the utilization rates in our factories up. We've invested in common engineering supply chain, financial, IT and HR systems that enable us to design anywhere, manufacturing anywhere and ship from anywhere. And our talent can transfer their knowledge across the company. We have a strong balance sheet for some time now so we have the financial strength to continue to make the right investments in our business and for our shareholders.
We are a company that is a consistent performer, with a strong and focused portfolio of programs, and our businesses are well managed. It's a portfolio looked on industry-leading technologies, core capabilities and on opportunities to apply both to meet our customers needs in the U.S. and in the world. Our business model enables us to benefit whether our technologies are used to build new systems or to upgrade existing systems. We support our customers in multiple ways.
In closing, we'll continue to work with our customers to deliver products and services they need for mission success. In that regard, the environment today is exactly what it was yesterday. It's all about innovation, performance, affordability and agility, and we strive to be the very best in each of these areas.

During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slide that we issued earlier this morning. 
If everyone would please turn to Page 3. Strong operational performance across the company drove our margin, EPS and operating cash flow results during the quarter. Sales were $6.3 billion, which I'll discuss further in a few moments. Adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, up 60 basis points. Our adjusted EPS of $1.36 was up 9%, primarily the result of operational improvements and capital deployment actions. Third quarter 2010 adjusted EPS excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment and the favorable tax settlement that we received during the quarter related to multiple prior-year's tax filings. We delivered solid operating cash flow from continuing operations of $413 million, driven primarily by the timing of initiatives related to working capital management.
We continue to improve our working capital efficiency and by way of example, we've increased our operational working capital terms from 10.4 four years ago to 17.2 in 2010, and this translates into about $800 million in cash flow. During the quarter, the company repurchased 9.5 million shares of common stock for $425 million, bringing the year-to-date repurchases to 23.7 million shares for about $1.2 billion. After the close, we executed a number of capital deployment actions taking advantage of the favorable market environment. 
First, the company issued three tranches of long-term debt for $2 billion, 5s, 10s, and 30s with a weighted average coupon of 3.35%.  We used approximately $750 million of the net proceeds to fund the redemption of the existing notes due in 2012 and 2013. The expected close is November 5. In addition, last week, we made the $750 million discretionary cash contribution to our pension plans.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me provide some more detail on our third quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $6 billion and on a year-to-date basis, were $18.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of about one. Missile Systems was the highlight from a bookings perspective with $2.2 billion of new awards during the quarter, including $545 million for the production of AMRAAM missiles, $451 million for the competitively awarded Small Diameter Bomb II and $237million for SM-3. We also booked significant awards for RAAM missiles, the Javelin program, AIM-9X and EKV in addition to winning the competitively awarded Excalibur 1b program. IDS [Integrated Defense Systems] booked $190 million for a TPY-2 radar for the Missile Defense Agency. IDS also booked $104 million on the Zumwalt-class destroyer program and $103 million for the [indiscernible] weapon systems for the U.S. Navy.  IIS [Intelligence and Information Systems] booked $447 million on a number of classified contracts, and our NCS [Network Centric Systems] business booked $84 million for airborne tactical communications systems for multiple customers.
SAS [Space and Airborne Systems] booked $265 million on a number of classified contracts. SAS also booked $87 million for their production of AESA radars for the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard. TS booked $306 million on domestic training programs and $121 million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS activities, and we ended the quarter with a $35.7 billion backlog.
If you'd move to Page 5. Relative to our prior guidance, our third quarter sales were impacted by the timing of awards as well as our cost reduction efforts. Focusing on increasing efficiency and taking costs out of the business is part of Raytheon's culture. We're clearly focused on stepping up our efforts in this area. 
Let me put some color on this. The reduction in costs on our cost-type contracts results in savings on those programs which we pass along to our customers, but also results in lower sales for the company. Now from a margin perspective, the various cost reductions that impact fixed-price programs on our backlog drive margin improvement, and we saw some of this reflected in our Q3 results.  Space and Airborne Systems sales were up 9% in the quarter, strengthening their classified business and growth on an international tactical radar program were key contributors. Technical Services sales were up 10%, driven by both domestic and foreign training programs. IDS, IIS and NCS were the businesses most affected by the timing of contract awards. 
Now moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered strong operational performance. Continued strong program performance was reflected in our adjusted operating margin, which was up by 60 basis points. All of our businesses delivered solid results during the quarter. Missiles, SAS and TS had significant margin expansion, primarily driven by operational improvements. 
Turning to Page 7. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2010 was $1.36, up 9% and on a year-to-date basis, was up 12%. This improvement speaks directly to our continued focus on productivity and cost-efficiency actions.
If you now move to Page 8. I'd like to comment on our guidance for the year. Our sales outlook reflects both the timing of awards and the impact of our cost reduction activities. We reduced the high end by $500 million and the low end by $300 million. As we've done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of the update, FAS/CAS pension expense for the year increased by $9 million from $220 million to $229 million. We updated the range of our interest expense to be between $110 million and $115 million, which now reflects the results of our recent debt offering. We also lowered the range of our diluted share count to be between $377 million and $379 million. 
We reduced our effective tax rate to 24.3%, driven by the favorable tax settlement in Q3. As a reminder, we're assuming that the R&D tax credit extension gets passed in 2010 to work it out $0.07 in earnings per share. We increased the high end of our adjusted EPS for the year by $0.10 to reflect the increase in our expected margin for the year. We see adjusted EPS to be between $5.28 and $5.38. You should note that we also increased our 2010 guidance for GAAP EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.55, which includes the $0.75 reduction, the full year EPS from the U.K. Border Agency program termination in the second quarter, the tax related benefit of $0.45 recorded in the third quarter, the estimated $0.13 charge we'll book in the fourth quarter associated with the make whole provision of the early debt retirement and the $0.39 in full year FAS/CAS pension expense.
Our current operating cash flow outlook for the full year of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion now includes the $750 million discretionary cash contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter. And finally, we increased the low end and narrowed the range of our outlook for ROIC to between 12.3% and 12.6% Overall, our updated outlook for 2010 reflects our ability to drive earnings growth through operational improvements and capital deployment actions.
Moving on to Page 9, let me give you a little more detail. The two principal drivers for the updated sales and margin guidance are consistent with what I've already said. Compared to our prior guidance, the lower sales that IDS and NCS are the results of the timing of awards, as well as cost reductions, which again are a key driver in the increase in margins. At MS, SAS and TS, we also see an improved margin outlook. Overall, we're pleased with the results of the operational improvements and the margin we've delivered, while at the same time, passing along savings to our customers.
Now we plan to provide you with the details for our 2011 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call in January. By that time, we'll have more clarity on the FY '11 budget, the continuing resolution and the timing of some of our U.S. and international awards. Now with that said, we do want to provide you with some sense of what we're seeing at this point in time.
If we have to peg next year today, we're looking at a sales range of 2% to 4% over 2010 and for margins on an adjusted basis, we expect to be in line with this year. And from a cash perspective, we fully expect to continue to deliver strong cash flow as we have in the past. We've also provided an update on how we see FAS/CAS pension expense trending for 
2011. 
So if you would please turn Page 10. We've provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2011. The shaded area on the matrix reflects our range of estimates for the current environment. We are currently at on a year-to-date asset return basis of slightly over 7%, consistent with our return-on-asset assumption of 8.75%. Just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset return won't be known until we close out 2010.  As a reminder, the FAS/CAS adjustment is non cash and non operational. It simply reflects the temporary difference between FAS and CAS pension accounting. The key point is that pension cost is recoverable overtime through our rates.
Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize our third quarter performance and our outlook. Continued improvement in operational performance during the quarter drove margin expansion, strong growth in earnings per share and good cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to address the opportunities and also the challenges in our industry. We have the right strategy, the right capabilities and the discipline to capital deployment plans to drive growth and attractive total shareholder returns. 
With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Over to you, Marc.

So the timing of how that margin improvement impacts the year is, by and large, behind us. It happened in the first three quarters simply because of when the programs went into play. Now if you go into the fourth quarter, there was a couple of things happening at some level and some of the businesses, mix does work against us a little bit overall. And secondly, we're starting to think, obviously, about next year and starting to put in place programs that will be more beneficial to next year that will be in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind though that we did improve our overall outlook for margins to 12.1% to 12.3%, and that's pretty healthy. So there's nothing, I guess the takeaway is there's nothing remarkable happening in the fourth quarter, a lot of it is just timing.

So if you look at IDS, we've increased guidance 20 basis points to reflect improved performance and cost reductions. Again, nothing unique. It's a lot of the programs we've been talking about, Bill just went through that. From an IIS perspective, they've been impacted primarily by the period costs that will incur as a result of the termination, and that's worth about 20 basis points. Q3 and year-to-date from a missile standpoint, higher than guidance, driven by, again, the timing of the productivity improvements, we're increasing the year by 20 basis points. Again, no particular issue, no particular area, it's just overall cost reductions. NCS, again, SAS continues to perform well, there's nothing unique there. I talked about SAS earlier having a little bit of favorable impact as a result of mix. TS, I mentioned the favorable contract modification earlier being worth about 20 basis points. So I think if you're standing back, you're looking for something unique to say, ""Well, there was one event that impacted margins 30 or 40 basis points on the quarter and it's normalized at 12.5%,"" I think that's frankly the wrong way to look at it. I'll go back to what I said before, it's simply the timing of when we put into our EACs, the impact of these cost-reduction actions. Once they're firm and in place, we're able to take that benefit, and it was notable in Q3, again, throughout the year, and it's just a timing between where we are now and where we'll be as we exit the year.

The Distributed Common Ground System, DCGS, you've heard me talk about it in the past, but we just completed with the Air Force, the successful evaluation of DCGS at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany. What DCGS does is it supports multiple ISR platforms, satellites, manned, unmanned systems. To me, I refer to it in the company and outside the company, it's like Google with a clearance. No offense to Google, but DCGS allows you to move data around. And what's important to it for us, as we look to the future, worldwide intelligence is going to even take on a bigger role, if you think about it. And how do you look at that information across the globe and sort it out and share at multiple classified areas and, that's what we're lining ourselves up to be able to do.

They'll be going through that. It's a big program, lots of money. And in this tight budget, the way I look at it, it satisfies three customers, Patriot satisfies the minimum 12 around the world, and people will decide what they want to do in that process. I'm highly biased so you know my answer. But I think from our standpoint, Patriot is the most capable air defense system in the world for both air breathers, ballistic missiles, aircraft and crews and there's nothing else like it, and put Patriot up against anything in the world for that matter. So we expect Patriot to be around a long time, and so from that standpoint, there could be an upside depending on what the decision is there. But I'll let people that have to make that choice make it. Regarding Standard Missile, we have a family of Standard Missile, we have IA, IB, IIA, IIBs. The IIA was just increased in funding about 25%. It's the one that's got a very successful flight-test program. And for us, we're a company that competes every place we go, so competition really doesn't frighten us. People didn't think we were going to win Small Diameter Bomb but low and behold, the company did that. Our customers told us we significantly provide them better mission capability, making our technical approach, we won the strength of our tri-mode seeker, our innovative warhead technology and our aircraft integration and our past performance was rated exceptional. So from my standpoint, competition doesn't bother me. We're prepared to go head to head with anybody especially in the missile business. So I realize what MDA has to do, but when we start talking about something in 2020 and 2025, that's a long ways out, and a lot of things can happen between now and then.

We delivered solid results during the quarter, with sales of $6.3 billion, adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of $413 million. Bookings during the quarter were $6",692,"Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone. 
We delivered solid results during the quarter, with sales of $6.3 billion, adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of $413 million. Bookings during the quarter were $6 billion. And on a year-to-date basis, our book-to-bill ratio was around one. Our Missile business brought in over $2 billion in orders during the quarter driven by broad-based demand from U.S. and international customers. At our other businesses, the pipeline remains healthy. 
We continue to see strong demand. We also see  a continuation of the congestion that we discussed on our prior conference calls and Webcasts that impacted the timing of awards. I'd like to put it in perspective. We really don't see the if issue, just when. And in this environment, when is a little more difficult to predict. Given that, the onus is on us to further reduce our cycle times. We have an internal push to increase speed, and we applaud the government's efforts to increase efficiency and reform export control. I think that's good for both sides. 
Within this environment of challenges and opportunities, we continue to execute well. Our strong program performance, coupled with Six Sigma and lean processes to take cost out of our business, is reflected in our results during the quarter. Our updated outlook for the year and our competitive position also reflects this domestically and internationally. 
Our customers in the U.S. are dealing with challenges. What I'm hearing from the DoD [Department of Defense] leadership is that the Department needs to continue to invest in capabilities to defeat threats to national security. At the same time, economic conditions require an increased focus on controlling costs on both sides. We support the DoD's overall objectives to prioritize spending, improve efficiency, reward contractors that deliver strong program performance, and we stand ready to help. 
On the International side, our business is strong and continues to grow. International sales from the third quarter are up 11%, reaching 24% of our total sales. Again, the driver is the threat environment which remains high, particularly in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Our customers in these regions have the resources to support the required investments in their security.  We have a number of additional important international orders in various stages of the procurement and notification process.
If you stand back and look at world events, the threat environment remains high. It hasn't changed. For all of us, this means that we need to get even better at what we do. Raytheon's well positioned for the future. We have outstanding technology. We have a flexible portfolio. And our consistent focus on providing innovative, affordable and proven solutions will ensure that we remain well positioned.
To help put that in perspective, we've institutionalized Six Sigma and the philosophy of continuous improvement. We made the tough choices on getting the utilization rates in our factories up. We've invested in common engineering supply chain, financial, IT and HR systems that enable us to design anywhere, manufacturing anywhere and ship from anywhere. And our talent can transfer their knowledge across the company. We have a strong balance sheet for some time now so we have the financial strength to continue to make the right investments in our business and for our shareholders.
We are a company that is a consistent performer, with a strong and focused portfolio of programs. And our businesses are well managed. It's a portfolio built on industry-leading technologies, core capabilities and on opportunities to apply both to meet our customers’ needs in the U.S. and in the world. Our business model enables us to benefit whether our technologies are used to build new systems or to upgrade existing systems. We support our customers in multiple ways.
In closing, we'll continue to work with our customers to deliver products and services they need for mission success. In that regard, the environment today is exactly what it was yesterday. It's all about innovation, performance, affordability and agility. And we strive to be the very best in each of these areas.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave."

During my remarks, I'll be referring to the Web slide that we issued earlier this morning. 
If everyone would please turn to Page 3. Strong operational performance across the company drove our margin, EPS and operating cash flow results during the quarter. Sales were $6.3 billion, which I'll discuss further in a few moments. Adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, up 60 basis points. Our adjusted EPS of $1.36 was up 9%, primarily the result of operational improvements and capital deployment actions. Third quarter 2010 adjusted EPS excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment and the favorable tax settlement that we received during the quarter related to multiple prior-years’ tax filings. We delivered solid operating cash flow from continuing operations of $413 million, driven primarily by the timing of initiatives related to working capital management.
We continue to improve our working capital efficiency. And by way of example, we've increased our operational working capital terms from 10.4 four years ago to 17.2 in 2010, and this translates into about $800 million in cash flow. During the quarter, the company repurchased 9.5 million shares of common stock for $425 million, bringing the year-to-date repurchases to 23.7 million shares for about $1.2 billion. After the close, we executed a number of capital deployment actions taking advantage of the favorable market environment. 
First, the company issued three tranches of long-term debt for $2 billion, 5s, 10s, and 30s with a weighted average coupon of 3.35%.  We used approximately $750 million of the net proceeds to fund the redemption of the existing notes due in 2012 and 2013. The expected close is November 5. In addition, last week, we made the $750 million discretionary cash contribution to our pension plans.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me provide some more detail on our third quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $6 billion, and on a year-to-date basis, were $18.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of about one. Missile Systems was the highlight from a bookings perspective with $2.2 billion of new awards during the quarter, including $545 million for the production of AMRAAM missiles, $451 million for the competitively-awarded Small Diameter Bomb II and $237million for SM-3. We also booked significant awards for RAAM missiles, the Javelin program, AIM-9X and EKV, in addition to winning the competitively-awarded Excalibur 1b program. IDS [Integrated Defense Systems] booked $190 million for a TPY-2 radar for the Missile Defense Agency. IDS also booked $104 million on the Zumwalt-class destroyer program and $103 million for the Weapon Systems for the U.S. Navy.  IIS [Intelligence and Information Systems] booked $447 million on a number of classified contracts. And our NCS [Network Centric Systems] business booked $84 million for airborne tactical communications systems for multiple customers.
SAS [Space and Airborne Systems] booked $265 million on a number of classified contracts. SAS also booked $87 million for their production of AESA radars for the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard. TS booked $306 million on domestic training programs and $121 million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS activities. And we ended the quarter with a $35.7 billion backlog.
If you'd move to Page 5. Relative to our prior guidance, our third quarter sales were impacted by the timing of awards, as well as our cost reduction efforts. Focusing on increasing efficiency and taking costs out of the business is part of Raytheon's culture. We're clearly focused on stepping up our efforts in this area. 
Let me put some color on this. The reduction in costs on our cost-type contracts results in savings on those programs which we pass along to our customers, but also results in lower sales for the company. Now from a margin perspective, the various cost reductions that impact fixed-price programs on our backlog drive margin improvement, and we saw some of this reflected in our Q3 results.  Space and Airborne Systems sales were up 9% in the quarter, strength in their classified business and growth on an international tactical radar program were key contributors. Technical Services sales were up 10%, driven by both domestic and foreign training programs. IDS, IIS and NCS were the businesses most affected by the timing of contract awards. 
Now moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered strong operational performance. Continued strong program performance was reflected in our adjusted operating margin, which was up by 60 basis points. All of our businesses delivered solid results during the quarter. Missiles, SAS and TS had significant margin expansion, primarily driven by operational improvements. 
Turning to Page 7. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2010 was $1.36, up 9%, and on a year-to-date basis was up 12%. This improvement speaks directly to our continued focus on productivity and cost-efficiency actions.
If you now move to Page 8. I'd like to comment on our guidance for the year. Our sales outlook reflects both the timing of awards and the impact of our cost reduction activities. We reduced the high end by $500 million and the low end by $300 million. As we've done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of the update, FAS/CAS pension expense for the year increased by $9 million from $220 million to $229 million. We updated the range of our interest expense to be between $110 million and $115 million, which now reflects the results of our recent debt offering. We also lowered the range of our diluted share count to be between $377 million and $379 million. 
We reduced our effective tax rate to 24.3%, driven by the favorable tax settlement in Q3. As a reminder, we're assuming that the R&D tax credit extension gets passed in 2010 to work it out $0.07 in earnings per share. We increased the high end of our adjusted EPS for the year by $0.10 to reflect the increase in our expected margin for the year. We see adjusted EPS to be between $5.28 and $5.38. You should note that we also increased our 2010 guidance for GAAP EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.55, which includes the $0.75 reduction, the full year EPS from the U.K. Border Agency program termination in the second quarter, the tax related benefit of $0.45 recorded in the third quarter, the estimated $0.13 charge we'll book in the fourth quarter associated with the make whole provision of the early debt retirement, and the $0.39 in full year FAS/CAS pension expense.
Our current operating cash flow outlook for the full year of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion now includes the $750 million discretionary cash contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter. And finally, we increased the low end and narrowed the range of our outlook for ROIC to between 12.3% and 12.6% Overall, our updated outlook for 2010 reflects our ability to drive earnings growth through operational improvements and capital deployment actions.
Moving on to Page 9, let me give you a little more detail. The two principal drivers for the updated sales and margin guidance are consistent with what I've already said. Compared to our prior guidance, the lower sales at IDS and NCS are the results of the timing of awards, as well as cost reductions, which again are a key driver in the increase in margins. At MS, SAS and TS, we also see an improved margin outlook. Overall, we're pleased with the results of the operational improvements and the margin we've delivered, while at the same time, passing along savings to our customers.
Now we plan to provide you with the details for our 2011 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call in January. By that time, we'll have more clarity on the FY '11 budget, the continuing resolution and the timing of some of our U.S. and international awards. Now with that said, we do want to provide you with some sense of what we're seeing at this point in time.
If we had to peg next year today, we're looking at a sales range of 2% to 4% over 2010, and for margins on an adjusted basis we expect to be in line with this year. And from a cash perspective, we fully expect to continue to deliver strong cash flow as we have in the past. We've also provided an update on how we see FAS/CAS pension expense trending for 2011. 
So if you would please turn Page 10. We've provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2011. The shaded area on the matrix reflects our range of estimates for the current environment. We are currently at on a year-to-date asset return basis of slightly over 7%, consistent with our return-on-asset assumption of 8.75%. Just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset return won't be known until we close out 2010.  As a reminder, the FAS/CAS adjustment is non cash and non operational. It simply reflects the temporary difference between FAS and CAS pension accounting. The key point is that pension cost is recoverable overtime through our rates.
Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize our third quarter performance and our outlook. Continued improvement in operational performance during the quarter drove margin expansion, strong growth in earnings per share and good cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to address the opportunities and also the challenges in our industry. We have the right strategy, the right capabilities and the discipline to capital deployment plans to drive growth and attractive total shareholder returns. 
With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Over to you, Marc."

Going forward, I would suggest that it's likely a little more level loaded, quarter-to-quarter, as you're comparing to prior year's same quarter. But again, Bill mentioned it during his commentary earlier. I did as well. There was just a lot of activity. We'll continue that moving forward.

And then, Dave, can you quantify, you talked about some of the cost-savings actions that in Q4 that might be a little bit more material than what you've incurred year-to-date, which hasn't really been material.

So if you look at IDS, we've increased guidance 20 basis points to reflect improved performance and cost reductions. Again, nothing unique. It's a lot of the programs we've been talking about. Bill just went through that. From an IIS perspective, they've been impacted primarily by the period costs that will incur as a result of the termination. And that's worth about 20 basis points. Q3 and year-to-date from a missile standpoint: higher than guidance, driven by, again, the timing of the productivity improvements. We're increasing the year by 20 basis points. Again, no particular issue. No particular area. It's just overall cost reductions. NCS, again. SAS continues to perform well. There’s nothing unique there. I talked about SAS earlier having a little bit of favorable impact as a result of mix. TS, I mentioned the favorable contract modification earlier being worth about 20 basis points. So I think if you're standing back and you're looking for something unique to say, ""Well, there was one event that impacted margins 30 or 40 basis points on the quarter and it's normalized at 12.5%,"" I think that's frankly the wrong way to look at it. I'll go back to what I said before. It's simply the timing of when we put into our EACs the impact of these cost-reduction actions. Once they're firm and in place we're able to take that benefit. And it was notable in Q3. Again, throughout the year. And it's just a timing between where we are now and where we'll be as we exit the year."

What is the incremental opportunity for your portfolio? And then second, in a related business. With respect to the MDA's [Missile Defense Agency] decision on SM-3 Block IIB to openly compete that. Can you talk about how we should think about that specifically in your program? And if you're seeing that in other areas that might put kind of minimum margin pressure?"

They'll be going through that. It's a big program. Lots of money. And in this tight budget, the way I look at it, it satisfies three customers. Patriot satisfies the minimum 12 around the world. And people will decide what they want to do in that process. I'm highly biased. So you know my answer. But I think from our standpoint, Patriot is the most capable air defense system in the world for both air breathers, ballistic missiles, aircraft and crews. And there's nothing else like it. Put Patriot up against anything in the world, for that matter. So we expect Patriot to be around a long time. And so from that standpoint there could be an upside depending on what the decision is there. But I'll let the people that have to make that choice make it. Regarding Standard Missile, we have a family of Standard Missiles. We have IA, IB, IIA, IIBs. The IIA was just increased in funding about 25%. It's the one that's got a very successful flight-test program. And for us, we're a company that competes every place we go. So competition really doesn't frighten us. People didn't think we were going to win Small Diameter Bomb. But lo and behold, the company did that. Our customers told us we significantly provide them better mission capability. Making our technical approach, we won the strength of our tri-mode seeker, our innovative warhead technology. And our aircraft integration and our past performance was rated exceptional. So from my standpoint, competition doesn't bother me. We're prepared to go head to head with anybody. Especially in the missile business. So I realize what MDA has to do, but when we start talking about something in 2020 and 2025, that's a long ways out. And a lot of things can happen between now and then."

105612,114666087,83187,"Raytheon Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives"," Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results during the quarter, with sales of $6.3 billion, adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of $413 million. Bookings during the quarter were $",692," Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone.
 We delivered solid results during the quarter, with sales of $6.3 billion, adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of $413 million. Bookings during the quarter were $6 billion and on a year-to-date basis, our book-to-bill ratio was around one. Our Missile business brought in over $2 billion in orders during the quarter driven by broad-based demand from U.S. and the international customers. At our other businesses, the pipeline remains healthy.
 We continue to see strong demand. We also see  a continuation of the congestion that we discussed on our prior conference calls and webcast that impacted timing of awards. I'd like to put it in perspective. We really don't see the if issue, just when, and in this environment, when is a little more difficult to predict. Given that, the onus is on us to further reduce our cycle times. We have an internal push to increase speed, and we applaud the government's efforts to increase efficiency and reform export control. I think that's good for both sides.
 Within this environment of challenges and opportunities, we continue to execute well. Our strong program performance, coupled with Six Sigma and lean processes to take cost out of our business, is reflected in our results during the quarter. Our updated outlook for the year and our competitive position also reflects this domestically and internationally.
 Our customers in the U.S. are dealing with challenges. What I'm hearing from the DoD [Department of Defense] leadership is that the Department needs to continue to invest in capabilities to defeat threats to national security. At the same time, economic conditions require an increased focus on controlling costs on both sides. We support the DoD's overall objectives to prioritize spending, improve efficiency, reward contractors that deliver strong program performance, and we stand ready to help.
 On the International side, our business is strong and continues to grow. International sales from the third quarter are up 11%, reaching 24% of our total sales. Again, the driver is the threat environment which remains high, particularly in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Our customers in these regions have the resources to support the required investments in their security.  We have a number of additional important international orders in various stages of the procurement and notification process.
 If you stand back and look at world events, the threat environment remains high. It hasn't changed. For all of us, this means that we need to get even better at what we do. Raytheon's well positioned for the future. We have outstanding technology, we have a flexible portfolio, and our consistent focus on providing innovative, affordable and proven solutions will ensure that we remain well positioned.
 To help put that in perspective, we've institutionalized Six Sigma and the philosophy of continuous improvement. We made the tough choices on getting the utilization rates in our factories up. We've invested in common engineering supply chain, financial, IT and HR systems that enable us to design anywhere, manufacturing anywhere and ship from anywhere. And our talent can transfer their knowledge across the company. We have a strong balance sheet for some time now so we have the financial strength to continue to make the right investments in our business and for our shareholders.
 We are a company that is a consistent performer, with a strong and focused portfolio of programs, and our businesses are well managed. It's a portfolio looked on industry-leading technologies, core capabilities and on opportunities to apply both to meet our customers needs in the U.S. and in the world. Our business model enables us to benefit whether our technologies are used to build new systems or to upgrade existing systems. We support our customers in multiple ways.
 In closing, we'll continue to work with our customers to deliver products and services they need for mission success. In that regard, the environment today is exactly what it was yesterday. It's all about innovation, performance, affordability and agility, and we strive to be the very best in each of these areas.
 With that, let me turn it over to Dave.

105612,114666087,83187,"Raytheon Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives"," Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening comments, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slide that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to Page 3. Strong operational performance a",1620," Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening comments, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slide that we issued earlier this morning.
 If everyone would please turn to Page 3. Strong operational performance across the company drove our margin, EPS and operating cash flow results during the quarter. Sales were $6.3 billion, which I'll discuss further in a few moments. Adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, up 60 basis points. Our adjusted EPS of $1.36 was up 9%, primarily the result of operational improvements and capital deployment actions. Third quarter 2010 adjusted EPS excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment and the favorable tax settlement that we received during the quarter related to multiple prior-year's tax filings. We delivered solid operating cash flow from continuing operations of $413 million, driven primarily by the timing of initiatives related to working capital management.
 We continue to improve our working capital efficiency and by way of example, we've increased our operational working capital terms from 10.4 four years ago to 17.2 in 2010, and this translates into about $800 million in cash flow. During the quarter, the company repurchased 9.5 million shares of common stock for $425 million, bringing the year-to-date repurchases to 23.7 million shares for about $1.2 billion. After the close, we executed a number of capital deployment actions taking advantage of the favorable market environment.
 First, the company issued three tranches of long-term debt for $2 billion, 5s, 10s, and 30s with a weighted average coupon of 3.35%.  We used approximately $750 million of the net proceeds to fund the redemption of the existing notes due in 2012 and 2013. The expected close is November 5. In addition, last week, we made the $750 million discretionary cash contribution to our pension plans.
 Turning now to Page 4. Let me provide some more detail on our third quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $6 billion and on a year-to-date basis, were $18.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of about one. Missile Systems was the highlight from a bookings perspective with $2.2 billion of new awards during the quarter, including $545 million for the production of AMRAAM missiles, $451 million for the competitively awarded Small Diameter Bomb II and $237million for SM-3. We also booked significant awards for RAAM missiles, the Javelin program, AIM-9X and EKV in addition to winning the competitively awarded Excalibur 1b program. IDS [Integrated Defense Systems] booked $190 million for a TPY-2 radar for the Missile Defense Agency. IDS also booked $104 million on the Zumwalt-class destroyer program and $103 million for the [indiscernible] weapon systems for the U.S. Navy.  IIS [Intelligence and Information Systems] booked $447 million on a number of classified contracts, and our NCS [Network Centric Systems] business booked $84 million for airborne tactical communications systems for multiple customers.
 SAS [Space and Airborne Systems] booked $265 million on a number of classified contracts. SAS also booked $87 million for their production of AESA radars for the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard. TS booked $306 million on domestic training programs and $121 million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS activities, and we ended the quarter with a $35.7 billion backlog.
 If you'd move to Page 5. Relative to our prior guidance, our third quarter sales were impacted by the timing of awards as well as our cost reduction efforts. Focusing on increasing efficiency and taking costs out of the business is part of Raytheon's culture. We're clearly focused on stepping up our efforts in this area.
 Let me put some color on this. The reduction in costs on our cost-type contracts results in savings on those programs which we pass along to our customers, but also results in lower sales for the company. Now from a margin perspective, the various cost reductions that impact fixed-price programs on our backlog drive margin improvement, and we saw some of this reflected in our Q3 results.  Space and Airborne Systems sales were up 9% in the quarter, strengthening their classified business and growth on an international tactical radar program were key contributors. Technical Services sales were up 10%, driven by both domestic and foreign training programs. IDS, IIS and NCS were the businesses most affected by the timing of contract awards.
 Now moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered strong operational performance. Continued strong program performance was reflected in our adjusted operating margin, which was up by 60 basis points. All of our businesses delivered solid results during the quarter. Missiles, SAS and TS had significant margin expansion, primarily driven by operational improvements.
 Turning to Page 7. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2010 was $1.36, up 9% and on a year-to-date basis, was up 12%. This improvement speaks directly to our continued focus on productivity and cost-efficiency actions.
 If you now move to Page 8. I'd like to comment on our guidance for the year. Our sales outlook reflects both the timing of awards and the impact of our cost reduction activities. We reduced the high end by $500 million and the low end by $300 million. As we've done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of the update, FAS/CAS pension expense for the year increased by $9 million from $220 million to $229 million. We updated the range of our interest expense to be between $110 million and $115 million, which now reflects the results of our recent debt offering. We also lowered the range of our diluted share count to be between $377 million and $379 million.
 We reduced our effective tax rate to 24.3%, driven by the favorable tax settlement in Q3. As a reminder, we're assuming that the R&D tax credit extension gets passed in 2010 to work it out $0.07 in earnings per share. We increased the high end of our adjusted EPS for the year by $0.10 to reflect the increase in our expected margin for the year. We see adjusted EPS to be between $5.28 and $5.38. You should note that we also increased our 2010 guidance for GAAP EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.55, which includes the $0.75 reduction, the full year EPS from the U.K. Border Agency program termination in the second quarter, the tax related benefit of $0.45 recorded in the third quarter, the estimated $0.13 charge we'll book in the fourth quarter associated with the make whole provision of the early debt retirement and the $0.39 in full year FAS/CAS pension expense.
 Our current operating cash flow outlook for the full year of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion now includes the $750 million discretionary cash contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter. And finally, we increased the low end and narrowed the range of our outlook for ROIC to between 12.3% and 12.6% Overall, our updated outlook for 2010 reflects our ability to drive earnings growth through operational improvements and capital deployment actions.
 Moving on to Page 9, let me give you a little more detail. The two principal drivers for the updated sales and margin guidance are consistent with what I've already said. Compared to our prior guidance, the lower sales that IDS and NCS are the results of the timing of awards, as well as cost reductions, which again are a key driver in the increase in margins. At MS, SAS and TS, we also see an improved margin outlook. Overall, we're pleased with the results of the operational improvements and the margin we've delivered, while at the same time, passing along savings to our customers.
 Now we plan to provide you with the details for our 2011 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call in January. By that time, we'll have more clarity on the FY '11 budget, the continuing resolution and the timing of some of our U.S. and international awards. Now with that said, we do want to provide you with some sense of what we're seeing at this point in time.
 If we have to peg next year today, we're looking at a sales range of 2% to 4% over 2010 and for margins on an adjusted basis, we expect to be in line with this year. And from a cash perspective, we fully expect to continue to deliver strong cash flow as we have in the past. We've also provided an update on how we see FAS/CAS pension expense trending for
 2011.
 So if you would please turn Page 10. We've provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2011. The shaded area on the matrix reflects our range of estimates for the current environment. We are currently at on a year-to-date asset return basis of slightly over 7%, consistent with our return-on-asset assumption of 8.75%. Just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset return won't be known until we close out 2010.  As a reminder, the FAS/CAS adjustment is non cash and non operational. It simply reflects the temporary difference between FAS and CAS pension accounting. The key point is that pension cost is recoverable overtime through our rates.
 Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize our third quarter performance and our outlook. Continued improvement in operational performance during the quarter drove margin expansion, strong growth in earnings per share and good cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to address the opportunities and also the challenges in our industry. We have the right strategy, the right capabilities and the discipline to capital deployment plans to drive growth and attractive total shareholder returns.
 With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Over to you, Marc.

It was driven by a combination of things, primarily program performance, and they are the one segment that was also favorably impacted by mix. In particular, some international sales. It's probably notable that the balance of the businesses from a margin perspective was primarily driven by program performance. Technical Services, again they've been performing strong for quite a while now, that continues. It's essentially their focus on overall efficiency within the group. There was also some relatively small, but it was worth probably 20, 30 basis points, some contract modifications that took place during the quarter. But let me reiterate that overall cost efficiency is what's driving their margins.

We talked a little bit about that a few minutes ago. We saw some of the benefits in Q3. On a year-to-date basis, I hadn't mentioned this earlier, our adjusted operating margins are up 50 basis points. So the timing of how that margin improvement impacts the year is, by and large, behind us. It happened in the first three quarters simply because of when the programs went into play. Now if you go into the fourth quarter, there was a couple of things happening at some level and some of the businesses, mix does work against us a little bit overall. And secondly, we're starting to think, obviously, about next year and starting to put in place programs that will be more beneficial to next year that will be in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind though that we did improve our overall outlook for margins to 12.1% to 12.3%, and that's pretty healthy. So there's nothing, I guess the takeaway is there's nothing remarkable happening in the fourth quarter, a lot of it is just timing.

Once they're firm and in place, we're able to take that benefit, and it was notable in Q3, again, throughout the year, and it's just a timing between where we are now and where we'll be as we exit the year.

And in this tight budget, the way I look at it, it satisfies three customers, Patriot satisfies the minimum 12 around the world, and people will decide what they want to do in that process. I'm highly biased so you know my answer. But I think from our standpoint, Patriot is the most capable air defense system in the world for both air breathers, ballistic missiles, aircraft and crews and there's nothing else like it, and put Patriot up against anything in the world for that matter. So we expect Patriot to be around a long time, and so from that standpoint, there could be an upside depending on what the decision is there. But I'll let people that have to make that choice make it. Regarding Standard Missile, we have a family of Standard Missile, we have IA, IB, IIA, IIBs. The IIA was just increased in funding about 25%. It's the one that's got a very successful flight-test program. And for us, we're a company that competes every place we go, so competition really doesn't frighten us. People didn't think we were going to win Small Diameter Bomb but low and behold, the company did that. Our customers told us we significantly provide them better mission capability, making our technical approach, we won the strength of our tri-mode seeker, our innovative warhead technology and our aircraft integration and our past performance was rated exceptional. So from my standpoint, competition doesn't bother me. We're prepared to go head to head with anybody especially in the missile business.

Bookings during the quarter were $",692," Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone.
 We delivered solid results during the quarter, with sales of $6.3 billion, adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of $413 million. Bookings during the quarter were $6 billion and on a year-to-date basis, our book-to-bill ratio was around one. Our Missile business brought in over $2 billion in orders during the quarter driven by broad-based demand from U.S. and the international customers. At our other businesses, the pipeline remains healthy.
 We continue to see strong demand. We also see  a continuation of the congestion that we discussed on our prior conference calls and webcast that impacted timing of awards. I'd like to put it in perspective. We really don't see the if issue, just when, and in this environment, when is a little more difficult to predict. Given that, the onus is on us to further reduce our cycle times. We have an internal push to increase speed, and we applaud the government's efforts to increase efficiency and reform export control. I think that's good for both sides.
 Within this environment of challenges and opportunities, we continue to execute well. Our strong program performance, coupled with Six Sigma and lean processes to take cost out of our business, is reflected in our results during the quarter. Our updated outlook for the year and our competitive position also reflects this domestically and internationally.
 Our customers in the U.S. are dealing with challenges. What I'm hearing from the DoD [Department of Defense] leadership is that the Department needs to continue to invest in capabilities to defeat threats to national security. At the same time, economic conditions require an increased focus on controlling costs on both sides. We support the DoD's overall objectives to prioritize spending, improve efficiency, reward contractors that deliver strong program performance, and we stand ready to help.
 On the International side, our business is strong and continues to grow. International sales from the third quarter are up 11%, reaching 24% of our total sales. Again, the driver is the threat environment which remains high, particularly in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Our customers in these regions have the resources to support the required investments in their security.  We have a number of additional important international orders in various stages of the procurement and notification process.
 If you stand back and look at world events, the threat environment remains high. It hasn't changed. For all of us, this means that we need to get even better at what we do. Raytheon's well positioned for the future. We have outstanding technology, we have a flexible portfolio, and our consistent focus on providing innovative, affordable and proven solutions will ensure that we remain well positioned.
 To help put that in perspective, we've institutionalized Six Sigma and the philosophy of continuous improvement. We made the tough choices on getting the utilization rates in our factories up. We've invested in common engineering supply chain, financial, IT and HR systems that enable us to design anywhere, manufacturing anywhere and ship from anywhere. And our talent can transfer their knowledge across the company. We have a strong balance sheet for some time now so we have the financial strength to continue to make the right investments in our business and for our shareholders.
 We are a company that is a consistent performer, with a strong and focused portfolio of programs, and our businesses are well managed. It's a portfolio looked on industry-leading technologies, core capabilities and on opportunities to apply both to meet our customers needs in the U.S. and in the world. Our business model enables us to benefit whether our technologies are used to build new systems or to upgrade existing systems. We support our customers in multiple ways.
 In closing, we'll continue to work with our customers to deliver products and services they need for mission success. In that regard, the environment today is exactly what it was yesterday. It's all about innovation, performance, affordability and agility, and we strive to be the very best in each of these areas.
 With that, let me turn it over to Dave.

I have a few opening comments, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slide that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to Page 3. Strong operational performance a",1620," Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening comments, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slide that we issued earlier this morning.
 If everyone would please turn to Page 3. Strong operational performance across the company drove our margin, EPS and operating cash flow results during the quarter. Sales were $6.3 billion, which I'll discuss further in a few moments. Adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, up 60 basis points. Our adjusted EPS of $1.36 was up 9%, primarily the result of operational improvements and capital deployment actions. Third quarter 2010 adjusted EPS excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment and the favorable tax settlement that we received during the quarter related to multiple prior-year's tax filings. We delivered solid operating cash flow from continuing operations of $413 million, driven primarily by the timing of initiatives related to working capital management.
 We continue to improve our working capital efficiency and by way of example, we've increased our operational working capital terms from 10.4 four years ago to 17.2 in 2010, and this translates into about $800 million in cash flow. During the quarter, the company repurchased 9.5 million shares of common stock for $425 million, bringing the year-to-date repurchases to 23.7 million shares for about $1.2 billion. After the close, we executed a number of capital deployment actions taking advantage of the favorable market environment.
 First, the company issued three tranches of long-term debt for $2 billion, 5s, 10s, and 30s with a weighted average coupon of 3.35%.  We used approximately $750 million of the net proceeds to fund the redemption of the existing notes due in 2012 and 2013. The expected close is November 5. In addition, last week, we made the $750 million discretionary cash contribution to our pension plans.
 Turning now to Page 4. Let me provide some more detail on our third quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $6 billion and on a year-to-date basis, were $18.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of about one. Missile Systems was the highlight from a bookings perspective with $2.2 billion of new awards during the quarter, including $545 million for the production of AMRAAM missiles, $451 million for the competitively awarded Small Diameter Bomb II and $237million for SM-3. We also booked significant awards for RAAM missiles, the Javelin program, AIM-9X and EKV in addition to winning the competitively awarded Excalibur 1b program. IDS [Integrated Defense Systems] booked $190 million for a TPY-2 radar for the Missile Defense Agency. IDS also booked $104 million on the Zumwalt-class destroyer program and $103 million for the [indiscernible] weapon systems for the U.S. Navy.  IIS [Intelligence and Information Systems] booked $447 million on a number of classified contracts, and our NCS [Network Centric Systems] business booked $84 million for airborne tactical communications systems for multiple customers.
 SAS [Space and Airborne Systems] booked $265 million on a number of classified contracts. SAS also booked $87 million for their production of AESA radars for the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard. TS booked $306 million on domestic training programs and $121 million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS activities, and we ended the quarter with a $35.7 billion backlog.
 If you'd move to Page 5. Relative to our prior guidance, our third quarter sales were impacted by the timing of awards as well as our cost reduction efforts. Focusing on increasing efficiency and taking costs out of the business is part of Raytheon's culture. We're clearly focused on stepping up our efforts in this area.
 Let me put some color on this. The reduction in costs on our cost-type contracts results in savings on those programs which we pass along to our customers, but also results in lower sales for the company. Now from a margin perspective, the various cost reductions that impact fixed-price programs on our backlog drive margin improvement, and we saw some of this reflected in our Q3 results.  Space and Airborne Systems sales were up 9% in the quarter, strengthening their classified business and growth on an international tactical radar program were key contributors. Technical Services sales were up 10%, driven by both domestic and foreign training programs. IDS, IIS and NCS were the businesses most affected by the timing of contract awards.
 Now moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered strong operational performance. Continued strong program performance was reflected in our adjusted operating margin, which was up by 60 basis points. All of our businesses delivered solid results during the quarter. Missiles, SAS and TS had significant margin expansion, primarily driven by operational improvements.
 Turning to Page 7. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2010 was $1.36, up 9% and on a year-to-date basis, was up 12%. This improvement speaks directly to our continued focus on productivity and cost-efficiency actions.
 If you now move to Page 8. I'd like to comment on our guidance for the year. Our sales outlook reflects both the timing of awards and the impact of our cost reduction activities. We reduced the high end by $500 million and the low end by $300 million. As we've done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of the update, FAS/CAS pension expense for the year increased by $9 million from $220 million to $229 million. We updated the range of our interest expense to be between $110 million and $115 million, which now reflects the results of our recent debt offering. We also lowered the range of our diluted share count to be between $377 million and $379 million.
 We reduced our effective tax rate to 24.3%, driven by the favorable tax settlement in Q3. As a reminder, we're assuming that the R&D tax credit extension gets passed in 2010 to work it out $0.07 in earnings per share. We increased the high end of our adjusted EPS for the year by $0.10 to reflect the increase in our expected margin for the year. We see adjusted EPS to be between $5.28 and $5.38. You should note that we also increased our 2010 guidance for GAAP EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.55, which includes the $0.75 reduction, the full year EPS from the U.K. Border Agency program termination in the second quarter, the tax related benefit of $0.45 recorded in the third quarter, the estimated $0.13 charge we'll book in the fourth quarter associated with the make whole provision of the early debt retirement and the $0.39 in full year FAS/CAS pension expense.
 Our current operating cash flow outlook for the full year of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion now includes the $750 million discretionary cash contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter. And finally, we increased the low end and narrowed the range of our outlook for ROIC to between 12.3% and 12.6% Overall, our updated outlook for 2010 reflects our ability to drive earnings growth through operational improvements and capital deployment actions.
 Moving on to Page 9, let me give you a little more detail. The two principal drivers for the updated sales and margin guidance are consistent with what I've already said. Compared to our prior guidance, the lower sales that IDS and NCS are the results of the timing of awards, as well as cost reductions, which again are a key driver in the increase in margins. At MS, SAS and TS, we also see an improved margin outlook. Overall, we're pleased with the results of the operational improvements and the margin we've delivered, while at the same time, passing along savings to our customers.
 Now we plan to provide you with the details for our 2011 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call in January. By that time, we'll have more clarity on the FY '11 budget, the continuing resolution and the timing of some of our U.S. and international awards. Now with that said, we do want to provide you with some sense of what we're seeing at this point in time.
 If we have to peg next year today, we're looking at a sales range of 2% to 4% over 2010 and for margins on an adjusted basis, we expect to be in line with this year. And from a cash perspective, we fully expect to continue to deliver strong cash flow as we have in the past. We've also provided an update on how we see FAS/CAS pension expense trending for
 2011.
 So if you would please turn Page 10. We've provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2011. The shaded area on the matrix reflects our range of estimates for the current environment. We are currently at on a year-to-date asset return basis of slightly over 7%, consistent with our return-on-asset assumption of 8.75%. Just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset return won't be known until we close out 2010.  As a reminder, the FAS/CAS adjustment is non cash and non operational. It simply reflects the temporary difference between FAS and CAS pension accounting. The key point is that pension cost is recoverable overtime through our rates.
 Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize our third quarter performance and our outlook. Continued improvement in operational performance during the quarter drove margin expansion, strong growth in earnings per share and good cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to address the opportunities and also the challenges in our industry. We have the right strategy, the right capabilities and the discipline to capital deployment plans to drive growth and attractive total shareholder returns.
 With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Over to you, Marc.

One is we passed along a lot of these savings to our customer, that's number one. Number two is you are right, the cost reductions will add to margins over time, because they directly impact our fixed-price backlog programs. But as you know, if you move forward and put new contracts in place, we also pass those savings along to our customers.

It's a lot of the programs we've been talking about, Bill just went through that. From an IIS perspective, they've been impacted primarily by the period costs that will incur as a result of the termination, and that's worth about 20 basis points. Q3 and year-to-date from a missile standpoint, higher than guidance, driven by, again, the timing of the productivity improvements, we're increasing the year by 20 basis points. Again, no particular issue, no particular area, it's just overall cost reductions. NCS, again, SAS continues to perform well, there's nothing unique there. I talked about SAS earlier having a little bit of favorable impact as a result of mix. TS, I mentioned the favorable contract modification earlier being worth about 20 basis points. So I think if you're standing back, you're looking for something unique to say, ""Well, there was one event that impacted margins 30 or 40 basis points on the quarter and it's normalized at 12.5%,"" I think that's frankly the wrong way to look at it. I'll go back to what I said before, it's simply the timing of when we put into our EACs, the impact of these cost-reduction actions. Once they're firm and in place, we're able to take that benefit, and it was notable in Q3, again, throughout the year, and it's just a timing between where we are now and where we'll be as we exit the year.

They'll be going through that. It's a big program, lots of money. And in this tight budget, the way I look at it, it satisfies three customers, Patriot satisfies the minimum 12 around the world, and people will decide what they want to do in that process. I'm highly biased so you know my answer. But I think from our standpoint, Patriot is the most capable air defense system in the world for both air breathers, ballistic missiles, aircraft and crews and there's nothing else like it, and put Patriot up against anything in the world for that matter. So we expect Patriot to be around a long time, and so from that standpoint, there could be an upside depending on what the decision is there. But I'll let people that have to make that choice make it. Regarding Standard Missile, we have a family of Standard Missile, we have IA, IB, IIA, IIBs. The IIA was just increased in funding about 25%. It's the one that's got a very successful flight-test program. And for us, we're a company that competes every place we go, so competition really doesn't frighten us. People didn't think we were going to win Small Diameter Bomb but low and behold, the company did that. Our customers told us we significantly provide them better mission capability, making our technical approach, we won the strength of our tri-mode seeker, our innovative warhead technology and our aircraft integration and our past performance was rated exceptional. So from my standpoint, competition doesn't bother me. We're prepared to go head to head with anybody especially in the missile business. So I realize what MDA has to do, but when we start talking about something in 2020 and 2025, that's a long ways out, and a lot of things can happen between now and then.

105612,114666087,90542,"Raytheon Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Raytheon Company","Executives","Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results during the quarter, with sales of $6.3 billion, adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of $413 million. Bookings during the quarter were $6",692,"Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everyone. 
We delivered solid results during the quarter, with sales of $6.3 billion, adjusted operating margin at 12.9% and adjusted EPS of $1.36 and operating cash flow of $413 million. Bookings during the quarter were $6 billion. And on a year-to-date basis, our book-to-bill ratio was around one. Our Missile business brought in over $2 billion in orders during the quarter driven by broad-based demand from U.S. and international customers. At our other businesses, the pipeline remains healthy. 
We continue to see strong demand. We also see a continuation of the congestion that we discussed on our prior conference calls and webcasts that impacted the timing of awards. I'd like to put it in perspective. We really don't see the if issue, just when. And in this environment, when is a little more difficult to predict. Given that, the onus is on us to further reduce our cycle times. We have an internal push to increase speed, and we applaud the government's efforts to increase efficiency and reform export control. I think that's good for both sides. 
Within this environment of challenges and opportunities, we continue to execute well. Our strong program performance, coupled with Six Sigma and Lean processes to take cost out of our business, is reflected in our results during the quarter. Our updated outlook for the year and our competitive position also reflects this domestically and internationally. 
Our customers in the U.S. are dealing with challenges. What I'm hearing from the DoD [Department of Defense] leadership is that the department needs to continue to invest in capabilities to defeat threats to national security. At the same time, economic conditions require an increased focus on controlling costs on both sides. We support the DoD's overall objectives to prioritize spending, improve efficiency, reward contractors that deliver strong program performance and we stand ready to help. 
On the International side, our business is strong and continues to grow. International sales in the third quarter were up 11%, reaching 24% of our total sales. Again, the driver is the threat environment, which remains high, particularly in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Our customers in these regions have the resources to support the required investments in their security. We have a number of additional important international orders in various stages of the procurement and notification process.
If you stand back and look at world events, the threat environment remains high. It hasn't changed. For all of us, this means that we need to get even better at what we do. Raytheon's well positioned for the future. We have outstanding technology. We have a flexible portfolio. And our consistent focus on providing innovative, affordable and proven solutions will ensure that we remain well positioned.
To help put that in perspective, we've institutionalized Six Sigma and the philosophy of continuous improvement. We made the tough choices on getting the utilization rates in our factories up. We've invested in common engineering supply chain, financial, IT and HR systems that enable us to design anywhere, manufacture anywhere and ship from anywhere. And our talent can transfer their knowledge across the company. We have a strong balance sheet for some time now, so we have the financial strength to continue to make the right investments in our business and for our shareholders.
We are a company that is a consistent performer, with a strong and focused portfolio of programs. And our businesses are well managed. It's a portfolio built on industry-leading technologies, core capabilities and on opportunities to apply both to meet our customers’ needs in the U.S. and in the world. Our business model enables us to benefit whether our technologies are used to build new systems or to upgrade existing systems. We support our customers in multiple ways.
In closing, we'll continue to work with our customers to deliver products and services they need for mission success. In that regard, the environment today is exactly what it was yesterday. It's all about innovation, performance, affordability and agility. And we strive to be the very best in each of these areas.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave."

During my remarks, I'll be referring to the Web slides that we issued earlier this morning. 
If everyone would please turn to Page 3. Strong operational performance across the company drove our margin, EPS and operating cash flow results during the quarter. Sales were $6.3 billion, which I'll discuss further in a few moments. Adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, up 60 basis points. Our adjusted EPS of $1.36 was up 9%, primarily the result of operational improvements and capital deployment actions. Third quarter 2010 adjusted EPS excludes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment and the favorable tax settlement that we received during the quarter related to multiple prior years’ tax filings. We delivered solid operating cash flow from continuing operations of $413 million, driven primarily by the timing of initiatives related to working capital management.
We continue to improve our working capital efficiency. And by way of example, we've increased our operational working capital turns from 10.4 four years ago to 17.2 in 2010, and this translates into about $800 million in cash flow. During the quarter, the company repurchased 9.5 million shares of common stock for $425 million, bringing the year-to-date repurchases to 23.7 million shares for about $1.2 billion. After the close, we executed a number of capital deployment actions taking advantage of the favorable market environment. 
First, the company issued three tranches of long-term debt for $2 billion, 5s, 10s, and 30s with a weighted average coupon of 3.35%. We'll use approximately $750 million of the net proceeds to fund the redemption of the existing notes due in 2012 and 2013. The expected close is November 5. In addition, last week, we made the $750 million discretionary cash contribution to our pension plans.
Turning now to Page 4. Let me provide some more detail on our third quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $6 billion, and on a year-to-date basis, were $18.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of about one. Missile Systems was the highlight from a bookings perspective with $2.2 billion of new awards during the quarter, including $545 million for the production of AMRAAM missiles, $451 million for the competitively awarded Small Diameter Bomb II and $237 million for SM-3. We also booked significant awards for RAM missiles, the Javelin program, AIM-9X and EKV, in addition to winning the competitively awarded Excalibur 1b program. IDS [Integrated Defense Systems] booked $190 million for a TPY-2 radar for the Missile Defense Agency. IDS also booked $104 million on the Zumwalt-class destroyer program and $103 million for the Aegis weapon system for the U.S. Navy. IIS [Intelligence and Information Systems] booked $447 million on a number of classified contracts. And our NCS [Network Centric Systems] business booked $84 million for airborne tactical communications systems for multiple customers.
SAS [Space and Airborne Systems] booked $265 million on a number of classified contracts. SAS also booked $87 million for their production of AESA radars for the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard. TS booked $306 million on domestic training programs and $121 million on foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS activities. And we ended the quarter with a $35.7 billion backlog.
If you'd move to Page 5. Relative to our prior guidance, our third quarter sales were impacted by the timing of awards, as well as our cost reduction efforts. Focusing on increasing efficiency and taking costs out of the business is part of Raytheon's culture. We're clearly focused on stepping up our efforts in this area. 
Let me put some color on this. The reduction in costs on our cost-type contracts results in savings on those programs, which we pass along to our customers, but also results in lower sales for the company. Now from a margin perspective, the various cost reductions that impact fixed-price programs on our backlog drive margin improvement, and we saw some of this reflected in our Q3 results. Space and Airborne Systems sales were up 9% in the quarter. Strength in their classified business and growth on an international tactical radar program were key contributors. Technical Services sales were up 10%, driven by both domestic and foreign training programs. IDS, IIS and NCS were the businesses most affected by the timing of contract awards. 
Now moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered strong operational performance. Continued strong program performance was reflected in our adjusted operating margin, which was up by 60 basis points. All of our businesses delivered solid results during the quarter. Missiles, SAS and TS had significant margin expansion, primarily driven by operational improvements. 
Turning to Page 7. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2010 was $1.36, up 9%, and on a year-to-date basis was up 12%. This improvement speaks directly to our continued focus on productivity and cost-efficiency actions.
If you’d now move to Page 8. I'd like to comment on our guidance for the year. Our sales outlook reflects both the timing of awards and the impact of our cost reduction activities. We reduced the high end by $500 million and the low end by $300 million. As we've done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of the update, FAS/CAS pension expense for the year increased by $9 million from $220 million to $229 million. We updated the range of our interest expense to be between $110 million and $115 million, which now reflects the results of our recent debt offering. We also lowered the range of our diluted share count to be between $377 million and $379 million. 
We reduced our effective tax rate to 24.3%, driven by the favorable tax settlement in Q3. As a reminder, we're assuming that the R&D tax credit extension gets passed in 2010. It's worth about $0.07 in earnings per share. We increased the high end of our adjusted EPS for the year by $0.10 to reflect the increase in our expected margin for the year. We see adjusted EPS to be between $5.28 and $5.38. You should note that we also increased our 2010 guidance for GAAP EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.55, which includes the $0.75 reduction, the full year EPS from the U.K. Border Agency program termination in the second quarter, the tax-related benefit of $0.45 recorded in the third quarter, the estimated $0.13 charge we'll book in the fourth quarter associated with the make whole provision of the early debt retirement, and the $0.39 in full year FAS/CAS pension expense.
Our current operating cash flow outlook for the full year of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion now includes the $750 million discretionary cash contribution we made to our pension plans in the fourth quarter. And finally, we increased the low end and narrowed the range of our outlook for ROIC to between 12.3% and 12.6% Overall, our updated outlook for 2010 reflects our ability to drive earnings growth through operational improvement and capital deployment actions.
Moving on to Page 9, let me give you a little more detail. The two principal drivers for the updated sales and margin guidance are consistent with what I've already said. Compared to our prior guidance, the lower sales at IDS and NCS are the results of the timing of awards, as well as cost reductions, which again are a key driver in the increase in margins. At MS, SAS and TS, we also see an improved margin outlook. Overall, we're pleased with the results of the operational improvement and the margin we've delivered, while at the same time, passing along savings to our customers.
Now we plan to provide you with the details for our 2011 outlook on our fourth quarter conference call in January. By that time, we'll have more clarity on the FY '11 budget, the continuing resolution and the timing of some of our U.S. and international awards. Now with that said, we do want to provide you with some sense of what we're seeing at this point in time.
If we had to peg next year today, we're looking at a sales range of 2% to 4% over 2010 and for margins on an adjusted basis we expect to be in line with this year. And from a cash perspective, we fully expect to continue to deliver strong cash flow as we have in the past. We've also provided an update on how we see FAS/CAS pension expense trending for 2011. 
So if you would please turn Page 10. We've provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2011. The shaded area on the matrix reflects our range of estimates for the current environment. We are currently at on a year-to-date asset return basis of slightly over 7%, consistent with our return-on-asset assumption of 8.75%. Just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset return won't be known until we close out 2010. As a reminder, the FAS/CAS adjustment is non-cash and non-operational. It simply reflects the temporary difference between FAS and CAS pension accounting. The key point is that pension cost is recoverable over time through our rates.
Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize our third quarter performance and our outlook. Continued improvement in operational performance during the quarter drove margin expansion, strong growth in earnings per share and good cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to address the opportunities and also the challenges in our industry. We have the right strategy, the right capabilities and the discipline to capital deployment plans to drive growth and attractive total shareholder returns. 
With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Over to you, Marc."

Now if you go into the fourth quarter, there was a couple of things happening at some level and some of the businesses mix does work against us a little bit, overall. And secondly, we're starting to think, obviously, about next year and starting to put in place programs that will be more beneficial to next year that will be in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind though that we did improve our overall outlook for margins to 12.1% to 12.3%. And that's pretty healthy.

And then taking it one more step, I think this is important from a book-to-bill standpoint we expect to exceed one both domestically and internationally as we close out the year."

Margins are improved substantially this year as we close out 2010 relative to the what we had expected when we started out 2010. Now what's important is that the cost-reduction programs are basically serving two purposes. And I talked about that a little bit a moment ago, so let me repeat it. It's important. One is that we pass along a lot of these savings to our customer, that's number one. Number two is you are right, the cost reductions will add to margins over time because they directly impact our fixed-price backlog programs. But as you know, if you move forward and put new contracts in place we also pass those savings along to our customers. With all that said, it's early. 12.1% to 12.3% is healthy starting point. And we're, at this stage, comfortable with that range of guidance."

So if you look at IDS, we've increased guidance 20 basis points to reflect improved performance and cost reductions. Again, nothing unique. It's a lot of the programs we've been talking about. Bill just went through that. From an IIS perspective, they've been impacted primarily by the period costs that we'll incur as a result of the termination. And that's worth about 20 basis points. Q3 and year-to-date from a missile standpoint, higher than guidance, driven by, again, the timing of the productivity improvements. We're increasing the year by 20 basis points. Again, no particular issue. No particular area. It's just overall cost reductions. NCS, again, SAS continues to perform well. There’s nothing unique there. I talked about SAS earlier having a little bit of favorable impact as a result of mix. TS, I mentioned the favorable contract modification earlier being worth about 20 basis points. So I think if you're standing back and you're looking for something unique to say, ""Well, there was one event that impacted margins 30 or 40 basis points on the quarter and it's more normalized at 12½%,"" I think that's frankly the wrong way to look at it. I'll go back to what I said before. It's simply the timing of when we put into our EACs the impact of these cost-reduction actions. Once they're firm and in place we're able to take that benefit.

And so when we look at the timing on the international we want the things that we've got in our forecast to happen. And as Dave pointed out in his remarks, it's where we stand today. We need to see what's going to happen on the fiscal year '11 budget. The continuing resolution. My gut still says that we're going to operate on that into next year. And so those things have a real effect on your domestic growth and then right on top of that we're going to be looking at fiscal year '12. So we tried to give you a peg at where we think it is and the timing that we see on things. But at this point in time, the end of October, there's a lot in flux. More so than I can remember in the past. But we still felt confident giving you the numbers we did."

Next year we'd be looking at a gross funding of about $1 billion. And on a net basis about $300 million. And as we go forward, if you're interested in the FAS/CAS accounting difference we expect '11, again under those same assumptions, to be between $450 million and $500 million for '11. '12 would be say, between $200 million to $250 million. Now importantly and I'm glad you asked this. If the interest rate environment were to adjust and the discount rate say, move to 6.25%, the FAS/CAS differences would improve from a P&L standpoint by about $200 million. Favorable."

The other one is a Trusted Computer systems (sic) [Solutions]. We expect to close that next month. They really provide cyber security solutions to our customers. Clearly, what they do is provide domain solutions that allow classified levels to be shared on the same network around computer operating systems. And it gives me an opportunity to highlight one of our teams, the Distributed Common Ground System, DCGS. You've heard me talk about it in the past. But we just completed with the Air Force the successful evaluation of DCGS at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany. What DCGS does is it supports multiple ISR platforms, satellites, manned, unmanned systems. To me, I refer to it in the company and outside the company, it's like Google with a clearance. No offense to Google, but DCGS allows you to move data around. And what's important to it for us, as we look to the future, worldwide intelligence is going to even take on a bigger role, if you think about it. And how do you look at that information across the globe and sort it out and share at multiple classified areas. And that's what we're lining ourselves up to be able to do."

They'll be going through that. It's a big program. Lots of money. And in this tight budget, the way I look at it, MIADS [ph] satisfies three customers. Patriot satisfies the minimum 12 around the world. And people will decide what they want to do in that process. I'm highly biased. So you know my answer. But I think from our standpoint, Patriot is the most capable air defense system in the world for both air breathers, ballistic missiles, aircraft and crews. And there's nothing else like it. Put Patriot up against anything in the world, for that matter. So we expect Patriot to be around a long time. And so from that standpoint there could be an upside depending on what the decision is there. But I'll let the people that have to make that choice make it. Regarding Standard Missile, we have a family of Standard Missiles. We have IA, IB, IIA, IIBs. The IIA was just increased in funding about 25%. It's the one that's got a very successful flight-test program. And for us, we're a company that competes every place we go. So competition really doesn't frighten us. People didn't think we were going to win Small Diameter Bomb. But lo and behold, the company did that. Our customers told us we significantly provide them better mission capability. Making our technical approach, we won the strength of our tri-mode seeker, our innovative warhead technology. And our aircraft integration and our past performance was rated exceptional. So from my standpoint, competition doesn't bother me. We're prepared to go head to head with anybody, especially in the missile business. So I realize what MDA has to do, but when we start talking about something in 2020 and 2025, that's a long ways out. And a lot of things can happen between now and then."
