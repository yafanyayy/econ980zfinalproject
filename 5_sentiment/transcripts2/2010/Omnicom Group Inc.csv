Overall, fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations. Results in the quarter improved when compared to the previous three quarters, but still reflect the reductions in annual advertising and marketing spending initiated by clients in the first and second quarters of last year. As economies improve, we believe the worst of the recession and its impact is behind us. While not all of our clients have finalized their budgets for 2010, we anticipate that many clients will at least modestly increase spending in the second half of this year.Turning to our performance and what we expect, we've always placed a premium on strong operating management and we've held our agency leaders to very high standards. At an operating level, we've challenged our agency leaders to capitally manage costs and to adjust their offerings to better meet the needs of their clients. Across the business, our agencies have effectively managed their cost structures over the past year. While continued cost control is going to be required, we feel good about our individual agency's ability now to focus on growing their businesses over the next 12 months.In 2009, we also did an excellent job in strengthening and improving our balance sheet and capital structure. Together with capital management, we're now in a very strong position to deploy our capital and grow our business via investing in talent, investing in startups and acquisitions and utilization of our free cash flow. Over the past 12 months, we continue to heavily invest in management training and development as we believe that strong managers and leaders are key strategic advantage on our business. In 2010, we'll make additional investments by expanding many of our programs including Omnicom University to emerging markets.  In the digital space, as many of you know, we have a dual strategy of building strong capabilities inside our existing agencies and adding new specialty skill sets.  First, we believe that a clear path for success in the future will be to continue to integrate these skills around our traditional businesses and make them adapt as quickly as possible to the changing media environment. Second, we plan to expand our portfolio of specialized digital properties and we should be making some targeted acquisitions and funding a few startups as we get into the beginning of the year.Also in 2009, as I said, we enhanced our capital structure and we reduced the debt on our balance sheet. Going forward, we expect to invest our free cash flow differently this year back to acquisitions, an increase in dividends and the resumption of our share buyback program. As you know, we've always followed a very disciplined acquisition strategy. Our focus is to target companies that fill specific strategic needs and in 2010, we expect to be more aggressive than we've been in the last 12 months. I specially focus on the extension of our geographic portfolio as we look at opportunities around the world.You might note in the fourth quarter, we acquired control of a long-standing affiliate partner in the Middle East, ImpactBBDO. Impact has 13 offices in seven countries and should enhance our offering in that region. Finally, as been widely reported, the company ended its relationship with Chrysler. But excluding Chrysler, net new business for the quarter exceeded $900 million. So our companies are performing well when given the opportunity to win new business.And before I turn it back to Randy, I just want to mention that given the severity of this recession, I'm very proud of our managers and employees in what they were able to accomplish in 2009. And I think at this point, we're poised as the market improves to grow our businesses again. With that, I'll turn it back to Randy."
96161,91124985,49287,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-10-2010",2010-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. In summary, the fourth quarter was a solid finish to what I think can safely be called the toughest economic period in our firm's history.

In summary, the fourth quarter was a solid finish to what I think can safely be called the toughest economic period in our firm's history. On the whole, our agency management teams on both the client side and the operations side did an outstanding job in guiding their individual agencies through the difficulties they faced this past year. They were successful at delivering the highest quality services to their clients and at the same time, managing their cost structures in a way that delivered solid results to shareholders.While the economic challenges are certainly not completely behind us, and the results of our businesses vary widely by business type and geography. Over the last two quarters, we've begun to see some optimistic signs of recovery in certain places and more widespread areas of stability. While the results overall for the quarter were ahead of our expectations, as I mentioned, the results vary widely by type of business and geography. By geography, they're basically three spades [ph]. In the U.S., business continues to stabilize with some signs of recovery in a few industry sectors. In Europe, we saw business take a further step down in the third quarter and that general trend continued into the fourth quarter. And lastly, excluding Japan, Asia, and most of the emerging markets, China, India, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, all showed year-over-year growth. By business type, our Recruitment Marketing and Events businesses continue to have a difficult time and from an industry perspective, the Auto category remained very difficult. These isolated areas weighed down what were otherwise relatively good overall performances in brand advertising and marketing services.Now going to the P&L. As I mentioned, our revenue performance overall was ahead of our expectation and showed sequential improvement from Q3. However, measured year-over-year, revenue declined 3.1% to $3.27 billion. Operating income decreased 10.9% to $399.6 million and our operating margin for the quarter was 12.2%, which was in line with our expectations. And our EBITDA margin was 14.3%, which was down about 75 basis points from last year and a little bit ahead of expectations.Year-to-date, our EBITDA and EBIT margins were down approximately 60 and 90 basis points respectively , which we feel is an exceptional performance on the part of our agency management teams especially given the rapid change in the economic environment that we all experienced from the end of 2008 to the first half of 2009. I also want to point out that we did in the fourth quarter take a pretax charge of $33.2 million in connection with the loss of our Chrysler business. That charge consisted primarily of lease costs, the write-off of leasehold improvements and some severance. In addition, in the quarter, we had a net pretax gain from several transactions that in the aggregate totaled about $32.4 million.Net interest expense for the quarter was $28.6 million, which was up about $4.7 million from last year and down about $300,000 from last quarter. The increase versus Q4 of 2008 was the result of our issuance of the $500 million 10-year senior note last July, as well as a decrease in interest earned on our foreign balances primarily due to rates, offset by lower borrowings and lower interest rates on our revolver and commercial paper facilities in 2009. Versus the third quarter of 2009, the decrease was primarily due to reduced borrowings on our short-term facilities. On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was just about flat versus last year at 33.6%, bringing the year-to-date tax rate to 34%, which was up from 33.6% last year. The aggregate result was net income for the quarter declining 15.3% to $229.6 million. For the year, net income declined 20.7% to $793 million. And diluted earnings per share in the quarter declined about 16% to $0.73, bringing the year-to-date total to $2.53. For the quarter, we had average outstanding diluted shares of about 313 million, and we finished the year with outstanding diluted shares of 314 million. That's a good number going into 2010. We have again in the first quarter of this year, started to repurchase our shares and would expect to utilize our excess cash after dividends and acquisitions to continue to repurchase shares throughout the year.Analyzing our revenue performance. On a year-over-year basis, the U.S. dollar weakened against most other currencies. As a result, FX had a year-over-year effect of increasing our revenue for the quarter by $130.5 million or about 3.9%. For the year, even after the positive move in the quarter, FX remained negative 3.4% or $454 million. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are, we expect FX will be positive between 3% and 4% in Q1 and flat to marginally down for the full year. Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions was negative $25.1 million in the quarter or about seven-tenths of 1%. That was driven primarily by the divestiture of our Directory Advertising business earlier in the year. Our organic growth was stronger than expected for the quarter, declining only 6.3% or $211 million. While all of our businesses have been negatively impacted by the recession, a few areas that we've highlighted in the last two quarters continue to be worth noting. First, the auto sector, which last year was our largest sector was down about 25% organically or about $86 million. The auto sector alone accounted for about 40% of our organic revenue decline in the quarter. Events and Sports Marketing area also continue to struggle on the quarter, down almost 27% organically. And our Recruitment Marketing businesses was down almost 70% in the quarter and about 50% for the full year. This business has been negatively affected by both the economic environment and the shift to the Internet. These three areas together while accounting for only about 16% of our global Q4 revenue last year and 12.4% of our global Q4 revenue this year, they accounted for almost 70% of our organic revenue decline.As for mix of business, Brand Advertising accounted for 45% of our revenue and Marketing Services, 55%. As for their respective organic growth rates, Brand Advertising in the quarter was down 4.8% and Marketing Services declined 7.4%. Breaking down Marketing Services revenue a little further, CRM had negative organic growth of 7.3%. However, similar to Q2 and Q3, the CRM performance was significantly impacted by our Event and Sports Marketing business. Excluding those results, organic growth for CRM was down only 4.4%. Public relations was down 9.3% and specialty communications had organic revenue decline of 5.8%. Two of the larger areas in the Specialty Communications category are Recruitment Marketing and Healthcare. Recruitment Marketing as I mentioned was down about 70% in the quarter and about 50% for the full year. Fortunately, our Healthcare businesses have performed very well, and as a result of strong new business efforts, organic revenue was marginally positive in Q4 and down only about 1% for the full year.Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 50% U.S. and 50% international. In the U.S., revenue declined $129 million or 7.3%. Acquisitions net of dispositions reduced revenue by $22.6 million or 1.3% and organic growth was a negative 6% or about $106 million. As was the case through the first three quarters, our organic revenue performance was somewhat skewed by our performance in three sectors. Auto, events and recruitment. For the U.S. in Q4, these sectors contributed only 13.9% of our total revenue and accounted for 100% of organic revenue decline. Or said another way, the other 86% of our U.S. business combined had flat organic growth in the fourth quarter. International revenue increased $23.7 million or about 1.5%. FX added $130.5 million or 8.1%. Acquisitions net of dispositions reduced revenue by $2.5 million and organic growth was a negative 6.4% or $104 million. Internationally, we had relatively strong performances in the U.K., India, China, Singapore, Australia, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Canada. In developed Asia, Korea showed positive signs of growth for the first time in several quarters while Japan continue to be negative. And with the exception of the United Kingdom, most markets across Eastern and Western Europe performed below average.Looking at revenue by industry, the auto sector represented 11% of our revenue in 2009 as compared to 14% in 2008. This reflect an overall organic decline for the sector of about 25% for the year. Healthcare and consumer product sectors due to the relatively strong performances during the year, both increased their share of our revenue while the other sectors remain relatively constant.Moving on to cash flow, operating cash flow for the quarter and year-to-date was very strong. And our overall working capital performance has continued to be very good. Our primary sources of cash, net income, stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization totaled $1.1 billion for the year. And our primary uses of cash were dividends, which totaled $187 million. Capital expenditures, which totaled $131 million this year versus $212 million last year, acquisitions including earn out payments totaled approximately $137 million this year versus $362 million last year and share repurchases were only $15 million this year versus $847 million last year.  As a result of the above, over the course of 2009, excluding working capital changes, we reduced our overall leverage by about $650 million.As the current credit picture chart shows including changes in working capital, our year end net debt position improved by about $1.3 billion down to $663 million. As a result of the reduction in our outstanding debt balances, our leverage ratio or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 1.4x as of December 31. And despite the decline in EBITDA for the year, our interest coverage ratio remained exceptionally strong at 13.2x. I should also point out that in December, we terminated a partnership we have created earlier in the year to purchase our 2031 convertible notes and those bonds will permanently retire. And finally from a liquidity perspective, we finished the year in a strong position with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling about $4.1 billion and we had additional uncommitted facilities available totaling $363 million. And with that, I'm going to now open up the call for questions."

We are very happy to announce positive year-over-year growth for the first quarter. Overall revenue increased 6.3% to $2.92 billion. This includes organic revenue growth of 2.1%, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. 
As we discussed in our last call, the general business environment continues to stabilize and improve. And as we look across, as we look at individual countries and regions, we are cautiously optimistic about continued global recovery, although we expect significant variation by region.
Turning to our performance, revenue growth was driven by a number of factors, including cycling on some easier year-over-year comps for some of our businesses. First, we are starting to see a rebound in some of the hardest hit areas from the downturn. Areas such as CRM and PR showed fairly strong organic growth as did our media business. Recruiting continues to be one area of note that has not yet rebounded and Randy will take you some of the specifics in a few minutes when he gets back on the call.
Geographically, we saw a continued strong growth in developing markets, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and South America. We are also pleasantly surprised by the US growth where organic growth was 5.1% in the quarter. This leaves Europe where performance remains weak and the outlook is still somewhat unclear.
On the cost front, we continued to keep a close eye on costs and have asked our agencies to remain mindful of the potential risk to the economy, especially in some of our European markets where it’s expensive to adjust staffing levels. Our other real estate and operating costs will take a little longer to fully absorb but barring any downturns in the economy, we expect some of these pressures begin to ease as we get in the second half of the year.
At the same time, our agencies are now increasingly focused on taking advantage of growth opportunities, both through new business efforts as well as growing our existing client accounts. Many of our agencies have adjusted their offerings to respond to the difficult environment, economic environment, and are now more and more flexible and better able to serve the diverse needs of their clients.
Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the year, last year, we said that in 2010, we intended to use our strong balance sheet to increase our dividend, buyback stocks, and make strategic acquisitions. And as you all know, we increased our dividend by 33% in February and also completed $250 million in stock buybacks during the quarter. 
Finally, our business is built on the strength of our management teams and the talented professionals around the world. They have worked extremely hard to help us navigate through last year and I am confident that we are positioned well for the coming year and beyond.
I will now turn this back to Randy, and then we will take your questions afterwards.

The short summary is the first quarter was a very positive start to the New Year. And while results varied somewhat by business type and geography, which I will cover in a more detail later, on the whole our businesses experienced solid seque",1200,"Thanks John. The short summary is the first quarter was a very positive start to the New Year. And while results varied somewhat by business type and geography, which I will cover in a more detail later, on the whole our businesses experienced solid sequential improvement from the fourth quarter and performed ahead of our expectation.
Versus the first quarter of 2009, the year-over-year revenue increased 6.3% to $2.92 billion. Operating income increased 3% to $291 million. That resulted in an operating income or EBIT margin of about 10%, down 30 basis points versus last year, and an EBITDA margin of 12.1%, down about 20 basis points from last year, which was a little bit ahead of the negative 30 basis points that we had expected.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $24.1 million. That was up $2.7 million from last year and down about $4.5 million from Q4. The increase versus Q1 2009 was a result of our issuance of $500 million of ten year senior notes last July, which in effect traded lower cost floating rate debt or higher cost longer-term fixed rate debt. That increase was offset in part by lower borrowing levels as we delevered the balance sheet over the course of last year.
Versus the fourth quarter, the decrease was primarily due to reduced borrowing levels. On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was about 34%, which was basically unchanged from Q1 of last year. Net income from the quarter declined seven-tenths of 1% to a $163.4 million and diluted earnings per share in the quarter declined $0.01 or 1.9% to $0.52 per share. The diluted share count for the quarter was about 311 million shares.
Analyzing our revenue performance, while in the current FX, while in the current period, the US dollar strengthened versus most major currencies. On a year-over-year basis, the dollar was weaker, resulting in a positive FX impact for the quarter of a $117 million or about 4.3%. Assuming FX rates remain at their current levels, FX should continue to have a positive impact of around 1% in Q2, and then turn negative about 1% in Q3, and then a negative 2.5% in Q4. Overall for the year, at current rates, FX will be about flat for the year.
Revenue growth from acquisitions net of dispositions, reduced revenue by $3.8 million in the quarter or about one-tenth of 1%, was largely due to the divestiture of our directory advertising business in Q2 of last year, partially offset by the acquisition of a majority stake and impact BBDO in the Middle East at the end of Q4.
Organic growth; with the backdrop of easier of year-over-year comparisons and continuing sequential improvement in revenue growth, organic revenue increased $60.2 million or about 2.1% in the quarter. A few areas worthy of note, our recruitment and marketing business, while stabilizing quarter-to-quarter has not yet cycled on easier comparisons and as a result was again down over 30% for the quarter when measured year-on-year.
Our events in sports marketing business did turn the quarter with significant increased activity in both the financial services and technology sectors, as well as activity around the Winter Olympics. And so while these businesses didn’t fully cycle on last year’s revenue drop, they still turned in 20% plus positive organic growth in the quarter.
Our media businesses also had a very strong quarter. While it was one of our better areas last year, it turned in at an even better performance this year, driven in part by a few specific clients and a few projects. And field marketing was also quite strong with high single-digit organic growth overall and very strong growth in China.
By industry, auto remained the toughest sector, while improving quarter-on-quarter this sector doesn’t cycle on last year’s significant changes until the second quarter. All other significant industry segments were positive for the quarter, which is a good sign.
Revenue mix; as far mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 44% of our revenue and marketing services 56%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising increased 5.6% in the quarter with a slight decrease in organic revenue of 0.3% or about $3 million. 
Marketing services increased 6.9% in total with organic growth of 4.2% or about $63 million. Within marketing services, CRM was up 8.6% with organic growth of 4.3%. Within the sector of couple businesses they had a better than expected quarter particularly our events and sports marketing business which I mentioned were up over 20%.
As John mentioned, public relations was up 5.9% in the quarter with organic growth of 2.4% and specialty communications was up 1.2% with organic growth of a positive 5.4%. Remember this area was affected by the sale of our directory business last year. Within this sector, healthcare is the largest area. They continued to have a solid performance and the other large area in the sector is recruitment and marketing which I mentioned doesn’t cycle on easier comps until later in the year.
Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 54.5% US and 45.5% international. In the United States, revenue increased $60.5 million or about 3.9%, dispositions net of acquisitions reduced revenue by $17 million or 1.2%, and organic growth was very strong at 5.1%, adding about $78 million to revenue. 
International revenue increased $113 million or 9.3%, FX added a $117 million or 9.6%, acquisitions were $13.5 million, adding about 1.1%, and organic growth was negative 1.4%. Internationally, we had relatively strong performances in India, China, Singapore, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa. In developed Asia, Korea showed positive growth for the second consecutive quarter and Japan turned in positive growth for the first time in several quarters.
Results in Eastern and Western Europe were mixed with flat performance in the UK, France and Italy, strong positive results in Russia, and then below average results in Germany, Spain, Portugal and Finland.
Moving to cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter excluding working capital remained very strong and our working capital performance continued to be very good. As everyone knows, our primary sources of cash are net income, plus stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, those items totaled $245 million for the quarter, and then our primary uses of cash were dividends which totaled $47 million, capital expenditure which totaled $25 million, acquisitions including earn-out payments totaled $19.6 million, and as John mentioned, we resumed our share repurchase efforts, repurchase totaling about $250 million in the quarter.
Our current credit picture, as this chart shows including changes in working capital, on a year-over-year, net debt position improved by a $1 billion to $1.3 billion. And as a result of the reduction in our outstanding debt balances, our leverage ratio or total debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 1.4 times. And our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 13 times.
And finally from the liquidity perspective, we finished the quarter in a strong position with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling about $3.4 billion and then we had additional uncommitted facilities available totaling about $380 million. 
And with that, I am going to open the call for questions. Thank you.

So it is an interesting time right now when we have a pretty wide variance of performance. We have obviously very positive organic growth, especially in many areas across the United States and we have you know mixed results across Europe. So it is a tricky time to balance our staffing levels. And so we are seeing some of that going through the P&L right now.

Obviously, we report the numbers in the aggregate, because we have them up and we report them in the way people want to hear them. 
Right now, the - some of the bigger initiatives were in the CRM areas and we certainly saw some significant improvements in part, because there were significant declines last year in areas like events and sports marketing. So we saw some pretty significant rebounds in those areas.
PR was another area that that had a very strong quarter. I think these things will certainly balance out in a - in over the course of this year. We will see less and less variance and more consistent performance across the - across the different disciplines I think as we go. 
We will probably also see more consistent performance across regions as we go. I think right now we are at that strange sort of inflection point where we are getting or continuing to get some fairly wide differences in performance.

As far as Germany goes - parts of Europe, we actually saw a step down in the last year in the third quarter. I think sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter I would say it stabilized, we didn’t see a real quarter-on-quarter change. But we are measuring all these numbers really year-over-year and we saw in parts of Europe that step change didn’t - the bigger step change didn’t really happen until the second half of last year. So it was almost a - the United States in many of these markets, it was a big step that really occurred between the fourth quarter of ’08 and say the first quarter of ’09. 
In Europe, there was one step sort of in the first half of ’09 and then a second step in the second half of ’09. In that second half, the US was stable. So now when we are measuring year-on-year, we are getting a little bit - a little bit different results. But sequentially, I think Europe is right now pretty stable.

We went through some wrenching changes last year, and where there was a lot of cost containment that contributed to our performance in terms of the what we were able to accomplish last year, but we had to reengineer quite a number of those agencies as well. 
And typically and typically when you get into a recovery, what occurs on your larger advertising annuity type annual fee clients is the clients who will come back and there will be a request, which has occurred in the past, where you will reduce the fee and you will reduce the scope of work, so therefore, you will reengineer your staffing levels. 
When you get into the recovery period, what occurs is clients will be spend some more, spend more money, you will have to become more productive during that when in the beginning of a recovery and till the client is comfortable that the recovery is fully in place, before they will generally increase your fee again, so it becomes - we are in that period right now. 
Having said that, on projects in some other areas, we saw a rebound in spending which is positive and having been through two serious recessions, while in leadership of the company, there is some pretty normal patterns which we are developing, so we are cautiously optimistic.

Other than auto, all of our major industry sectors were positive, some, some very marginally positive, but all positive. So that was a good sign of broad recovery. 
We saw more increased in projects. Some of that may have been a little bit of pumped up demand, some of them are trying to get done earlier in the year and some of that will probably move into normal scope changes in fee renegotiations or fee changes in contracts as we go. 
So I wouldn’t expect the pace of change to continue from the pace from Q4 to Q1, it won’t continue necessarily from Q1 to Q2. So I think we probably we got a faster recovery. I think we will probably have about the same overall recovery as we were expecting. But it’s nice that it happened sooner. 
We also had a little bit of benefit that the transition work at Chrysler lasted a little bit longer than we anticipated. So all - we had a bunch of relatively small but they add up to it a nice addition, positive results in the first quarter, which obviously we are all very happy about.

We're very happy to announce positive year-over-year growth through the first quarter. Overall revenue increased 6.3% to $2.92 billion. This includes organic revenue growth of 2.1%, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. 
As we discussed in our last call, the general business environment continues to stabilize and improve. And as we look across, as we look at individual countries and regions, we're cautiously optimistic about continued global recovery, although we expect significant variation by region.
Turning to our performance, revenue growth was driven by a number of factors including cycling on some easier year-over-year comps for some of our businesses. First, we're starting to see a rebound in some of the hardest hit areas from the downturn, areas such as CRM and PR showed fairly strong organic growth as did our Media business. Recruiting continues to be one area of note that has not yet rebounded, and Randy will take you some of the specifics in a few minutes when he gets back on the call. 
Geographically, we saw a continued strong growth in developing markets: the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. We are also pleasantly surprised by the U.S. growth where organic growth was 5.1% in the quarter. This leaves Europe where our performance remains weak and the outlook is still somewhat unclear. 
On the cost run, we continue to keep a close eye on costs and we've asked our agencies to remain mindful of the potential risks to the economy, especially in some of our European markets where it's expensive to adjust staffing levels. 
Our other real estate and operating costs will take a little longer to fully absorb, but barring any downturns in the economy, we expect some of these pressures to begin to ease as we get into the second half of the year.
At the same time, our agencies are now increasingly focused on taking advantage of growth opportunities, both through new business efforts as well as growing our existing client accounts. Many of our agencies have adjusted their offerings to respond to the difficult economic environment and are now both more flexible and better able to serve the diverse needs of their clients. 
Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the year last year, we said that in 2010, we intended to use our strong balance sheet to increase our dividend, buy back stocks and make strategic acquisitions. And as you all know, we increased our dividend by 33% in February and also completed $250 million in stock buybacks during the quarter. 
Finally, our business is built on the strength of our management teams and the talented professionals around the world. They worked extremely hard to help us navigate through last year, and I'm confident that we are positioned well for the coming year and beyond. I'll now turn this back to Randy, and then we will take your questions afterwards."
96161,100781983,56656,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John.

And while results varied somewhat by business type and geography, which I'll cover in more detail later, on the whole, our business experienced solid sequential im",1181,"Thanks, John. The short summary is the first quarter was a very positive start to the year. And while results varied somewhat by business type and geography, which I'll cover in more detail later, on the whole, our business experienced solid sequential improvement from the fourth quarter and performed ahead of our expectations. 
Versus the first quarter of 2009, year-over-year revenue increased 6.3% to $2.92 billion. Our operating income increased 3% to $291 million. That resulted in an operating income or EBIT margin of about 10% down 30 basis points versus last year, and an EBITDA margin of 12.1%, down about 20 basis points from last year, which was a little bit ahead of the negative 30 basis points that we had expected. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $24.1 million. That was up $2.7 million from last year and down about $4.5 million from Q4. The increase versus Q1 2009 was the result of our issuance of $500 million of 10 year senior notes last July, which in effect traded lower cost floating rate debt for higher cost, longer-term, fixed rate debt. That increase was offset, in part, by lower borrowing levels as we de-lever the balance sheet over the course of last year. 
Versus the fourth quarter, the decrease was primarily due to reduced borrowing levels. On a tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was about 34%, which was basically unchanged from Q1 of last year. Net income from the quarter declined 0.7% to $163.4 million and diluted earnings per share in the quarter declined $0.01 or 1.9% to $0.52 per share. The diluted share count for the quarter was about 311 million shares. 
Analyzing our revenue performance, while in the current period, the U.S. dollar strengthened versus most major currencies. On a year-over-year basis, the dollar was weaker, resulting in a positive FX impact for the quarter of $117 million or about 4.3%. Assuming FX rates remain at their current levels, FX should continue to have a positive impact of around 1% in Q2 and then turn negative, about 1% in Q3, and then a negative 2.5% in Q4. Overall for the year at current rates, FX will be about flat for the year.
Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by $3.8 million in the quarter or about 0.10%. It was largely due to the divestiture of our Directory Advertising business in Q2 of last year, partially offset by the acquisition of a majority stake in ImpactBBDO in the Middle East at the end of Q4. 
Organic growth. With the backdrop of easier year-over-year comparisons and continuing sequential improvement in revenue growth, organic revenue increased $60.2 million or about 2.1% in the quarter. A few areas worthy of note. Our Recruitment Marketing business, while stabilizing quarter-to-quarter, has not yet cycled on easier comparisons. And as a result, was again down over 30% for the quarter when measured year-on-year. 
Our Events and Sports Marketing businesses did turn the corner with significant increased activity in both financial services and technology sectors, as well as activity around the Winter Olympics. And so while these businesses didn’t fully cycle on last year's revenue drop, they still turned in 20 plus percent positive organic growth in the quarter. 
Our Media businesses also had a very strong quarter. While it is one of our better performing areas last year, it turned in an even better performance this quarter driven in part by a few specific clients and a few projects. And field marketing was also quite strong with high single-digit organic growth overall and very strong growth in China.
By industry, Auto remained the toughest sector. While improving quarter-on-quarter, this sector doesn't cycle on last year's significant changes until the second quarter. All other significant industry segments were positive for the quarter, which is a good sign.
Revenue mix. As for our mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 44% of our revenue and marketing services, 56%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising increased 5.6% in the quarter, with a slight decrease in organic revenue of 0.3% or about $3 million. 
Marketing services increased 6.9% in total with organic growth of 4.2% or about $63 million. Within marketing services, CRM was up 8.6% with organic growth of 4.3%. Within the sector, a couple businesses had a better than expected quarter, particularly our Events and Sports Marketing businesses, which I mentioned were up over 20%. 
As John mentioned, Public Relations was up 5.9% in the quarter, with organic growth of 2.4% and Specialty Communications was up 1.2%, with organic growth of a positive 5.4%. If you remember, this area was affected by the sale of our directory business last year. Within this sector, healthcare is the largest area. It continued to have a solid performance, and the other large area in the sector is recruitment marketing, which I mentioned doesn't cycle on the easier comps until later in the year.
Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 54.5% U.S. and 45.5% international. In the United States, revenue increased $60.5 million or about 3.9%. Dispositions, net of acquisitions, reduced revenue by $17 million or 1.2% and organic growth was very strong at 5.1%, adding about $78 million to revenue. 
International revenue increased $113 million or 9.3%. FX added $117 million or 9.6%. Acquisitions were $13.5 million adding about 1.1% and organic growth was negative 1.4%. Internationally, we had relatively strong performances in India, China, Singapore, Australia, the Middle East and Africa. In developed Asia, Korea showed positive growth for the second consecutive quarter and Japan turned in positive growth for the first time in several quarters. Results in Eastern and Western Europe were mixed, with flat performance in the U.K., France and Italy, strong positive results in Russia and then below average results in Germany, Spain, Portugal and Finland.
Moving to cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter, excluding working capital, remained very strong and our working capital performance continued to be very good. As everyone knows, our primary sources of cash, our net income plus stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, those items totaled $245 million for the quarter and our primary uses of cash were dividends, which totaled $47 million; capital expenditures, which totaled $25 million; acquisitions, including earn out payments, totaled $19.6 million. And as John mentioned, we resumed our share repurchase efforts with purchases totaling about $250 million in the quarter.

Our current credit picture, as this chart shows including changes of working capital, on a year-over-year net debt position improved by $1 billion to $1.3 billion. And as a result of the reduction in our outstanding debt balances, our leverage ratio or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 1.4 times and our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 13 times.
And finally from a liquidity perspective, we finished the quarter in a strong position with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling about $3.4 billion, and then we had additional uncommitted facilities available totaling $380 million. And with that, I'm going to open the call for questions. Thank you."

So it is an interesting time right now when we have a pretty wide variance of performance.

Right now, some of the bigger initiatives were in the CRM areas and we certainly saw some significant improvements in part because there were significant declines last year in areas like Events and Sports Marketing, so again we saw some pretty significant rebounds in those areas. PR was another area that had a very strong quarter. I think these things will certainly balance out over the course of this year. We will see less and less variants and more consistent performance across the different disciplines I think as we go. We'll probably also see more consistent performance across regions as we go. I think right now we're at that strange  sort of inflection point where we're continuing to get some fairly wide differences in performance."

As far as Germany goes, parts of Europe, we actually saw a step down last year in the third quarter. I think sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, I would say it stabilized. We didn't see a real quarter-on-quarter change, but we’re measuring all of these numbers really year-over-year. And we saw in parts of Europe, the bigger step change didn't really happen until the second half of last year. So it was almost -- the United States in many of these markets it was a big step that really occurred between the fourth quarter of '08 and say the first quarter of '09. In Europe, there was one step sort of in the first half of '09, and then a second step in the second half of '09. In that second half, the U.S. was stable.

We went through some wrenching changes last year and where there was a lot of cost containment that contributed to our performance in terms of what we're able to accomplish last year, but we had to reengineer quite of number of those agencies as well. And typically, when you get into a recovery, what occurs on your larger advertising annuity type annual fee clients, is the clients will come back and there will be a  request, which has occurred in the past, where you will reduce the fee and you will reduce the scope of work, so therefore you'll reengineer your staffing levels. When you get into the recovery period, what occurs is clients will spend more money. You will have to become more productive during that in the beginning of the recovery until the client is comfortable that the recovery is fully in place before they'll generally increase your fee again so it becomes -- We're in that period right now. Having said that, on projects and some other areas where we saw a rebound in spending, which is positive; and then having been through two serious recessions while in leadership with the company, there's some pretty normal patterns which are developing, so we are cautiously optimistic."

And these are measuring year-on-year. Other than auto, all of our major industry sectors were positive. Some very marginally positive, but all positive. So that was a good sign of broader recovery. We saw more increase in projects. Some of that may have been a little bit of pent-up demand, some of that we're trying to get done earlier in the year, and some of that will probably move into normal scope changes in fee renegotiations or fee changes in contracts as we go. So I wouldn't expect the pace of change to continue from -- the pace from Q4 to Q1 won't continue necessarily from Q1 to Q2. So I think we probably got a faster recovery. I think we'll probably have about the same overall recovery as we were expecting. But it's nice that it happened sooner.

We're very happy to announce positive year-over-year growth through the first quarter. Overall revenue increased 6.3% to $2.92 billion. This includes organic revenue growth of 2.1%, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. 
As we discussed in our last call, the general business environment continues to stabilize and improve. And as we look across, as we look at individual countries and regions, we're cautiously optimistic about continued global recovery, although we expect significant variation by region.
Turning to our performance, revenue growth was driven by a number of factors including cycling on some easier year-over-year comps for some of our businesses. First, we're starting to see a rebound in some of the hardest hit areas from the downturn, areas such as CRM and PR showed fairly strong organic growth as did our Media business. Recruiting continues to be one area of note that has not yet rebounded, and Randy will take you some of the specifics in a few minutes when he gets back on the call. 
Geographically, we saw a continued strong growth in developing markets: the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. We are also pleasantly surprised by the U.S. growth where organic growth was 5.1% in the quarter. This leaves Europe where our performance remains weak and the outlook is still somewhat unclear. 
On the cost run, we continue to keep a close eye on costs and we've asked our agencies to remain mindful of the potential risks to the economy, especially in some of our European markets where it's expensive to adjust staffing levels. 
Our other real estate and operating costs will take a little longer to fully absorb, but barring any downturns in the economy, we expect some of these pressures to begin to ease as we get into the second half of the year.
At the same time, our agencies are now increasingly focused on taking advantage of growth opportunities, both through new business efforts as well as growing our existing client accounts. Many of our agencies have adjusted their offerings to respond to the difficult economic environment and are now both more flexible and better able to serve the diverse needs of their clients. 
Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the year last year, we said that in 2010, we intended to use our strong balance sheet to increase our dividend, buy back stocks and make strategic acquisitions. And as you all know, we increased our dividend by 33% in February and also completed $250 million in stock buybacks during the quarter. 
Finally, our business is built on the strength of our management teams and the talented professionals around the world. They worked extremely hard to help us navigate through last year, and I'm confident that we are positioned well for the coming year and beyond. I'll now turn this back to Randy, and then we will take your questions afterwards."
96161,100781983,56913,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. The short summary is the first quarter was a very positive start to the year. And while results varied somewhat by business type and geography, which I'll cover in more detail later, on the whole, our business experienced solid sequential im",1178,"Thanks, John. The short summary is the first quarter was a very positive start to the year. And while results varied somewhat by business type and geography, which I'll cover in more detail later, on the whole, our business experienced solid sequential improvement from the fourth quarter and performed ahead of our expectations. 
Versus the first quarter of 2009, year-over-year revenue increased 6.3% to $2.92 billion. Our operating income increased 3% to $291 million. That resulted in an operating income or EBIT margin of about 10% down 30 basis points versus last year, and an EBITDA margin of 12.1%, down about 20 basis points from last year, which was a little bit ahead of the negative 30 basis points that we had expected. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $24.1 million. That was up $2.7 million from last year and down about $4.5 million from Q4. The increase versus Q1 2009 was the result of our issuance of $500 million of 10 year senior notes last July, which in effect traded lower cost floating rate debt for higher cost, longer-term, fixed rate debt. That increase was offset, in part, by lower borrowing levels as we de-lever the balance sheet over the course of last year. 
Versus the fourth quarter, the decrease was primarily due to reduced borrowing levels. On a tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was about 34%, which was basically unchanged from Q1 of last year. Net income from the quarter declined 0.7% to $163.4 million and diluted earnings per share in the quarter declined $0.01 or 1.9% to $0.52 per share. The diluted share count for the quarter was about 311 million shares. 
Analyzing our revenue performance, while in the current period, the U.S. dollar strengthened versus most major currencies. On a year-over-year basis, the dollar was weaker, resulting in a positive FX impact for the quarter of $117 million or about 4.3%. Assuming FX rates remain at their current levels, FX should continue to have a positive impact of around 1% in Q2 and then turn negative, about 1% in Q3, and then a negative 2.5% in Q4. Overall for the year at current rates, FX will be about flat for the year.
Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, reduced revenue by $3.8 million in the quarter or about 0.10%. It was largely due to the divestiture of our Directory Advertising business in Q2 of last year, partially offset by the acquisition of a majority stake in ImpactBBDO in the Middle East at the end of Q4. 
Organic growth. With the backdrop of easier year-over-year comparisons and continuing sequential improvement in revenue growth, organic revenue increased $60.2 million or about 2.1% in the quarter. A few areas worthy of note. Our Recruitment Marketing business, while stabilizing quarter-to-quarter, has not yet cycled on easier comparisons, and as a result, was again down over 30% for the quarter when measured year-on-year. 
Our Events and Sports Marketing businesses did turn the corner with significant increased activity in both financial services and technology sectors, as well as activity around the Winter Olympics. And so while these businesses didn’t fully cycle on last year's revenue drop, they still turned in 20-plus percent positive organic growth in the quarter. 
Our Media businesses also had a very strong quarter. While it was one of our better performing areas last year, it turned in an even better performance this quarter driven in part by a few specific clients and a few projects. And Field Marketing was also quite strong with high single-digit organic growth overall and very strong growth in China.
By industry, Auto remained the toughest sector. While improving quarter-on-quarter, this sector doesn't cycle on last year's significant changes until the second quarter. All other significant industry segments were positive for the quarter, which is a good sign.
Revenue mix. As for our mix of business, Brand Advertising accounted for 44% of our revenue and Marketing Services, 56%. As for their respective growth rates, Brand Advertising increased 5.6% in the quarter, with a slight decrease in organic revenue of 0.3% or about $3 million. 
Marketing Services increased 6.9% in total with organic growth of 4.2% or about $63 million. Within Marketing Services, CRM was up 8.6% with organic growth of 4.3%. Within the sector, a couple businesses had a better-than-expected quarter, particularly our Events and Sports Marketing businesses, which I mentioned were up over 20%. 
As John mentioned, Public Relations was up 5.9% in the quarter, with organic growth of 2.4% and Specialty Communications was up 1.2%, with organic growth of a positive 5.4%. If you remember, this area was affected by the sale of our directory business last year. Within this sector, Healthcare is the largest area. It continued to have a solid performance, and the other large area in the sector is Recruitment Marketing, which I mentioned doesn't cycle on the easier comps until later in the year.
Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 54.5% U.S. and 45.5% international. In the United States, revenue increased $60.5 million or about 3.9%. Dispositions, net of acquisitions, reduced revenue by $17 million or 1.2% and organic growth was very strong at 5.1%, adding about $78 million to revenue. 
International revenue increased $113 million or 9.3%. FX added $117 million or 9.6%. Acquisitions were $13.5 million adding about 1.1% and organic growth was negative 1.4%. Internationally, we had relatively strong performances in India, China, Singapore, Australia, the Middle East and Africa. In developed Asia, Korea showed positive growth for the second consecutive quarter and Japan turned in positive growth for the first time in several quarters. Results in Eastern and Western Europe were mixed, with flat performance in the U.K., France and Italy, strong positive results in Russia and then below average results in Germany, Spain, Portugal and Finland.
Moving to cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter, excluding working capital, remained very strong and our working capital performance continued to be very good. As everyone knows, our primary sources of cash, our net income plus stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, those items totaled $245 million for the quarter and our primary uses of cash were dividends, which totaled $47 million; capital expenditures, which totaled $25 million; acquisitions, including earn out payments, totaled $19.6 million. And as John mentioned, we resumed our share repurchase efforts with purchases totaling about $250 million in the quarter.

Our current credit picture, as this chart shows including changes of working capital, on a year-over-year net debt position improved by $1 billion to $1.3 billion. And as a result of the reduction in our outstanding debt balances, our leverage ratio or total debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 1.4 times and our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 13 times.
And finally from a liquidity perspective, we finished the quarter in a strong position with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling about $3.4 billion, and then we had additional uncommitted facilities available totaling $380 million. And with that, I'm going to open the call for questions. Thank you."

Where we're growing business, we have to add headcount, we have to add the people to perform those services to the clients. It's not like we can allocate people from Europe to do growth and activities in the United States and people in one area of our business are able to be fungible across to another discipline. So it is an interesting time right now when we have a pretty wide variance of performance. We have obviously very positive organic growth, especially in many areas across the United States, and we have mixed results across Europe. So it's a tricky time to balance our staffing levels. And so we're seeing some of that going to the P&L right now."

As far as Germany goes, parts of Europe, we actually saw a step down last year in the third quarter. I think sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, I would say it stabilized. We didn't see a real quarter-on-quarter change, but we’re measuring all of these numbers really year-over-year. And we saw in parts of Europe, the bigger step change didn't really happen until the second half of last year. So it was almost -- the United States, in many of these markets it was a big step that really occurred between the fourth quarter of '08 and say the first quarter of '09. In Europe, there was one step sort of in the first half of '09 and then a second step in the second half of '09. In that second half, the U.S. was stable.

And typically, when you get into a recovery, what occurs on your larger advertising annuity type annual fee clients, is the clients will come back and there will be a  request, which has occurred in the past, where you will reduce the fee and you will reduce the scope of work, so therefore you'll reengineer your staffing levels. When you get into the recovery period, what occurs is clients will spend more money. You will have to become more productive during that in the beginning of the recovery until the client is comfortable that the recovery is fully in place before they'll generally increase your fee again so it becomes -- We're in that period right now.

We saw more increase in projects. Some of that may have been a little bit of pent-up demand, some of that we're trying to get done earlier in the year, and some of that will probably move into normal scope changes in fee renegotiations or fee changes in contracts as we go. So I wouldn't expect the pace of change to continue from -- the pace from Q4 to Q1 won't continue necessarily from Q1 to Q2. So I think we probably got a faster recovery. I think we'll probably have about the same overall recovery as we were expecting. But it's nice that it happened sooner.

We're pleased to announce strong quarterly results for the second quarter. Results showed an improvement over last year and over the prior quarter. Overall, these results demonstrate continued improvement in our business.The",1125,"Good morning. Thanks, Randy. We're pleased to announce strong quarterly results for the second quarter. Results showed an improvement over last year and over the prior quarter. Overall, these results demonstrate continued improvement in our business.
There are several key trends that I'd like to highlight. First, from an overall point of view, economic growth is improving, although, slowly. Second, an increasing number of our clients are now focused on growth, and we're starting to see increases in the scope of services they require. Third, driven by the need for disciplined innovation during the recession, our agencies are extremely well positioned to compete and win, driving both industry recognition and importantly, some significant new business wins.
On the economy, the picture is generally improving with the exception of several smaller European countries that have been at the center of the recent crisis. We continue to see evidence of a recovery in the U.S. and saw a fairly strong revenue growth during the last quarter. As a result, we're optimistic about the next few quarters, but we still remain cautious until the unemployment picture here markedly starts to improve. Regarding Asia and Latin America, growth in these markets continue to be strong with a positive outlook in the next couple of quarters.
Go back to Europe. The picture is decidedly mixed. There are clearly some markets that have been and will continue to be affected by the current debt crisis. And in other markets such as the U.K., France and even Germany, we're hopeful that we're at the bottom or near the bottom of any economic impact. 
Let me take a second and touch on what we're hearing from clients. In one of the more positive outcomes of the recession, I believe that many of our client relationships are getting stronger. Last year, when clients hit difficult times, we reduced the scope of our work. As the focus now returns to growth, many of our larger clients are bringing us in closer than they ever had into their strategic decision-making process, so we can help drive their results.
While I won't get into specific clients or industries, generally speaking, the ship that's carrying it is very positive. Once again, last year, the focus was survival. Today, it's growth, and that growth should drive new and expanded engagements across all of our networks. 
The third trend I'd mention is our internal performance, costs. As we've talked over the past few quarters, our agencies were quick to adjust where they could when we hit the financial crisis. Now the challenge is to manage costs very thoughtfully as we start to re-invest in the growth of our business. From a margin point of view, and Randy will talk of this a little bit more, some of the transition costs, fix cut costs, severance and real estate reductions are still running through our system. But as we forecasted earlier this year, those costs had a minor impact on our margins in this quarter. And at this point, unless there's a double dip recession, we're near the end of the process and we expect to see margins level off in the second half and then start to improve next year.
On the revenue side, we continue to see growth by discipline and geography, and we saw robust growth in our new business during the quarter, which should help drive our revenue in future quarters. From a discipline point of view, our Specialty businesses, with the exception of Recruitment Advertising, generated double-digit growth in the quarter. And as we discussed, these businesses, they were hit particularly hard last year, but at this point, aided by some easier year-over-year comps, we expect these businesses will continue to grow.
PR also showed fairly strong growth in the quarter, and we're happy with the trends we're seeing in both the advertising and the CRM disciplines. From a geographic point of view, the story on the developing markets continues to be a good one, and following up on a strong first quarter in the U.S., we're happy to see that growth continue. Organic growth in the U.S. was 8.2% even after the loss of the Chrysler business. This leaves Europe, and as I previously mentioned, we were pleasantly surprised by the performances we saw in the U.K. and to a lesser degree, in France and Germany. But the picture in the rest of Europe is still somewhat unclear to us.
Turning to new business. We believe that the strategies we've pursued during the downturn are paying off. Our agencies agreed to find their value proposition and develop innovative services and are becoming more flexible in how we service our clients. They've also continued to make significant investments in digital capabilities, building internal skill sets, and that's resulting in stronger integrated offerings. 
Our Creative has also remained extremely strong, and we recently returned from Cannes with Network of the Year honors for BBDO, and I think that was the fourth year in a row. DDB captured number two and TBWA came in at number six. Together with the innovation and creative excellence, we are being rewarded with new business, making this a particularly strong quarter with new business, I believe, and Randy will cover it, in excess of $1.5 billion.
Acquisitions, which we talked about in the past. The story of the second quarter is one of organic growth. And as you can see, we've not really deployed any meaningful capital for acquisitions. As we said in the past, we expect to see more activity going forward especially in markets like Asia. To help in this effort, we've recently restructured our Asian operations. And earlier this month, we brought back, Dara Akbarian, who had previously been with Omnicom, and he'll now spearhead our M&A efforts in the Asian area. 
The balance sheet is another area where our discipline has worked to our advantage. During the second quarter, we further improved our position by completing our transition away from short-term debt to medium and long-term maturities, and we now sit in a very strong position, which will make achieving any of our strategic priorities much easier. 
So as we look to the second half of the year and beyond, we believe we are very, very well positioned. We'll continue to focus on expanding our digital capabilities as well as our footprint in developing markets. And in all cases, we're going to do this in a very conscientious way. There are still risks out there in the global economy, and we'll continue to rely on the strength of our management teams and the talent of the professionals we have around the world. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Randy, who'll take you through the second quarter."

In short, the second quarter was outstanding and better than we had anticipated. Driven by our strong new business performance over the past several quarters, as well as stabilizing to improving economic conditions around the world, we conti",1280,"Thanks, John. In short, the second quarter was outstanding and better than we had anticipated. Driven by our strong new business performance over the past several quarters, as well as stabilizing to improving economic conditions around the world, we continue to experience sequential improvements from Q1 across almost every industry segment and every geography. Even in geographies where we're still facing year-over-year declines, the declines were lower in Q2 versus Q1.
As a result, year-over-year revenue increased 5.9% to just over $3 billion. Operating income increased 4.3% to $415 million and that resulted in operating income or EBIT margins of 13.7%. That was down about 20 basis points and an EBITDA margin of 15.7%, also down about 20 basis points. 
Overall, our agencies have done a great job over the past 18 months at adjusting salary and service costs to align with client revenue. We're also beginning to make good progress at bringing our occupancy and other infrastructure costs into alignment. And most importantly, the agencies have been able to make this progress, while maintaining their client's service levels, as well as continuing to invest significantly behind the development of new and expanded capabilities to support future growth.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $23.7 million. That's up $1.8 million from Q2 of last year and down about $400,000 from Q1. The increase versus Q2 '09 was primarily the result of our issuance of $500 million of 10-year senior notes last July. That increase was largely offset by a decrease in borrowing levels, as well as lower rates on short-term borrowings. 
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was about 34%, down slightly from the 34.5% we had in Q2 of last year. Our results in net income for the quarter, an increase of 4.2% to $243.3 million and diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased $0.04 or 5.3% to $0.79. The diluted share count for the quarter was about 307 million shares. 
Analyzing our revenue performance a little further, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar was mixed versus our major currencies, resulting in a negative FX impact for the quarter of about 5.1 million or about 0.2%. Assuming rates remain at their current levels, FX will be increasingly negative for the balance of the year with an impact of around minus 2.5% in Q3 and minus 3.5% in Q4. And at current rates, FX will be negative about 0.5% for the full year.
Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $2.3 million in the quarter or about 0.1%. We're finally cycling on the disposition of the Directory Advertising business that we completed in the second quarter of 2009. That disposition has been bringing down our acquisition revenue by about 0.5% each quarter. 
Driven by both the success of our new business efforts, the stabilizing to improving economic environment and easier year-over-year comparisons, organic revenue was a very strong 6%, increasing our revenue by $173 million. 
A few areas worthy of note, as I mentioned earlier, we experienced increased revenue across almost every industry sector. The exception was auto, which was down about 1%. However, excluding the loss of Chrysler, the auto category was up over 15%. Events and Sports Marketing had another excellent quarter, up over 15% this quarter, benefiting somewhat from the FIFA World Cup and then Field Marketing continues to perform well up almost 15%. On the negative side, our Recruitment Marketing business has not yet turned the corner, although it's improving, with revenue down only 11% in the quarter.
As for our mix of business, Brand Advertising accounted for 45% of our revenue and Marketing Services, 55%. As for their respective growth rates, Brand Advertising increased 4.6% in the quarter, 3.4% being organic. And Marketing Services increased 7.1% in total, organic being up 8.2% or about $129 million. 
Within Marketing Services, CRM was up 5.9% with organic growth of 6.9%. Within this sector, a couple of businesses had better-than-expected quarter, particularly our Events and Sports Marketing and Field Marketing businesses that I mentioned earlier. 
As John said, Public Relations was up 7.1% in the quarter, with organic growth of 5.8% and Specialty Communications was up 11.4%, with organic growth of 15.7%. Healthcare, which is the largest area within Specialty Communications, continue to drive the performance in the category. And as I mentioned, Recruit Marketing, although beginning to cycle on easier comparisons, was still negative in the quarter.
I also want to point out that in the quarter, we've adjusted the discipline definitions for several of our operations. As more of our business is being performed on an integrated basis, several of our digital operations and CRM operations are now integrated together into Brand Advertising. To make prior-period amounts more comparable, we've adjusted prior-year revenue by discipline groupings as well as the current years. The changes didn't have a meaningful impact on any of the organic growth rates for any of the disciplines.
Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 53.8% U.S. and 46.2% international. In the U.S., revenue increased $112 million or 7.4%. Dispositions, net of acquisitions, reduced revenue by $12.2 million or about 0.8%, and organic growth was extremely strong at 8.2%, adding $124.6 million. International revenue increased $58 million or about 4.3%. FX decreased revenue by $5.1 million. Acquisitions added $14.5 million or about 1.1% and organic growth was positive at 3.6%. 
Internationally, again, driven by improving economic conditions and various successful new business efforts, in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia regions, we achieved double-digit organic growth in the quarter. In Europe, results continue to be mixed, with strong performances in the U.K., France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Russia, and other markets like Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Poland and the Czech Republic continuing to struggle.
However, we experienced sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 in almost every country. So even in places where the year-over-year growth was negative, it was less negative than in Q1, or in short, we're experiencing increasing stability and improvement across all markets.
Moving to cash flow, our operating cash flow through June, excluding working capital, was strong, and our working capital performance continue to be very good. Our primary sources of cash, that is, net income plus stock-based compensation and then depreciation and amortization, totaled about $580 million year-to-date. And our primary uses of cash year-to-date have been dividends, which totaled $108 million. CapEx totaled $63 million and acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $76 million. And then, share repurchases totaled approximately $472 million, net of proceeds we received from the various stock plans.
As the current credit picture chart shows, including changes on working capital, our year-over-year net debt position improved by about $400 million to $1.66 billion. And as a result of the reduction in our outstanding debt balances, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 1.3x, and our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 12.9x. 
During the quarter, the holders of our 2038 notes have the ability to put the notes back to us for repurchase. We were able to keep 407 million of the 467 million of the notes outstanding by paying a $50 per bond supplemental interest payment to bondholders. That amounts to about 1.6% annual interest on those notes. And now the next put date for those notes is going to be June of 2013.
And finally, from a liquidity perspective, we finished the quarter in a very strong position, with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling about $3 billion, and we had an additional uncommitted group of facilities available totaling $395 million. And with that, I'm going to now ask the operator to open the call for questions."

This quarter, we're back to broad-based, good solid performance.

I fully expect that the number of the government-sponsored advertising type of programs, which the industry benefited from under the previous government will be curtailed as part of the already announced austerity measures that the government is taking. We benefited a little bit about from that in the past, but that wasn't a big part of our U.K. business so that won't have much of an impact on us. The increase in that, which is supposed to take place January 1 from 17.5% to 20% will in all likelihood have some impact, and I would imagine it'll have an impact on large purchases. And this is me guessing more than anything else, but somebody who is planning to buy a car in the next five months will probably buy it before year end as opposed to in January because of those kinds of increases. In terms of packaged goods and normal products that people use everyday, everybody is tightening their belt but it's too early to see what the impact is going to be from the changes that their made.

With just the euro, we actually had a second step down last year at the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, so we haven't yet cycled on the easiest comps there.

We're pleased to announce strong quarterly results for the second quarter. Results showed an improvement over last year and over the prior quarter. Overall, these results demonstrate continued improvement in our business.The",1125,"Good morning. Thanks, Randy. We're pleased to announce strong quarterly results for the second quarter. Results showed an improvement over last year and over the prior quarter. Overall, these results demonstrate continued improvement in our business.
There are several key trends that I'd like to highlight. First, from an overall point of view, economic growth is improving, although, slowly. Second, an increasing number of our clients are now focused on growth, and we're starting to see increases in the scope of services they require. Third, driven by the need for disciplined innovation during the recession, our agencies are extremely well positioned to compete and win, driving both industry recognition and importantly, some significant new business wins.
On the economy, the picture is generally improving with the exception of several smaller European countries that have been at the center of the recent crisis. We continue to see evidence of a recovery in the U.S. and saw a fairly strong revenue growth during the last quarter. As a result, we're optimistic about the next few quarters, but we still remain cautious until the unemployment picture here markedly starts to improve. Regarding Asia and Latin America, growth in these markets continue to be strong with a positive outlook in the next couple of quarters.
Go back to Europe. The picture is decidedly mixed. There are clearly some markets that have been and will continue to be affected by the current debt crisis. And in other markets such as the U.K., France and even Germany, we're hopeful that we're at the bottom or near the bottom of any economic impact. 
Let me take a second and touch on what we're hearing from clients. In one of the more positive outcomes of the recession, I believe that many of our client relationships are getting stronger. Last year, when clients hit difficult times, we reduced the scope of our work. As the focus now returns to growth, many of our larger clients are bringing us in closer than they ever had into their strategic decision-making process, so we can help drive their results.
While I won't get into specific clients or industries, generally speaking, the ship that's carrying it is very positive. Once again, last year, the focus was survival. Today, it's growth, and that growth should drive new and expanded engagements across all of our networks. 
The third trend I'd mention is our internal performance, costs. As we've talked over the past few quarters, our agencies were quick to adjust where they could when we hit the financial crisis. Now the challenge is to manage costs very thoughtfully as we start to re-invest in the growth of our business. From a margin point of view, and Randy will talk of this a little bit more, some of the transition costs, fix cut costs, severance and real estate reductions are still running through our system. But as we forecasted earlier this year, those costs had a minor impact on our margins in this quarter. And at this point, unless there's a double dip recession, we're near the end of the process and we expect to see margins level off in the second half and then start to improve next year.
On the revenue side, we continue to see growth by discipline and geography, and we saw robust growth in our new business during the quarter, which should help drive our revenue in future quarters. From a discipline point of view, our Specialty businesses, with the exception of Recruitment Advertising, generated double-digit growth in the quarter. And as we discussed, these businesses, they were hit particularly hard last year, but at this point, aided by some easier year-over-year comps, we expect these businesses will continue to grow.
PR also showed fairly strong growth in the quarter, and we're happy with the trends we're seeing in both the advertising and the CRM disciplines. From a geographic point of view, the story on the developing markets continues to be a good one, and following up on a strong first quarter in the U.S., we're happy to see that growth continue. Organic growth in the U.S. was 8.2% even after the loss of the Chrysler business. This leaves Europe, and as I previously mentioned, we were pleasantly surprised by the performances we saw in the U.K. and to a lesser degree, in France and Germany. But the picture in the rest of Europe is still somewhat unclear to us.
Turning to new business. We believe that the strategies we've pursued during the downturn are paying off. Our agencies agreed to find their value proposition and develop innovative services and are becoming more flexible in how we service our clients. They've also continued to make significant investments in digital capabilities, building internal skill sets, and that's resulting in stronger integrated offerings. 
Our Creative has also remained extremely strong, and we recently returned from Cannes with Network of the Year honors for BBDO, and I think that was the fourth year in a row. DDB captured number two and TBWA came in at number six. Together with the innovation and creative excellence, we are being rewarded with new business, making this a particularly strong quarter with new business, I believe, and Randy will cover it, in excess of $1.5 billion.
Acquisitions, which we talked about in the past. The story of the second quarter is one of organic growth. And as you can see, we've not really deployed any meaningful capital for acquisitions. As we said in the past, we expect to see more activity going forward especially in markets like Asia. To help in this effort, we've recently restructured our Asian operations. And earlier this month, we brought back, Dara Akbarian, who had previously been with Omnicom, and he'll now spearhead our M&A efforts in the Asian area. 
The balance sheet is another area where our discipline has worked to our advantage. During the second quarter, we further improved our position by completing our transition away from short-term debt to medium and long-term maturities, and we now sit in a very strong position, which will make achieving any of our strategic priorities much easier. 
So as we look to the second half of the year and beyond, we believe we are very, very well positioned. We'll continue to focus on expanding our digital capabilities as well as our footprint in developing markets. And in all cases, we're going to do this in a very conscientious way. There are still risks out there in the global economy, and we'll continue to rely on the strength of our management teams and the talent of the professionals we have around the world. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Randy, who'll take you through the second quarter."
96161,109399202,67936,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2010",2010-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. In short, the second quarter was outstanding and better than we had anticipated. Driven by our strong new business performance over the past several quarters, as well as stabilizing to improving economic conditions around the world, we conti",1280,"Thanks, John. In short, the second quarter was outstanding and better than we had anticipated. Driven by our strong new business performance over the past several quarters, as well as stabilizing to improving economic conditions around the world, we continue to experience sequential improvements from Q1 across almost every industry segment and every geography. Even in geographies where we're still facing year-over-year declines, the declines were lower in Q2 versus Q1.
As a result, year-over-year revenue increased 5.9% to just over $3 billion. Operating income increased 4.3% to $415 million and that resulted in operating income or EBIT margins of 13.7%. That was down about 20 basis points and an EBITDA margin of 15.7%, also down about 20 basis points. 
Overall, our agencies have done a great job over the past 18 months at adjusting salary and service costs to align with client revenue. We're also beginning to make good progress at bringing our occupancy and other infrastructure costs into alignment. And most importantly, the agencies have been able to make this progress, while maintaining their client's service levels, as well as continuing to invest significantly behind the development of new and expanded capabilities to support future growth.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $23.7 million. That's up $1.8 million from Q2 of last year and down about $400,000 from Q1. The increase versus Q2 '09 was primarily the result of our issuance of $500 million of 10-year senior notes last July. That increase was largely offset by a decrease in borrowing levels, as well as lower rates on short-term borrowings. 
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was about 34%, down slightly from the 34.5% we had in Q2 of last year. Our results in net income for the quarter, an increase of 4.2% to $243.3 million and diluted earnings per share on the quarter increased $0.04 or 5.3% to $0.79. The diluted share count for the quarter was about 307 million shares. 
Analyzing our revenue performance a little further, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar was mixed versus our major currencies, resulting in a negative FX impact for the quarter of about 5.1 million or about 0.2%. Assuming rates remain at their current levels, FX will be increasingly negative for the balance of the year with an impact of around minus 2.5% in Q3 and minus 3.5% in Q4. And at current rates, FX will be negative about 0.5% for the full year.
Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $2.3 million in the quarter or about 0.1%. We're finally cycling on the disposition of the Directory Advertising business that we completed in the second quarter of 2009. That disposition has been bringing down our acquisition revenue by about 0.5% each quarter. 
Driven by both the success of our new business efforts, the stabilizing to improving economic environment and easier year-over-year comparisons, organic revenue was a very strong 6%, increasing our revenue by $173 million. 
A few areas worthy of note, as I mentioned earlier, we experienced increased revenue across almost every industry sector. The exception was auto, which was down about 1%. However, excluding the loss of Chrysler, the auto category was up over 15%. Events and Sports Marketing had another excellent quarter, up over 15% this quarter, benefiting somewhat from the FIFA World Cup and then Field Marketing continues to perform well up almost 15%. On the negative side, our Recruitment Marketing business has not yet turned the corner, although it's improving, with revenue down only 11% in the quarter.
As for our mix of business, Brand Advertising accounted for 45% of our revenue and Marketing Services, 55%. As for their respective growth rates, Brand Advertising increased 4.6% in the quarter, 3.4% being organic. And Marketing Services increased 7.1% in total, organic being up 8.2% or about $129 million. 
Within Marketing Services, CRM was up 5.9% with organic growth of 6.9%. Within this sector, a couple of businesses had better-than-expected quarter, particularly our Events and Sports Marketing and Field Marketing businesses that I mentioned earlier. 
As John said, Public Relations was up 7.1% in the quarter, with organic growth of 5.8% and Specialty Communications was up 11.4%, with organic growth of 15.7%. Healthcare, which is the largest area within Specialty Communications, continue to drive the performance in the category. And as I mentioned, Recruit Marketing, although beginning to cycle on easier comparisons, was still negative in the quarter.
I also want to point out that in the quarter, we've adjusted the discipline definitions for several of our operations. As more of our business is being performed on an integrated basis, several of our digital operations and CRM operations are now integrated together into Brand Advertising. To make prior-period amounts more comparable, we've adjusted prior-year revenue by discipline groupings as well as the current years. The changes didn't have a meaningful impact on any of the organic growth rates for any of the disciplines.
Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 53.8% U.S. and 46.2% international. In the U.S., revenue increased $112 million or 7.4%. Dispositions, net of acquisitions, reduced revenue by $12.2 million or about 0.8%, and organic growth was extremely strong at 8.2%, adding $124.6 million. International revenue increased $58 million or about 4.3%. FX decreased revenue by $5.1 million. Acquisitions added $14.5 million or about 1.1% and organic growth was positive at 3.6%. 
Internationally, again, driven by improving economic conditions and various successful new business efforts, in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia regions, we achieved double-digit organic growth in the quarter. In Europe, results continue to be mixed, with strong performances in the U.K., France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Russia, and other markets like Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Poland and the Czech Republic continuing to struggle.
However, we experienced sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 in almost every country. So even in places where the year-over-year growth was negative, it was less negative than in Q1, or in short, we're experiencing increasing stability and improvement across all markets.
Moving to cash flow, our operating cash flow through June, excluding working capital, was strong, and our working capital performance continue to be very good. Our primary sources of cash, that is, net income plus stock-based compensation and then depreciation and amortization, totaled about $580 million year-to-date. And our primary uses of cash year-to-date have been dividends, which totaled $108 million. CapEx totaled $63 million and acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $76 million. And then, share repurchases totaled approximately $472 million, net of proceeds we received from the various stock plans.
As the current credit picture chart shows, including changes on working capital, our year-over-year net debt position improved by about $400 million to $1.66 billion. And as a result of the reduction in our outstanding debt balances, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 1.3x, and our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 12.9x. 
During the quarter, the holders of our 2038 notes have the ability to put the notes back to us for repurchase. We were able to keep 407 million of the 467 million of the notes outstanding by paying a $50 per bond supplemental interest payment to bondholders. That amounts to about 1.6% annual interest on those notes. And now the next put date for those notes is going to be June of 2013.
And finally, from a liquidity perspective, we finished the quarter in a very strong position, with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling about $3 billion, and we had an additional uncommitted group of facilities available totaling $395 million. And with that, I'm going to now ask the operator to open the call for questions."

I fully expect that the number of the government-sponsored advertising type of programs, which the industry benefited from under the previous government will be curtailed as part of the already announced austerity measures that the government is taking. We benefited a little bit about from that in the past, but that wasn't a big part of our U.K. business so that won't have much of an impact on us. The increase in that, which is supposed to take place January 1 from 17.5% to 20% will in all likelihood have some impact, and I would imagine it'll have an impact on large purchases. And this is me guessing more than anything else, but somebody who is planning to buy a car in the next five months will probably buy it before year end as opposed to in January because of those kinds of increases. In terms of packaged goods and normal products that people use everyday, everybody is tightening their belt but it's too early to see what the impact is going to be from the changes that their made. And like most governments, there are announcements of what's going to go on, and then there's implementation of those announcements and until they've been implemented, one doesn't know."

And so I think auto spending, frankly, even last year when it was down 30% at least in the U.S. was fairly rational to its unit sales. Now the increase, I guess, that's probably also fairly rational with the unit sales, so the unit sales are up but they're not back to the 16 million unit level that they were at, say, in the 2007 time frame. So the auto category seems to be fairly rational in its spending, at least, as it relates to our revenues. And then obviously, we've got a deal with performance within it. So we lost Chrysler, we won Chevy. Chevy doesn't replace the Chrysler loss. Chrysler was a very large integrated account. We want a piece of the Chevy business, which was obviously a great win.

I think in the fourth quarter, we actually started having an uplift so it's not quite such an easy comp in the U.S. for the fourth quarter. With just the euro, we actually had a second step down last year at the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, so we haven't yet cycled on the easiest comps there. And I'm not sure we really had a lot of blip, a lot of year-over-year differences or economic changes in places like the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and Asia.

We are pleased to announce strong quarterly results for the second quarter. Results showed an improvement over the last year and overt the prior quarter. Overall these results demonstrate continued improvement in our business.",1128," Good morning, thanks Randy. We are pleased to announce strong quarterly results for the second quarter. Results showed an improvement over the last year and overt the prior quarter. Overall these results demonstrate continued improvement in our business.
 There are several key trends that I’d like to highlight. First, from an overall point of view economic growth is improving although slowly. Second, an increasing number of our clients are now focused on growth and we are starting to see increases in the scope of services they require.
 Third, driven by the need for disciplined innovation during the recession our agencies are extremely well positioned to compete and win. Driving both industry recognition importantly some significant in business wins.
 On the economy the picture is generally improving with the exception of several smaller European countries that have been at the center of the recent crisis. We continue to see evidence of recovery in the US and saw fairly strong revenue growth during the last quarter. As a result we are optimistic about the next few quarters, but we still remain cautious until the unemployment picture here markedly starts to improve.
 Regarding Asia and Latin America growth in these markets continue to be strong with a positive outlook in the next several quarters.
 Go back to Europe the picture is decidedly mixed, there are clearly some markets that have been and will continue to be affected by the current debt crisis and then other markets such as the UK, France and even Germany we are hopeful that we are at the bottom or near the bottom of any economic impasse.
 Let me take a second and touch on what we are hearing from clients. In one of the more positive outcomes of the recession I believe that many of our client relationships are getting stronger. Last year when clients hit difficult times we reduced the scope of our work. As the focus now returns to growth many of our largest clients are bringing us in closer that they ever had into their strategic decision making process so we can help derive their results.
 While I won’t get into specific clients or industries generally speaking the shift that’s occurring is very positive. Once again last year the focus was survival, today its growth and that growth should drive new and expanded engagements across all of our networks.
 The third trend I mentioned is our internal performance, costs. As we talked over the past few quarters, our agencies were quick where they could when we hit the financial crisis. Now the challenge is to manage cost very thoughtfully as we start to reinvest in the growth of our business.
 From a margin point of view and Randy will cover this a little bit more, some of the transition costs, fixed debt costs, severance and real estate reductions are still running through our system, but as we forecasted earlier this year those costs had a minor impact on our margins in this quarter. And at this point unless there is a double-dip recession we are near the end of the process and we expect to see margins level off in the second half and then start to improve next year.
 On the revenue side we continue to see growth by discipline and geography and saw robust growth in our new business during the quarter, which should help drive our revenue in future quarters.
 From a discipline point of view our specialty businesses with the exception of recruitment and advertising generated double-digit growth in the quarter and as we discussed these businesses were particularly -- they were hit particularly hard last year, but at this point aided by some easier year-over-year comps, we expect these business will continue to grow.
 PR also showed fairly strong growth in the quarter and we happy with the trends we are seeing in both advertising and the CRM disciplines.
 From a geographic point of view the story in the developing markets continues to be a good one and following up on a strong first quarter in the U.S., we are happy to see that growth continue.
 Organic growth in the US was 8.2% even after the loss of the Chrysler business, this leaves Europe and as I previously mentioned we were pleasantly surprised by the performances we saw in the U.K., to a lesser degree in France and Germany, but the picture and the rest of Europe is still somewhat unclear to us.
 Turning to new business we believe that the strategies we pursued during the downturn of paying off our agencies have redefined their value proposition and developed innovative services and are becoming more flexible on how we service our clients. They’ve also continued to make significant investments in digital capabilities building internal skill sets and that’s resulting in stronger integrated offerings.
 Our creative has also remained extremely strong and we recently returned form Cannes with Network of the Year honors for BBDO and I think that was the fourth year in a row. DBB captured number 2 and TBWA came in number 6.
 Together with the innovation and creative excellence we are being rewarded with new business making this a particularly strong quarter with new business I believe and Randy will cover it in excess of $1.5 billion.
 Acquisitions - which we’ve talked about in the past; the story of the second quarter is one of organic growth and as you can see we’ve not really deployed any meaningful capital for acquisitions. As we’ve said in the past we expect to see more activity going forward especially in markets like Asia.
 To help in this effort we’ve recently restructured our Asia operations and earlier this month we brought back Dara Akabarian who had previously been with Omnicom and he’ll now spearhead our M&A efforts in the Asian area.
 The balance sheets, it’s another area where our discipline has worked to our advantage, during the second quarter we’ve further improved our position by completing our transition away from short term debt to medium and long term maturities and now sit in a very strong position which will make achieving any of our strategic priorities much easier.
 So as we look to the second half of the year and beyond we believe we are very, very well positioned.
 We’ll continue to focus on expanding our digital capabilities as well as our footprint in developing markets and in all cases we are going to do this in a very conscientious way. There are still risks out there in the global economy and we’ll continue to relay on the strength of our management teams and the talented professionals we have around the world.
 With that I’ll now turn the call back to Randy who’ll take you through the second quarter.

Driven by a strong new business performance over the past several quarters as well stabilizing to improving economic conditions around the world we continued to experience sequential improvements from Q1 across almost every industry segment and every geography. Even in geographies where we are still facing year-over-year declines, the declines were lower on Q2 versus Q1. As a result year-over-year revenue increased 5.9% to just over $3 billion. Operating income increased 4.3% to $415 million and that resulted in operating income or EBIT margins of 13.7% that was down about 20 basis points and an EBITDA margin of 15.7% also down about 20 basis points. Overall our agencies have done a great job over the past 18 months at adjusting salary and service cost to align with client revenue.
 We are also beginning to make good progress at brining our occupancy and other infrastructure costs into alignment and most importantly the agencies have been able to make this progress while maintaining their client service levels as well as continuing to invest significantly behind the development of new and expanding capabilities to support future growth.
 Net interest expense for the quarter was $23.7 million, that’s up 1.8 million from Q2 of last year and down about $400,000 from Q1. The increase versus Q2 ‘09 was primarily the result of our issuance of $500 million of ten-year senior notes last July. That increase was largely offset by a decrease in borrowing levels as well as lower rates on short term borrowings.
 On a tax front our reported tax rate for the quarter was about 34% down slightly from the 34.5% we hit in Q2 of last year.
 Our results in net income for the quarter an increase of 4.2% to $243.3 million and diluted earnings per share on the quarter increase $0.04 or 5.3% to $0.79. The diluted share cap for the quarter was about 307 million shares.
 Analyzing our revenue performance a little further, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar was mixed versus our major currencies resulting in a negative FX impact for the quarter of about $5.1 million or about two tenths of 1%. Assuming rates remain at their current levels, FX will be increasingly negative for the balance of the year with an impact of our around minus 2.5% in Q3 and minus 3.5% in Q4, and the current rate's FX will be negative about 0.5% for the full year.
 Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $2.3 million in the quarter or about one tenth of 1%. We are finally cycling on the disposition of the directory advertising business that we completed in the second quarter of 2009. That disposition has been bringing down our acquisition revenue by about 0.5% each quarter.
 Driven by both the success of our new business efforts, the stabilizing to improving economic environment and easier year-over-year comparison, organic revenue was a very strong 6% increasing our revenue by $173 million.
 A few areas worthy of note, as I mentioned earlier, we experienced increased revenue across almost every industry sector. The exception was auto, which was down about 1%. However, excluding the loss of Chrysler, the auto category was up over 15%.
 Events and sports marketing had another excellent quarter, up over 15% this quarter, benefiting somewhat from the FIFA World Cup, and then field marketing continues to perform well, up almost 15%.
 On a negative side, our recruitment marketing business has not yet turned the quarter, although it's improving with revenue down only 11% in the quarter.
 As for mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 45% of our revenue and marketing services 55%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising increased 4.6% in the quarter, 3.4% being organic and marketing services increased 7.1% in total, organic being up 8.2% or about $129 million.
 Within marketing services, CRM was up 5.9% with organic growth of 6.9%. Within the sector a couple of businesses had better than expected quarter, particularly our events and sports marketing and field marketing businesses that I mentioned earlier.
 As John said, public relations was up 7.1% in the quarter with organic growth of 5.8%, and specialty communications was up 11.4% with organic growth of 15.7%.
 Healthcare, which is the largest area within specialty communications, continued to drive the performance in the category. As I've mentioned, recruit marketing, although beginning to cycle on easier comparisons, was still negative in the quarter.
 I also want to point out that in the quarter we’ve adjusted the disciplined definitions for several of our operations. As more of our business is being performed on an integrated basis, several of our digital operations and CRM operations are now integrated together into brand advertising. To make prior period amounts more comparable, we have adjusted prior year revenue by discipline groupings as well as the current years. The changes didn't have a meaningful impact on any of the organic growth rates for any of the disciplines.
 Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 53.8% U.S. and 46.2% international. In the U.S., revenue increased $112 million or 7.4%. Dispositions net of acquisitions reduced revenue by $12.2 million or about 0.8%, and organic growth was extremely strong at 8.2% adding $124.6 million.
 International revenue increased $58 million or about 4.3%. FX decreased revenue by $5.1 million, acquisitions added $14.5 million or about 1.1%, and organic growth was positive at 3.6%.
 Internationally, again, driven by improving economic conditions and very successful new business efforts in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Asia regions, we achieved double-digit organic growth in the quarter. In Europe, results continued to be mixed with strong performances in the U.K., France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Russia; and other markets like Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Poland, and the Czech Republic continuing to struggle. However, we experienced sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 in almost every country. So, even in places where the year-over-year growth was negative, it was less negative than in Q1, or in short, we're experiencing increasing stability and improvement across all markets.
 Moving to cash flow, our operating cash flow through June, excluding working capital, was strong and our working capital performance continue to be very good. Our primary sources of cash, that is net income plus stock-based compensation and then depreciation and amortization, totaled about $580 million year-to-date. And our primary uses of cash year-to-date have been dividends, which totaled $108 million, CapEx totaled $63 million and acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $76 million. And then share repurchases totaled approximately $472 million net of proceeds we receive from the various stock plans.
 As the current credit picture chart shows, including changes in working capital, our year-over-year net debt position improved by about $400 million to $1.66 billion. As a result of the reduction in our outstanding debt balances, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 1.3 times, and our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 12.9 times.
 During the quarter, the holders of our 2038 Notes have the ability to put the notes back to us for repurchase. We were able to keep $407 million of the $467 million of the notes outstanding by paying a $50 per bond supplemental interest payment to bondholders. That amounts to about 1.6% annual interest on those notes, and now the next put date for those notes is going to be June of 2013.
 And finally, from a liquidity perspective, we finished the quarter in a very strong position, with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling about $3 billion and we had an additional uncommitted group of facilities available totaling $395 million.
 With that, I am going to now ask the operator to open the call for question.

Having said that, domestically if that's what you are focused on, we'll remain somewhat cautious with unemployment as high as it is and act accordingly; but, clients, I guess after having being forced to focus as we were on costs for about 18 months, are now turning towards the top line and increasingly trying to drive growth, so.

I'd fully expect that number of the government sponsored advertising type of programs, which the industry benefited from under the previous government will be curtail as part of the already announced austerity measures that the government is taking. We were not – we benefited a little bit from that in the past, but it wasn't a big part of our U.K. business. So, that won't have much of an impact on us. The increase in that, which is supposed to take place January 1st, from 17.5% to 20%, will in all likelihood have some impact, and I would imagine it will have an impact on large purchases. So and this is me guessing more than anything else, if somebody who was planning to buy a car in the next five months will probably buy it before year end as opposed to in January because of those kinds of increases. In terms of packaged goods and normal products that people use everyday, everybody is tightening their belt, but it's too early to see what the impact is going to be from the changes that they've made. And like most governments, there are announcements of what's going to go on and then there is implementation of those announcements and until they've been implemented one doesn't know.

We had strong organic growth this quarter. We had positive organic growth last quarter, we were, I think, just over flat in the fourth quarter if I remember right. That wasn't necessarily because the economy was very different in the U.K. versus some of the other parts of Europe. Frankly I think what really drove it was very strong new business and operating performance of the individual agencies that we have in the marketplace. And frankly, that strong operating performance certainly is a good offset to economic conditions. It's obviously a lot easier on everybody if the economies are strong, but the agencies going out and winning new business and expanding their relationships, they can certainly buck that economic trend.

Right now part of the reason this year's management of margins is probably more difficult than other times is you have that double trend. We still have elevated severance in some spots where agencies are fine tuning their cost structures and in places like Europe. On the other side, where we're getting expansion, we're getting that increase in personnel and recruitment costs as well. Let's see, share account we ended June with about $303 million.

If I was just doing generalizations, I would say that there are three speeds going on in the world, Asia and Middle East, Latin America it's in the go-speed, it's going forward. I don't see any real disruptions in those markets in terms of our overall growth and the economies that are there. Europe, we remain very cautious about focusing on new business wins in smaller markets, efficiencies making certain that we innovate quickly in those markets to expand what relationships we do have. And the U.S. is the place where it's moving forward. We've had a very good experience in the first six months of the year. Some of it we have been aided by easier comps, some of it has been real expansion on part of our clients. And we remain optimistic, but cautious because we read the same thing as you do. Our clients are looking to grow their businesses, so they are more focused this year on the top line than probably in the past, where they had to immediately turn most of their focus to cost reduction, and we're working very closely with them on that. So, I probably won't feel as good about the U.S. as I do about some of the emerging and developing markets until we start to see some improvement in unemployment, and as a personal wish, I wish Congress would go on recess and stop doing things, because I think we would all benefit from a quiet period in the United States, but that's a personal wish. So, the clients are truly focused on product innovation for their own products and growth, and that goes across the board in terms of ones that I am in contact with and talking to all the time.

Is your thinking now that the growth going forward, for at least for the next couple of quarters, should be in the range that you've seen this quarter off that reset base allowing for the noise that you've talked about, Randy, a point or two or do you've some reason to thinks it's gone materially differ from that one way or the other?

First of all, we saw about a 30% decline in auto last year, so absent Chrysler, today we are seeing a 15% increase this year. When you just do that math, that's still down 20% from say 2007ish levels, so I think auto spending frankly, even last year when it was down 30% at least in the U.S., was fairly rational through its unit sales. Now, with the increase I guess that's probably also fairly rational with the unit sales. So, the unit sales are up, but they are not back to 60 million unit level that they were at say in the 2007 timeframe. So, the auto category seems to be fairly rational in its spending at least as it relates to our revenues. And then, obviously, we've got to deal with performance within it. So, we lost Chrysler, we won Chevy. Chevy doesn't replace the Chrysler loss. Chrysler was a very large integrated account. We won a piece of the Chevy business, which was, obviously, a great win, but it wasn't what a 25 or 50-year relationship with Chrysler had built up to. So, we're happy with where we're at and the progress that we've made in the auto sector. What was the second question again?

I think probably overall maybe some work moves around, around things like FIFA that probably doesn't necessarily impact the full year numbers, but may move a little bit of revenue into the second quarter, that's hard to determine. I think by the end of the fourth quarter we actually started having an up lift, so it's not quite such an easy comp in the U.S. for the fourth quarter. When you get to Europe we actually had a second step down last year at the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, so we haven't yet cycled on the easiest comps there. And I'm not sure we really had a lot of blip, a lot of year-over-year differences or economic changes in places like the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and Asia. So, there's probably not a lot of easy comp analysis to be done there.

Results showed an improvement over the last year and over the prior quarter. Overall these results demonstrate continued improvement in our business. 
There are several key trends that I’d like to highlight. First, from an overall point of view economic growth is improving although slowly. Second, an increasing number of our clients are now focused on growth and we are starting to see increases in the scope of services they require. 
Third, driven by the need for disciplined innovation during the recession our agencies are extremely well positioned to compete and win, driving both industry recognition and importantly some significant new business wins.
On the economy the picture is generally improving with the exception of several smaller European countries that have been at the center of the recent crisis. We continue to see evidence of recovery in the US and saw fairly strong revenue growth during the last quarter. As a result we are optimistic about the next few quarters, but we still remain cautious until the unemployment picture here markedly starts to improve. 
Regarding Asia and Latin America growth in these markets continue to be strong with a positive outlook in the next several quarters. 
Go back to Europe the picture is decidedly mixed, there are clearly some markets that have been and will continue to be affected by the current debt crisis and then other markets such as the UK, France and even Germany we are hopeful that we are at the bottom or near the bottom of any economic impacts.
Let me take a second and touch on what we are hearing from clients. In one of the more positive outcomes of the recession I believe that many of our client relationships are getting stronger. Last year when clients hit difficult times we reduced the scope of our work. As the focus now returns to growth many of our largest clients are bringing us in closer than they ever had into their strategic decision making process so we can help drive their results. 
While I won’t get into specific clients or industries generally speaking the shift that’s occurring is very positive. Once again last year the focus was survival, today it’s growth and that growth should drive new and expanded engagements across all of our networks. 
The third trend I mentioned is our internal performance, costs. As we talked over the past few quarters, our agencies were quick where they could when we hit the financial crisis. Now the challenge is to manage cost very thoughtfully as we start to reinvest in the growth of our business. 
From a margin point of view and Randy will cover this a little bit more, some of the transition costs, fixed debt costs, severance and real estate reductions are still running through our system, but as we forecasted earlier this year those costs had a minor impact on our margins in this quarter. And at this point unless there is a double-dip recession we are near the end of the process and we expect to see margins level off in the second half and then start to improve next year.
On the revenue side we continue to see growth by discipline and geography and saw robust growth in our new business during the quarter, which should help drive our revenue in future quarters. 
From a discipline point of view our specialty businesses with the exception of recruitment and advertising generated double-digit growth in the quarter and as we discussed these businesses were particularly -- they were hit particularly hard last year, but at this point aided by some easier year-over-year comps, we expect these business will continue to grow.
PR also showed fairly strong growth in the quarter and we are happy with the trends we are seeing in both advertising and the CRM disciplines. 
From a geographic point of view the story in the developing markets continues to be a good one and following up on a strong first quarter in the U.S., we are happy to see that growth continue. 
Organic growth in the US was 8.2% even after the loss of the Chrysler business. This leaves Europe, and as I previously mentioned we were pleasantly surprised by the performances we saw in the U.K., to a lesser degree in France and Germany, but the picture in the rest of Europe is still somewhat unclear to us. 
Turning to new business we believe that the strategies we pursued during the downturn are paying off. Our agencies have redefined their value proposition and developed innovative services and are becoming more flexible on how we service our clients. They’ve also continued to make significant investments in digital capabilities, building internal skill sets and that’s resulting in stronger integrated offerings. 
Our creative has also remained extremely strong and we recently returned form Cannes with Network of the Year honors for BBDO and I think that was the fourth year in a row. DDB captured number 2 and TBWA came in number 6. 
Together with the innovation and creative excellence we are being rewarded with new business making this a particularly strong quarter with new business I believe and Randy will cover it in excess of $1.5 billion. 
Acquisitions - which we’ve talked about in the past; the story of the second quarter is one of organic growth and as you can see we’ve not really deployed any meaningful capital for acquisitions. As we’ve said in the past we expect to see more activity going forward especially in markets like Asia. 
To help in this effort we’ve recently restructured our Asia operations and earlier this month we brought back Dara Akbarian who had previously been with Omnicom and he’ll now spearhead our M&A efforts in the Asian area. 
The balance sheet, it’s another area where our discipline has worked to our advantage, during the second quarter we’ve further improved our position by completing our transition away from short term debt to medium and long term maturities and we now sit in a very strong position which will make achieving any of our strategic priorities much easier. 
So as we look to the second half of the year and beyond we believe we are very, very well positioned. 
We’ll continue to focus on expanding our digital capabilities as well as our footprint in developing markets and in all cases we are going to do this in a very conscientious way. There are still risks out there in the global economy and we’ll continue to rely on the strength of our management teams and the talented professionals we have around the world.
With that I’ll now turn the call back to Randy who’ll take you through the second quarter.

In short, the second quarter was outstanding and better than we had anticipated. Driven by our strong new business performance over the past several quarters as well stabilizing to improving economic conditions around the world, we continued",1295,"Thanks John. In short, the second quarter was outstanding and better than we had anticipated. Driven by our strong new business performance over the past several quarters as well stabilizing to improving economic conditions around the world, we continued to experience sequential improvements from Q1 across almost every industry segment and every geography. Even in geographies where we are still facing year-over-year declines, the declines were lower in Q2 versus Q1. As a result year-over-year revenue increased 5.9% to just over $3 billion. Operating income increased 4.3% to $415 million and that resulted in operating income or EBIT margins of 13.7% that was down about 20 basis points and an EBITDA margin of 15.7% also down about 20 basis points. Overall our agencies have done a great job over the past 18 months at adjusting salary and service cost to align with client revenue. 
We are also beginning to make good progress at bringing our occupancy and other infrastructure costs into alignment and most importantly the agencies have been able to make this progress while maintaining their client service levels as well as continuing to invest significantly behind the development of new and expanding capabilities to support future growth.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $23.7 million, that’s up 1.8 million from Q2 of last year and down about $400,000 from Q1. The increase versus Q2 ‘09 was primarily the result of our issuance of $500 million of ten-year senior notes last July. That increase was largely offset by a decrease in borrowing levels as well as lower rates on short term borrowings. 
On the tax front our reported tax rate for the quarter was about 34% down slightly from the 34.5% we hit in Q2 of last year. 
That results in net income for the quarter an increase of 4.2% to $243.3 million and diluted earnings per share on the quarter increased $0.04 or 5.3% to $0.79. The diluted share cap for the quarter was about 307 million shares. 
Analyzing our revenue performance a little further, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar was mixed versus our major currencies resulting in a negative FX impact for the quarter of about $5.1 million or about two tenths of 1%. Assuming rates remain at their current levels, FX will be increasingly negative for the balance of the year with an impact of our around minus 2.5% in Q3 and minus 3.5% in Q4, and at current rate's FX will be negative about 0.5% for the full year.
Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions increased revenue by $2.3 million in the quarter or about one tenth of 1%. We are finally cycling on the disposition of the directory advertising business that we completed in the second quarter of 2009. That disposition has been bringing down our acquisition revenue by about 0.5% each quarter.
Driven by both the success of our new business efforts, the stabilizing to improving economic environment and easier year-over-year comparisons, organic revenue was a very strong 6% increasing our revenue by $173 million.
A few areas worthy of note, as I mentioned earlier, we experienced increased revenue across almost every industry sector. The exception was auto, which was down about 1%. However, excluding the loss of Chrysler, the auto category was up over 15%.
Events and sports marketing had another excellent quarter, up over 15% this quarter, benefiting somewhat from the FIFA World Cup, and then field marketing continues to perform well, up almost 15%.
On the negative side, our recruitment marketing business has not yet turned the quarter, although it's improving with revenue down only 11% in the quarter.
As for mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 45% of our revenue and marketing services 55%. As for their respective growth rates, brand advertising increased 4.6% in the quarter, 3.4% being organic and marketing services increased 7.1% in total, organic being up 8.2% or about $129 million.
Within marketing services, CRM was up 5.9% with organic growth of 6.9%. Within the sector a couple of businesses had better than expected quarter, particularly our events and sports marketing and field marketing businesses that I mentioned earlier.
As John said, public relations was up 7.1% in the quarter with organic growth of 5.8%, and specialty communications was up 11.4% with organic growth of 15.7%.
Healthcare, which is the largest area within specialty communications, continued to drive the performance in the category. As I've mentioned, recruit marketing, although beginning to cycle on easier comparisons, was still negative in the quarter.
I also want to point out that in the quarter we’ve adjusted the discipline definitions for several of our operations. As more of our business is being performed on an integrated basis, several of our digital operations and CRM operations are now integrated together into brand advertising. To make prior period amounts more comparable, we have adjusted prior year revenue by discipline groupings as well as the current years. The changes didn't have a meaningful impact on any of the organic growth rates for any of the disciplines.
Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 53.8% U.S. and 46.2% international. In the U.S., revenue increased $112 million or 7.4%. Dispositions net of acquisitions reduced revenue by $12.2 million or about 0.8%, and organic growth was extremely strong at 8.2% adding $124.6 million.
International revenue increased $58 million or about 4.3%. FX decreased revenue by $5.1 million, acquisitions added $14.5 million or about 1.1%, and organic growth was positive at 3.6%.
Internationally, again, driven by improving economic conditions and very successful new business efforts in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Asia regions, we achieved double-digit organic growth in the quarter. In Europe, results continued to be mixed with strong performances in the U.K., France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Russia; and other markets like Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Poland, and the Czech Republic continuing to struggle. However, we experienced sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 in almost every country. So, even in places where the year-over-year growth was negative, it was less negative than in Q1, or in short, we're experiencing increasing stability and improvement across all markets.
Moving to cash flow, our operating cash flow through June, excluding working capital, was strong and our working capital performance continues to be very good. Our primary sources of cash, that is net income plus stock-based compensation and then depreciation and amortization, totaled about $580 million year-to-date. And our primary uses of cash year-to-date have been dividends, which totaled $108 million, CapEx totaled $63 million and acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $76 million. And then share repurchases totaled approximately $472 million net of proceeds we received from the various stock plans.
As the current credit picture chart shows, including changes in working capital, our year-over-year net debt position improved by about $400 million to $1.66 billion. As a result of the reduction in our outstanding debt balances, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 1.3 times, and our interest coverage ratio remained very strong at 12.9 times.
During the quarter, the holders of our 2038 Notes have the ability to put the notes back to us for repurchase. We were able to keep $407 million of the $467 million of the notes outstanding by paying a $50 per bond supplemental interest payment to bondholders. That amounts to about 1.6% annual interest on those notes, and now the next put date for those notes is going to be June of 2013.
And finally, from a liquidity perspective, we finished the quarter in a very strong position, with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling about $3 billion and we had an additional uncommitted group of facilities available totaling $395 million.
With that, I am going to now ask the operator to open the call for questions.

We've already said sort of plus or minus 1% or 2% in a given quarter is a bit of noise. We think the quarter was extremely good. To me the best part was the breadth of the performance. It was really across the industries and across countries we had improvement. That breadth to me is very important. Before in some of the down quarters, we had some isolated areas that were hit very hard that actually pulled the numbers down sort of abnormally. This quarter, we're back to broad-based good solid performance. So I think next quarter is going to be a very good quarter. Whether it's going to be a 6% growth or 5% growth, is probably not that meaningful.

I'd fully expect that number of the government sponsored advertising type of programs, which the industry benefited from under the previous government will be curtailed as part of the already announced austerity measures that the government is taking. We were not - we benefited a little bit from that in the past, but it wasn't a big part of our U.K. business. So, that won't have much of an impact on us. The increase in that, which is supposed to take place January 1st, from 17.5% to 20%, will in all likelihood have some impact, and I would imagine it will have an impact on large purchases. So and this is me guessing more than anything else, if somebody who was planning to buy a car in the next five months will probably buy it before year end as opposed to in January because of those kinds of increases. In terms of packaged goods and normal products that people use everyday, everybody is tightening their belt, but it's too early to see what the impact is going to be from the changes that they've made. And like most governments, there are announcements of what's going to go on and then there is implementation of those announcements and until they've been implemented one doesn't know.

We had strong organic growth this quarter. We had positive organic growth last quarter, we were, I think, just over flat in the fourth quarter if I remember right. That wasn't necessarily because the economy was very different in the U.K. versus some of the other parts of Europe. Frankly I think what really drove it was very strong new business and operating performance of the individual agencies that we have in the marketplace. And frankly, that strong operating performance certainly is a good offset to economic conditions. It's obviously a lot easier on everybody if the economies are strong, but the agencies going out and winning new business and expanding their relationships, they can certainly buck that economic trend.

But in the beginning you have recruitment costs, you have location costs, you have all sorts of things which go on. So oddly enough in this business, when you win something big that in the very beginning of it the margins are the smallest and then sometimes when you lose a piece of business for those last couple of months the margins on the business is the highest, it’s just an anomaly of the industry.

I don't see any real disruptions in those markets in terms of our overall growth and the economies that are there. Europe, we remain very cautious about focusing on new business wins in smaller markets, efficiencies making certain that we innovate quickly in those markets to expand what relationships we do have. And the U.S. is the place where it's moving forward. We've had a very good experience in the first six months of the year. Some of it we have been aided by easier comps, some of it has been real expansion on part of our clients. And we remain optimistic, but cautious because we read the same thing as you do. Our clients are looking to grow their businesses, so they are more focused this year on the top line than probably in the past, where they had to immediately turn most of their focus to cost reduction, and we're working very closely with them on that. So, I probably won't feel as good about the U.S. as I do about some of the emerging and developing markets until we start to see some improvement in unemployment, and as a personal wish, I wish Congress would go on recess and stop doing things, because I think we would all benefit from a quiet period in the United States, but that's a personal wish. So, the clients are truly focused on product innovation for their own products and growth, and that goes across the board in terms of ones that I am in contact with and talking to all the time.

When you just do that math, that's still down 20% from say 2007-ish levels, so I think auto spending frankly, even last year when it was down 30% at least in the U.S., was fairly rational through its unit sales. Now, with the increase I guess that's probably also fairly rational with the unit sales. So, the unit sales are up, but they are not back to 60 million unit level that they were at say in the 2007 timeframe. So, the auto category seems to be fairly rational in it’s spending at least as it relates to our revenues. And then, obviously, we've got to deal with performance within it. So, we lost Chrysler, we won Chevy. Chevy doesn't replace the Chrysler loss. Chrysler was a very large integrated account. We won a piece of the Chevy business, which was, obviously, a great win, but it wasn't what a 25 or 50-year relationship with Chrysler had built up to. So, we're happy with where we're at and the progress that we've made in the auto sector. What was the second question again?

We have some positives I think this quarter with the FIFA World Cup. So, I think that certainly helps the numbers a little bit and those revenues for us really come through the U.S., that's what the company that does that - primary company that does that work is at. I think probably overall maybe some work moves around, around things like FIFA that probably doesn't necessarily impact the full year numbers, but may move a little bit of revenue into the second quarter, that's hard to determine. I think by the end of the fourth quarter we actually started having an up lift, so it's not quite such an easy comp in the U.S. for the fourth quarter. When you get to Europe we actually had a second step down last year at the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, so we haven't yet cycled on the easiest comps there. And I'm not sure we really had a lot of blip, a lot of year-over-year differences or economic changes in places like the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and Asia. So, there's probably not a lot of easy comp analysis to be done there.

We're pleased to announce strong third quarter results to continue the progress we've made during 2010 and shown improvements over the last year.

We're pleased to announce strong third quarter results to continue the progress we've made during 2010 and shown improvements over the last year. In particular, I want to highlight three things today. 
First, organic growth continues to trend positively across our businesses. And globally, we achieved 6.7% growth, making this our strongest quarter of the year. Second, while improvements in the economy are inconsistent from region to region, we have been pleasantly surprised by the continued growth in the United States and renewed strength in Europe's major markets. Third, as we look forward to 2011 and 2012, we've identified a number of actions which will allow us to improve our margins towards our goal of returning to 2007 levels. Additionally, we expect to increase our acquisition activity in emerging markets, form additional alliances with new partners, especially in the areas of emerging technology and divest in several slow growth, low-margin businesses.
All of these positive trends are occurring in the midst of an economic picture that is generally improving but still fragile. In the U.S., we are seeing continued growth in our business as the economy slowly recovers. Following the strong quarter growth in the first and second quarters, our third quarter growth was 8.4%, even after accounting for the loss of the Chrysler business. 
The Chrysler loss globally reduced our organic growth for the quarter by 1.5%. And for those of you who haven't been following it, we have two more quarters to cycle through the impact of Chrysler. Despite that loss, the overall automotive category, which represents about 11% of our business, grew by 8%. 
Also in the U.S., with respect to clients, every client that I speak to seems to have a renewed focus on top line growth. With that said, we're going to continue to remain cautious, wait for their budgets at least until after we understand the implications of the upcoming elections and until the unemployment picture in the U.S. starts to improve.
Outside of the U.S., we're also seeing an improving picture. We continue to see double-digit top line growth in Asia and the Middle East. Growth in Africa and South America remain strong and in line with our expectations. In Europe, we're pleased with the results in the U.K. and France, and then we're also seeing improvement in Germany. In the other countries in Europe, the picture remains mixed as the economies try to recover. 
When turning to disciplines, we also continue to see growth across all of our disciplines. All of the areas showed strong growth in the quarter over the last year. And each discipline showed strong sequential growth, with the exception of our Specialty line of business. While still in line with our third quarter expectations, it was less than the first six months of the year due to more difficult comps.
Our growth is also coming from across the spectrum of industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category, with the exception of travel and entertainment which showed a modest decline for the quarter compared to 2009. 
In general, in looking at organic growth, it seems it continues to be driven by strong retention strategies we have in place and our focus on delivering value to our existing clients. It's also the result of our success in generating new business wins. For the quarter, we generated in excess of $900 million in new business. And we continue to see a pretty robust pipeline, and our agencies continue to work to provide innovative solutions to meet the evolving needs of our clients and prospective client.
On the margin front, our results are slightly better than the third quarter of 2009 and in line with what we've expected. But as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our goal is to restore margins by 2012 to at least our 2007 levels. For the past several quarters, I've talked about our strong balance sheet and the flexibility it gives us to look for strategic and reasonably priced acquisitions. As you know, in mid-September, we announced an increased stake in the Clemenger Group, the largest communications group in Australia and New Zealand. That acquisition, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2011, will give us the incentives and the flexibility to truly leverage the skills, reputation and people of Clemenger to grow our combined businesses. 
Also during the quarter, we increased our ownership in our Media operations in the Middle East and moved to 100% ownership of our Field Marketing operations in China. The combination of our two Field Marketing ventures will give us coverage now in over 100 cities in China. And finally, we disposed the four underperforming businesses that we had in Europe. 
So as we look to the fourth quarter and into 2011 and 2012. We feel confident in how we are positioned. We recognize the continued risk to the economy, but also see real growth opportunities in wide range of areas around the globe. Consistent with our strategic plan, we continue to build our digital skill sets, both inside existing agencies and with new acquisitions. We also continue to look for strongly managed organizations that will help us expand our presence in rapidly growing markets. And finally, as always, we're working to retain, recruit and train our talented management teams and professionals around the world. 
I will now turn the call over to back to Randy, who'll take you through the third quarter numbers."
96161,114463902,80103,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. As John said, the third quarter continued the trend, both of solid year-over-year growth as well as the sequential improvement in revenue that we've experienced each quarter this year. The U.S. and the emerging markets continues to perfor",1109,"Thank you, John. As John said, the third quarter continued the trend, both of solid year-over-year growth as well as the sequential improvement in revenue that we've experienced each quarter this year. The U.S. and the emerging markets continues to perform well, and we're beginning to see even broader signs of stability and improvement in the European markets.
As a result, year-over-year revenue increased 5.5% to just below $3 billion for the quarter. Operating income increased 6.5% to $314 million, and that resulted in an operating income or EBIT margin of 10.5%, up about 10 basis points. In our EBIT A, which we believe is a better metric of our operating performance increased 7.3% to $332 million, and our EBITDA margin was 11.1%, which was up about 20 basis points from last year. 
Our agencies continue to make progress at realigning their costs with revenue. As we progress through the year, our agencies have done a good job of controlling labor costs and general operating expenses and are now beginning to make solid strides at realigning occupancy and infrastructure costs, which are typically much slower to adjust. At the same time, we've continued to invest heavily to extend our capabilities in the emerging markets of Asia, the Middle East and Africa, as well as further enhancing our digital capabilities across disciplines.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $29.8 million, up $900,000 from last year and up about $6 million from Q2. The increase versus Q2 was primarily the result of our issuance of $1 billion of 10-year senior notes in August and the amortization of the sweetener paid on the 2038 notes in July, offset by lower borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and further improvement in our working capital management effort.
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was about 34.1%, up slightly from the 34% last year. Net income for the quarter increased 5.4% to $174.6 million, and diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased 7.5% to $0.57 per share. For reference, the diluted share count for the quarter was 303.5 million shares.
Analyzing our revenue performance a bit further. FX growth. In addition to having fairly significant volatility during the quarter, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar experienced mixed results versus our major currencies. The dollar strengthened against the euro and the pound and weakened versus the yen, the real and the Canadian and Australian dollars. The aggregate result was a negative FX impact for the quarter of $53 million or about 1.9%.
Assuming rates remain at the current levels, FX will continue to be negative in the fourth quarter, but only by about 1%. For the full year, FX would end up marginally positive at about 0.5%.
Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $19.6 million in the quarter or about of 0.07%. That was due primarily to the acquisition of ImpactBBDO in the Middle East at the end of 2009. As John mentioned, we did complete two acquisitions in the quarter and we've also closed several more small transactions already this quarter. We also disposed of four underperforming businesses in the third quarter. In conjunction with our current initiatives to increase operating margins, we are also undertaking a global review of all of our businesses to eliminate any underperforming non-core operations.
Driven by both the success of our new business efforts, the improving economic environment and easier year-over-year comparisons, organic revenue was a very strong 6.7%, increasing our revenue by $190.3 million. It's also worth pointing out that the Chrysler loss had a negative impact on organic growth in the quarter of about 1.5%. We will cycle on the Chrysler loss in the second quarter of next year.
As for our mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 44.5% of our revenue and Marketing Services, 55.5%. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 6.5% in the quarter and Marketing Services was up 6.9%. Within the Marketing Services category, CRM had 7.3% organic growth. And within this sector, field marketing and branding had the best performances, both achieving double-digit growth. Public Relations had organic growth of 5.4% and specialty communications was up 6.8%.
In addition to having positive organic growth across almost every industry we serve, we also had positive organic growth across all of our disciplines. Even our Recruitment Marketing business had positive organic growth in the quarter, which alone maybe a sign of improving economic conditions. 
Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 54% U.S. and 46% international. In the United States, revenue increased $126 million or 8.4%. There were no acquisitions or dispositions affecting our domestic operations during the quarter, so all of the change in the quarter is attributable to organic growth. 
International revenue increased $31 million or about 2.3%. FX decreased revenue by $53 million or 3.9%. Acquisitions added about 1.4%, and organic growth was positive 4.8% or about $64 million. Internationally, we continue to have strong performances in the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. 
In the euro markets, we experienced 1.2% organic growth. This was actually the first quarter of positive organic growth for the region in aggregate since the third quarter of 2008, with almost all of the individual markets again showing quarter-on-quarter sequential improvement. And in the other European markets, the U.K. and Russia both stood out with strong positive performances.
Turning to cash flow, our primary sources of cash, net income or stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization totaled about $835 million year-to-date. And our primary uses of cash during the first nine months have been dividends at about $169 million. Capital expenditures totaled about $98 million. Acquisitions including earn-out payments totaled $142 million and share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share plans, totaled approximately $462 million.
As the current credit picture chart shows, including changes in working capital, our year-over-year net debt position improved by about $275 million to $1.52 billion. As I already mentioned, during the quarter, we completed the issuance of $1 billion of 10-year 4.45% senior notes, with a corresponding increase in our total debt and cash positions. As a result of the new notes, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio is about 1.9x, and our interest coverage ratio remained consistent with last quarter at 12.9x.
And finally from a liquidity perspective, we finished the quarter in a strong position, with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling about $4.2 billion, and we had an additional uncommitted facilities available totaling $581 million. 
And with that, I'll now going to ask the operator to open the call for questions."

We are pleased to announce strong third quarter results that continue the progress we have made during 2010 and show improvements over last year.

We are pleased to announce strong third quarter results that continue the progress we have made during 2010 and show improvements over last year. In particular, I want to highlight three things today. First, organic growth continues to trend positively across our businesses, and globally we achieved 6.7% growth, making this our strongest quarter of the year.
Second, while improvements in the economy are consistent from region to region, we have been pleasantly surprised by the continued growth in the United States and renewed strength in Europe’s major markets. Third, as we look forward to 2011 and 2012, we have identified a number of actions which will allow us to improve our margins towards our goal of returning to 2007 levels.
Additionally, we expect to increase our acquisition activity in emerging markets; form additional alliances with new partners, especially in the areas of emerging technologies; and divest the several slow-growth, low margin businesses. All of these positive trends are occurring in the midst of an economic picture that is generally improving, but still fragile.
In the US, we are seeing continued growth in our business as the economy slowly recovers. Following the strong quarter growth in the first and second quarters, our third quarter growth was 8.4%, even after accounting for the loss of the Chrysler business. The Chrysler loss globally reduced our organic growth for the quarter by 1.5%. And for those that haven’t been following it, we have two more quarters to cycle through the impact of Chrysler. Despite that loss, the overall automobile category, which represents about 11% of our business, grew by 8%.
Also in the US, with respect to clients, every client that I speak to seems to have a renewed focus on top-line growth. With that said, we are going to continue to remain cautious, wait for their budgets at least until after we understand the implications of the upcoming elections and until the unemployment picture in the US starts to improve.
Outside of the US, we are also seeing an improving picture. We continue to see double-digit top-line growth in Asia and the Middle East. Growth in Africa and South American remained strong and in line with our expectations. In Europe, we are pleased with the release in the UK and France and we have also seen improvement in Germany. In the other countries in Europe, the picture remains mixed as the economies try to recover.
When turning to disciplines, we also continue to see growth across all of our discipline. All of the areas showed strong growth in the quarter over last year. And each discipline showed strong sequential quarter with the exception of our specialty line of business. While still in line with our third quarter expectations, it was less than the first six months of the year due to more difficult comps. Our growth is also coming from across the spectrum of industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category with the exception of travel and entertainment, which showed a modest decline for the quarter compared to 2009.
In general, in looking at organic growth, it seems to be continues to be driven by the strong retention strategies we have in place and our focus on delivering value to our existing clients. It is also the result of our success in generating new business wins. For the quarter, we generated in excess of $900 million in new business. And we continue to see a pretty robust pipeline and our agencies continue to work to provide innovative solutions to meet the evolving needs of our clients and prospective clients.
On the margin front, our results are slightly better than the third quarter of 2009 and in line with what we have expected. But as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our goal is to restore our margins by 2012 to at least our 2007 levels. For the past several quarters, I have talked about our strong balance sheet and the flexibility it gives us to look for strategic and reasonably priced acquisitions.
As you know, in mid-September, we announced an increased stake in the Clemenger Group, the largest communications group in Australia and New Zealand. That acquisition, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2011, would give us the incentives and the flexibility to truly leverage the skills, reputation, and people of Clemenger to grow our combined businesses.
Also during the quarter, we increased our ownership in our media operations in the Middle East and moved to a 100% ownership of our field marketing operations in China. The combination of our two field marketing ventures will give us coverage now in over 100 cities in China. Finally, we disposed the four underperforming businesses that we had in Europe.
So, as we look to the fourth quarter and into 2011 and 2012, we feel confident in how we're positioned. We recognize the continued risk to the economy but also see real growth opportunities in a wide range of areas around the globe. Consistent with our strategic plan, we continued to build our digital skill sets, both inside existing agencies and with new acquisitions. We also continue to look for strongly managed organizations that will help us expand our presence in rapidly growing markets. And finally, as always, we are working to retain, recruit and train our talented management teams and professionals around the world.
I will now turn the call back to Randy who will take you through the third quarter numbers.

96161,114463902,80122,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. As John said, the third quarter continued to trend both a solid year-over-year growth as well as a sequential improvement in revenue that we have experienced each quarter this year. The US and the emerging markets continued to perform wel",1115,"Thank you, John. As John said, the third quarter continued to trend both a solid year-over-year growth as well as a sequential improvement in revenue that we have experienced each quarter this year. The US and the emerging markets continued to perform well, and we are beginning to see even broader signs of stability and improvement in the European market.
As a result, year-over-year revenue increased 5.5% to just below $3 billion for the quarter. Operating income increased 6.5% to $314 million, and that resulted in an operating income or EBIT margin of 10.5%, up about 10 basis points. And our EBITA, which we believe is a better metric of our operating performance, increased 7.3% to $332 million, and our EBITA margin was 11.1%, which was up about 20 basis points from last year.
Our agencies continue to make good progress at realigning their cost with revenue. As we’ve progressed through the year, our agencies have done a good job at controlling labor costs and general operating expenses and are now beginning to make solid strides at realigning occupancy and infrastructure costs, which are typically much slower to adjust. At the same time, we have continued to invest heavily to extend our capabilities in the emerging markets of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, as well as further enhancing our digital capabilities across disciplines.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $29.8 million, up $900,000 from last year and up about $6 million from Q2. The increase versus Q2 was primarily the result of our issuance of $1 billion of 10-year senior notes in August and the amortization of the sweetener paid on the 2038 notes in July, offset by lower borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and further improvement in our working capital management effort.
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was about 34.1%, up slightly from the 34% last year. Net income for the quarter increased 5.4% to $174.6 million, and diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased 7.5% to $0.57 per share. For reference, the diluted share count for the quarter was 303.5 million shares.
Analyzing our revenue performance a bit further, FX growth; in addition to having fairly significant volatility during the quarter, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar experienced mixed results versus our major currencies. The dollar strengthened against the euro and the pound, and weakened versus the yen, the real, and the Canadian and Australian dollars. The aggregate result was a negative FX impact for the quarter of $53 million or about 1.9%.
Assuming rates remain at the current levels, FX will continue to be negative in the fourth quarter, but only by about 1%. For the full year, FX would end up marginally positive at about one-half of 1%. Revenue growth from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue by $19.6 million in the quarter or about seven-tenths of 1%. That was due primarily to the acquisition of IMPACT/BBDO in the Middle East at the end of 2009.
As John mentioned, we did complete two acquisitions in the quarter and we’ve also closed several more small transactions already this quarter. We also disposed four underperforming businesses in the third quarter. In conjunction with our current initiatives to increase operating margins, we are also undertaking a global review of all of our businesses to eliminate any underperforming non-core operations.
Driven by both the success of our new business efforts, the improving economic environment, and easier year-over-year comparisons, organic revenue was a very strong 6.7%, increasing our revenue by $190.3 million. It is also worth pointing out that the Chrysler loss had a negative impact on organic growth in the quarter of about 1.5%. We will cycle on the Chrysler loss in the second quarter of next year.
As for mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 44.5% of our revenue and marketing services 55.5%. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 6.5% in the quarter and marketing services was up 6.9%. Within the marketing services category, CRM had 7.3% organic growth, and within this sector, field marketing and branding had the best performances, both achieving double-digit growth.
Public relations had organic growth of 5.4% and specialty communications was up 6.8%. In addition to having positive organic growth across almost every industry we serve, we also had positive organic growth across all of our disciplines. Even our recruitment marketing business had positive organic growth in the quarter, which alone may be a sign of improving economic conditions.
Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 54% US and 46% international. In the United States, revenue increased $126 million or 8.4%. There were no acquisitions or dispositions affecting our domestic operations during the quarter. So, all of the change in the quarter is attributable to organic growth.
International revenue increased $31 million or about 2.3%. FX decreased revenue by $53 million or 3.9%. Acquisitions added about 1.4%, and organic growth was positive 4.8% or about $64 million. Internationally, we continue to have strong performances in the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.
In the euro markets, we experienced 1.2% organic growth. This was actually the first quarter of positive organic growth for the region in aggregate since the third quarter of 2008, with almost all of the individual markets again showing quarter-on-quarter sequential improvement. And the other European markets, the UK and Russia, both stood out with strong positive performances.
Turning to cash flow; our primary sources of cash, net income or stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization totaled about $835 million year-to-date, and our primary uses of cash during the first nine months have been dividends at about $169 million, capital expenditures totaled about $98 million, acquisitions including earn-out payments totaled $142 million, and share repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share plans totaled approximately $462 million.
As the current credit picture chart shows, including changes in working capital, our year-over-year net debt position improved by about $275 million to $1.52 billion. As I already mentioned, during the quarter, we completed the issuance of $1 billion of 10-year 4.45% senior notes, with a corresponding increase in our total debt and cash positions. As a result of the new notes, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio is about 1.9 times, and our interest coverage ratio remained consistent with last quarter at 12.9 times.
And finally, from a liquidity perspective, we finished the quarter in a strong position with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling about $4.2 billion, and we had additional uncommitted facilities available totaling $581 million.
And with that, I’m now going to ask the operator to open the call for questions.

So where we’ve been able to identify non-core low-growth, low-margin businesses, and they are generally in smaller markets, we would like to dispose of those as it improves the quality of our product, it allows our management to focus on the clients and the types of things which are going to generate growth in the future.

We definitely knew what our agreement said. We had forecast of revenues, we had projects that people work, and we're going through the same process, we're going through during every other period. And our new business percentage at the beginning of 2009 wasn't a lot different than our new business percentage and our revenue forecast at the beginning of 2010.

First, organic growth continues to trend positively across our businesses. And globally, we achieved 6.7% growth, making this our strongest quarter of the year. Second, while improvements in the economy are inconsistent from region to region, we have been pleasantly surprised by the continued growth in the United States and renewed strength in Europe's major markets.

Additionally, we expect to increase our acquisition activity in emerging markets, form additional alliances with new partners, especially in the areas of emerging technology and divest in several slow growth, low-margin businesses.
All of these positive trends are occurring in the midst of an economic picture that is generally improving but still fragile. In the U.S., we are seeing continued growth in our business as the economy slowly recovers. Following the strong quarter growth in the first and second quarters, our third quarter growth was 8.4%, even after accounting for the loss of the Chrysler business. 
The Chrysler loss globally reduced our organic growth for the quarter by 1.5%. And for those of you who haven't been following it, we have two more quarters to cycle through the impact of Chrysler. Despite that loss, the overall automobile category, which represents about 11% of our business, grew by 8%. 
Also in the U.S., with respect to clients, every client that I speak to seems to have a renewed focus on top line growth. With that said, we're going to continue to remain cautious, wait for their budgets at least until after we understand the implications of the upcoming elections and until the unemployment picture in the U.S. starts to improve.
Outside of the U.S., we're also seeing an improving picture. We continue to see double-digit top line growth in Asia and the Middle East. Growth in Africa and South America remain strong and in line with our expectations. In Europe, we're pleased with the results in the U.K. and France, and then we're also seeing improvement in Germany. In the other countries in Europe, the picture remains mixed as the economies try to recover. 
When turning to disciplines, we also continue to see growth across all of our disciplines. All of the areas showed strong growth in the quarter over the last year. And each discipline showed strong sequential growth, with the exception of our Specialty line of business. While still in line with our third quarter expectations, it was less than the first six months of the year due to more difficult comps.
Our growth is also coming from across the spectrum of industries we serve. Revenues are up in every significant industry category, with the exception of travel and entertainment which showed a modest decline for the quarter compared to 2009. 
In general, in looking at organic growth, it seems it continues to be driven by strong retention strategies we have in place and our focus on delivering value to our existing clients. It's also the result of our success in generating new business wins. For the quarter, we generated in excess of $900 million in new business. And we continue to see a pretty robust pipeline, and our agencies continue to work to provide innovative solutions to meet the evolving needs of our clients and prospective client.
On the margin front, our results are slightly better than the third quarter of 2009 and in line with what we've expected. But as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our goal is to restore margins by 2012 to at least our 2007 levels. For the past several quarters, I've talked about our strong balance sheet and the flexibility it gives us to look for strategic and reasonably priced acquisitions. As you know, in mid-September, we announced an increased stake in the Clemenger Group, the largest communications group in Australia and New Zealand. That acquisition, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2011, will give us the incentives and the flexibility to truly leverage the skills, reputation and people of Clemenger to grow our combined businesses. 
Also during the quarter, we increased our ownership in our Media operations in the Middle East and moved to 100% ownership of our Field Marketing operations in China. The combination of our two Field Marketing ventures will give us coverage now in over 100 cities in China. And finally, we disposed the four underperforming businesses that we had in Europe. 
So as we look to the fourth quarter and into 2011 and 2012. We feel confident in how we are positioned. We recognize the continued risk to the economy, but also see real growth opportunities in wide range of areas around the globe. Consistent with our strategic plan, we continue to build our digital skill sets, both inside existing agencies and with new acquisitions. We also continue to look for strongly managed organizations that will help us expand our presence in rapidly growing markets. And finally, as always, we're working to retain, recruit and train our talented management teams and professionals around the world. 
I will now turn the call over to back to Randy, who'll take you through the third quarter numbers."
96161,114463902,80140,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. As John said, the third quarter continued the trend, both of solid year-over-year growth as well as the sequential improvement in revenue that we've experienced each quarter this year. The U.S. and the emerging markets continued to perfor",1108,"Thank you, John. As John said, the third quarter continued the trend, both of solid year-over-year growth as well as the sequential improvement in revenue that we've experienced each quarter this year. The U.S. and the emerging markets continued to perform well, and we're beginning to see even broader signs of stability and improvement in the European markets.
As a result, year-over-year revenue increased 5.5% to just below $3 billion for the quarter. Operating income increased 6.5% to $314 million, and that resulted in an operating income or EBIT margin of 10.5%, up about 10 basis points. In our EBITA, which we believe is a better metric of our operating performance increased 7.3% to $332 million, and our EBITA margin was 11.1%, which was up about 20 basis points from last year. 
Our agencies continue to make progress at realigning their costs with revenue. As we progress through the year, our agencies have done a good job at controlling labor costs and general operating expenses and are now beginning to make solid strides at realigning occupancy and infrastructure costs, which are typically much slower to adjust. At the same time, we've continued to invest heavily to extend our capabilities in the emerging markets of Asia, the Middle East and Africa, as well as further enhancing our digital capabilities across disciplines.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $29.8 million, up $900,000 from last year and up about $6 million from Q2. The increase versus Q2 was primarily the result of our issuance of $1 billion of 10-year senior notes in August and the amortization of the sweetener paid on the 2038 notes in July, offset by lower borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and further improvement in our working capital management effort.
On the tax front, our reported tax rate for the quarter was about 34.1%, up slightly from the 34% last year. Net income for the quarter increased 5.4% to $174.6 million, and diluted earnings per share in the quarter increased 7.5% to $0.57 per share. For reference, the diluted share count for the quarter was 303.5 million shares.
Analyzing our revenue performance a bit further. FX growth. In addition to having fairly significant volatility during the quarter, on a year-over-year basis, the dollar experienced mixed results versus our major currencies. The dollar strengthened against the euro and the pound and weakened versus the yen, the real and the Canadian and Australian dollars. The aggregate result was a negative FX impact for the quarter of $53 million or about 1.9%.
Assuming rates remain at the current levels, FX will continue to be negative in the fourth quarter, but only by about 1%. For the full year, FX would end up marginally positive at about 0.5%.
Revenue growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, increased revenue by $19.6 million in the quarter or about 0.7%. That was due primarily to the acquisition of ImpactBBDO in the Middle East at the end of 2009. As John mentioned, we did complete two acquisitions in the quarter, and we've also closed several more small transactions already this quarter. We also disposed of four underperforming businesses in the third quarter. In conjunction with our current initiatives to increase operating margins, we are also undertaking a global review of all of our businesses to eliminate any underperforming non-core operations.
Driven by both the success of our new business efforts, the improving economic environment and easier year-over-year comparisons, organic revenue was a very strong 6.7%, increasing our revenue by $190.3 million. It's also worth pointing out that the Chrysler loss had a negative impact on organic growth in the quarter of about 1.5%. We will cycle on the Chrysler loss in the second quarter of next year.
As for our mix of business, brand advertising accounted for 44.5% of our revenue and Marketing Services, 55.5%. As for their respective organic growth rates, brand advertising was up 6.5% in the quarter and Marketing Services was up 6.9%. Within the Marketing Services category, CRM had 7.3% organic growth. And within this sector, field marketing and branding had the best performances, both achieving double-digit growth. Public Relations had organic growth of 5.4%, and specialty communications was up 6.8%.
In addition to having positive organic growth across almost every industry we serve, we also had positive organic growth across all of our disciplines. Even our Recruitment Marketing business had positive organic growth in the quarter, which alone may be a sign of improving economic conditions. 
Our geographic mix of business in the quarter was 54% U.S. and 46% international. In the United States, revenue increased $126 million or 8.4%. There were no acquisitions or dispositions affecting our domestic operations during the quarter, so all of the change in the quarter is attributable to organic growth. 
International revenue increased $31 million or about 2.3%. FX decreased revenue by $53 million or 3.9%. Acquisitions added about 1.4%, and organic growth was positive 4.8% or about $64 million. Internationally, we continue to have strong performances in the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. 
In the euro markets, we experienced 1.2% organic growth. This was actually the first quarter of positive organic growth for the region in aggregate since the third quarter of 2008, with almost all of the individual markets again showing quarter-on-quarter sequential improvement. And in the other European markets, the U.K. and Russia both stood out with strong positive performances.
Turning to cash flow, our primary sources of cash, net income or stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization totaled about $835 million year-to-date. And our primary uses of cash during the first nine months have been dividends at about $169 million. Capital expenditures totaled about $98 million. Acquisitions including earn-out payments totaled $142 million and share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our share plans, totaled approximately $462 million.
As the current credit picture chart shows, including changes in working capital, our year-over-year net debt position improved by about $275 million to $1.52 billion. As I already mentioned, during the quarter, we completed the issuance of $1 billion of 10-year 4.45% senior notes, with a corresponding increase in our total debt and cash positions. As a result of the new notes, our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio is about 1.9x, and our interest coverage ratio remained consistent with last quarter at 12.9x.
And finally from a liquidity perspective, we finished the quarter in a strong position, with cash and undrawn committed credit facilities totaling about $4.2 billion, and we had an additional uncommitted facilities available totaling $581 million. 
And with that, I'll now going to ask the operator to open the call for questions."

We've thought the pricing and the structure, the availability of capital was almost too good to pass up, 4.45% pretax, so we thought that was very good cost of capital to give us a lot of flexibility going forward. As far as current authorization goes, we've said it now for a while that this year, we were authorized to spend all of our free cash on a combination of dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. I think through the nine months, we are dead on that schedule. We’ll obviously generate a fairly significant amount of cash flow in the fourth quarter. So that's going to definitely give us some availability under the current structure. And as John pointed out, we're at a board meeting, so we'll see what the decisions are for going forward."
