Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 2009 was an interesting year that tested strategic and execution capabilities across the United States oil and gas industry. We believe that Oxy passed last year’s test with an A plus. We achieved solid financial results in a very challenging environment.
In a few minutes, Steve Chazen will provide details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009. But first, I want to mention some highlights and key developments of the past year that we believe are integral to Oxy’s continued success in 2010 and beyond.
Notably, in 2009 we were able to grow our worldwide production 7% year-over-year while not increasing our net debt to capitalization. This brought us to the highest annual production volume in our history 645,000 BOE per day net to Oxy. We expect a similar increase in oil and gas production both this year and next while continuing to focus on operational efficiency. Also noteworthy, during the next two weeks we will be announcing the official results, but also more importantly our 2009 production replacement. The results look very favorable. We expect to announce that the 2009 reserve replacement ratio is about 200%.
In 2009 we maintained our A debt rating across all rating agencies. And we continued to build our pipeline of exciting opportunities, which gives us confidence that our production increases from continuing operations of about 5% to 8% annually over the last five years will again be an achievable target for the next five years.
These results are attributable to consistent execution of our long-term financial strategy, as well as a successful companywide initiative to reduce costs. We aggressively managed our oil and gas production costs in 2009’s volatile commodity price environment, reducing our oil and gas production costs per BOE by 15%, excluding production and property taxes. We ended the year with cash on hand of $1.2 billion, very little debt and one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. During the past 12 months, we capitalized on some key opportunities to strengthen our position and achieve further growth.
In the United States, we announced a significant discovery of oil and gas reserves in Kern County, California, with initial estimated reserves of 150 million to 250 million gross barrels of oil equivalent. Steve will give you an update on its continued production growth in his upcoming comments.
We also made numerous acquisitions of properties adjacent to our key operations in Texas and California, and expanded other areas of our core business. In the chemical segment, we acquired Dow Chemical Company’s calcium chloride operations. Calcium chloride is a premium salt with a variety of beneficial applications, including ice control on roads and sidewalks. Our product line has an approximately 65% market share of the North American market.
There were also significant, positive developments in our Middle East core operations. In Bahrain, we are partnering with Mubadala of Abu Dhabi on a project to redevelop the Bahrain oil and gas Field. Field operations began on December 1, 2009 and we expect to increase oil production from the Bahrain Field to about three times its current level of production, to reach 100,000 barrels of oil per day within seven years, and increase will be of course gradual overtime. And increase also gas production by more than 65% to approximately 2.5 billion cubic feet per day.
It was announced in the fourth quarter that Oxy, partnering with a consortium led by Eni, was awarded a license for development of the Zubair Field in Iraq. Last Friday we announced the signing of the contract with the government of Iraq and we expect Zubair to reach production of approximately 1.2 million barrels a day within the next six years, that’s up from the current level of approximately 200,000 barrels a day.
Solid production growth also continued as a giant Mukhaizna oilfield in south-central Oman, where we have a major steam flood project for enhanced oil recovery. As of year-end 2009, gross daily production was over 10 times higher than the production rate in September 2005, when we took over operations at that time Oxy assumed the operation from another company.
Looking ahead to our 2010 capital expenditures, we plan to increase CapEx approximately 19% from the $3.6 billion spent in 2009 to about $4.3 billion, for projects that will stimulate our continued growth while maintaining our targeted financial returns.
Our 2009 results confirm that Oxy is very well positioned to succeed in the volatile business climate that has presented significant challenges to our industry and to the global economy. We plan to maintain a low-risk, low-leverage profile and a consistent focus on building stockholder value.
With our concentration on core areas, growth in production and reserves, very efficient operations and strong a balance sheets, we are confident in our ability to continue achieving sustained growth and delivering solid profitability.
I’d like to turn the call over to Steve Chazen.

Net income was $938 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $443 million in the fourth quarter of last year. 2009 fourth quarter net income included after-tax non-core charges, mostly consisting of a $115 million impairment of c",1946,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $938 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $443 million in the fourth quarter of last year. 2009 fourth quarter net income included after-tax non-core charges, mostly consisting of a $115 million impairment of certain Argentine producing properties. 2008 fourth quarter included after-tax non-core charges of $514 million for impairments, rig termination costs and plant closures. Core results were $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $957 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Here is the segment breakdown for the fourth quarter.
Oil and gas fourth quarter 2009 segment earnings were $1.6 billion, compared to $339 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Oil and gas core results for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $1.8 billion compared to $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008, after excluding asset impairments in both periods and rig termination costs last year.
The increase in the 2009 fourth quarter earnings was due to higher crude oil prices and sales volumes and lower operating expenses. Occidental’s average realized crude price of 2009 fourth quarter was $69.39 a barrel, an increase of 30% from the $53.52 a barrel last year. Oxy’s domestic realized gas price for the quarter was $4.37 per mcf, compared to $4.67 an mcf in the fourth quarter last year.
Worldwide oil and gas sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 2009 were 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, an increase of nearly 5%, compared to 620,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of last year. Daily production volume increased 23,000 BOE a day from Oman and Bahrain, 6,000 BOE from Argentina and 13,000 BOE from California operations, excluding Long Beach. Partially offsetting these increases were lower Middle East volumes of 7,000 BOE a day caused by higher oil prices affecting our production sharing contracts.
Fourth quarter of 2009 worldwide oil and gas volumes increased 3.5% or 22,000 barrels a day equivalent from the third quarter 2009 sales volumes of 628,000 BOE a day. We began Bahrain production and development activities on December 1, 2009. Argentina volumes increased by 8,000 BOE a day, the third quarter included a 9,000 BOE a day loss due to the strike Santa Cruz province.
California volumes, excluding Long Beach increased by 3,000 BOE a day. Oman volumes increased by 4,000 BOE a day from the Mukhaizna field. Exploration expense was $99 million in the quarter.
Chemical segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $33 million, compared with $127 million in last year's fourth quarter. After excluding plant closure and impairments, the fourth quarter of 2008 core results were $217 million. The fourth quarter 2009 results reflect to continued weakness in most domestic markets, but in particular U.S. housing, durable goods and agricultural sectors.
Midstream segment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $81 million, compared to $171 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in earnings was due to lower margins in the marketing business in 2009 compared to 2008, partially offset by improved NGL margins resulting from lower maintenance expenses, energy costs and property taxes in the gas processing business and higher income from the Dolphin Pipeline. The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the fourth quarter of 2009, in line with our guidance.
Let me now turn to our performance during the twelve months.
Net income was $2.9 billion for the twelve months of 2009, compared with $6.9 billion same period last year, core results for the twelve months were $3.1 billion, compared with $7.3 billion for the full year of 2008. Income for the twelve months of 2009 included $168 million of charges, net of tax and 2008 included $491 million of charges, net of tax, for the items noted on the schedule reconciling net income to core results.
Oil and gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.37 a barrel for twelve months of 2009, a 15% decline from last year's twelve-month costs of $12.13 a barrel.
Taxes, other than on income were $1.77 a barrel for the twelve months of 2009 compared to $2.62 a barrel for all of 2008. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect lower crude oil and gas prices this year. Capital spending for 2009 was $3.6 billion. Capital expenditures by segment were 79% in Oil and Gas, 6% in Chemical and 15% in Midstream. Oil and Gas expenditures were 56% in foreign operations and 44% domestically.
Cash flow from operations for the twelve months of 2009 was $5.8 billion. We used $3.6 billion of the company’s cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $1.8 billion on acquisitions and foreign bonuses. These items amounted to $5.4 billion cash usage. We also used $1.1 billion to pay dividends. These and other net cash flows decreased our $1.8 billion cash balance from the end of last year by $600 million to $1.2 billion at December 31. Fourth quarter free cash flow after capital spending, dividends and taxes but before acquisition activity was about $850 million.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the twelve months were $811.3 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $813.8 million.
Our debt to capitalization ratio was 9%. Our 2009 return on equity was 10.3% with return on capital employed of 9.6%.
We’ll now discuss some factors affecting our 2010 program. Beginning in 2010, we are making three reporting changes which full impact comparability between years. Historically, our production volumes have been reported as a mix of pre-tax and after tax volumes while revenues are reflected only pre-tax sales. This difference is caused by our production sharing contracts in the Middle East and North Africa where production is immediately taken and sold to pay the local income tax. We have treated this as additional revenue but not additional production. To simplify our reporting and to conform with industry practice, our production and our revenues will now be tied. Beginning this year we will refer to production on this more accurate and consistent basis.
To assist you in making comparisons, an historical charge presented in the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules that shows what the previous 5 years and the 2009 quarterly volumes would have been on this basis. All references to growth and volume comparisons will be against these reformatted production volumes. For example, production from last year will be referred to as 714,000 BOE per day rather than 645,000 BOE per day for the year. This change will have no effect on the company's financial statements.
We have combined most of our gas production in the mid-continental regions of the United States into a single business unit called Midcontinent Gas, in order to take advantage of common development methods and production optimization opportunities. This business unit includes the Hugoton field, the Piceance basin as well as the bulk of the Permian basin non-associated gas assets, which had been reported as part of the Permian business unit through the end of 2009. Starting in 2010, these assets will be reported in Midcontinent Gas. As a result, Midcontinent Gas unit's production will be approximately 75% gas and 25% liquids.
Permian's production will go from 84% liquids and 16% gas, to 89% liquids and 11% mostly associated gas. Included in the Investor Relations Supplemental Schedules are charts showing what the previous 5 years and 2009 quarterly sales volumes would have been for these business units if those Permian gas properties had been reported as part of Midcontinent Gas.
Occidental's policy regarding tertiary recovery is to capitalize costs, such as CO2, when they support development of proved reserves and generally expense these costs when they support current production. In 2009, we capitalized approximately 50% of the CO2 injected in the Permian basin. Over the years, as the CO2 program matures, a larger portion of the injected gas supports current production. Beginning in 2010, we will be expensing 100 percent of the CO2 injected, in order to simplify the process of determining the portion that should be capitalized versus expensed. In 2009, $69 million of CO2 costs were capitalized.
As we look ahead in the current quarter we expect oil and gas sales volumes to increase from the reformatted fourth quarter 2009 amount of 722,000 BOE a day to about 730,000 to 740,000 BOE a day at current oil prices. Increases will come from California, Bahrain and Oman. There will be less lifting out of Libya which will not affect production but will affect sales.
With regard to prices, at current market prices, $1.00 change in oil prices impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. The average fourth quarter WTI price was about $76.19 per barrel. Swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $24 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $5.60 per MCF.
Additionally we expect exploration expense to be about $75 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. For the chemical segment, the international markets remain solid. In the United States, we have a competitive advantage against foreign products; however, the housing and construction markets remain weak, which will limit improvement in sales volumes and margins. Chemical earnings for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of $30 million to $50 million. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the first quarter of 2010 to be in the range of 42% to 43% depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income. Our fourth quarter in U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in our Supplemental Schedule.
For all of this year we expect capital spending to be about $4.3 billion. Our capital program will continue to focus on ensuring that our returns remain well above our cost of capital. The additional capital from 2009's $3.6 billion level will be allocated to the Oil and Gas segment. Of this increase, about a quarter each will go to California and Iraq, about 15% to Bahrain and 10% to Midcontinent Gas. As a result, the capital allocation will be approximately 82% in Oil and Gas with the remainder being spent in Midstream and Chemical.
Our Oil and Gas DD&A expense for 2010 should be approximately $10.75 per BOE. Depreciation for the other two segments should be approximately $450 million.
Excluding the Kern County discovery, over the course of a couple of years, we have drilled 39 exploration wells seeking non-traditional hydrocarbon bearing zones in California. Of these wells, 12 are commercial and 10 are currently being evaluated. Occidental holds approximately 1.3 million acres of net fee minerals and leasehold in California, which have been acquired over in the last few years to exploit these opportunities.
At the Kern County discovery we are currently producing approximately 145 million cubic feet of gas a day and 7,500 barrels of liquids a day from 15 wells. This is 5,700 BOE a day higher in the production of 26,000 barrels a day which we disclosed last quarter. Cumulative gross production since the start of production through the end of December 2009 has been 19.4 bcf of gas and 1.5 million barrels of liquids. We expect to drill 8 wells in the first half of the year focusing on oil drilling and exploring the limits of the field. We also expect to add skid mounted gas processing facilities by the second quarter. This will add to our gas production once these facilities are installed.
Copies of the press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings and the Supplemental Schedules are available on our website or through the EDGAR system.
Now we’re ready to take your questions.

The midstream business is really influenced just this year, last year and this year by the Century plant. Once that plant is done with, the midstream capital will plummet. So the percentage in the oil, instead of going from say 400 million - 500 million in the midstream business is probably going to wind up in the $100 million range.

Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core in",1635,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core income were $1.32 per diluted share. 2009 first quarter core income was $0.50 per diluted share. 
For comparability purposes, all of our prior period volumes, as well as volume-based statistics, such as operating costs per barrel are being stated on a pretax basis as we previously discussed with you. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedule for the previous five year and the 2009 quarterly sales volumes presented on a pretax basis.
Here's a segment breakdown for the first quarter: Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.8 billion compared to $553 million for the first quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven by significantly higher commodity prices and higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 83% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 59% from the first quarter of last year.
Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating expenses, largely resulting from fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, as well as higher DD&A rates and the effects of foreign exchange. The year-over-year production was negatively impact by a 38,000 BOE per day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia which were the result of the higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.
Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.8 billion was essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, the 2010 first quarter earnings reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased DD&A rates, the effect of fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, lower total volumes resulting from two fewer days in the first quarter of 2010 and the timing of liftings I will discuss shortly.
Oxy's average realized crude price in 2010 first quarter of $71.88 per barrel, as increase of about 3 1/2% to from $69.39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009. Oxy's domestic average realized gas prices for the quarter was $5.62 per MCF compared with $4.37 per MCF for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the first quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels equivalent per day, an increase of over 3 1/2% compared with 717,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of last year. Daily volumes increased in Bahrain by 2,000 barrels of oil and 126 million cubic feet of gas. Our domestic operations added 5,000 BOE, largely in the Kern County discovery area. Partially offsetting these increases were 4,000 BOE of lower volumes resulted in the Dolphin gas plant maintenance which were shut in for 50% of production for approximately two weeks. 
Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were 726,000 BOE a day compared to 722,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales volume were lower than the production volumes I just mentioned due to timing of liftings of 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent day in the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America, of which 11,000 BOE a day were in Libya. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedules for net sales volumes per day and the net production per day by asset.
Exploration expense was $56 million in the quarter. Oil and Gas cash production cost, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.05 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to last year's 12-month cost of $9.37 a barrel. The increase reflects $0.32 a barrel, higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense a 100% of CO2 injected in beginning of this year and higher field support operations and maintenance cost. 
Taxes, other than on income, were $1.82 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $1.60 for all of 2009. These costs which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude and natural gas prices. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 benefited by $174 million from higher prices, $43 million lower exploration expense, $62 million of lower cash operating cost and G&A expense. These gains were offset by the lower liftings of $102 million, effect of two fewer sales days of $77 million, higher DD&A rates of $69 million and a higher CO2 cost decision to expense of $25 million.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $30 million compared to $33 million fourth quarter of 2009. The first quarter of 2010 results reflect the continued weakness of domestic market, particularly in the housing and construction area sectors, and the significant margin erosion that was experienced through 2009 that carried into first quarter this year. 
Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $94 million compared to $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was due to improved margins in the Marketing and Trading business, partially offset by lower pipeline income from Dolphin resulted from the two-week partial shutdown of the gas plant for maintenance. Phibro's earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were not significant.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the first quarter of 2010. Capital spending for the first quarter of 2010 was about $850 million, capital expenditures by segment were 80% in Oil and Gas, 15% in the Midstream, with the rest in Chemicals. The spending run rate will increase throughout the year as we ramp up in California, Bahrain and Iraq. Our total year forecast has been increased by $200 million to $4.5 billion.
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $2.2 billion. We used $850 million of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $250 million on largely Permian acquisitions -- in Midcontinent acquistions and $50 million on foreign contract commitments. These items amounted to $1.2 billion of cash use. We expect property acquisition activity to continue during this quarter as there are sizeable build up of opportunity. We also used $270 million to pay dividends and $225 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $700 million to $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter. 
The first quarter free cash flow after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $1.1 billion. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for three months of 2010 were 812.1 million. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.5 million.
As you look ahead in the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas sales volumes to be in the range of 750,000 to 760,000 BOEs a day at about current prices, with production slightly above these levels. Production volume increased the second quarter expect to come from the following sources: domestically, the Kern County discovery area expected to show modest improvement during the second quarter. The production continues to be constrained by the lack of additional processing capacity. More significant increase are expected to occur late in the second quarter, when we add the skid amount of gas processing facilities. 
We're continuing with drilling and completed a number of cells. We have sufficient completed wells to fill the entire capacity of the skid mounted processing facilities. Our oil production is also constrained by the lack of gas processing capacity, since these wells also produce natural gas. 
The Midcontinent Gas region where we're currently drilling shallow oil wells is also expected to show production growth. In the Middle East, increases are expected in Oman, Mukhaizna field and in Dolphin. The first quarter plant maintenance downtime is not expected to repeat. 
In Latin America, assuming no labor-related stoppages, increases are expected in Argentina, with the current run rate is about 2,000 BOE a day higher than the first quarter, which was negatively affected by a short strike. The Argentine provincial legislature passed enabling legislation in the first quarter that will allow 10-year extension for hydrocarbon extensions (sic) [concessions]. We are now negotiating specific contract terms of a 10-year extension of our concession.
Regard to prices. The current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. The average first quarter WTI oil price was $78.71 per barrel. 
A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $31 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4 per MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $80 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. 
The Chemical segment demand for caustic soda and vinyls is expected to continue to improve both in the United States and international markets. Improving caustic soda pricing and low natural gas price will contribute to margin improvement. The Chemical segment is expected to provide about $80 million of earnings in the second quarter. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to be about 42% depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income. 
Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule. Copies of the press release announcing our results and the schedules are available at our website, www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR System. 
We will provide additional details on May 19 meeting with the financial community in New York City. We request that you limit your questions today, specifically, the quarter results as opposed to strategic matters such as Iraq, Bahrain and California operations, which will be discussed in detail at the meeting. We're now ready to take your questions."

Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core in",1635,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core income were $1.32 per diluted share. 2009 first quarter core income was $0.50 per diluted share. 
For comparability purposes, all of our prior period volumes, as well as volume-based statistics, such as operating costs per barrel are being stated on a pretax basis as we previously discussed with you. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedule for the previous five year and the 2009 quarterly sales volumes presented on a pretax basis.
Here's a segment breakdown for the first quarter: Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.8 billion compared to $553 million for the first quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven by significantly higher commodity prices and higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 83% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 59% from the first quarter of last year.
Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating expenses, largely resulting from fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, as well as higher DD&A rates and the effects of foreign exchange. The year-over-year production was negatively impact by a 38,000 BOE per day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia which were the result of the higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.
Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.8 billion was essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, the 2010 first quarter earnings reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased DD&A rates, the effect of fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, lower total volumes resulting from two fewer days in the first quarter of 2010 and the timing of liftings I will discuss shortly.
Oxy's average realized crude price in 2010 first quarter of $71.88 per barrel, as increase of about 3 1/2% to from $69.39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009. Oxy's domestic average realized gas prices for the quarter was $5.62 per MCF compared with $4.37 per MCF for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the first quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels equivalent per day, an increase of over 3 1/2% compared with 717,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of last year. Daily volumes increased in Bahrain by 2,000 barrels of oil and 126 million cubic feet of gas. Our domestic operations added 5,000 BOE, largely in the Kern County discovery area. Partially offsetting these increases were 4,000 BOE of lower volumes resulted in the Dolphin gas plant maintenance which were shut in for 50% of production for approximately two weeks. 
Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were 726,000 BOE a day compared to 722,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales volume were lower than the production volumes I just mentioned due to timing of liftings of 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent day in the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America, of which 11,000 BOE a day were in Libya. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedules for net sales volumes per day and the net production per day by asset.
Exploration expense was $56 million in the quarter. Oil and Gas cash production cost, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.05 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to last year's 12-month cost of $9.37 a barrel. The increase reflects $0.32 a barrel, higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense a 100% of CO2 injected in beginning of this year and higher field support operations and maintenance cost. 
Taxes, other than on income, were $1.82 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $1.60 for all of 2009. These costs which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude and natural gas prices. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 benefited by $174 million from higher prices, $43 million lower exploration expense, $62 million of lower cash operating cost and G&A expense. These gains were offset by the lower liftings of $102 million, effect of two fewer sales days of $77 million, higher DD&A rates of $69 million and a higher CO2 cost decision to expense of $25 million.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $30 million compared to $33 million fourth quarter of 2009. The first quarter of 2010 results reflect the continued weakness of domestic market, particularly in the housing and construction area sectors, and the significant margin erosion that was experienced through 2009 that carried into first quarter this year. 
Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $94 million compared to $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was due to improved margins in the Marketing and Trading business, partially offset by lower pipeline income from Dolphin resulted from the two-week partial shutdown of the gas plant for maintenance. Phibro's earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were not significant.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the first quarter of 2010. Capital spending for the first quarter of 2010 was about $850 million, capital expenditures by segment were 80% in Oil and Gas, 15% in the Midstream, with the rest in Chemicals. The spending run rate will increase throughout the year as we ramp up in California, Bahrain and Iraq. Our total year forecast has been increased by $200 million to $4.5 billion.
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $2.2 billion. We used $850 million of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $250 million on largely Permian acquisitions -- in Midcontinent acquistions and $50 million on foreign contract commitments. These items amounted to $1.2 billion of cash use. We expect property acquisition activity to continue during this quarter as there are sizeable build up of opportunity. We also used $270 million to pay dividends and $225 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $700 million to $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter. 
The first quarter free cash flow after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $1.1 billion. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for three months of 2010 were 812.1 million. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.5 million.
As you look ahead in the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas sales volumes to be in the range of 750,000 to 760,000 BOEs a day at about current prices, with production slightly above these levels. Production volume increased the second quarter expect to come from the following sources: domestically, the Kern County discovery area expected to show modest improvement during the second quarter. The production continues to be constrained by the lack of additional processing capacity. More significant increase are expected to occur late in the second quarter, when we add the skid amount of gas processing facilities. 
We're continuing with drilling and completed a number of cells. We have sufficient completed wells to fill the entire capacity of the skid mounted processing facilities. Our oil production is also constrained by the lack of gas processing capacity, since these wells also produce natural gas. 
The Midcontinent Gas region where we're currently drilling shallow oil wells is also expected to show production growth. In the Middle East, increases are expected in Oman, Mukhaizna field and in Dolphin. The first quarter plant maintenance downtime is not expected to repeat. 
In Latin America, assuming no labor-related stoppages, increases are expected in Argentina, with the current run rate is about 2,000 BOE a day higher than the first quarter, which was negatively affected by a short strike. The Argentine provincial legislature passed enabling legislation in the first quarter that will allow 10-year extension for hydrocarbon extensions (sic) [concessions]. We are now negotiating specific contract terms of a 10-year extension of our concession.
Regard to prices. The current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. The average first quarter WTI oil price was $78.71 per barrel. 
A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $31 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4 per MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $80 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. 
The Chemical segment demand for caustic soda and vinyls is expected to continue to improve both in the United States and international markets. Improving caustic soda pricing and low natural gas price will contribute to margin improvement. The Chemical segment is expected to provide about $80 million of earnings in the second quarter. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to be about 42% depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income. 
Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule. Copies of the press release announcing our results and the schedules are available at our website, www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR System. 
We will provide additional details on May 19 meeting with the financial community in New York City. We request that you limit your questions today, specifically, the quarter results as opposed to strategic matters such as Iraq, Bahrain and California operations, which will be discussed in detail at the meeting. We're now ready to take your questions.

Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core in",1635,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core income were $1.32 per diluted share. 2009 first quarter core income was $0.50 per diluted share. 
For comparability purposes, all of our prior period volumes, as well as volume-based statistics, such as operating costs per barrel are being stated on a pretax basis as we previously discussed with you. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedule for the previous five year and the 2009 quarterly sales volumes presented on a pretax basis.
Here's a segment breakdown for the first quarter: Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.8 billion compared to $553 million for the first quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven by significantly higher commodity prices and higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 83% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 59% from the first quarter of last year.
Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating expenses, largely resulting from fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, as well as higher DD&A rates and the effects of foreign exchange. The year-over-year production was negatively impact by a 38,000 BOE per day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia which were the result of the higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.
Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.8 billion was essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, the 2010 first quarter earnings reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased DD&A rates, the effect of fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, lower total volumes resulting from two fewer days in the first quarter of 2010 and the timing of liftings I will discuss shortly.
Oxy's average realized crude price in the 2010 first quarter was $71.88 per barrel, an increase of about 3 1/2% to from $69.39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009. Oxy's domestic average realized gas prices for the quarter was $5.62 per MCF compared with $4.37 per MCF for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the first quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels equivalent per day, an increase of over 3 1/2% compared with 717,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of last year. Daily volumes increased in Bahrain by 2,000 barrels of oil and 126 million cubic feet of gas. Our domestic operations added 5,000 BOE, largely in the Kern County discovery area. Partially offsetting these increases were 4,000 BOE of lower volumes resulted in the Dolphin gas plant maintenance which was shut in for 50% of production for approximately two weeks. 
Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were 726,000 BOE a day compared to 722,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales volume were lower than the production volumes I just mentioned due to timing of liftings of 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America, of which 11,000 BOE a day were in Libya. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedules for net sales volumes per day and the net production per day by asset.
Exploration expense was $56 million in the quarter. Oil and Gas cash production cost, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.05 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to last year's 12-month cost of $9.37 a barrel. The increase reflects $0.32 a barrel, higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense a 100% of CO2 injected in the beginning of this year and higher field support operations and maintenance cost. 
Taxes, other than on income, were $1.82 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $1.60 for all of 2009. These costs which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude and natural gas prices. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 benefited by $174 million from higher prices, $43 million lower exploration expense, $62 million of lower cash operating cost and G&A expense. These gains were offset by the lower liftings of $102 million, effect of two fewer sales days of $77 million, higher DD&A rates of $69 million and a higher CO2 cost being expense of $25 million.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $30 million compared to $33 million fourth quarter of 2009. The first quarter of 2010 results reflect the continued weakness of domestic market, particularly in the housing and construction area sectors, and the significant margin erosion that was experienced through 2009 that carried into first quarter of this year. 
Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $94 million compared to $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was due to improved margins in the Marketing and Trading business, partially offset by lower pipeline income from Dolphin resulted from the two-week partial shutdown of the gas plant for maintenance. Phibro's earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were not significant.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the first quarter of 2010. Capital spending for the first quarter of 2010 was about $850 million, capital expenditures by segment were 80% in Oil and Gas, 15% in the Midstream, with the rest in Chemicals. The spending run rate will increase throughout the year as we ramp up in California, Bahrain and Iraq. Our total year forecast has been increased by $200 million to $4.5 billion.
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $2.2 billion. We used $850 million of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $250 million on largely Midcontinent acquisitions and $50 million on foreign contract commitments. These items amounted to $1.2 billion of cash use. We expect property acquisition activity to continue during this quarter as there are sizeable build up of opportunity. We also used $270 million to pay dividends and $225 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $700 million to $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter. 
The first quarter free cash flow after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $1.1 billion. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for three months of 2010 were 812.1 million. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.5 million.
As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas sales volumes to be in the range of 750,000 to 760,000 BOEs a day at about current prices, with production slightly above these levels. Production volume increase to second quarter expect to come from the following sources: domestically, the Kern County discovery area expected to show modest improvement during the second quarter. The production continues to be constrained by the lack of additional processing capacity. More significant increase are expected to occur late in the second quarter, when we add the skid amount of gas processing facilities. 
We're continuing with drilling and completed a number of cells. We have sufficient completed wells to fill the entire capacity of the skid mounted processing facilities. Our oil production is also constrained by the lack of gas processing capacity, since these wells also produce natural gas. 
The Midcontinent Gas region where we're currently drilling shallow oil wells is also expected to show production growth. In the Middle East, increases are expected in Oman, Mukhaizna field and in Dolphin. The first quarter plant maintenance downtime is not expected to repeat. 
In Latin America, assuming no labor-related stoppages, increases are expected in Argentina, with the current run rate is about 2,000 BOE a day higher than the first quarter, which was negatively affected by a short strike. The Argentine provincial legislature passed enabling legislation in the first quarter that will allow a 10-year extension for hydrocarbon extensions (sic) [concessions]. We are now negotiating specific contract terms of a 10-year extension of our concession.
Regard to prices. The current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. The average first quarter WTI oil price was $78.71 per barrel. 
A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $31 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4 per MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $80 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. 
The Chemical segment demand for caustic soda and vinyls is expected to continue to improve both in the United States and international markets. Improving caustic soda pricing and low natural gas price will contribute to margin improvement. The Chemical segment is expected to provide about $80 million of earnings in the second quarter. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to be about 42% depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income. 
Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule. Copies of the press release announcing our results and the schedules are available at our website, www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR System. 
We will provide additional details on May 19 meeting with the financial community in New York City. We request that you limit your questions today, specifically, the quarter results as opposed to strategic matters such as Iraq, Bahrain and California operations, which will be discussed in detail at the meeting. We're now ready to take your questions."

Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core in",1635,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core income were $1.32 per diluted share. 2009 first quarter core income was $0.50 per diluted share. 
For comparability purposes, all of our prior period volumes, as well as volume-based statistics, such as operating costs per barrel are being stated on a pretax basis as we previously discussed with you. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedule for the previous five year and the 2009 quarterly sales volumes presented on a pretax basis.
Here's a segment breakdown for the first quarter: Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.8 billion compared to $553 million for the first quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven by significantly higher commodity prices and higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 83% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 59% from the first quarter of last year.
Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating expenses, largely resulting from fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, as well as higher DD&A rates and the effects of foreign exchange. The year-over-year production was negatively impact by a 38,000 BOE per day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia which were the result of the higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.
Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.8 billion was essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, the 2010 first quarter earnings reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased DD&A rates, the effect of fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, lower total volumes resulting from two fewer days in the first quarter of 2010 and the timing of liftings I will discuss shortly.
Oxy's average realized crude price in the 2010 first quarter was $71.88 per barrel, an increase of about 3 1/2% to from $69.39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009. Oxy's domestic average realized gas prices for the quarter was $5.62 per MCF compared with $4.37 per MCF for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the first quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels equivalent per day, an increase of over 3 1/2% compared with 717,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of last year. Daily volumes increased in Bahrain by 2,000 barrels of oil and 126 million cubic feet of gas. Our domestic operations added 5,000 BOE, largely in the Kern County discovery area. Partially offsetting these increases were 4,000 BOE of lower volumes resulted in the Dolphin gas plant maintenance which was shut in for 50% of production for approximately two weeks. 
Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were 726,000 BOE a day compared to 722,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales volume were lower than the production volumes I just mentioned due to timing of liftings of 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America, of which 11,000 BOE a day were in Libya. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedules for net sales volumes per day and the net production per day by asset.
Exploration expense was $56 million in the quarter. Oil and Gas cash production cost, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.05 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to last year's 12-month cost of $9.37 a barrel. The increase reflects $0.32 a barrel, higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense a 100% of CO2 injected in the beginning of this year and higher field support operations and maintenance cost. 
Taxes, other than on income, were $1.82 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $1.60 for all of 2009. These costs which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude and natural gas prices. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 benefited by $174 million from higher prices, $43 million lower exploration expense, $62 million of lower cash operating cost and G&A expense. These gains were offset by the lower liftings of $102 million, effect of two fewer sales days of $77 million, higher DD&A rates of $69 million and a higher CO2 cost being expense of $25 million.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $30 million compared to $33 million fourth quarter of 2009. The first quarter of 2010 results reflect the continued weakness of domestic market, particularly in the housing and construction area sectors, and the significant margin erosion that was experienced through 2009 that carried into first quarter of this year. 
Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $94 million compared to $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was due to improved margins in the Marketing and Trading business, partially offset by lower pipeline income from Dolphin resulted from the two-week partial shutdown of the gas plant for maintenance. Phibro's earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were not significant.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the first quarter of 2010. Capital spending for the first quarter of 2010 was about $850 million, capital expenditures by segment were 80% in Oil and Gas, 15% in the Midstream, with the rest in Chemicals. The spending run rate will increase throughout the year as we ramp up in California, Bahrain and Iraq. Our total year forecast has been increased by $200 million to $4.5 billion.
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $2.2 billion. We used $850 million of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $250 million on largely Midcontinent acquisitions and $50 million on foreign contract commitments. These items amounted to $1.2 billion of cash use. We expect property acquisition activity to continue during this quarter as there are sizeable build up of opportunity. We also used $270 million to pay dividends and $225 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $700 million to $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter. 
The first quarter free cash flow after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $1.1 billion. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for three months of 2010 were 812.1 million. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.5 million.
As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas sales volumes to be in the range of 750,000 to 760,000 BOEs a day at about current prices, with production slightly above these levels. Production volume increase to second quarter expect to come from the following sources: domestically, the Kern County discovery area expected to show modest improvement during the second quarter. The production continues to be constrained by the lack of additional processing capacity. More significant increase are expected to occur late in the second quarter, when we add the skid amount of gas processing facilities. 
We're continuing with drilling and completed a number of cells. We have sufficient completed wells to fill the entire capacity of the skid mounted processing facilities. Our oil production is also constrained by the lack of gas processing capacity, since these wells also produce natural gas. 
The Midcontinent Gas region where we're currently drilling shallow oil wells is also expected to show production growth. In the Middle East, increases are expected in Oman, Mukhaizna field and in Dolphin. The first quarter plant maintenance downtime is not expected to repeat. 
In Latin America, assuming no labor-related stoppages, increases are expected in Argentina, with the current run rate is about 2,000 BOE a day higher than the first quarter, which was negatively affected by a short strike. The Argentine provincial legislature passed enabling legislation in the first quarter that will allow a 10-year extension for hydrocarbon extensions (sic) [concessions]. We are now negotiating specific contract terms of a 10-year extension of our concession.
Regard to prices. The current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. The average first quarter WTI oil price was $78.71 per barrel. 
A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $31 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4 per MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $80 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. 
The Chemical segment demand for caustic soda and vinyls is expected to continue to improve both in the United States and international markets. Improving caustic soda pricing and low natural gas price will contribute to margin improvement. The Chemical segment is expected to provide about $80 million of earnings in the second quarter. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to be about 42% depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income. 
Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule. Copies of the press release announcing our results and the schedules are available at our website, www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR System. 
We will provide additional details on May 19 meeting with the financial community in New York City. We request that you limit your questions today, specifically, the quarter results as opposed to strategic matters such as Iraq, Bahrain and California operations, which will be discussed in detail at the meeting. We're now ready to take your questions."

You obviously generated a lot of free cash flow this quarter, and I realized that the CapEx spend was going to be a bit more back-end loaded throughout the year. But as we look at commodity prices and we look at relative levels of free cash flow, I realized you bumped up your CapEx a little bit, but how can we expect you to think about your uses of cash in terms of more aggressive deployment of organic capital versus cash return to shareholders? And also the increase in CapEx, can you tell us were that in any particular area or it's just inflation across the board?"

Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core in",1635,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core income were $1.32 per diluted share. 2009 first quarter core income was $0.50 per diluted share. 
For comparability purposes, all of our prior period volumes, as well as volume-based statistics, such as operating costs per barrel are being stated on a pretax basis as we previously discussed with you. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedule for the previous five year and the 2009 quarterly sales volumes presented on a pretax basis.
Here's a segment breakdown for the first quarter: Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.8 billion compared to $553 million for the first quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven by significantly higher commodity prices and higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 83% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 59% from the first quarter of last year.
Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating expenses, largely resulting from fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, as well as higher DD&A rates and the effects of foreign exchange. The year-over-year production was negatively impact by a 38,000 BOE per day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia which were the result of the higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.
Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.8 billion was essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, the 2010 first quarter earnings reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased DD&A rates, the effect of fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, lower total volumes resulting from two fewer days in the first quarter of 2010 and the timing of liftings I will discuss shortly.
Oxy's average realized crude price in the 2010 first quarter was $71.88 per barrel, an increase of about 3 1/2% to from $69.39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009. Oxy's domestic average realized gas prices for the quarter was $5.62 per MCF compared with $4.37 per MCF for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the first quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels equivalent per day, an increase of over 3 1/2% compared with 717,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of last year. Daily volumes increased in Bahrain by 2,000 barrels of oil and 126 million cubic feet of gas. Our domestic operations added 5,000 BOE, largely in the Kern County discovery area. Partially offsetting these increases were 4,000 BOE of lower volumes resulted in the Dolphin gas plant maintenance which was shut in for 50% of production for approximately two weeks. 
Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were 726,000 BOE a day compared to 722,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales volume were lower than the production volumes I just mentioned due to timing of liftings of 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America, of which 11,000 BOE a day were in Libya. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedules for net sales volumes per day and the net production per day by asset.
Exploration expense was $56 million in the quarter. Oil and Gas cash production cost, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.05 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to last year's 12-month cost of $9.37 a barrel. The increase reflects $0.32 a barrel, higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense a 100% of CO2 injected in the beginning of this year and higher field support operations and maintenance cost. 
Taxes, other than on income, were $1.82 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $1.60 for all of 2009. These costs which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude and natural gas prices. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 benefited by $174 million from higher prices, $43 million lower exploration expense, $62 million of lower cash operating cost and G&A expense. These gains were offset by the lower liftings of $102 million, effect of two fewer sales days of $77 million, higher DD&A rates of $69 million and a higher CO2 cost being expense of $25 million.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $30 million compared to $33 million fourth quarter of 2009. The first quarter of 2010 results reflect the continued weakness of domestic market, particularly in the housing and construction area sectors, and the significant margin erosion that was experienced through 2009 that carried into first quarter of this year. 
Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $94 million compared to $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was due to improved margins in the Marketing and Trading business, partially offset by lower pipeline income from Dolphin resulted from the two-week partial shutdown of the gas plant for maintenance. Phibro's earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were not significant.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the first quarter of 2010. Capital spending for the first quarter of 2010 was about $850 million, capital expenditures by segment were 80% in Oil and Gas, 15% in the Midstream, with the rest in Chemicals. The spending run rate will increase throughout the year as we ramp up in California, Bahrain and Iraq. Our total year forecast has been increased by $200 million to $4.5 billion.
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $2.2 billion. We used $850 million of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $250 million on largely Midcontinent acquisitions and $50 million on foreign contract commitments. These items amounted to $1.2 billion of cash use. We expect property acquisition activity to continue during this quarter as there are sizeable build up of opportunity. We also used $270 million to pay dividends and $225 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $700 million to $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter. 
The first quarter free cash flow after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $1.1 billion. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for three months of 2010 were 812.1 million. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.5 million.
As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas sales volumes to be in the range of 750,000 to 760,000 BOEs a day at about current prices, with production slightly above these levels. Production volume increase to second quarter expect to come from the following sources: domestically, the Kern County discovery area expected to show modest improvement during the second quarter. The production continues to be constrained by the lack of additional processing capacity. More significant increase are expected to occur late in the second quarter, when we add the skid amount of gas processing facilities. 
We're continuing with drilling and completed a number of cells. We have sufficient completed wells to fill the entire capacity of the skid mounted processing facilities. Our oil production is also constrained by the lack of gas processing capacity, since these wells also produce natural gas. 
The Midcontinent Gas region where we're currently drilling shallow oil wells is also expected to show production growth. In the Middle East, increases are expected in Oman, Mukhaizna field and in Dolphin. The first quarter plant maintenance downtime is not expected to repeat. 
In Latin America, assuming no labor-related stoppages, increases are expected in Argentina, with the current run rate is about 2,000 BOE a day higher than the first quarter, which was negatively affected by a short strike. The Argentine provincial legislature passed enabling legislation in the first quarter that will allow a 10-year extension for hydrocarbon extensions (sic) [concessions]. We are now negotiating specific contract terms of a 10-year extension of our concession.
Regard to prices. The current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. The average first quarter WTI oil price was $78.71 per barrel. 
A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $31 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4 per MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $80 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. 
The Chemical segment demand for caustic soda and vinyls is expected to continue to improve both in the United States and international markets. Improving caustic soda pricing and low natural gas price will contribute to margin improvement. The Chemical segment is expected to provide about $80 million of earnings in the second quarter. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to be about 42% depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income. 
Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule. Copies of the press release announcing our results and the schedules are available at our website, www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR System. 
We will provide additional details on May 19 meeting with the financial community in New York City. We request that you limit your questions today, specifically, the quarter results as opposed to strategic matters such as Iraq, Bahrain and California operations, which will be discussed in detail at the meeting. We're now ready to take your questions."

Among the areas we will cover at the May 19 meeting are: one, we will provide you a multi-year production outlook and build up from our asset base, which will provide considerable detail about the continued growth of the company. We will also outline significant and exciting new opportunities in California, including both conventional and unconventional prospects in the states. We would present details on our continuing growth and success in Oxy's existing Middle East production and also insights into new project potential, and we will provide you our anticipated capital spending program over the next five years.
My colleagues and I look forward to meeting with you in three weeks to give you a thorough presentation on these and the numerous other outstanding growth areas of Oxy. I will now turn the call over to Steve Chazen for the details on our first quarter performance."
293286,100480416,60954,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core in",1635,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core income were $1.32 per diluted share. 2009 first quarter core income was $0.50 per diluted share. 
For comparability purposes, all of our prior period volumes, as well as volume-based statistics, such as operating costs per barrel are being stated on a pretax basis as we previously discussed with you. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedule for the previous five year and the 2009 quarterly sales volumes presented on a pretax basis.
Here's a segment breakdown for the first quarter: Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.8 billion compared to $553 million for the first quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven by significantly higher commodity prices and higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 83% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 59% from the first quarter of last year.
Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating expenses, largely resulting from fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, as well as higher DD&A rates and the effects of foreign exchange. The year-over-year production was negatively impact by a 38,000 BOE per day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia which were the result of the higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.
Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.8 billion was essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, the 2010 first quarter earnings reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased DD&A rates, the effect of fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, lower total volumes resulting from two fewer days in the first quarter of 2010 and the timing of liftings I will discuss shortly.
Oxy's average realized crude price in the 2010 first quarter was $71.88 per barrel, an increase of about 3 1/2% to from $69.39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009. Oxy's domestic average realized gas prices for the quarter was $5.62 per MCF compared with $4.37 per MCF for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the first quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels equivalent per day, an increase of over 3 1/2% compared with 717,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of last year. Daily volumes increased in Bahrain by 2,000 barrels of oil and 126 million cubic feet of gas. Our domestic operations added 5,000 BOE, largely in the Kern County discovery area. Partially offsetting these increases were 4,000 BOE of lower volumes resulted in the Dolphin gas plant maintenance which was shut in for 50% of production for approximately two weeks. 
Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were 726,000 BOE a day compared to 722,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales volume were lower than the production volumes I just mentioned due to timing of liftings of 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America, of which 11,000 BOE a day were in Libya. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedules for net sales volumes per day and the net production per day by asset.
Exploration expense was $56 million in the quarter. Oil and Gas cash production cost, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.05 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to last year's 12-month cost of $9.37 a barrel. The increase reflects $0.32 a barrel, higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense a 100% of CO2 injected in the beginning of this year and higher field support operations and maintenance cost. 
Taxes, other than on income, were $1.82 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $1.60 for all of 2009. These costs which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude and natural gas prices. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 benefited by $174 million from higher prices, $43 million lower exploration expense, $62 million of lower cash operating cost and G&A expense. These gains were offset by the lower liftings of $102 million, effect of two fewer sales days of $77 million, higher DD&A rates of $69 million and a higher CO2 cost being expense of $25 million.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $30 million compared to $33 million fourth quarter of 2009. The first quarter of 2010 results reflect the continued weakness of domestic market, particularly in the housing and construction area sectors, and the significant margin erosion that was experienced through 2009 that carried into first quarter of this year. 
Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $94 million compared to $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was due to improved margins in the Marketing and Trading business, partially offset by lower pipeline income from Dolphin resulted from the two-week partial shutdown of the gas plant for maintenance. Phibro's earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were not significant.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the first quarter of 2010. Capital spending for the first quarter of 2010 was about $850 million, capital expenditures by segment were 80% in Oil and Gas, 15% in the Midstream, with the rest in Chemicals. The spending run rate will increase throughout the year as we ramp up in California, Bahrain and Iraq. Our total year forecast has been increased by $200 million to $4.5 billion.
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $2.2 billion. We used $850 million of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $250 million on largely Midcontinent acquisitions and $50 million on foreign contract commitments. These items amounted to $1.2 billion of cash use. We expect property acquisition activity to continue during this quarter as there are sizeable build up of opportunity. We also used $270 million to pay dividends and $225 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $700 million to $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter. 
The first quarter free cash flow after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $1.1 billion. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for three months of 2010 were 812.1 million. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.5 million.
As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas sales volumes to be in the range of 750,000 to 760,000 BOEs a day at about current prices, with production slightly above these levels. Production volume increase to second quarter expect to come from the following sources: domestically, the Kern County discovery area expected to show modest improvement during the second quarter. The production continues to be constrained by the lack of additional processing capacity. More significant increase are expected to occur late in the second quarter, when we add the skid amount of gas processing facilities. 
We're continuing with drilling and completed a number of cells. We have sufficient completed wells to fill the entire capacity of the skid mounted processing facilities. Our oil production is also constrained by the lack of gas processing capacity, since these wells also produce natural gas. 
The Midcontinent Gas region where we're currently drilling shallow oil wells is also expected to show production growth. In the Middle East, increases are expected in Oman, Mukhaizna field and in Dolphin. The first quarter plant maintenance downtime is not expected to repeat. 
In Latin America, assuming no labor-related stoppages, increases are expected in Argentina, with the current run rate is about 2,000 BOE a day higher than the first quarter, which was negatively affected by a short strike. The Argentine provincial legislature passed enabling legislation in the first quarter that will allow a 10-year extension for hydrocarbon extensions (sic) [concessions]. We are now negotiating specific contract terms of a 10-year extension of our concession.
Regard to prices. The current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. The average first quarter WTI oil price was $78.71 per barrel. 
A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $31 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4 per MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $80 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. 
The Chemical segment demand for caustic soda and vinyls is expected to continue to improve both in the United States and international markets. Improving caustic soda pricing and low natural gas price will contribute to margin improvement. The Chemical segment is expected to provide about $80 million of earnings in the second quarter. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to be about 42% depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income. 
Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule. Copies of the press release announcing our results and the schedules are available at our website, www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR System. 
We will provide additional details on May 19 meeting with the financial community in New York City. We request that you limit your questions today, specifically, the quarter results as opposed to strategic matters such as Iraq, Bahrain and California operations, which will be discussed in detail at the meeting. We're now ready to take your questions."

Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core in",1635,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core income were $1.32 per diluted share. 2009 first quarter core income was $0.50 per diluted share. 
For comparability purposes, all of our prior period volumes, as well as volume-based statistics, such as operating costs per barrel are being stated on a pretax basis as we previously discussed with you. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedule for the previous five year and the 2009 quarterly sales volumes presented on a pretax basis.
Here's a segment breakdown for the first quarter: Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.8 billion compared to $553 million for the first quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven by significantly higher commodity prices and higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 83% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 59% from the first quarter of last year.
Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating expenses, largely resulting from fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, as well as higher DD&A rates and the effects of foreign exchange. The year-over-year production was negatively impact by a 38,000 BOE per day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia which were the result of the higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.
Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.8 billion was essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, the 2010 first quarter earnings reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased DD&A rates, the effect of fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, lower total volumes resulting from two fewer days in the first quarter of 2010 and the timing of liftings I will discuss shortly.
Oxy's average realized crude price in the 2010 first quarter was $71.88 per barrel, an increase of about 3 1/2% to from $69.39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009. Oxy's domestic average realized gas prices for the quarter was $5.62 per MCF compared with $4.37 per MCF for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the first quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels equivalent per day, an increase of over 3 1/2% compared with 717,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of last year. Daily volumes increased in Bahrain by 2,000 barrels of oil and 126 million cubic feet of gas. Our domestic operations added 5,000 BOE, largely in the Kern County discovery area. Partially offsetting these increases were 4,000 BOE of lower volumes resulted in the Dolphin gas plant maintenance which was shut in for 50% of production for approximately two weeks. 
Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were 726,000 BOE a day compared to 722,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales volume were lower than the production volumes I just mentioned due to timing of liftings of 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America, of which 11,000 BOE a day were in Libya. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedules for net sales volumes per day and the net production per day by asset.
Exploration expense was $56 million in the quarter. Oil and Gas cash production cost, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.05 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to last year's 12-month cost of $9.37 a barrel. The increase reflects $0.32 a barrel, higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense a 100% of CO2 injected in the beginning of this year and higher field support operations and maintenance cost. 
Taxes, other than on income, were $1.82 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $1.60 for all of 2009. These costs which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude and natural gas prices. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 benefited by $174 million from higher prices, $43 million lower exploration expense, $62 million of lower cash operating cost and G&A expense. These gains were offset by the lower liftings of $102 million, effect of two fewer sales days of $77 million, higher DD&A rates of $69 million and a higher CO2 cost being expense of $25 million.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $30 million compared to $33 million fourth quarter of 2009. The first quarter of 2010 results reflect the continued weakness of domestic market, particularly in the housing and construction area sectors, and the significant margin erosion that was experienced through 2009 that carried into first quarter of this year. 
Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $94 million compared to $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was due to improved margins in the Marketing and Trading business, partially offset by lower pipeline income from Dolphin resulted from the two-week partial shutdown of the gas plant for maintenance. Phibro's earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were not significant.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the first quarter of 2010. Capital spending for the first quarter of 2010 was about $850 million, capital expenditures by segment were 80% in Oil and Gas, 15% in the Midstream, with the rest in Chemicals. The spending run rate will increase throughout the year as we ramp up in California, Bahrain and Iraq. Our total year forecast has been increased by $200 million to $4.5 billion.
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $2.2 billion. We used $850 million of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $250 million on largely Midcontinent acquisitions and $50 million on foreign contract commitments. These items amounted to $1.2 billion of cash use. We expect property acquisition activity to continue during this quarter as there are sizeable build up of opportunity. We also used $270 million to pay dividends and $225 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $700 million to $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter. 
The first quarter free cash flow after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $1.1 billion. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for three months of 2010 were 812.1 million. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.5 million.
As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas sales volumes to be in the range of 750,000 to 760,000 BOEs a day at about current prices, with production slightly above these levels. Production volume increase to second quarter expect to come from the following sources: domestically, the Kern County discovery area expected to show modest improvement during the second quarter. The production continues to be constrained by the lack of additional processing capacity. More significant increase are expected to occur late in the second quarter, when we add the skid amount of gas processing facilities. 
We're continuing with drilling and completed a number of cells. We have sufficient completed wells to fill the entire capacity of the skid mounted processing facilities. Our oil production is also constrained by the lack of gas processing capacity, since these wells also produce natural gas. 
The Midcontinent Gas region where we're currently drilling shallow oil wells is also expected to show production growth. In the Middle East, increases are expected in Oman, Mukhaizna field and in Dolphin. The first quarter plant maintenance downtime is not expected to repeat. 
In Latin America, assuming no labor-related stoppages, increases are expected in Argentina, with the current run rate is about 2,000 BOE a day higher than the first quarter, which was negatively affected by a short strike. The Argentine provincial legislature passed enabling legislation in the first quarter that will allow a 10-year extension for hydrocarbon extensions (sic) [concessions]. We are now negotiating specific contract terms of a 10-year extension of our concession.
Regard to prices. The current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. The average first quarter WTI oil price was $78.71 per barrel. 
A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $31 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4 per MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $80 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. 
The Chemical segment demand for caustic soda and vinyls is expected to continue to improve both in the United States and international markets. Improving caustic soda pricing and low natural gas price will contribute to margin improvement. The Chemical segment is expected to provide about $80 million of earnings in the second quarter. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to be about 42% depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income. 
Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule. Copies of the press release announcing our results and the schedules are available at our website, www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR System. 
We will provide additional details on May 19 meeting with the financial community in New York City. We request that you limit your questions today, specifically, the quarter results as opposed to strategic matters such as Iraq, Bahrain and California operations, which will be discussed in detail at the meeting. We're now ready to take your questions."

Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core in",1635,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 for diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $368 million or $0.45 per diluted share the first quarter of last year. The first quarter of 2010 income from continuing operations and core income were $1.32 per diluted share. 2009 first quarter core income was $0.50 per diluted share. 
For comparability purposes, all of our prior period volumes, as well as volume-based statistics, such as operating costs per barrel are being stated on a pretax basis as we previously discussed with you. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedule for the previous five year and the 2009 quarterly sales volumes presented on a pretax basis.
Here's a segment breakdown for the first quarter: Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings were $1.8 billion compared to $553 million for the first quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven by significantly higher commodity prices and higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 83% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 59% from the first quarter of last year.
Partially offsetting these gains were higher operating expenses, largely resulting from fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, as well as higher DD&A rates and the effects of foreign exchange. The year-over-year production was negatively impact by a 38,000 BOE per day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia which were the result of the higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.
Oil and Gas first quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.8 billion was essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, the 2010 first quarter earnings reflected higher crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased DD&A rates, the effect of fully expensing CO2 cost in 2010, lower total volumes resulting from two fewer days in the first quarter of 2010 and the timing of liftings I will discuss shortly.
Oxy's average realized crude price in the 2010 first quarter was $71.88 per barrel, an increase of about 3 1/2% to from $69.39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2009. Oxy's domestic average realized gas prices for the quarter was $5.62 per MCF compared with $4.37 per MCF for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the first quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels equivalent per day, an increase of over 3 1/2% compared with 717,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of last year. Daily volumes increased in Bahrain by 2,000 barrels of oil and 126 million cubic feet of gas. Our domestic operations added 5,000 BOE, largely in the Kern County discovery area. Partially offsetting these increases were 4,000 BOE of lower volumes resulted in the Dolphin gas plant maintenance which was shut in for 50% of production for approximately two weeks. 
Sales volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were 726,000 BOE a day compared to 722,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales volume were lower than the production volumes I just mentioned due to timing of liftings of 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America, of which 11,000 BOE a day were in Libya. Please see the Investor Relations supplemental schedules for net sales volumes per day and the net production per day by asset.
Exploration expense was $56 million in the quarter. Oil and Gas cash production cost, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.05 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to last year's 12-month cost of $9.37 a barrel. The increase reflects $0.32 a barrel, higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense a 100% of CO2 injected in the beginning of this year and higher field support operations and maintenance cost. 
Taxes, other than on income, were $1.82 a barrel for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $1.60 for all of 2009. These costs which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude and natural gas prices. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 benefited by $174 million from higher prices, $43 million lower exploration expense, $62 million of lower cash operating cost and G&A expense. These gains were offset by the lower liftings of $102 million, effect of two fewer sales days of $77 million, higher DD&A rates of $69 million and a higher CO2 cost being expense of $25 million.
Chemical segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $30 million compared to $33 million fourth quarter of 2009. The first quarter of 2010 results reflect the continued weakness of domestic market, particularly in the housing and construction area sectors, and the significant margin erosion that was experienced through 2009 that carried into first quarter of this year. 
Midstream segment earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $94 million compared to $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was due to improved margins in the Marketing and Trading business, partially offset by lower pipeline income from Dolphin resulted from the two-week partial shutdown of the gas plant for maintenance. Phibro's earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were not significant.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the first quarter of 2010. Capital spending for the first quarter of 2010 was about $850 million, capital expenditures by segment were 80% in Oil and Gas, 15% in the Midstream, with the rest in Chemicals. The spending run rate will increase throughout the year as we ramp up in California, Bahrain and Iraq. Our total year forecast has been increased by $200 million to $4.5 billion.
Cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $2.2 billion. We used $850 million of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $250 million on largely Midcontinent acquisitions and $50 million on foreign contract commitments. These items amounted to $1.2 billion of cash use. We expect property acquisition activity to continue during this quarter as there are sizeable build up of opportunity. We also used $270 million to pay dividends and $225 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $700 million to $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter. 
The first quarter free cash flow after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $1.1 billion. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for three months of 2010 were 812.1 million. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.5 million.
As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas sales volumes to be in the range of 750,000 to 760,000 BOEs a day at about current prices, with production slightly above these levels. Production volume increase to second quarter expect to come from the following sources: domestically, the Kern County discovery area expected to show modest improvement during the second quarter. The production continues to be constrained by the lack of additional processing capacity. More significant increase are expected to occur late in the second quarter, when we add the skid amount of gas processing facilities. 
We're continuing with drilling and completed a number of cells. We have sufficient completed wells to fill the entire capacity of the skid mounted processing facilities. Our oil production is also constrained by the lack of gas processing capacity, since these wells also produce natural gas. 
The Midcontinent Gas region where we're currently drilling shallow oil wells is also expected to show production growth. In the Middle East, increases are expected in Oman, Mukhaizna field and in Dolphin. The first quarter plant maintenance downtime is not expected to repeat. 
In Latin America, assuming no labor-related stoppages, increases are expected in Argentina, with the current run rate is about 2,000 BOE a day higher than the first quarter, which was negatively affected by a short strike. The Argentine provincial legislature passed enabling legislation in the first quarter that will allow a 10-year extension for hydrocarbon extensions (sic) [concessions]. We are now negotiating specific contract terms of a 10-year extension of our concession.
Regard to prices. The current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $36 million. The average first quarter WTI oil price was $78.71 per barrel. 
A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $31 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4 per MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $80 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. 
The Chemical segment demand for caustic soda and vinyls is expected to continue to improve both in the United States and international markets. Improving caustic soda pricing and low natural gas price will contribute to margin improvement. The Chemical segment is expected to provide about $80 million of earnings in the second quarter. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the second quarter to be about 42% depending on the split between domestic and foreign sourced income. 
Our first quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor Relations supplemental schedule. Copies of the press release announcing our results and the schedules are available at our website, www.oxy.com or through the SEC's EDGAR System. 
We will provide additional details on May 19 meeting with the financial community in New York City. We request that you limit your questions today, specifically, the quarter results as opposed to strategic matters such as Iraq, Bahrain and California operations, which will be discussed in detail at the meeting. We're now ready to take your questions."

Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $682 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Here's the segment breakdown for the second quarter. Oil and",1464,"Thank you, Chris. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $682 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Here's the segment breakdown for the second quarter. 
Oil and Gas second quarter 2010 segment earnings were $1.9 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven mostly by higher commodity prices, with additional contributions from higher volumes.  Realized crude oil prices increased 36% in 2010, and domestic natural gas prices improved 46% in the second quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these gains were higher DD&A rates and higher operating expenses, partly resulting from fully expensing CO2 costs in 2010.
Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the second quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 3.5% compared to 717,000 BOE a day in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter of 2010 production was lower than our guidance due primarily to shortfalls in California and adjustments resulting from the mechanics of production sharing contracts in the Middle East. Our production in California continues to be affected by the gas plants' and related infrastructure's inability to process oil and gas that could be produced. Also, this affects the liquids that are associated with this production.
Year-over-year production was negatively impacted by 29,000 BOE a day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia, as a result of higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts. Second quarter 2010 production includes volumes in Bahrain of 3,000 barrels of oil and 161 million cubic feet of gas, and 16,000 BOE a day higher volumes in the Mukhaizna field of Oman. Our domestic operations added 11,000 BOE. Volume gains in the Kern County discovery area were moderated by production declines in Elk Hills, which was caused by gas gathering and processing issues. 
Exploration expense was $73 million in the quarter.
Oil and Gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $9.90 a barrel for the first six months of 2010. The second quarter 2010 per barrel production costs were slightly lower than this figure. Last year's 12-month costs were $9.37 per barrel. The increase reflects $0.30 a barrel higher CO2 costs due to our decision to expense 100% of injected CO2 beginning in 2010 and somewhat higher field support operations and maintenance costs. 
Taxes, other than on income, were $1.80 a barrel for the first six months of 2010, compared to $1.60 per barrel for all of 2009. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of the higher crude and gas prices this year.
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were $108 million. Second quarter results reflect improvement from the first quarter in 2010 in margins and volumes across most product lines. 
Midstream segment earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were $13 million, compared to $63 million last year. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to a pre-tax $104 million, $0.07 per share after taxes, loss at Phibro, the bulk of which resulted from marking its quarter end open positions to market.
This was partially offset by higher margins in the marketing, gas processing and pipeline business. The worldwide effective tax rate was 43% for the second quarter of 2010. 
Now let us turn briefly to our first six months results. The net income was $2.1 billion or $2.61 per diluted share for the first six months of 2010, compared to $1.1 billion or $1.29 per diluted share for the first six months of 2009. Capital spending for the second quarter of 2010 was about $865 million and $1.7 billion for the first six months. 
Year-to-date capital expenditures by segment were 81% in Oil and Gas, 13% Midstream and the rest in Chemicals. Our total year capital expenditures is estimated to be about $4.5 billion. The capital spending rate will increase in the second half of the year largely from Iraq, Bahrain and California. 
Cash flow from operations for the first six months of 2010 was $4.3 billion. We used $1.7 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $460 million on acquisitions and $300 million on foreign contracts. These investing cash flow uses amounted to $2.5 billion.  We also used $540 million to pay dividends, and $300 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $1.1 billion to $2.3 billion at June 30. The first six months' free cash flow, after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements, was about $2.1 billion.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the six months of 2010 were $812.3 million, and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding was $813.7 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 8% at the end of the second quarter. 
As we look ahead to the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas production and sales volumes to be in the range of 750 to 760 [million] BOE a day at about current oil prices. Volume increases in the third quarter are expected to come from California, Oman's Mukhaizna field and Dolphin. 
With regard to prices, at current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $37 million. The average second quarter WTI oil price was $78.03 per barrel. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices have a $30 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4.80 an MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $90 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. 
For the Chemical segment, modest volume and margin improvement is expected over second quarter levels for chlor-alkali and vinyl products. The Chemical segment is expected to provide earnings for the third quarter of about $125 million. While the domestic market continues to be lackluster, export volumes are up about 13% compared to 2009. Chlorine exports are averaging about 42% of total production.
We have successfully renegotiated and extended our hydrocarbon concessions in the Santa Cruz province of Argentina, increasing our oil and gas reserves from 129 million barrels to 202 million barrels. The current quarter DD&A expense reflects the resulting decrease in the DD&A rate. 
We have recently renegotiated a number of asset acquisitions in the Oil and Gas business that in aggregate would be about $1.5 billion. We expect these acquisitions are mainly from private individuals, largely in the gassier parts of the Permian basin where there've been several much more expensive deals recently announced. 
When the acquisitions are concluded, they will add to production mostly in the Midcontinent business unit, which include these parts of the Permian basin. Virtually all of the improvement in the production rate will be in subsequent years. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the third quarter to be about 42%. Our second quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in our supplemental schedules.
During the first half of the year, we drilled six conventional exploration and extension wells in California. Of these, five were outside of the Kern County discovery area. Two of these new areas are currently being tested. In the second half of the year, we are planning to drill two conventional exploration wells in the Kern County discovery area and one exploration well outside this area. We also drilled seven unconventional exploration wells in the first half of the year, of which two were successful and two were being tested. We plan to drill 15 additional unconventional exploration wells in the second half. 
In addition, we have drilled 10 conventional exploitation wells in the Kern County discovery area in the first half of the year, and plan to drill 23 more in the second half. We've also drilled 10 unconventional exploitation wells in California in the first half, with 25 more expected to be drilled in the second half of the year. 
This skid-mounted gas processing plant came online at the end of the second quarter. The existing main processing plant related to infrastructure continue to have operating issues, which are constraining Elk Hills' production. We are in the process of upgrading the infrastructure to alleviate these issues until a new gas plant comes online. We believe these upgrades will be in place by the end of the third quarter.

Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $682 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Here's the segment breakdown for the second quarter. Oil and",1463,"Thank you, Chris. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $682 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Here's the segment breakdown for the second quarter. 
Oil and Gas second quarter 2010 segment earnings were $1.9 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven mostly by higher commodity prices, with additional contributions from higher volumes.  Realized crude oil prices increased 36% in 2010, and domestic natural gas prices improved 46% in the second quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these gains were higher DD&A rates and higher operating expenses, partly resulting from fully expensing CO2 costs in 2010.
Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the second quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 3.5% compared to 717,000 BOE a day in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter of 2010 production was lower than our guidance due primarily to shortfalls in California and adjustments resulting from the mechanics of production sharing contracts in the Middle East. Our production in California continues to be affected by the gas plants' and related infrastructure's inability to process oil and gas that could be produced. Also, this affects the liquids that are associated with this production.
Year-over-year production was negatively impacted by 29,000 BOE a day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia, as a result of higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts. Second quarter 2010 production includes volumes in Bahrain of 3,000 barrels of oil and 161 million cubic feet of gas, and 16,000 BOE a day higher volumes in the Mukhaizna field of Oman. Our domestic operations added 11,000 BOE. Volume gains in the Kern County discovery area were moderated by production declines in Elk Hills, which was caused by gas gathering and processing issues. 
Exploration expense was $73 million in the quarter.
Oil and Gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $9.90 a barrel for the first six months of 2010. The second quarter 2010 per barrel production costs were slightly lower than this figure. Last year's 12-month costs were $9.37 per barrel. The increase reflects $0.30 a barrel higher CO2 costs due to our decision to expense 100% of injected CO2 beginning in 2010 and somewhat higher field support operations and maintenance costs. 
Taxes, other than income, were $1.80 a barrel for the first six months of 2010, compared to $1.60 per barrel for all of 2009. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of the higher crude and gas prices this year.
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were $108 million. Second quarter results reflect improvement from the first quarter in 2010 in margins and volumes across most product lines. 
Midstream segment earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were $13 million, compared to $63 million last year. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to a pre-tax $104 million, $0.07 per share after taxes, loss at Phibro, the bulk of which resulted from marking its quarter end open positions to market.
This was partially offset by higher margins in the marketing, gas processing and pipeline business. The worldwide effective tax rate was 43% for the second quarter of 2010. 
Now let us turn briefly to our first six months results. The net income was $2.1 billion or $2.61 per diluted share for the first six months of 2010, compared to $1.1 billion or $1.29 per diluted share for the first six months of 2009. Capital spending for the second quarter of 2010 was about $865 million and $1.7 billion for the first six months. 
Year-to-date capital expenditures by segment were 81% in Oil and Gas, 13% Midstream and the rest in Chemicals. Our total year capital expenditures is estimated to be about $4.5 billion. The capital spending rate will increase in the second half of the year largely from Iraq, Bahrain and California. 
Cash flow from operations for the first six months of 2010 was $4.3 billion. We used $1.7 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $460 million on acquisitions and $300 million on foreign contracts. These investing cash flow uses amounted to $2.5 billion.  We also used $540 million to pay dividends, and $300 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $1.1 billion to $2.3 billion at June 30. The first six months' free cash flow, after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements, was about $2.1 billion.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the six months of 2010 were $812.3 million, and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding was $813.7 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 8% at the end of the second quarter. 
As we look ahead to the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas production and sales volumes to be in the range of 750 to 760 [million] BOE a day at about current oil prices. Volume increases in the third quarter are expected to come from California, Oman's Mukhaizna field and Dolphin. 
With regard to prices, at current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $37 million. The average second quarter WTI oil price was $78.03 per barrel. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices have a $30 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4.80 an MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $90 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. 
For the Chemical segment, modest volume and margin improvement is expected over second quarter levels for chlor-alkali and vinyl products. The Chemical segment is expected to provide earnings for the third quarter of about $125 million. While the domestic market continues to be lackluster, export volumes are up about 13% compared to 2009. Chlorine exports are averaging about 42% of total production.
We have successfully renegotiated and extended our hydrocarbon concessions in the Santa Cruz province of Argentina, increasing our oil and gas reserves from 129 million barrels to 202 million barrels. The current quarter DD&A expense reflects the resulting decrease in the DD&A rate. 
We have recently negotiated a number of asset acquisitions in the Oil and Gas business that in aggregate would be about $1.5 billion. We expect these acquisitions are mainly from private individuals, largely in the gassier parts of the Permian basin where there've been several much more expensive deals recently announced. 
When the acquisitions are concluded, they will add to production mostly in the Midcontinent business unit, which include these parts of the Permian basin. Virtually all of the improvement in the production rate will be in subsequent years. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the third quarter to be about 42%. Our second quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in our supplemental schedules.
During the first half of the year, we drilled six conventional exploration and extension wells in California. Of these, five were outside of the Kern County discovery area. Two of these new areas are currently being tested. In the second half of the year, we are planning to drill two conventional exploration wells in the Kern County discovery area and one exploration well outside this area. We also drilled seven unconventional exploration wells in the first half of the year, of which two were successful and two were being tested. We plan to drill 15 additional unconventional exploration wells in the second half. 
In addition, we have drilled 10 conventional exploitation wells in the Kern County discovery area in the first half of the year, and plan to drill 23 more in the second half. We've also drilled 10 unconventional exploitation wells in California in the first half, with 25 more expected to be drilled in the second half of the year. 
This skid-mounted gas processing plant came online at the end of the second quarter. The existing main processing plant related to infrastructure continue to have operating issues, which are constraining Elk Hills' production. We are in the process of upgrading the infrastructure to alleviate these issues until a new gas plant comes online. We believe these upgrades will be in place by the end of the third quarter. Construction in the new gas plant has started and is expected to come online in early 2012.

Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $682 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Here's the segment breakdown for the second quarter. Oil and",1463,"Thank you, Chris. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $682 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Here's the segment breakdown for the second quarter. 
Oil and Gas second quarter 2010 segment earnings were $1.9 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 was driven mostly by higher commodity prices, with additional contributions from higher volumes.  Realized crude oil prices increased 36% in 2010, and domestic natural gas prices improved 46% in the second quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these gains were higher DD&A rates and higher operating expenses, partly resulting from fully expensing CO2 costs in 2010.
Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the second quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 3.5% compared to 717,000 BOE a day in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter of 2010 production was lower than our guidance due primarily to shortfalls in California and adjustments resulting from the mechanics of production sharing contracts in the Middle East. Our production in California continues to be affected by the gas plants' and related infrastructure's inability to process oil and gas that could be produced. Also, this affects the liquids that are associated with this production.
Year-over-year production was negatively impacted by 29,000 BOE a day in the Middle East/North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia, as a result of higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts. Second quarter 2010 production includes volumes in Bahrain of 3,000 barrels of oil and 161 million cubic feet of gas, and 16,000 BOE a day higher volumes in the Mukhaizna field of Oman. Our domestic operations added 11,000 BOE. Volume gains in the Kern County discovery area were moderated by production declines in Elk Hills, which was caused by gas gathering and processing issues. 
Exploration expense was $73 million in the quarter.
Oil and Gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $9.90 a barrel for the first six months of 2010. The second quarter 2010 per barrel production costs were slightly lower than this figure. Last year's 12-month costs were $9.37 per barrel. The increase reflects $0.30 a barrel higher CO2 costs due to our decision to expense 100% of injected CO2 beginning in 2010 and somewhat higher field support operations and maintenance costs. 
Taxes, other than income, were $1.80 a barrel for the first six months of 2010, compared to $1.60 per barrel for all of 2009. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of the higher crude and gas prices this year.
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were $108 million. Second quarter results reflect improvement from the first quarter in 2010 in margins and volumes across most product lines. 
Midstream segment earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were $13 million, compared to $63 million last year. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to a pre-tax $104 million, $0.07 per share after taxes, loss at Phibro, the bulk of which resulted from marking its quarter end open positions to market.
This was partially offset by higher margins in the marketing, gas processing and pipeline business. The worldwide effective tax rate was 43% for the second quarter of 2010. 
Now let us turn briefly to our first six months results. The net income was $2.1 billion or $2.61 per diluted share for the first six months of 2010, compared to $1.1 billion or $1.29 per diluted share for the first six months of 2009. Capital spending for the second quarter of 2010 was about $865 million and $1.7 billion for the first six months. 
Year-to-date capital expenditures by segment were 81% in Oil and Gas, 13% Midstream and the rest in Chemicals. Our total year capital expenditures is estimated to be about $4.5 billion. The capital spending rate will increase in the second half of the year largely from Iraq, Bahrain and California. 
Cash flow from operations for the first six months of 2010 was $4.3 billion. We used $1.7 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $460 million on acquisitions and $300 million on foreign contracts. These investing cash flow uses amounted to $2.5 billion.  We also used $540 million to pay dividends, and $300 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $1.1 billion to $2.3 billion at June 30. The first six months' free cash flow, after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition activity and debt retirements, was about $2.1 billion.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the six months of 2010 were $812.3 million, and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding was $813.7 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 8% at the end of the second quarter. 
As we look ahead to the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas production and sales volumes to be in the range of 750 to 760 [million] BOE a day at about current oil prices. Volume increases in the third quarter are expected to come from California, Oman's Mukhaizna field and Dolphin. 
With regard to prices, at current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $37 million. The average second quarter WTI oil price was $78.03 per barrel. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices have a $30 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4.80 an MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $90 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. 
For the Chemical segment, modest volume and margin improvement is expected over second quarter levels for chlor-alkali and vinyl products. The Chemical segment is expected to provide earnings for the third quarter of about $125 million. While the domestic market continues to be lackluster, export volumes are up about 13% compared to 2009. Chlorine exports are averaging about 42% of total production.
We have successfully renegotiated and extended our hydrocarbon concessions in the Santa Cruz province of Argentina, increasing our oil and gas reserves from 129 million barrels to 202 million barrels. The current quarter DD&A expense reflects the resulting decrease in the DD&A rate. 
We have recently negotiated a number of asset acquisitions in the Oil and Gas business that in aggregate would be about $1.5 billion. We expect these acquisitions are mainly from private individuals, largely in the gassier parts of the Permian basin where there've been several much more expensive deals recently announced. 
When the acquisitions are concluded, they will add to production mostly in the Midcontinent business unit, which include these parts of the Permian basin. Virtually all of the improvement in the production rate will be in subsequent years. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the third quarter to be about 42%. Our second quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in our supplemental schedules.
During the first half of the year, we drilled six conventional exploration and extension wells in California. Of these, five were outside of the Kern County discovery area. Two of these new areas are currently being tested. In the second half of the year, we are planning to drill two conventional exploration wells in the Kern County discovery area and one exploration well outside this area. We also drilled seven unconventional exploration wells in the first half of the year, of which two were successful and two were being tested. We plan to drill 15 additional unconventional exploration wells in the second half. 
In addition, we have drilled 10 conventional exploitation wells in the Kern County discovery area in the first half of the year, and plan to drill 23 more in the second half. We've also drilled 10 unconventional exploitation wells in California in the first half, with 25 more expected to be drilled in the second half of the year. 
This skid-mounted gas processing plant came online at the end of the second quarter. The existing main processing plant related to infrastructure continue to have operating issues, which are constraining Elk Hills' production. We are in the process of upgrading the infrastructure to alleviate these issues until a new gas plant comes online. We believe these upgrades will be in place by the end of the third quarter. Construction in the new gas plant has started and is expected to come online in early 2012.

I'm very enthusiastic about the new management structure we announced last week. Both for myself and for Oxy. The new structure will assure Oxy of continuity of a winning team, both in terms of our experience and effective management and in terms of our emphasis on a highly successful business strategy. To recap the new structure, I informed our board of directors of my desire to relinquish the position of Chief Executive Officer, effective at the May 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, and to continue as full-time executive chair.
I recommended to the board that Steve Chazen replace me as CEO. The board agreed with this new structure. Steve, he's a proven leader, he has been an integral member of our senior management team for many years. Steve joined Oxy and my team in 1994 as Executive VP of Corporate Development. He became Chief Financial Officer in 1999, President in 2007 and Chief Operating Officer earlier this year. He was also elected to the board of directors in 2010.  He has made, and will continue to make, significant contributions to the Occidental's ongoing success and development. This is a carefully developed and long anticipated senior management transition. Steve and I have had an extraordinarily productive partnership for many years. Clearly, maintaining this partnership is in the best interest of Oxy and its stockholders. And I look forward to continuing this partnership in future years.
During the 20 years that I have been CEO, our management team has transformed Oxy from a conglomerate of unrelated business entities with a market capitalization of $5 billion into the fourth largest oil and gas company in the United States with a market capitalization today of $67 billion.  Oxy has led its proxy peer group in total stockholder returns. With cumulative returns of 76% over the past three years, 204% over the past five years and 870% over the past 10 years.  I'm very proud of these accomplishments.
Our management team is strong and cohesive and would be very willing and able under this new structure to take Oxy to new heights in performance and excellence. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen for the details on our third quarter performance."
293286,114139221,80233,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.2 billion or $1.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $927 million or $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations, $1.47 per diluted share in the third q",1814,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.2 billion or $1.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $927 million or $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations, $1.47 per diluted share in the third quarter this year compared to $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year. Here is the segment breakdown for the third quarter. 
Oil and Gas third quarter 2010 segment earnings were $1.7 billion compared to $1.5 billion for third quarter of last year. The improvement in 2010 was driven mostly by higher commodity prices, additional contributions from higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 13% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 38% from the third quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these gains were higher DD&A rates and higher operating expenses, partly resulting from fully expensing CO2 costs in 2010. 
Production for the third quarter of 2010 were 751,000 BOE a day, a 6.5% increase compared to 705,000 BOE a day, the third quarter of 2009. Most of the year-over-year production increases came from the Middle East, North Africa with smaller increases in Argentina and United States. The worldwide oil and gas sales volume for third quarter of 2010 were 749,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of over 6.5% compared to the 702,000 BOE a day in the third quarter of last year. Sales volume differs from production volumes due mainly to the timing of a lifting in Argentina.  Exploration expense was $83 million in the quarter. 
Oil and Gas cash production costs excluding production of property taxes were $10.25 a barrel for the first nine months of 2010. Last year's 12 months costs were $9.37 a barrel. The nine-month increase reflects a $0.35 a barrel higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense of 100% of injected CO2 beginning in 2010 and higher field support operations workovers and maintenance costs, and higher domestic workover activities mostly in the Permian.
Taxes other than on income was $1.76 per barrel for the nine months of 2010 compared with $1.60 per barrel for all of 2009. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude oil and natural gas prices in 2010.
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $189 million compared with $108 million in the second quarter of 2010. Third quarter results reflect improvement from second quarter in 2010, both volumes and margins across most product lines. Export markets have improved more rapidly than domestic markets due in part to favorable feedstock costs in North America versus Europe and Asia.
Midstream segment earnings for third quarter of 2010 were $163 million compared to $77 million in the third quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was mainly due to trading and marketing income and higher margins in the Pipeline business. The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the third quarter of 2010. Let's now turn to our performance for the first nine months of this year.
Net income was $3.3 billion or $4.07 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2010 compared with $2 billion or $2.43 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2009. Core income was $3.3 billion or $4.09 per diluted share for the first nine months of this year compared with $2 billion or $2.48 per diluted share for the year-to-date 2009 period.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the nine months of 2009 were 812.4 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.8 million. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 7% at the end of the third quarter.
Capital spending for the third quarter of 2010 was about $1 billion and $2.8 billion for the first nine months. Year-to-date, capital expenditures by segment were 82% in Oil and Gas, 13% in Midstream with the remainder in Chemicals. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months of 2010 was $6.6 billion. We used $2.8 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $1.6 billion on acquisitions and $340 million on foreign contracts. These investing cash flow uses amounted to $4.7 billion. We also used $850 million to pay dividends and $310 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $900 million to $2.1 billion at September 30. The first nine months free cash flow, after capital spending and dividends, before acquisition activity and debt retirements, was about $3.1 billion.
Our acquisition costs for the third quarter were $1.1 billion and we expect to spend about $300 million in the first part of the fourth quarter. Through these acquisitions, we expect to add about 10,000 BOE a day in average production in the fourth quarter. These acquisitions have a run rate of about 12,000 BOE a day. Of this production, about a third will be liquids and the balance will be natural gas. Over the medium term, we expect these acquisitions to add at least 25,000 BOE a day of production. This increase will come largely from oil production.
In addition to these acquisitions, we expect to add an additional 380,000 acres to our California  acreage position, and an interest in 100,000 acres in other producing areas. Our California acreage will now reach 1.6 million acres, an overwhelming portion of which consists of mineral interests.  We currently don't contemplate any more sizable acquisitions of acreage in California.
Our total year capital spending is expected to be about $4.4 billion. The capital spending rate will increase in the fourth quarter of the year, largely in our domestic operations and in Iraq. At the beginning of the year, we were running 11 development rigs in California and five rigs in the Permian. We're currently running 16 rigs in California and nine in the Permian. And expect our year end exit rig count to reach 19 rigs in California and 14 in the Permian. Next year, we anticipate working 21 rigs in California and 15 rigs in the Permian. In the current environment, we are cautious about natural gas drilling and may re-evaluate our 2011 U.S. natural gas drilling program.
In the Permian, we are currently running 94 workover rigs compared with the 57 rigs we had at the beginning of the year. We are currently expecting to be operating 110 rigs by the end of this year. Of course, the workover expenditures are expensed as opposed to being capitalized depending on their nature. Our operating costs have recently increased due to higher workover activity to $10.94 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 and further increases are expected in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect oil and gas production and sales volumes to be in the range of 760,000 to 770,000 BOE a day at third quarter average oil prices. Volume increases in the fourth quarter are expected to come from California, Oman's Mukhaizna field and the acquisitions. Increase in oil prices of $5 a barrel from the third quarter 2010 levels would result in about 4,000 BOE a day of lower production due to the impact of higher prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.
Based on the development plan at the Zubair field in Iraq, we believe that we should have a small amount of production in the fourth quarter. We do not expect to report any sales from Iraq until the first quarter of 2011. Field development plan is on target for us to meet next year's production targets.
With regard to prices. At current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $39 million. Average third quarter WTI oil price was $76.20 per barrel. For gas, a swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $27 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes.  Approximately, the current NYMEX gas price is under $3.90 per MCF. 
Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $110 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. Chemical segment is expected to provide earnings for the quarter of about $100 million to $120 million. The fourth quarter is usually the weakest for the business. Expect the continued margin improvement will be offset by the typical seasonal slowdown in the highs in construction, bleach and fertilizer markets.  We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the fourth quarter to be about 41%. Our third quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included on our supplemental schedules.
The Century Plant in the Permian has just started operations and will be providing additional CO2 to support growth in our Permian operations. We expect that the plant will yield about 180 million cubic feet a day of CO2 next year to support our Permian EOR operations. We are in the process of contracting additional CO2 from other sources and we use penalty payments due from the operator for underproduction to support these activities. We expect to have sufficient CO2 to meet the needs of our previously disclosed expansion of flooding activities.
Turning now to California, in the first nine months of the year, we drilled seven conventional exploration extension wells in California. Of these, five were outside the Kern County discovery area. Two of these wells are currently being tested. We also drilled 12 unconventional exploration wells in the first nine months of this year of which three are successful and five are being tested.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to drill 10 exploration wells of which two will be conventional and the remaining eight wells, non-conventional. In the fourth quarter, the exploration program will target smaller prospects until permits are obtained for the larger ones.
We've also drilled 13 conventional exploitation wells in the Kern County discovery area and 15 unconventional exploitation wells in California in the first nine months. Due to delays in permitting, we've reduced our exploitation plans for the second half of the year by about 10 wells.
We're continuing to have problems with our gas processing and gathering infrastructure at Elk Hills. As a result, we expect our gas-related NGL production to be about flat in the fourth quarter. We have ordered and commenced construction of the first new processing plant. We'll order the second plant shortly. Once complete, the new processing plants will increase productive capacity, improve yields, enhance netbacks and lower operating costs.
We are also working actively to optimize and de-bottleneck our existing facilities to improve performance. Additionally, we are shifting our drilling to oil wells, which we expect will result in higher oil production in the fourth quarter.
Copies of the press release announcing our third quarter earnings and Investor Relations supplemental schedules are available on our website or through the SEC's EDGAR system.

I'm very enthusiastic about the new management structure we announced last week. Both for myself and for Oxy. The new structure will assure Oxy of continuity of a winning team, both in terms of our experience and effective management and in terms of our emphasis on a highly successful business strategy. To recap the new structure, I informed our board of directors of my desire to relinquish the position of Chief Executive Officer, effective at the May 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, and to continue as full-time executive chair.
I recommended to the board that Steve Chazen replace me as CEO. The board agreed with this new structure. Steve, he's a proven leader, he has been an integral member of our senior management team for many years. Steve joined Oxy and my team in 1994 as Executive VP of Corporate Development. He became Chief Financial Officer in 1999, President in 2007 and Chief Operating Officer earlier this year. He was also elected to the board of directors in 2010.  He has made, and will continue to make, significant contributions to the Occidental's ongoing success and development. This is a carefully developed and long anticipated senior management transition. Steve and I have had an extraordinarily productive partnership for many years. Clearly, maintaining this partnership is in the best interest of Oxy and its stockholders. And I look forward to continuing this partnership in future years.
During the 20 years that I have been CEO, our management team has transformed Oxy from a conglomerate of unrelated business entities with a market capitalization of $5 billion into the fourth largest oil and gas company in the United States with a market capitalization today of $67 billion.  Oxy has led its proxy peer group in total stockholder returns. With cumulative returns of 76% over the past three years, 204% over the past five years and 870% over the past 10 years.  I'm very proud of these accomplishments.
Our management team is strong and cohesive and would be very willing and able under this new structure to take Oxy to new heights in performance and excellence. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen for the details on our third quarter performance."
293286,114139221,80345,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.2 billion or $1.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $927 million or $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations, $1.47 per diluted share in the third q",1814,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.2 billion or $1.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $927 million or $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations, $1.47 per diluted share in the third quarter this year compared to $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year. Here is the segment breakdown for the third quarter. 
Oil and Gas third quarter 2010 segment earnings were $1.7 billion compared to $1.5 billion for third quarter of last year. The improvement in 2010 was driven mostly by higher commodity prices, additional contributions from higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 13% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 38% from the third quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these gains were higher DD&A rates and higher operating expenses, partly resulting from fully expensing CO2 costs in 2010. 
Production for the third quarter of 2010 were 751,000 BOE a day, a 6.5% increase compared to 705,000 BOE a day, the third quarter of 2009. Most of the year-over-year production increases came from the Middle East, North Africa with smaller increases in Argentina and United States. The worldwide oil and gas sales volume for third quarter of 2010 were 749,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of over 6.5% compared to the 702,000 BOE a day in the third quarter of last year. Sales volume differs from production volumes due mainly to the timing of a lifting in Argentina.  Exploration expense was $83 million in the quarter. 
Oil and Gas cash production costs excluding production of property taxes were $10.25 a barrel for the first nine months of 2010. Last year's 12 months costs were $9.37 a barrel. The nine-month increase reflects a $0.35 a barrel higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense of 100% of injected CO2 beginning in 2010 and higher field support operations workovers and maintenance costs, and higher domestic workover activities mostly in the Permian.
Taxes other than on income was $1.76 per barrel for the nine months of 2010 compared with $1.60 per barrel for all of 2009. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude oil and natural gas prices in 2010.
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $189 million compared with $108 million in the second quarter of 2010. Third quarter results reflect improvement from second quarter in 2010, both volumes and margins across most product lines. Export markets have improved more rapidly than domestic markets due in part to favorable feedstock costs in North America versus Europe and Asia.
Midstream segment earnings for third quarter of 2010 were $163 million compared to $77 million in the third quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was mainly due to trading and marketing income and higher margins in the Pipeline business. The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the third quarter of 2010. Let's now turn to our performance for the first nine months of this year.
Net income was $3.3 billion or $4.07 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2010 compared with $2 billion or $2.43 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2009. Core income was $3.3 billion or $4.09 per diluted share for the first nine months of this year compared with $2 billion or $2.48 per diluted share for the year-to-date 2009 period.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the nine months of 2009 were 812.4 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.8 million. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 7% at the end of the third quarter.
Capital spending for the third quarter of 2010 was about $1 billion and $2.8 billion for the first nine months. Year-to-date, capital expenditures by segment were 82% in Oil and Gas, 13% in Midstream with the remainder in Chemicals. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months of 2010 was $6.6 billion. We used $2.8 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $1.6 billion on acquisitions and $340 million on foreign contracts. These investing cash flow uses amounted to $4.7 billion. We also used $850 million to pay dividends and $310 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $900 million to $2.1 billion at September 30. The first nine months free cash flow, after capital spending and dividends, before acquisition activity and debt retirements, was about $3.1 billion.
Our acquisition costs for the third quarter were $1.1 billion and we expect to spend about $300 million in the first part of the fourth quarter. Through these acquisitions, we expect to add about 10,000 BOE a day in average production in the fourth quarter. These acquisitions have a run rate of about 12,000 BOE a day. Of this production, about a third will be liquids and the balance will be natural gas. Over the medium term, we expect these acquisitions to add at least 25,000 BOE a day of production. This increase will come largely from oil production.
In addition to these acquisitions, we expect to add an additional 380,000 acres to our California  acreage position, and an interest in 100,000 acres in other producing areas. Our California acreage will now reach 1.6 million acres, an overwhelming portion of which consists of mineral interests.  We currently don't contemplate any more sizable acquisitions of acreage in California.
Our total year capital spending is expected to be about $4.4 billion. The capital spending rate will increase in the fourth quarter of the year, largely in our domestic operations and in Iraq. At the beginning of the year, we were running 11 development rigs in California and five rigs in the Permian. We're currently running 16 rigs in California and nine in the Permian. And expect our year end exit rig count to reach 19 rigs in California and 14 in the Permian. Next year, we anticipate working 21 rigs in California and 15 rigs in the Permian. In the current environment, we are cautious about natural gas drilling and may re-evaluate our 2011 U.S. natural gas drilling program.
In the Permian, we are currently running 94 workover rigs compared with the 57 rigs we had at the beginning of the year. We are currently expecting to be operating 110 rigs by the end of this year. Of course, the workover expenditures are expensed as opposed to being capitalized depending on their nature. Our operating costs have recently increased due to higher workover activity to $10.94 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 and further increases are expected in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect oil and gas production and sales volumes to be in the range of 760,000 to 770,000 BOE a day at third quarter average oil prices. Volume increases in the fourth quarter are expected to come from California, Oman's Mukhaizna field and the acquisitions. Increase in oil prices of $5 a barrel from the third quarter 2010 levels would result in about 4,000 BOE a day of lower production due to the impact of higher prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.
Based on the development plan at the Zubair field in Iraq, we believe that we should have a small amount of production in the fourth quarter. We do not expect to report any sales from Iraq until the first quarter of 2011. Field development plan is on target for us to meet next year's production targets.
With regard to prices. At current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $39 million. Average third quarter WTI oil price was $76.20 per barrel. For gas, a swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $27 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes.  Approximately, the current NYMEX gas price is under $3.90 per MCF. 
Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $110 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. Chemical segment is expected to provide earnings for the quarter of about $100 million to $120 million. The fourth quarter is usually the weakest for the business. Expect the continued margin improvement will be offset by the typical seasonal slowdown in the highs in construction, bleach and fertilizer markets.  We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the fourth quarter to be about 41%. Our third quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included on our supplemental schedules.
The Century Plant in the Permian has just started operations and will be providing additional CO2 to support growth in our Permian operations. We expect that the plant will yield about 180 million cubic feet a day of CO2 next year to support our Permian EOR operations. We are in the process of contracting additional CO2 from other sources and we use penalty payments due from the operator for underproduction to support these activities. We expect to have sufficient CO2 to meet the needs of our previously disclosed expansion of flooding activities.
Turning now to California, in the first nine months of the year, we drilled seven conventional exploration extension wells in California. Of these, five were outside the Kern County discovery area. Two of these wells are currently being tested. We also drilled 12 unconventional exploration wells in the first nine months of this year of which three are successful and five are being tested.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to drill 10 exploration wells of which two will be conventional and the remaining eight wells, non-conventional. In the fourth quarter, the exploration program will target smaller prospects until permits are obtained for the larger ones.
We've also drilled 13 conventional exploitation wells in the Kern County discovery area and 15 unconventional exploitation wells in California in the first nine months. Due to delays in permitting, we've reduced our exploitation plans for the second half of the year by about 10 wells.
We're continuing to have problems with our gas processing and gathering infrastructure at Elk Hills. As a result, we expect our gas-related NGL production to be about flat in the fourth quarter. We have ordered and commenced construction of the first new processing plant. We'll order the second plant shortly. Once complete, the new processing plants will increase productive capacity, improve yields, enhance netbacks and lower operating costs.
We are also working actively to optimize and de-bottleneck our existing facilities to improve performance. Additionally, we are shifting our drilling to oil wells, which we expect will result in higher oil production in the fourth quarter.
Copies of the press release announcing our third quarter earnings and Investor Relations supplemental schedules are available on our website or through the SEC's EDGAR system.

I'm very enthusiastic about the new management structure we announced last week. Both for myself and for Oxy. The new structure will assure Oxy of continuity of a winning team, both in terms of our experience and effective management and in terms of our emphasis on a highly successful business strategy. To recap the new structure, I informed our board of directors of my desire to relinquish the position of Chief Executive Officer, effective at the May 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, and to continue as full-time executive chair.
I recommended to the board that Steve Chazen replace me as CEO. The board agreed with this new structure. Steve is a proven leader. He has been an integral member of our senior management team for many years. Steve joined Oxy and my team in 1994 as the Executive VP, Corporate Development, became Chief Financial Officer in 1999, President in 2007 and Chief Operating Officer earlier this year. He was also elected to the board of directors in 2010. He has made, and will continue to make, significant contributions to Occidental's ongoing success and development. This is a carefully developed and long anticipated senior management transition. Steve and I have had an extraordinarily productive partnership for many years. Clearly, maintaining this partnership is in the best interest of Oxy and its stockholders. And I look forward to continuing this partnership in future years.
During the 20 years that I have been CEO, our management team has transformed Oxy from a conglomerate of unrelated business entities with a market capitalization of $5 billion into the fourth largest oil and gas company in the United States with a market capitalization today of $67 billion. Oxy has led its proxy peer group in total stockholder returns with cumulative returns of 76% over the past three years, 204% over the past five years and 870% over the past 10 years. I'm very proud of these accomplishments.
Our management team is strong and cohesive and would be very willing and able under this new structure to take Oxy to new heights in performance and excellence. 
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen for the details on our third quarter performance."
293286,114139221,88297,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.2 billion or $1.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $927 million or $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations, $1.47 per diluted share in the third q",1816,"Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.2 billion or $1.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $927 million or $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009, income from continuing operations, $1.47 per diluted share in the third quarter this year compared to $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year. Here is the segment breakdown for the third quarter. 
Oil and Gas third quarter 2010 segment earnings were $1.7 billion compared to $1.5 billion for third quarter of last year. The improvement in 2010 was driven mostly by higher commodity prices, additional contributions from higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 13% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 38% from the third quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these gains were higher DD&A rates and higher operating expenses, partly resulting from fully expensing CO2 costs in 2010. 
Production for the third quarter of 2010 were 751,000 BOE a day, a 6½% increase compared to 705,000 BOE a day, the third quarter of 2009. Most of the year-over-year production increases came from the Middle East, North Africa with smaller increases in Argentina and the United States. The worldwide oil and gas sales volume for third quarter of 2010 were 749,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of over 6½% compared to the 702,000 BOE a day in the third quarter of last year. Sales volume differs from the production volumes due mainly to the timing of a lifting in Argentina. Exploration expense was $83 million in the quarter. 
Oil and Gas cash production costs excluding production and property taxes were $10.25 a barrel for the first nine months of 2010. Last year's 12 months costs were $9.37 a barrel. The nine-month increase reflects a $0.35 a barrel higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense 100% of injected CO2 beginning in 2010 and higher field support operations workovers and maintenance costs, with higher domestic workover activities mostly in the Permian.
Taxes other than on income were $1.76 per barrel for the nine months of 2010 compared with $1.60 per barrel for all of 2009. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude oil and natural gas prices in 2010.
Chemical segment earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $189 million compared with $108 million in the second quarter of 2010. Third quarter results reflect improvement from the second quarter in 2010 in both volumes and margins across most product lines. Export markets have improved more rapidly than domestic markets due in part to favorable feedstock costs in North America versus Europe and Asia.
Midstream segment earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $163 million compared to $77 million in the third quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was mainly due to trading and marketing income and higher margins in the Pipeline business. The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the third quarter of 2010. 
Let's now turn to our performance for the first nine months of this year. Net income was $3.3 billion or $4.07 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2010 compared with $2 billion or $2.43 per diluted share the first nine months of 2009. Core income was $3.3 billion or $4.09 per diluted share for the first nine months of this year compared with $2 billion or $2.48 per diluted share for the year-to-date 2009 period.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the nine months of 2009 were 812.4 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.8 million. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 7% at the end of the third quarter.
Capital spending for the third quarter of 2010 was about $1 billion and $2.8 billion for the first nine months. Year-to-date, capital expenditures by segment were 82% in Oil and Gas, 13% in Midstream with the remainder in Chemicals. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months of 2010 was $6.6 billion. We used $2.8 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $1.6 billion on acquisitions and $340 million on foreign contracts. These investing cash flow uses amounted to $4.7 billion. We also used $850 million to pay dividends and $310 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $900 million to $2.1 billion at September 30. The first nine months free cash flow, after capital spending and dividends, before acquisition activity and debt retirements, was about $3.1 billion.
Our acquisition costs for the third quarter were $1.1 billion and we expect to spend about $300 million in the first part of the fourth quarter. Through these acquisitions, we expect to add about 10,000 BOE a day in average production in the fourth quarter. These acquisitions have a run rate of about 12,000 BOE a day. Of this production, about a third will be liquids and the balance will be natural gas. Over the medium term, we expect these acquisitions to add at least 25,000 BOE a day of production. This increase will come largely from oil production.
In addition to these acquisitions, we expect to add an additional 380,000 acres to our California acreage position and interest in 100,000 acres in other producing areas. Our California acreage will now reach 1.6 million acres, an overwhelming portion of which consists of mineral interests. We currently don't contemplate any more sizable acquisitions of acreage in California.
Our total year capital spending is expected to be about $4.4 billion. The capital spending rate will increase in the fourth quarter of the year, largely in our domestic operations and in Iraq. At the beginning of the year, we were running 11 development rigs in California and five rigs in the Permian. We're currently running 16 rigs in California and nine in the Permian and expect our year-end exit rig count to reach 19 rigs in California and 14 in the Permian. Next year, we anticipate working 21 rigs in California and 15 rigs in the Permian. In the current environment, we are cautious about natural gas drilling and may re-evaluate our 2011 U.S. natural gas drilling program.
In the Permian, we are currently running 94 workover rigs compared with the 57 rigs we had at the beginning of the year. We are currently expecting to be operating 110 rigs by the end of this year. A portion of the workover expenditures are expensed as opposed to being capitalized depending on their nature. Our operating costs have recently increased due to higher workover activity to $10.94 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 and further increases are expected in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect oil and gas production and sales volumes to be in the range of 760,000 to 770,000 BOE a day at third quarter average oil prices. Volume increases in the fourth quarter are expected to come from California, Oman's Mukhaizna field and the acquisitions. Increase in oil prices of $5 a barrel from the third quarter 2010 levels would result in about 4,000 BOE a day of lower production due to the impact of higher prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.
Based on the development plan at the Zubair field in Iraq, we believe that we should have a small amount of production in the fourth quarter. We do not expect to report any sales from Iraq until the first quarter of 2011. Field development plan is on target for us to meet next year's production targets.
With regard to prices. At current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $39 million. Average third quarter WTI oil price was $76.20 per barrel. For gas, a swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $27 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes.  Approximately, the current NYMEX gas price is under $3.90 per MCF. 
Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $110 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. Chemical segment is expected to provide earnings for the quarter of about $100 million to $120 million. The fourth quarter is usually the weakest for the business. Expect the continued margin improvement will be offset by the typical seasonal slowdown in the highs in construction, bleach and fertilizer markets.  We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the fourth quarter to be about 41%. Our third quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included on our supplemental schedules.
The Century Plant in the Permian has just started operations and will be providing additional CO2 to support growth in our Permian operations. We expect that the plant will yield about 180 million cubic feet a day of CO2 next year to support our Permian EOR operations. We are in the process of contracting additional CO2 from other sources and we use penalty payments due from the operator for underproduction to support these activities. We expect to have sufficient CO2 to meet the needs of our previously disclosed expansion of flooding activities.
Turning now to California, in the first nine months of the year, we drilled seven conventional exploration extension wells in California. Of these, five were outside the Kern County discovery area. Two of these wells are currently being tested. We also drilled 12 unconventional exploration wells in the first nine months of this year of which three are successful and five are being tested.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to drill 10 exploration wells of which two will be conventional and the remaining eight wells, non-conventional. In the fourth quarter, the exploration program will target smaller prospects until permits are obtained for the larger ones.
We've also drilled 13 conventional exploitation wells in the Kern County discovery area and 15 unconventional exploitation wells in California in the first nine months. Due to delays in permitting, we've reduced our exploitation plans for the second half of the year by about 10 wells.
We're continuing to have problems with our gas processing and gathering infrastructure at Elk Hills. As a result, we expect our gas-related NGL production to be about flat in the fourth quarter. We have ordered and commenced construction of the first new processing plant. We'll order the second plant shortly. Once complete, the new processing plants will increase productive capacity, improve yields, enhance netbacks and lower operating costs.
We are also working actively to optimize and de-bottleneck our existing facilities to improve performance. Additionally, we are shifting our drilling to oil wells, which we expect will result in higher oil production in the fourth quarter.
Copies of the press release announcing our third quarter earnings and Investor Relations supplemental schedules are available on our website or through the SEC's EDGAR system.
