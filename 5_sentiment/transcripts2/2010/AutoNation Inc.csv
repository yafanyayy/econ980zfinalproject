Today, we reported fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations of $0.36, compared to a year-ago EPS of $0.42. After adjusting for a favorable tax item in 2009, our adjusted fourth quarter 2009 EPS more than doubled to $0.29, compared to an adjusted EPS of $0.13 for the prior year. Fourth quarter 2009 revenue totaled $2.8 billion, compared to $2.6 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 8%, driven primarily by higher new vehicle sales. In the fourth quarter, total U.S. industry new vehicle retail sales increased 6% based on CNW Research Data. In comparison, during the same period, AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 7%. AutoNation delivered solid profitability in the fourth quarter of 2009 and more than doubled adjusted EPS in spite of a sour rate that increased only 3% to $10.8 million.  AutoNation's full year adjusted EPS increased 14% to $1.15 from $1.01 for the prior year despite a U.S. industry new vehicle sales decline of 22% in 2009. Going forward, there are two issues I'd like to address. First is the recent recall announced by Toyota. Many have reported that customers are overwhelmed in dealerships and are outraged about their vehicles. Neither of these are true. Customers are making appointments and in fact have been very patient with regards to the recent recalls. The recalls created a disruption in business beginning on January 25, 2010. We have begun to sell Toyotas that were on a no sales hold and estimate the impact on Q1 2010 EPS more likely be less than $0.01, depending on the availability of replacement parts, car shopping to the other brands and the rate of recovery to the pre-recall levels. We expect that Toyota will move aggressively to gain back market share following resolution of these issues and believe that the Toyota brand will not suffer significant long-term damage to its reputation for quality, safety and dependability.The second topic is to note that we passed the one-year anniversary of the financial meltdown and have prevailed through the multiyear industry downturn our aggressive cost-cutting reduction and asset management strategies, resulted in a lower cost structure, reduced debt levels and more efficient inventory management. These improvements will allow us to continue to respond to the expected recovery in the retail sales environment. Although sales have been improving from a bottom, the pace of recovery continues to be gradual and the absolute level of sales remain well-below historical levels.  These past few years of low sales volume have resulted in a meaningful reduction in the units and operation, which has created a headwind for the Parts and Service business industry-wide that we intend to mitigate through targeted initiatives, best in class processes.  I would now like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Short."

Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter, as Mike mentioned, we reported net income from continuing operations of $62 million or $0.36 per share. These results included the favorable tax adjustment of $13 million or $0.07 per share and the adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.29, which compares to adjusted EPS of $0.13 per share in the fourth quarter 2008. For the full year, our adjusted EPS was $1.15, compared to $1.01 last year.  Given the industry-wide new unit sales decline of more than 20%, we're very proud of this performance.  The adjustments in net income are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release. Compared to last year, revenue increased $218 million and gross profit improved by $21.2 million for the quarter. Despite these increases, SG&A was up only 1% as we benefited on a year-over-year basis from the $200 million structural cost reductions we've completed during 2008. As we discussed previously, $150 million of this reduction is permanent in nature while the remaining $50 million is expected to return as volume recovers. As a percentage of gross profit, SG&A was 76.4%, a reduction of 260 basis points. As has been the case in previous quarters, net new floorplan continued to be a benefit. For the quarter, it was a benefit of $4.3 million, compared to a cost of $7.3 million last year, an improvement of $11.6 million. This improvement was a result of lower floorplan interest expense due to effective management of inventory levels and significantly lower LIBOR rates, which spiked in the fourth quarter of 2008. These reductions were partially offset by higher spreads and the decrease in floorplan assistance.Non-vehicle interest expense was $10.2 million for the quarter, down from the $20.1 million we reported last year due to our $236 million lower average debt balance and a decrease in LIBOR rates. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $14.7 million and included the benefit of $12.7 million, as we have had favorable resolution of some state tax matters. During the quarter, we repurchased four million shares of our stock for $69.9 million, an average price of $17.67 per share. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $35 million, bringing our total annual spend to $75.5 million, a $35 million reduction from 2008. And we expect CapEx to be approximately $150 million in 2010.As of January 1, we had an additional $45 million available per share for the repurchase of shares within our restricted payments basket. Thus far in the quarter, we have utilized approximately $12 million of this amount with the repurchase of 700,000 shares. We remain within the limits of our financial covenants with a leverage ratio of 2.41x at the end of the year, unchanged from the third quarter. Our debt in this number in this calculation is not on a net debt basis. If we have applied the cash on our balance sheet plus cash available from used inventory flooring to reduce debt, we would have lowered the ratio to below 2x compared to the limit of 2.75x. Our capitalization ratio was measured floorplan debt plus non-vehicle debt divided by total book capitalization increased from the third quarter levels, as we restocked our vehicle inventory. Floorplan debt was $1.39 billion at year end, up $328 million from September 30 and down $425 from December 31, 2008. As of December 31, the capitalization ratio was 52.7%, well within the covenant requirement of 65%. The calculation of these covenants were included in the tables of the press release. Our quarter-end cash balance was $174 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in a total liquidity of $390 million at the end of December, which is ample cash in liquidity to invest in our business and stay within our debt covenants.  Now let me turn it over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone."
112302,84913036,49471,"AutoNation Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-11-2010",2010-02-11,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning.  AutoNation ended the year on a strong note with an operating margin of 3.4% in the fourth quarter, an 80 basis point improvement compared to a year ago.

AutoNation ended the year on a strong note with an operating margin of 3.4% in the fourth quarter, an 80 basis point improvement compared to a year ago. In the quarter, we continued to maintain an extremely disciplined cost structure and it served us well. We've managed our inventories prudently,  gained new vehicle market share and continued to benefit from our expanding shared service model. In the period, associate productivity increases and we experienced the lowest associate turnover in the history of the company. We also obtained our best ever customer satisfaction levels for both sales and service in the quarter.Turning to detailed results for the quarter, I'll begin with our segment performance. In the quarter, segment income excluding corporate and other increased $40 million or 54% compared to a year ago. Segment income as a percent of segment revenue increased for all segments as a result of increased unit volume, higher vehicle grosses, reductions in SG&A and lower floorplan interest expense. As I continue, my comments will be on a same-store basis unless noted otherwise.AutoNation retailed 46,500 new vehicles in the quarter, an increase of 8% compared to a year ago and favorable to the industry retail number of plus 6%. We were pleased to record new vehicle market share gains in each month of the quarter. Fourth quarter new vehicle revenue increased 15%, compared to the period a year ago. Revenue for new vehicle retail increased $1,900 in the quarter to $33,400 with revenue increases across all segments. This due to reduction in incentives and a shift in mix toward larger vehicles for Imports and Premium Luxury that was partially offset by a mixed shift toward cars for Domestics. Gross profit for new vehicles increased $246 or 12% to $2,289, resulting from improved margins on imports and trucks, as well as overall lean inventories. Total gross profit dollars on new vehicles increased 21% compared to the quarter a year ago.  Relative to new vehicle inventory, as planned, we increased our stocking levels of core inventory and ended the year with just over 35,000 units on the ground with over 90% of our inventory being 2010 model year. Our inventory is in great shape relative to both quantity and mix. At December 31, our new vehicle days supply was 54 days, compared to 83 days a year ago.We retailed 32,500 used vehicles in the quarter, a decline of 2% compared to a year ago while increasing total used gross by 7%. Used volume growth in the Import and Premium Luxury segments was offset by a Domestic decline, driven primarily by a sizable reduction in Domestic-certified pre-owned sales. During the quarter, we moved 4,700 used vehicles from originating store to a more optimal location with good success at retail. Revenue per used retailed increased 10% or $1,625 to $17,188 in the quarter. Its tight supply drove up used vehicle values, specially trucks, post-Clunkers. Total gross profit dollars increased 7% in the period to $48 million due in part to a $3.6 million wholesale improvement. I'll note that after experiencing a significant wholesale loss in 2008 due to the volatility of the used market, we've managed our used inventory much more conservatively throughout 2009. Gross profit for used vehicle retailed was $1,485, an increase of $13 or 1% compared to the quarter a year ago. At December 31, our days supply in used vehicles was 41 days, up 11 days compared to a year ago. Days supply calculation was inflated by increased trades [ph] at the end of December.Turning to Parts and Service, fourth quarter revenue of $521 million and gross profit of $227 million were off 2% compared to a year ago, with warranty being the primary driver of the decline. This improved vehicle quality in the declining service base continued to impact the Warranty business. Our service base consists primarily of the trailing five years of our new and used unit sales. Relative to gross profit in the quarter, declines of 13% in warranty gross and 1% in customer pay service gross were offset somewhat by 14% growth in internal gross, as we prepped more new and used vehicles for sale. In the quarter, internal gross, which is driven by current period volume improved year-over-year and made up 14% of total Parts and Service gross profit. Customer pay service comprised 44% of our Parts and Service gross profit and warranty accounted for 18%. When you factor in parts and collision, more than 80% of our total fixed gross is impacted by changes in unit sales, and thus our service base, which has declined in each of the past five years and most dramatically in the past two. This trend will continue for the coming years until sales recover from their current depressed levels. While the fixed business remains under pressure, to offset the macro issues, we've implemented a plan to grow Customer Pay Service business and improve owner retention, which is a key long-term goal for our company. We believe our efforts will stabilize our Parts and Service business and that in total, it will remain relatively flat until the service base stabilizes. To this end, in the quarter, we've expanded our service reminder program. We've added an outbound phone initiative to win back defectors and expanded our service marketing to reach more prospects. We've also sold 35,000 prepaid maintenance programs, an important retention tool with about 40% of them sold on the service drive. And we continue to validate our seven-day service pilot in Clearwater, Tampa and in South Florida.Next Finance and Insurance, where gross profit or vehicle retail was $1,130 in the quarter, an increase of $81 or 8%. We attribute this growth to our strong preferred lender network, improve returns from our service contract portfolios with third parties, increase product penetration and ongoing efforts to improve the performance of our third and fourth quartile stores. In the quarter, there was an improvement in the credit environment compared to a year ago. We noted an increase in approval rates by the majority of captives, as well as our preferred bank lenders for prime and near-prime customers. For the higher risk segments of non-prime and used vehicles, credit recovery is slower. On average, advances have increased on both new and used vehicles and the securitization environment continues to improve with spreads versus LIBOR at the lowest levels since the fourth quarter of 2007. In the quarter, we noted strength in the Atlanta and Denver markets and we're encouraged by a solid performance in Florida. Distressed areas of California and Phoenix and Vegas were all up slightly compared to the period a year ago. At year end, our store portfolio numbered 203 stores and 246 franchises in 15 states. In January, we competed and successfully integrated our most recent acquisitions of AppleWay Honda and AppleWay Acura in Spokane, Washington. Looking ahead, our corporate development team is actively pursuing acquisition opportunities that meet our market and brand criteria, as well as our return on investment threshold.We are proud of our performance in what was a very challenging year. I'd like to thank our 18,000 associates for their dedication and determination. As the economy recovers, we're focused on gaining profitable and new and used market share, growing our service customer base and strategically acquiring franchises. We will continue to invest in training and technology to support the consistent execution of our best practice processes in order to deliver superior customer satisfaction.Before I turn it back to Mike Jackson, I would like to comment on our Toyota business. Our first priority continues to be servicing our affected customers to alleviate their concerns and ensure their trust in Toyota and our stores. The vast majority of customers are very understanding and are awaiting notification from Toyota before coming to the dealership. Parts are arriving daily and we're completing customers cars first then turning to stock units. The recall initially affected 56% of our new inventory and 22% of our used inventory. Based on what we've been told relative to the availability of parts along with the relative simplicity of the repair, we expect to have all inventories salable in the next week to 10 days. Our incoming phone calls and service business are up significantly and are manageable with our increased staffing and extended hours. Showroom traffic is down about 20%, but should increase as available inventory and advertising increases. Our associates view this as an opportunity to reinforce our commitment to customers and clearly understand the need to extend ourselves at each interaction. We appreciate and value their efforts.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike Jackson."

I would make a general statement that all manufacturers are much more conservative in their production runs and are much more responsive to signals from the marketplace if something's not selling to curtail production. And we have many vehicles from all manufacturers where there's clearly more demand than supply. If you really think about the business, there's only two things you'll ever hear from the marketplace. You have too many or you have too few. You'll never hear it's just right. So the only way to go through life in this business is to have more demand than supply but you're trying to keep that as close as possible, but that you have tight inventories with the demand pull system. It looks like the industry has done a phenomenal job of transitioning to that coming out of all the difficulties of last year. And so far all manufacturers we deal with are much more responsive to push back when there's difficulties in the marketplace and trying to respond much quicker than what people actually want to buy. So it's really a new world. Mike, you want to fill in any details?"

And so there's a definite gap between buyers and sellers. And it's on three issues. One, I would say the extreme volatility of the industry over the past couple of years. If you look at what happened around gas prices, if you look around what happened around credit, it means the bandwidth of what can happen is much broader than what anyone thought. Imagine, we got down to a selling rate of below 10 million units, meaning you need to be much more conservative in the multiple you pay because the volatility is higher. I think that's pretty well accepted by sellers. The next step is, though, absolute earnings of the dealerships are down because we're at the bottom of the trough. And they want to apply this lower multiple to what they used to make, not what they're making today. Because they think what they used to make is what they will make. And the buyer's attitude, certainly our attitude is, well, that could be. We got a pretty optimistic view about the future, but nobody knows for sure what's going to happen. And why should I pay you for what I think is going to happen. I'm going to pay you for what is happening. And if you want to hold door for two or three years, and we see how all these develop, that's your privilege. And then, the final issue indeed you've already touched on is real estate. And with the fact that the rationalization of retail did not take place year-by-year, as there were changes in shifts in the industry. It happened all at once with the bankruptcy of Chrysler and General Motors and the collapse of the market. There's a lot of automotive real estate on the market, which is going to affect values for some period of time as the economy recovers and the use of those properties change. And again, sellers want to be paid for what they used to be worth and what they think it will be worth in the future. And buyers are saying, ""If you want to sell now, this is all we're willing to pay you now because this is the market today."" So there's a gap there. And somebody's going to have to capitulate.

We're going to get through this together. We're making no attempt at AutoNation to divert traffic to other brands during this. We are standing unequivocally with Toyota. And my belief is that looking at the faces of the customers coming in to the Toyota stores and their depth of goodwill, confidence and trust in Toyota, that once we can go back to full sales, Toyota during the months of March and April will by and large have recaptured almost all the share that they have lost during this disruptive period."

And we find it a little bit conservatively. But I think Mike Jackson has already called out our risk profile has changed. We've got some unique pilots that we're working on in the Used side, including some centralized buying and trying to get more aggressive on the buying side. And it's clearly our intention to grow our Used vehicle business this year. I do want to point out though that our units were down two, but our total Used car gross was up seven.

It's a combination of it's kind of reduced units and the overall size of the balance sheet. But more importantly, I believe, are the improvement in ratios on CRP [ph] days outstanding and receivable days outstanding, et cetera. So as the business volume recovers, it will be natural for there to be a little bit of the use of cash and working capital. But I think it'll be much less of an increase than it was a decrease on the downside."

Today, we reported first quarter EPS from continuing operations of $0.34, a 55% increase compared to adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.22 in the prior year and a 13% increase compared to the $0.30 on a GAAP basis.
First quarter 2010 revenue totaled $2.8 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 19% and increased in all of our revenue categories. In the first quarter, total US industry new vehicle retail sales increased 15%, based on CNW Research Data. In comparison during the same period, AutoNation’s new vehicle unit sales increased 19%. Our new and used vehicle and finance and insurance revenues, all increased 24%. And parts and service revenue was up slightly for the first time since the first of 2008.
Going forward, there are three issues I would like to address. The first is that we had two quarters of growth in all of AutoNation’s regions with significant year-over-year growth in our largest state of Florida, where we have 54 dealerships that represents 30% of our revenue in the first quarter of 2010. Florida was one of the initial states that saw a downturn beginning in 2007 and a collapse in the middle of 2008. We have now seen two straight quarters of growth in Florida.
After increasing 15% in the fourth quarter of 2009, Florida revenue grew 29% and new units saw a 27% increase in the first quarter of this year. The second issue is the recent recall by Toyota. We saw a no sales period that lasted nearly all of February and affected over 55% of our Toyota inventory. In March, Toyota launched an incentive program that brought customers who have been waiting back into our Toyota dealerships. Toyota has continued to retain the trust of their customers. AutoNation new vehicle unit sales for Toyota in March were up 38% and 6% for the first quarter.
And third, we have begun to see the resurgence of domestic brands, especially at Ford and General Motors. Because of our balanced brand portfolio and our focus on the Ford and Chevy brands, AutoNation is well positioned to benefit from the recovery of these manufacturers.
I would now like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Short.

Let’s turn to our financial results for the first quarter.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let’s turn to our financial results for the first quarter. As Mike mentioned, we reported net income from continuing operations of $58.4 million or $0.34 per share versus $52.6 million or $0.30 per share during the first quarter of 2009. 
Part of (results) included the gain on senior note repurchases of $0.04 per share, a net gain on assets sales and dispositions of $0.03 per share, partially offset by property and over appearance. After giving the effect of these items, our adjusted EPS from last year's first quarter was $0.22 per share. Adjustments to net income are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release. 
Compared to last year, revenue increased $446 million or 19% and gross profit improved by $54 million or 12%. The SG&A increased of $23 million was primarily related to variable expenses, such as sales commissions increasing with higher sales volume and improved gross margin. As a percentage of gross profit, SG&A was 73.6%, that’s a reduction of 360 basis points year-over-year and down 280 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2009.
As has been the case in previous quarters, net new vehicle floor plan continued to be a benefit. For the quarter, it was a benefit of $3.3 million, an improvement of $2.5 million from the first quarter of last year. 
Non-vehicle interest expense was $9 million for the quarter, down from the $11.8 million we reported last year due to our $76 million lower average debt balance and the decrease in LIBOR rates.
Provision for income tax in the quarter was $37.6 million or 39.2%. During the quarter, we repurchased nearly 2.1 million shares for $37.2 million at an average price of $17.91 per share. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $14 million and we invested $12.5 million related to acquisitions.
We remain within the limits of our financial covenants with a leverage ratio of 2.37 times at the end of the quarter. Our capitalization ratio measures floor plan debt plus non-vehicle debt divided by total book capitalization. Floor plan debt was $1.427 billion at quarter end, up $46 million from December 31st, 2009. As of March 31st, the capitalization ratio was 52.8%, well within the covenant requirement of 65%. The calculation of these covenants are included in the tables of our press release and do not reflect any changes related to the financing that we announced on March 31st.
Our quarter end cash balance was $161 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of $447 million at the end of March, again before taking into account the debt transactions announced on March 31st.
I would like to spend a moment discussing our recent group financing transactions. With debt maturities scheduled for 2012, 2013 and 2014, AutoNation has been monitoring market conditions to identify an opportune time to announce its capital structure. 
In light of near historical lows in the bond market, the vastly improved banking environment, and the potential for rate increases on the horizon, we have decided that now was the right time to go to market. I am very pleased with the results and we believe the market recognize and rewarded AutoNation for managing through the downturn effectively and positioning the company to succeed during the recovery.
Key accomplishments of the refinancing include, we extend our maturities by issuing eight-year bonds and move the extended credit facility maturity from 2012 to 2014. Next we improved our flexibility by increasing leverage ratio covenants and eliminating the impact of any goodwill, franchise rate, property impairments, subsequent through January 2007 on the capitalization covenant. 
And additionally, we were able to issue bond with investment grade covenants, reflecting in markets understanding of the quality of our balance sheet. Thirdly, we achieved improved liquidity from less restricted covenants. We provide additional access to our revolver and we captivated our covenants on March 31st based on the revised agreement and/or pro forma capital structure, our leverage ratio would have been unchanged at 2.37 times and the capitalization ratio would have been 40.4%. 
Additionally we reduced our exposure to interest rate volatility by increasing the fifth straight portion of our debt from 33% to 55%. And finally, we achieved very attractive pricing. At 7% yield to maturity, our bonds were priced at one of the tightest high yield spreads to treasury this year. 
Additionally, the increase in our term loan pricing from LIBOR plus 87.5 to LIBOR plus 225 is on favorable terms relative to market. Remember that absent this transaction, the credit facility would have likely been refinanced prior to the middle of 2011 that we have gone current. It includes in our press release that provides a pro forma comparison of our previous and our new capital structures. 
Approximately $20 million before tax will be expensed in the second quarter of 2010 related to these transactions including approximately $4 million for the write-off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the old notes and the prior credit agreement. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with the outcome of these transactions. As they have extended our debt maturities, increased our available liquidity, lowering our exposure to interest rate increases in the future, and it provides us with additional flexibility to manage our business and optimize capital allocation in the future.
Now, let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone.

We are very pleased with our performance in the quarter. Customers were back in the market and thanks to the tremendous efforts of our associates; we recorded impressive increases in revenue, in gross profit dollars across the board and delivered a strong operating margin of 4%. Our Q1 focus was on driving volume in all areas of our business and we did just that both delighting customers as well as reinvesting in the business.
We are particularly encouraged by the performance of our Florida region store, where store revenue increased 29% in the quarter, followed by our Texas region at plus 24%, our Central region at plus 21%, and our Western region at plus 12%. This marks two consecutive quarters of revenue growth across the enterprise. During the period, we ramped up our new and used vehicle inventories for the spring selling season, maintained our disciplined cost structure and continued to experience very low associate turnover.
Relative to Toyota, I will note that our Toyota stores continue to do a great job of addressing customer concerns relating to the recalls and handling the high volume of recall related business. On the sales side, incentives offered by Toyota to attract new and returning customers worked. In fact AutoNation had increases in both new and used vehicle volume for Toyota in the quarter, driven by an exceptionally strong March.
Turning to detailed results, I will begin with our segment performance. In the quarter, segment income excluding corporate and other increased $37 million or 40% compared to a year-ago. Segment income grew for all segments with sizeable gains coming from the domestic and import segments, which wore the brunt of the headwinds in the period a year-ago. We saw strong performances from Nissan, Honda and Toyota in the import segment and Ford and General Motors in the domestic segment. That floor plan benefited all segments.
As I continue, my comments will be on a same-store basis unless noted otherwise. AutoNation retailed 45,000 new vehicles in the quarter, an increase of 19% compared to a year-ago, and favorable to the CNW industry retail number of plus 15%. We were pleased to record new vehicle unit growth in each month in the quarter.
First quarter new vehicle revenue increased $282 million or 24% to $1.5 billion on increased volume and a slight shift in mix toward domestic and import vehicles. Year-over-year revenue per new vehicle increased 4% with increases across all three segments, particularly premium luxury. At a $103 million new vehicle gross profit dollars rose 40% or $30 million in the quarter. Gross profit per new vehicle retail was 2272, an increase of 18% or $347.
Factors contributing to the increase were AutoNation’s performance relative to strong manufactured dealer incentives, the end of the production push system by manufacturers in the domestic segment and our inventories being in great shape. We have the right inventory including the right mix with prior-year models comprising just 2% of our March ending inventory compared to 7% a year-ago.
Same-store new vehicle gross profit as a percent of revenue improved 80 basis points to 7%. At March 31st, new vehicle days supply was 50 days or 37,800 units compared to 65 days a year-ago and 54 days at December 31st.
AutoNation retailed 37,700 used vehicles in the quarter, a unit volume increase of 12% compared to the period a year-ago. Our used to new ratio was a solid 0.83 to 1. Retail used revenue was up 24% to $644 million, driven by increased unit volume as well as across the board increases in used vehicle pricing due to a tight supply of used inventory.
Revenue per used vehicle retail increased $1600 or 10% to $17,100 as tight inventories and increased demand moved prices higher. Specific to AutoNation, we experienced a shift in mix toward premium luxury which has the highest average selling price of the three segments as well as a 19% increase in certified pre-owned units which have a higher average selling price compared to other used vehicles.
Wholesale revenue increased $23 million or 35% to $88 million as a result of increased volume and very strong wholesale prices in February and March. Same-store used vehicle gross profit of $66 million reflected an increase of 6% with wholesale improvement of 1% being a contributing - $1 million being a contributing factor. 
  Gross profit for vehicle retail was $1680 was off a $131 compared to the period a year-ago, resulting in part from a keen focus on increasing volume through the use of software that enables us to priced recently acquired inventory closer to market. Our target is to turn 75% of our used inventory in the first 30 days. This focus optimizes our inventory turnover and minimizes wholesale loss. I will also note that the margin reduction was partially offset by strong gains in F&I, PBR on used vehicles.
Sequentially, compared to Q4 2009, gross profit for used vehicle retail increased a $195 or 13% and gross profit as a percent of revenue improved a 120 basis points. We also noted a 24% increase in appraisals and a 42% increase in trade-in supplier compared to the period a year-ago due to continued emphasis on our appraisal process. In the quarter, we moved 5500 used vehicles from originating stores to a more optimal location relative to turn and PBR. And we continued to experience good success at retail with this program. At March 31st, our used vehicle day supply was 39 days. 
For part service and collision compared to the quarter a year-ago, same-store revenue of $538 million and gross profit of $237 million, both grew 1%. Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased 10 basis points to 44.1%. Excluding Toyota, part service and collision revenue would have been flat and gross profit would have been just shy of 1%. Relative to gross profit in the quarter, we had a 1% increase in customer pay service gross and a 23% increase in internal gross which is driven by current period sales volume. Those increase has substantially offset a 4% decline in warranty gross.
When we normalized our warranty results for the Lexus recall in the period a year-ago and the Toyota recalls in this quarter, our warranty gross declined 12%. The warranty decline continues as a result of improved vehicle quality in a declining surface base which we define is the trailing five years of our new and used unit sales.
Overtime as the industry continues its gradual recovery, the part service and collision business will benefit. In the meantime, growing customer pay service business and improving customer retention remain our priorities. Our aggressive approach to service marketing as well as selling our value care program on the service drive continue. In addition to ongoing training, we have launched a new initiative with our service associate to improve full skills and appointment setting capabilities. These efforts and others are aimed squarely at offsetting the impact of the declining service base.
Next, we had a very strong quarter in finance and insurance with gross profit per vehicle retail with $1149, an $85 decrease or 8% versus a year-ago. We attribute much of that growth to continued improvement of the automotive credit environment and better execution at the store level. Gradual improve in the economy also drove reduced F&I chargebacks as a percent of gross profit.
In the quarter, there was an improvement in the credit environment compared to a year-ago, we noted an increase in approval rates by the majority of the captives as well as the majority of our preferred bank lenders for prime and near prime customers. For the higher risk segment of non-prime, credit recovery continues at slower pace. The securitization environment continues to improve with spreads versus LIBOR remaining at the lowest levels since the fourth quarter of 2007. 
With consistent execution of our best practices and continued emphasis on the opportunity stores, we expect a favorable F&I performance trends to continue.
Relative to our store portfolio, in the quarter, we purchased two stores and gained one store through an add point from an increase of five franchises. We continued to actively pursue acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand criteria as well as our return on investment thresholds. The combining annual revenue run rate for the added stores of the $71 million. In the period, we divested one store and terminated another with a combined annual revenue run rate of $45 million. At March 31st, our portfolio consisted of 204 stores and 249 franchises in 15 states.
Finally, our associate productivity has increased and our team is enthused as our retail selling environment is improved significantly. We are benefitting by leveraging our low-cost base and our improved execution from the intense training during the downturn. Our industry leading margins reflect that work and we are very grateful for the teams’ efforts. I would like to thank our associates for their contributions to a strong quarter as well as their commitment to delivering a superior buying and ownership experience for our customers.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Mike Jackson.

And that our new vehicle revenue was up 24%, our unit volume for new vehicles was up 19%, our content per vehicle sold increased. And overall in total, manufacturer incentives are down from a year-ago. I think that specific Toyota incentives to address their difficult period are appropriate. And I would also observe that their incentives are still significantly lower than the domestics. 
So when you see higher volume, higher content, higher front-end grosses for us, that’s a real recovery. And I think there could be no question, there is some impact from Toyota’s incentives particularly for them. But I don’t think it is going to be dramatic. And when we made our forecast of a 11,500,000 units for the year, that’s what we thought was going to happen and now with the first quarter, you look at and say, well that’s going to happen. So our level of confidence is much higher. And if there is any movement from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter around incentive so be it, but this is a real genuine recovery. 
And, of course, I think the Florida figure of a plus 29% is also meaningful, because people don’t go out and spend $30,000 for a vehicle without feeling much better overall. So they - even though the housing hasn’t recovered in Florida, it is stabilized in the sense that unit sales are up and prices have stopped going down. They feel more secure about their jobs, they know the worst of the unemployment is over. And when they come in, we have a much better credit environment for them. So we feel good about the year and I think the incentives are very much on the tactical side of the equation.

And the biggest factors that we look at are housing. I have been saying it for strongly since 2005. And to get back to 16 million and to really get full stride in this recovery, you just got to watch these housing figures closely. And when you see the combination of increased unit volume plus the beginning of valuations going up, and the resumption of new housing construction, which will be crucial for our truck sale. That's what we are watching for, that’s what we are waiting for. 
The employment situation obviously and there it’s not the unemployment number, we know the unemployment number is going to remain high, could even go higher as people return to the work force. It’s simply that the total number of people employed is going up. The credit situation we have talked about (inaudible) and in premium luxury, what has made the difference this year and what we watch is the equity market and the bond market because the clientele has heavily invested there and how they feel about that determines whether they are willing to buy a expensive vehicle and also in the premium luxury, the employment numbers in the sense that many of them are entrepreneurs and small business people and they really don't want to buy a new expensive vehicle when they are laying people off, and as soon as they have to stop doing that, they told us they are going to return to the market.
So those are the big issues that we really watch state by state and we will make a judgment call. We think that we are all moving in the right direction. We call the recovery, I call it a (fat z) in the sense that the collapse took two years and I think we are looking at three to four years to get back the 16 million units. However, I think the journey back is going to be very rewarding for the industry and that it’s a new business model at the manufacturer level, more about sustainability, profitability and viability and so much cost, so much irrational behavior, it’s been squeezed out. I think the profit opportunity during the recovery period is significantly higher than it was on the downward spiral.

There is always a few models you are short of. But all in all, our inventories are in really good shape. Each of the import inventories is in the 45 to 50 day range, the domestic inventories are in good shape in the 60 to 70 range; premium luxury continues to be tight and were especially tight on Mercedes and Lexus, I know Mercedes is ramping up their production in the second quarter. So I think all-in-all, we are very pleased with our ability to manage inventory. We have added a lot of capability centrally to work with our stores to be sure we have the right inventory. We move a lot of inventory from store-to-store but I don’t see long-term big shortages that are going to impact it. We really like the way we are performing now. As we mentioned in our call script, only 2% of our inventory right now are ’09 models. That's the best we have ever been. 
So all-in-all, inventories were in good shape and as far out as we can see, it looks like production is going to stay steady and Mike Jackson’s called out, doing a really nice job of reflecting consumer demand.

Certainly there is room for improvement in what we call the front end gross. But if you look under the covers, what you will see is is that our F&I dollars have increases as we move to a more expensive used product, we got a higher percentage of certified preown and before. So our total gross dollars including F&I were up about 9% on 12% increase in volume.
The other piece is their internal gross in parts and service has been positively impacted as we have done more reconditioning and more CPO. So if you put all that gross together we are performing we think we think at a pretty high level. Is there room for more on the front end, I think there is some and we will continue to work at that. But our focus in the quarter was really to drive more top line growth to turn our inventory quicker in the wholesale less products. 
So, yes, I think there is always a little more, you can never be satisfied but if you put the whole package together, a front end gross, F&I gross and recon gross, I think we did a really good job.

First and foremost, the credit environment but that was everywhere, but with absent that nothing would have been able to improve. The housing situation in Florida is stabilizing. The downward spiral has been broken, unit volume is increasing with stabilization around pricing. Everyone’s come to terms with the fact that is going to be our long, long journey on the recovery of valuations but people have had come to terms with that and have adjusted to it. 
Now we still have a long way to go because the downward spiral in Florida was dramatic but I said it before that I fundamentally believe that Florida will recover and recover strongly. Also, something to keep in mind is as the housing market improves in the rest of the country, it helps Florida. In other words, if people can't sell their homes and move to Florida, that's a problem and that's been the situation for the last couple of years. And the growth that you normally see Florida was not able to occur because people couldn't sell their home and move here. 
I think that is also going to change that would be a big help to Florida and Florida is going to be more attractive than ever when you look at the (inaudible) and we still have great coastal lines of sunshine. So I am optimistic that the recovery in Florida is real and Florida probably will be one of our leading markets going forward for quite some time. Mr. Maroone?

On a GAAP basis, we reported EPS as $0.31, compared to $0.30 a year ago. Second quarter 2010 revenue totaled $3.1 billion, compared to $2.6 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 20%. And we had increases in all of our revenue categories.
In the second quarter, total US industry new vehicle retail unit sales increased 12% based on CNW research data. In comparison, during the same period, AutoNation's new vehicle unit sales increased 20%.
The key to our top lying growth is driving operational excellence through the use of leading technology and processes, combined with inventory optimization. Combining with our best-in-class disciplined cost structure, we will continue to drive our industry-leading margins.
We believe that we have a compelling opportunity to create significant value for our shareholders over the next several years as the industry recovers. We have made a major investment of over a half a billion dollars in our company through stock repurchases together with the acquisitions that we announced and our continued reinvestment in our existing stores, reflecting our confidence in AutoNation's financial and operating strength and the long term prospects in the auto industry. The combination of these drivers presents a significant long term growth and value-creation opportunity.
With that, now, I'd like to turn it over to our chief financial officer, Mike Short.

Starting to our financial results for the second quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $62 million or $0.38 per share, versus $50.2 million or $0.28 per share during the second quarter of 2009. Our second recorded results for this year excludes $12.1 million or $0.07 per share of expenses related to debt refinancing costs and the write-off of certain prior deal costs following the refinancing transaction we completed in April.
Our second quarter prior year results exclude a net gain on asset sales of $3.7 million, or $0.02 per share. Adjustments to net income are included in the reconciliations provided in our press release.
Compared to last year, revenue increased $512 million or 20%, and gross profit improved by $57 million or 12%. SG&A increased 6% as variable expenses such as sales commissions increased in line with higher sales volume and gross profit, and we continued to leverage our fixed cost structure. SG&A was 72.5% of gross profit, a reduction of 390 basis points year-over-year, and down 110 basis points sequentially from the first quarter of 2010, reflecting our continued effective management of our cost structure.
Net new vehicle floor plan was a benefit of $4.7 million in the quarter, an improvement of $2.5 million from the second quarter of last year. Non-vehicle interest expense was $14.7 million for the quarter, up from the $10.5 million we reported last year through our refinancing, which closed in April. The refinancing increased our percentage of fixed rate debt and increased our pricing under our revolver in our term loan facilities from LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 225 basis points.
Additionally, during the quarter, we borrowed $195 million under our revolving credit facility. Our second quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.367 billion, an increase of $234 million, compared to the second quarter of last year, and an increase of $257 million, compared to the first quarter of 2010. LIBOR rates were relatively flat, compared with the second quarter of 2009. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $31.9 million or 39%.
I'd like to spend a moment discussing our recent share repurchase activity. We remained bullish on the long term prospects in the auto industry. And during the second quarter, we repurchased nearly $21 million shares for $414 million, at an average price of $19.83 per share.
We ended Q2 with $149.3 million shares outstanding, down from the $169.9 million we reported at the end of Q1. We currently have $146.4 million shares outstanding. And our Board has authorized an additional $250 million for future share repurchases.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $26.2 million. And our CapEx for the year remains at $150 million. We remain within the limits of our financial covenants, with a leverage ratio of 2.66 times at the end of the quarter. Our indebtedness number in this calculation is not on a net debt basis. If we had applied to cash on our balance sheet, plus the cash available from our used inventory flooring to reduce our debt, we would have lowered the ratio to below 2.4 times, compared to our limit of 3.25 fines.
As our EBITDA grows during the recovery, we will generate additional investable funds over time. We have the strongest balance sheet in our segment, and have always prudently managed our covenants. And we will continue to do so going forward.
Our capitalization ratio measures floor plan debt plus none vehicle debt, divided by total book capitalization. Floor plan debt was $1.488 billion at quarter end, up $61 million for March 31st, 2010. As of June 30th, the capitalization rate was 45.1 %, well within the covenant requirements of 60%. As a result of our April refinancing, the capitalization ratio now eliminates the impact of any goodwill franchise rights and property impairments subsequent to January 2007.
Our quarter end cash balance was $101.6 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in the healthy total liquidity of $486 million at the end of June.
As we discussed on last quarter's call, during the second quarter, we closed on our refinancing of the company's capital structure. These refinancing transactions extended our debt maturities, increased our available liquidity, and lowered our exposure to interest rate increases in the future, and provided us with additional flexibility to manage our business and optimize our capital allocation.
During the second quarter, $20 million before tax was expense related to our refinancing transactions, including $4 million for the write off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our old notes in our prior credit agreement.
Now, let me turn you over to our president and chief operating officer, Mike Maroone.

Compared to the period a year ago, AutoNation delivered impressive 20% growth in new and used unit volume and a strong operating margin of 4%. We're very pleased with this performance given the difficult economy. The key drivers of our solid performance remain disciplined inventory and cost management, and focus on our best practices that are in place to delight customers and deliver results. Our goal is to outperform the market as the economy recovers. And we're doing just that.   
With a more aggressive operating risk profile, our inventory is in great shape, and our sales efforts are growing volume profitably. Higher gross, coupled with flat headcount year-over-year, has also led to higher productivity and strong rewards for our value associates.
Starting to detailed results, I'll begin with our segment performance. At a $116 million, our total segment income increased $25 million or 27%, compared to the quarter a year ago, with the domestic segment being the largest contributor. All segments benefited from volume growth and increased revenue per vehicle.
As I continue, my comments will be on a same store basis unless noted otherwise. I'll begin with new vehicles, where according to CNW research, the industry grew 12% in the quarter at retail, compared to AutoNation at plus 20% year-over-year for total stores with 52,000 new vehicles sold. Domestic volume increased 30%, followed by imports up 16%, and premium luxury up 15%.
Looking at key states, we had year-over-year unit increases on a total store basis of 25% in California, and 21% in both Florida and Texas. Our vehicle type, full-sized pickup trucks grew 39% year-over-year; cars grew 17%; and, other light trucks, including CUVs, grew 16%.
Change to our revenue for new vehicle retail was $32,000, an increase of $1,200 or 4%, compared to the period a year ago as demand for full-sized pickups grew as did vehicle content. Gross profit for new vehicle retails increased $107 or 5% to $2,096 per vehicle. With 37, 600 units in inventory, new vehicle base supply at June 30th was 55 days, compared to 53 days a year ago, and 51 days at March 31st.
On the used side, we retailed 40,000 used vehicles, a strong increase of 19%, compared to a year ago, and a solid use to new ratio of 0.78. Revenue per used vehicle retail was $17,400, up $1,100 or 7% as supply of used vehicles remained tight. Other contributing factors were a slight shift in mix toward premium luxury and our certified pre-owned mix increasing to one-third of our used sales in the quarter, compared to 30% a year ago.
The $1,624 gross profit for used vehicle retail was up $42, compared to the period a year ago. The decline was offset by continued growth of F&I, PBR on used vehicles. In the quarter, we noted a 27% increase in appraisals, and a 35% increase in trade and acquired, compared to the period a year ago with nearly a 50% close ratio on potential trade-ins appraised, compared to 45% a year ago.
At June 30th, our used vehicle day supply was 45 days. If $541 million same store revenue for part service and collision increased 2%, compared to a year ago, the gross profit improved 1% to $237 million. Customer pay revenue was essentially flat year-over-year, and up 1% when adjusted for selling days, compared to the first quarter. We continue to work on strengthening this area of our business through service marketing initiatives.
In the quarter, a 7% decline in warranty revenue was more than offset by a volume-driven 21% increase in internal and public. Trading is in progress for our customers facing service associates that centers on proper handling of phone calls as well as appointment setting and preparation, all in an effort to drive more customer traffic, enhance the customer experience, and improve sales and service retention. In addition, we continue to actively sell prepaid maintenance programs as a retention tool.
Turning to finance and insurance gross profit for vehicle retails of $1,137 was up $12 from the period a year ago. Note that in the period a year ago, we had a gross profit benefit of $67 per vehicle retail from a favorable charge-back reserve adjustment due to reduced exposure. Excluding that, our gross profit for vehicle retail this quarter grew by $55, reflecting a strong performance for our F&I team.
Our preferred lender network, OEM service contract alliances, strong product penetration, and store level execution continue to drive growth in this area. In addition, increasing volume resulted in lower F&I charge backs as a percent gross profit.
The credit environment was favorable, compared to a year ago. We noted an increase in approval rates by the majority of captives as well as the majority of our preferred bank lenders for all customer segments, prime, near-prime, and subprime. However, the subprime segment, while improving, remains challenging.
At June 30th, our store portfolio was unchanged from Q1 with 204 stores and 249 franchises in 15 states. We're extremely pleased to have entered into an agreement to acquire Mall of Georgia Toyota and Mall of Georgia Hyundai in the Atlanta market. This is in addition to the acquisition of a Hyundai store in Seattle earlier this month. Together, the three stores represent an annual revenue run rate of nearly $200 million.
Our corporate development team continues to aggressively pursue acquisition opportunities that meet our market and brand criteria as well as our return on investment objectives. We are committed to outperforming the market as the economy recovers.
In the quarter, we achieved peer group leading operating margin of 4%, and high levels of customer satisfaction for both sales and service. Looking ahead, we are enthusiastic about the recovery underway. We remain focused on continuous improvement holding our low-cost position and advancing our capabilities.
I'd like to take a moment to thank all AutoNation associates for their contributions to an excellent quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson.

For our year-to-date, through June, new vehicle retail sales at AutoNation are up 19%, and the industry, according to CNW, is up 10%. And as we look forward, we believe the gradual improvement in new vehicle sales will continue. We expect third quarter 2010 new vehicle industry sales will be over 11,500,000. And we'll surpass the third quarter 2009 new vehicle sales, even though the prior year included the highly successful cash for clunkers program. We believe the fourth quarter will exceed $12 million.

Our hats at the management team are off to all of our associates who are really responsible for helping us manage this on a day-to-day basis.
In terms of how we think about SG&A, when you look at our cost structure, approximately 50% of our SG&A is what we classify as variable. And again, these definitions of variable in fact are not as clean as the words might imply. But those variable costs we see as generally rising with our overall sales pace and gross profit improvement. But again, as Mike Maroone pointed out, we're very focused on productivity measurements. And so we hope - we expect that there're some opportunities to improve even in that rate going forward.
The balance of our costs, the other 50%, is fixed. And fixed costs have some inflationary-type pressures on them. You can imagine that in some of our geographies, states or local municipalities are trying to generate some revenues, and whether that comes in the form of property tax increases. Those types of things are - would normally generate a slight increase on those fixed cost, which we work very hard with our productivity initiatives to try and improve.
As you think about what our initiatives are going forward, bucket them into three general categories. One is productivity improvements that would help us mitigate any changes in the rate of increase in our variable costs. And secondly, I think within the - our fixed cost structure, we were very focused on trying to leverage our position as the nation's largest by our purchasing activities. And third is the investment that we have in our shared service center, which I think will continue to generate ongoing savings for us and certainly help us offset any increased pressure there might be on the fixed cost side.

I'm very impressed that we have the capability to look at projects that take five to six years to bear fruit, and invest in them, and grind out with tenacity what it takes to get those structural cost savings, which then, John, to your point, we have them. And you see without the company's performing now on the revenue side that it leads to enhanced performance. We're getting more - we're getting the ability to perform better in the marketplace for our customers at the same time that we're taking our cost structure down. It's very different than what everybody else is doing.

I think it's just going to take time. If I look at the recovery and the way I characterize it is as follows, '09 was the great depression as far as the absolute sales number, with the number dramatically reduced to the withdrawal credit. The only way you can get down below $10 million is deprive customers of credit. And 2010 is the foundational year for the real recovery. But even though we're going out on $11.5 billion, that's still a depression level, and the components of moving from under $10 billion to under $11.5 billion, all revolve around the improvement in credit.
For the recovery to have to hit its stride, you're going to need higher levels of employment and additional stability over housing, which I don't think you can really get this year. And I really don't think the industry should try to force it this year. So going back to production levels, I think the discipline is the right thing to do. But I'm very confident that just with more time, the employment and the housing situation is going to improve, and the stage has been set for additional levels of recovery back to 15 million, 16 million years - 15 million, 16 million units per year. So I think it's just going to take more time.
Now, what excites me, though, is that with this more rational approach to the business, the profit opportunity on the way back up is really quite extraordinary vis-à-vis what it was pre this downturn. So I think the industry, both at retail at the manufacturer level, have really taken this horrible, painful thing we're going through and transform the industry. So I think the profits at each level of recovery are going to be much higher than anyone thought could ever be possible. And I think it's very positive for the industry. So I applaud the industry for just saying, ""It's going to take some time, let's give it sometime. But in the meantime, let's do everything we can. As it takes hold, we take full advantage of it.""

I estimate, in the past, that was about 15% of pickup trucks that's been dramatically reduced. This is really a small business in America that a year ago, so very dim prospects for the business, had difficulty getting credit for both their business, saw their customers having difficulty having credit. And even if they want a new pickup truck, we had difficulty getting them credit. And that really exaggerated the constriction of the pickup truck market.
Today, that's more business entrepreneur feel. It has better prospects. The vehicle really needs to be replaced. The difference in capability is what they get with in today's pickup truck to what they're driving. It's considerable. And they're coming in. And so, it's this combination of better prospects with available credit.
So, John, to complete - going back to your earlier question when I then say, ""Okay, let's just give that time."" I think when it comes to that same person making decisions about employment and the kind of work they think they're going to have, that's when I say, ""Okay, sometime later this year, sometime in 2011, you're going to see much better employment numbers, much better construction numbers.

So I think the used car business is a big opportunity. The market used is double what the market at new is. And I think 0.78, we can move even better level going forward.

Thank you for joining us. Today we reported third quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.39, an 8% increase, compared to adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.36 in the prior year, which included the highly successful Cash for Clunkers program. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we have seen a solid increase in revenue and adjusted EPS year-over-year. 
Third quarter 2010 revenue totaled $3.3 billion, compared to $2.9 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 13%. And we had increases in all of our revenue categories. In the third quarter, total US industry new vehicle retail unit sales decreased 4% based on CNW Research data. In comparison, during the same period, AutoNation new vehicle unit sales increased 1% on the same store sales basis and 3% including acquisitions.
Also on the third quarter, our AutoNation has strong performance in used vehicles with retail units up 25%. In the third quarter, we continue to see a gradual recovery in the auto industry. With the second consecutive quarter, we saw strength in the domestic lead by Ford and Chevrolet, which make up the vast majority of our domestic portfolio.
On a sequential basis, new vehicle margins were lower for the Japanese imports. We saw a share shift back towards domestic, especially Ford. Traditionally, Japanese import inventories have trended higher adding to the margin pressure. Going forward, we'd expect margins to stabilize.
We believe that upcoming elections on November 2nd, 2010 will be a pivotal event as a change in Washington will result in improved (inaudible) and consumer sentiment and continue to improve the outlook for the auto industry and the recovery. 
I'd now like to turn over to our Chief Financial Officer Mike Short.

112302,114142513,82841,"AutoNation Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $58.5 million or $0.39 per share versus $64.4 million or $0.36 per share during",662,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $58.5 million or $0.39 per share versus $64.4 million or $0.36 per share during the third quarter of 2009, an 8% improvement on a per share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in the third quarter of 2010 or 2009.
Compared to last year, revenue increased to $382.9 million or 13% despite a challenging Q3 2009 comparison due to Cash for Clunkers. Gross profit improved by $35.8 million or 7%. We experienced an increase in volume related expenses such as advertising and compensation in the quarter. Additionally, pressure on new and used vehicle margins adversely affected SG&A, which was up 7% for the quarter in line with gross profit. Additionally, impairment charges of $2.8 million were recorded primarily related to properties held for sale based on an analysis of current market conditions for those properties. 
Net new vehicle floor plan was a benefit of $4.7 million for the quarter, a decrease of $2 million from the $6.7 million benefit in the third quarter of last year. Non-vehicle interest expense was $16.1 million for the quarter, up from the $10.2 million we reported in the third quarter of last year through our refinancing which closed in April this year. The refinancing increased our percentage of fixed rate debt from 33% to 46% at the end of the end quarter and it increased the pricing under our revolver and term loan facilities from LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 225 basis points.
During the quarter, we drew an additional $15 million under our revolving credit facility resulting in $210 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at the end of the third quarter. Our third quarter non-vehicle debt balance was $1.381 billion, an increase of $266 million, compared to the third quarter of last year, and an increase of $13 million, compared to the second quarter of 2010. LIBOR rates were relatively flat, compared with the third quarter of 2009.
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $35.1 million or 37.5%. This reflects the benefit of certain favorable tax adjustments.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for $55 million in an average price of $19.08 per share. We ended the third quarter with $148 million shares outstanding. During the third quarter as previously discussed, we acquired a Honda and a Hyundai -- I'm sorry, Toyota and a Hyundai dealership in the Atlanta market and a Hyundai store in Seattle for $60.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million. And our CapEx estimate for the year remains at $150 million.
We remain within the limits of our financial covenants with a leverage ratio of 2.64 times at the end of the end of the quarter. Our indebtedness number in this calculation is not on a net debt basis. If we had to apply the cash on our balance sheet plus available borrowings from our used inventory to reduce the debt, we would have lowered the ratio to under 2.4 times, compared to the limit of 3.25 times.
As our EBITDA grows during the recovery, we will generate additional investable funds over time. We have the strongest balance sheet among our peer group. And we carefully manage our covenants, and we'll continue to do so. 
Our capitalization ratio measures floor plan debt plus non-vehicle debt divided by total book capitalization. Floor plan debt was approximately $1.6 billion at quarter-end, up approximately $150 million from June 30th, 2010. As of September 30th, the capitalization ratio was 46.1%, well within the covenant requirements of 60%.
Our quarter-end cash balance was $85 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in a healthy total liquidity of $474 million at the end of September. 
Now, let me turn you over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Maroone.

112302,114142513,82841,"AutoNation Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. In the quarter, AutoNation aggressively grew new and used market share, revenue, and total gross profit for delivering a solid operating margin of 3.7%. We are pleased with this performance. And note that the period a year",1306,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. In the quarter, AutoNation aggressively grew new and used market share, revenue, and total gross profit for delivering a solid operating margin of 3.7%. We are pleased with this performance. And note that the period a year ago included the government's Cash for Clunkers program, which impacts retail sales and gross margin comparisons in the current period.
Beginning with our segment performance at $110 million, total segment income was in line with the quarter a year ago. Domestic segment income at $43 million increased $10 million or 29%. Premium luxury of $48 million was up $4 million or 10%. And import segment income of $51 million declined to $12 million or 18%. As I continue, my comments will be on a same store basis unless noted otherwise. 
In the third quarter, we retailed 54,900 new vehicles, an increase of 1%, compared to the period a year ago and favorable to the industry, which was down 4% according to CNW Research. We were able to capture profitable market share, utilizing aggressive advertising, time to take advantage of great inventory mix and value conscious consumers. On a total store basis, domestic volume increased 15%, premium luxury increased 3%, and import volume was off 3%. 
By vehicle type, full sized pick-up truck volume grew 39% year-over-year and car volume dropped 9%, both impacted by Cash for Clunkers in the period a year ago when consumer focus was on small, fuel-efficient vehicles. In the current quarter, other light trucks, including CUVs, grew 7%. 
Same store revenue for new vehicle retail was $31,800, an increase of $2,100 or 7%, compared to the period a year ago due to increased vehicle content and a mix shift toward trucks.
Gross profit for new vehicle retailed of $1,995 was off $186 or 9% driven in part by our pursuit of profitable market share in the current quarter, margin pressure on imports, particularly import cars as well as the supply and demand dynamic that followed Cash for Clunkers that had a positive impact on gross profit in the period a year ago.
While we expect new vehicle margins to be stable going forward, I'll note that we expect to recognize a total of about $20 million of certain performance-based manufacturing incentives over the next two to three quarters primarily related to premium luxury vehicles previously sold. This amount is incremental and will benefit our new vehicle margins during this timeframe. I'll also note that the approximate $20 million pre-tax benefit from these incentive-based programs is a net amount as related cost were expensed at the time the vehicles were sold. 
On an ongoing basis, we anticipate the benefit to overall gross profit for new vehicle retail will be approximately $30. In September 30th, new vehicle day supply was 57 days or 41,800 units, compared to 48 days a year ago and 55 days at June 30th.
On the used side, we retailed 42,000 used vehicles delivering an impressive unit increase of 24% and revenue increase of 29%, compared to year ago. Our used to new ratio in the quarter was 0.77, compared to 0.63 a year ago. The $17,100 revenue per used vehicle retails increased $760 or 5% driven by the domestic and premium luxury segments.
Gross profit for used vehicle retail was off 7% or $111 to $1,579, compared to the quarter a year ago. Contributing factors were our pursuit of profitable market share, which is in line with our strategy on new vehicles; increased acquisition costs; conservative lender advances; and, a strong effort to recondition in retail more higher mileage, lower-priced vehicles. At September 30th, our used vehicle days supply was 46 days. 
I'd also like to share that in the quarter, we expanded an additional used vehicle offering that we piloted in Q2 to address the continued tightening of used vehicle supply as well as consumer demand for lower-priced vehicles. These outlets are in centralized locations at select stores within our existing markets. They offer a wide selection of value-priced vehicles that we would traditionally wholesale. Our objective is to retail a greater percentage of trade-ins and fill a strong market demand. It's a no haggle environment with vehicles backed by worry-free attributes such as money-back guarantee. 
In the quarter, the average selling price at these locations was $7,800. Our Value Vehicle outlets were selected based on location, brand, access to real estate, and service capacity. At this time, we have a total of 16 value vehicle outlets, with six more scheduled to be in operation by the end of the first quarter of 2011, which will bring us to a total of 22 Value Vehicle outlets.
Turning to parts, service, and collision, same store revenue of $552 million and gross profit of $240 million, both increased 4%, compared to a year ago. In the quarter, warranty revenue was flat, compared to a year ago bucking a long-term trend of declining warranty revenue. We attribute this to the increase in manufacturer recalls. We also noted a 22% increase in internal revenue in the quarter. 
Customer pay revenue increased 2% year-over-year, resulting from ongoing service marketing initiatives and increased focus on the retail opportunities in our service departments. We remain keenly focused on growing our customer pay business and also in customer retention. Relative to gross profit, improvement in the quarter was driven primarily by a 21% increase in internal gross as we prep [ph] more and new vehicles for sale. Warranty gross increased 4%. And customer pay gross was relatively flat. Customer pay service comprised 43% of our parts and service gross profit, warranty accounted for 18%, and internal accounted for 16%.
Results for finance and insurance were positive with gross profit for vehicle retail to be $1,134, reflecting an increase of $63 or 6%, compared to a year ago. 
The credit environment was again favorable, compared to a year ago. We noted an increase in approval rates by the majority of the captives as well as the majority of our preferred bank lenders for all customer segments, and in particular for near prime. However, loans for sub-prime customers, while improving, remain challenging.
Our preferred lender network, OEM service contract alliances, strong product penetration, and store level execution continue to drive our strong F&I performance. In the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Toyota Mall at Georgia, Hyundai Mall at Georgia and Hyundai of Seattle, along with one divestiture. Our store portfolio at September 30th stood at 206 stores and 251 franchises in 15 states. Our corporate development team continues to seek acquisition opportunities that meet our market brand criteria, as well as our return-on-investment objectives. 
I'll also share that AutoNation has received seven Fiat locations, all on our existing markets and will be the largest Fiat dealer in the US. We look forward to exploring other opportunities with Fiat and Chrysler. 
In closing, our stores performed at a very high level in the quarter driven by strong associate productivity. In fact, on a year-to-date basis through Q3, same store total revenue is up 16%, and headcount is relatively flat compared to the same timeframe a year ago.
In the quarter, we also experienced significant new and used vehicle market share gains. Record CSI performance is measured by manufacture benchmarks and a low associate turnover. We're continuing to invest in facilities, training, and technology to drive even a higher level of performance in the years ahead. 
We're also pleased with our year-to-date performance, where on a total store basis, revenue is up 17%, new and used unit volume is up 16%, and adjusted earnings per share is up 28%. We remain committed to outperforming the market as the economy recovers and thank our 19,000 associates for their dedication to providing a superior customer experience and shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike Jackson.

For year-to-date through September, new vehicle retail sales at AutoNation were up 13% and the industry, according to CNW, was up 4%. As stated last quarter, we expected third quarter 2010 new vehicle industry sales will be over $11.5 million. And that came in as $11.6 million. We also said our third quarter would equal or surpass third quarter 2009 new vehicle sales, even though the prior year included the highly successful Cash for Clunkers program. And we achieved that with a sales increase of 1%.
We still believe that the full year 2010 new vehicle unit sales will be in the range of 11.5 million units. That means the fourth quarter will average approximately 12 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis. In the month of October, sales are tracking towards this space. On November 4th, 2010, we're going to have our October new vehicle sales.

When you look at SG&A within the quarter, it was up $27 million or 7% in line with the increase in gross profit. Within that would be a couple of drivers. The Mall of Georgia acquisition added about $4 million to our SG&A line. A couple in line with gross, generally we see some leverage in there because there are certain elements of store compensation that are fixed. We didn't see that this quarter because the lower margins offset that. 
Advertising was up more than gross profit within the quarter on a year-to-year basis. You first we talked about our initiative to drive share. And also, remember that last year, we didn't have to advertise quite as much because there was a raise in natural demand because of the Cash for Clunkers initiative.
Other SG&A is up a little bit as well, about 4%. Within that, you've got things like deferred maintenance that we're catching up on a little bit as we come out of the downturn. We indicated previously that some of that would come back higher accruals for bonuses given the strong performance that we've had so far this year. And then, the additional training I think that was core level.
At a high level, you're right. We strive for and are dedicated to continuing to generate leverage in our operating cost structure. And we'll continue to do that. And I think as you've heard the comments earlier about stabilization and margins, we look forward to being able to generate that level of operating leverage once we get to the more stable margin (inaudible).

But I'm just wondering, as you look at this two, three years down the line, and hopefully new vehicle sales have recovered significantly at that point, is this the kind of operation that might get lost as you get this leverage on the new vehicle side? And is this real ramped-up focus just a function of the stronger used car market and the weaker new car market? Or is this something that you think is going from 16 locations to 22?

As soon as their -- our bottom turned and we knew we're on a recovery, we might not know the angle of the recovery. But no question we're on a recovery, we switch to a very aggressive mode.

And I'm not going to hit the brakes to enhance short term profitability. In return, we're giving up our momentum of significantly taking share for quite a number of quarters in a row.

I think the driver this year certainly is internal gross in recalls and we are seeing a small lift in customer pay. We've also seen stock -- an end of the deterioration of warranty.
