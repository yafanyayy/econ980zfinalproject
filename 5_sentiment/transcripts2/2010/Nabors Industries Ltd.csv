Again, welcome everybody to the conference call and the fourth quarter and the full calendar year. I want to thank you again for participating this morning. As usual, we have posted to the Nabors' website a series of slides that contain details about the performance of the various segments of the company. Please refer to these as we proceed because I'm not going to get into the specific details. What I'd like to do is to briefly comment on the quarter, mention several important developments worth summarizing that occurred during the year, then briefly review from probably 10,000 feet each business unit where it's at and where it's likely to go. Following my comments, we'll be focused on non-GAAP results and frankly, I expect my comments this morning to be reasonably shorter than what we've had in the past.First quarter, as we suggested in our pre-release, our fourth quarter results came in a little better than estimates. We had projected something better than 16 and came in at 18s, excluding non-cash charges. Operating income for the quarter was $133 million, which was remarkable considering we had a significant decline in our international operations, which more than offset by sequential increases in all our other units, including seasonal increases in Canada and Alaska.These results map the first sequential improvement we have witnessed since the third quarter of '08. This almost certainly confirms that the third quarter of '09 was the bottom in this cycle. Our Rig business other than international oil saw our improvements during the quarter and we think international will stabilize in the first quarter and improve significantly as the year progresses, which we'll elaborate on a little later. Let me mention a couple of 2009 items that I think are worth recapping. First, we did a financing early in the year, January of $1.125 billion. Looking back at what we saw in the fourth quarter of '08 and the beginning of '09, we saw our almost $3 billion of short-term debt maturing before May 15, 2011. Business looked bad, bank and borrowing in the public market looked inaccessible and we were really happy to get this debt [ph] a lot, albeit we paid a price that represents an insurance premium namely, 9.25% interest.But how that's evolved has been pretty favorable. First place, we paid off $1 billion, we brought back $1 billion of the $2.75 billion that matures in 2011 at roughly $130 million of savings, and we paid out to $225 million of debt and we're still siting with $900 million of cash and equivalent. And the credit markets are opened, really wide open, we almost get bothered by requests to do a straight debt, convertible debt, every -- things like that. We don't need it and we will probably get a revolver, which we don't have yet. But basically, the picture now is we'll be almost certainly be able to pay off totally the remainder of the $1.75 billion convertible debt in May 11 without any incremental borrowing. When we do that, our debt to capital ratio will be down to the high-20s and more important, we'll have the fire power to continue to do attractive investments, take advantage of attractive investment opportunities either organic or otherwise. Our rig performance last year was another feature worth commenting on. Our rigs continue to perform between very well and extremely well. And our new rigs sustains themselves regularly. 100% of our U.S. PACE rigs are really working and committed. Some of the highlights that lead me to this overall position is we continue to achieve greater levels of success with the major oil companies and other discriminating, utilizes or uses of rigs. We performed 100% in shelves Land Drilling in the U.S. and Canada. We do about 80% of DPs[ph] work and drilling work in the Lower. We haven't had in the past successful events, but we had our first land rig in Lower 48 working for them and we've had kind of, I'd say, extraordinary success with their highly sensitive, highly technical project in Alaska, Point Thompson project. And if you want, Dennis will be happy to send you a release they put  out citing the technical boundaries that were extended with this well and how we performed extremely well on it. We've also been selected by Exxon to work on that. Pretty important in high profile Papua New Guinea LNG work, which is actually two rigs. So I think we'll go from zero to pretty significant position with Exxon, even in the Lower 48, as frankly we did DP from being shut out essentially three years ago to having almost 100% of the incremental work and 80% of the total work.Currently, we have more than 50% again of the rigs working for majors in the Lower 48, and we do more than 50% of the total horizontal drilling in the Lower 48. And before we get into the details, what our technology provided by Canrig and epic products continue to enhance our overall image and our drilling results. Now let me take a couple of minutes to give you a very big picture for each of our units.Nabors offshore, we actually have 100% of the deepwater platform rig market next to the innovative features of our margin technology. As we mentioned earlier, we're involved in the last conference call, we have two Front-End Engineering Design or FEED studies. First of their kind, 4,500 horsepower platform rigs on deep water start-up platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. We're pretty close to having one of them and the other one is pending but we're pretty optimistic.  One or both of these awards will contribute pretty dramatically to our longer-term results probably starting in 2012. But basically, with technology in that organization is good, there are barge rigs that are few but technologically advanced. And things like the Davy Jones finally, we could drill well.Canada. Canada is financially a worst-performing unit. But still, there are reasons for optimisms. In very brief summary, I think it's rare to observe as of the situation that a very significant part of the future Canada drilling is going to be the British Columbia shales. And in the British Columbia shales, Nabors has a 40% market position compared to a 10% market position or less overall now. So our fleet is geared to it, so I would say, if future we have 40 and the present is 10, we're looking at the progress there from the most broadest possible viewpoint. Even when the P&L results are short-term and dismal in Canada, we still benefit from for example, the technology developed there. An important case in point is the highly successful coiled tubing which is developed there. And now we have a big one, very successful and working in Alaska, which we'll talked about. And these rigs soon will be deployed at least highly possible in Australia and I'd say that likely in the Middle East.International, international we have really the broadest and deepest infrastructure of any contract drilling in the world. Although the nature of this business is such that this unit will always be characterized by fits and starts. However, the overall growth and demand for oil, and increasing difficulty in offsetting declining production leads us to concur with most people, including the future's curve that oil is going to be going upward from here over the term. And that is the main driver for performance in this unit. Although 2009 was disappointing, this unit grew a compound annual growth rate of 27% for a year between 200 and 208. And up I'm pretty confident that we'll get back pretty quickly to significant levels of growth, probably not compound 27% for the next 10 years. Nabors Well-Servicing, the upward trend in crude pricing should also benefit Nabors Well-Servicing. Hence, I would guess approximately 70% of their debt units revenue are driven by oil prices. The fact that the market is finally recognizing the quality of our millennium rigs where we've taken it and have the ability to effectively market them is only going to enhance the future. These are the only PACE rigs in the market. I also agree with the consensus that with a lot of the sell side it has, that this oil-based market, the whole work over the market will get better beginning in the second half of 2010 and should be in pretty good shape by 2011. We are also currently making some significant changes in the management of this unit to address current issues and more importantly, to prepare for the upturn which we think is very likely.Nabors Drilling USA. Operating income, there's no getting around it. It's clearly enhanced by the fact that we signed a bunch of long-term contracts when pricing and markets were better. These contracts are leading us and will eventually end of this original. This tends to bring income down and what's going to happen and what is happening is this decline will be offset, I can't tell exactly when, with increased utilization of existing rigs, higher than our target prices for redeployed rigs and actually new builds. We actually have contracts for four new builds in addition to four or some of the new builds that we haven't yet delivered this year.And those rates are good and also the same factors that costs are coming down a little bit and investment costs are coming down a little too, so we can get a good return at lower margins and these new rigs are at par at good margins. Our PACE rigs are fully utilized, suggested market's broad prices in general are improving, and term contracts are being signed even for existing rigs. Particularly, the better rigs or at least the rigs that can perform in tight markets like the Bakken.  All of these will drive performance in this unit back up. I can't say without question when the cross over will occur, when we'll start tilting it because the new work and the new performance, and the new requirements were high-end shale rigs will more than offset by the decline and runoff of the existing contracts. But that will happen, that point of reflection will happen and my guess is in the second half of 2010. Alaska. In Alaska, the results will decline in 2010. This year was a record year, but that's history. The decline in 2010, although it's clear to practically everybody, except the survey that checks these things, that we have found our way to best operations in Alaska. We have the only AC drilling rig in Alaska working for Pioneer and it's working superbly. We have, what I mentioned earlier, we have a big coiled tubing unit i.e. 5,000-meter capacity, setting all kinds of records. And that probably will be the tool of the future. I'd be unpleasantly surprised if around at least two more of these units completed in the next nine months or a year committed to and I'll be disappointed if it's not to us. And I've already mentioned the Exxon Point Thomson accomplishments. Some of this, disaggregate and also, we have a pretty good safety record i.e., very good safety record and performance for EP where we have many of our rigs working, they're happy.  So the outlook short-term PNOIs [ph] is bad, but the infrastructure for long-term favorable growth is there. Our other operating units keep modest increase and we expect next quarter will be favorable, largely through the third party sales of Canrig. As I mentioned earlier, some of the technology is really significant and is making a little money on its own but more important, enhancing Nabors' repetition generally and enabling us to enter markets. For example, I think in Iraq and I'll talk to Iraq in a second, I think the fact that we sold a lot of the technology to the Italian company that sold them rigs so they have our top [indiscernible].  I mean, we really didn't need much help to succeed but there's a little bit help. Let me talk about Oil and Gas. A lot of people, I mean, oil and gas has been a negative in fact, on our stock for a long time. And I'd like to tell you briefly what our assets are, what the book -- what we paid for them, what our total investment is and what the book value is after all these impairments, and what we think the fair market value is. The most significant investment is our investment in NFR, that's the joints -- that's with our joint venture with First Reserve, that's the domestic one. They have probably 75% to 85% of their operations are in shales, good stuff. They're doing pretty well, they just recently accessed the public market for debt for the very first time. But we've continually have had, and I won't go through the litany of SEC requirements, but we invested half a billion in that thing. We've market down to $112 million according to the SEC rules. And basically, we have one T of E1, we have one T of P2, we have potential beyond that. And even if you say -- and it's good stuff, shales, shaley. So even if you say you're going to get more than $2, something north of $2 for just the P1 alone, our value is worth more than $1 billion, which I think is kind of realistic.I think the second area where we invest is say, Colombia. In Colombia we do it two ways. One, we have Remora, which is our joint venture with First Reserve and our own stuff which is Ramson [ph], which essentially is diggers' operation which preceded the joint venture. And in both of those, we have both $80 million, $81 million of investment. And we had a third-party study, I'm even reluctant to quote the price so I won't quote the price of the valuation. But it shouldn't be hard based on if I discount what they told us they could get for, and this is a hot market because it's all oily and this market is particularly hot for small E&P companies, either recently public or going public. It could be in Toronto, but that's got to be worth at least 450 and that's lower than the estimates we've been given. That's probably the first one that they will market because after this dry season of drilling, we're going to look and see what our alternatives are there. Probably the most sexy one is our Canadian operations. We have essentially an aggregate of 34,000 acres in the Horn River, roughly 12 of those are joint venture with First Reserve and an entity called Stone Mountain. And the other 22-ish are our own and that theologically is generally recognized to be kind of best shale in North America. But it's been remote from market and hasn't been developed super intensely yet although, it probably will be commencing even this winter. But in terms of -- but the other thing that's happening there, is there's a lot of talk including at least one LNG plant to take some of this stuff directly to the Far East and there are a lot of people fishing around gas, couple of Japanese trading companies, so that it's highly likely that they'll have a market value much higher than right now on the domestic futures curve adjusted for the places of managed. So net-net-net, I think that's going to be good and basically, I can't believe we could -- we'd have anything less than $750,000,000 in market value for that. The other thing is we have other U.S. assets of our own. One of which is Alaska. The total U.S. is probably around 160 million, 25 million issue is Alaska and we've got a good find there on how big it will be but it's relatively like crude, relatively a lot of it and things can happen but I can't believe that, that won't be at least twice our investment or isn't worth twice our investment now. And the other stuff is going to be worth at least book. In addition to that, we have pipeline in Canada, which I think will be worth books. So net-net, we have an investment of under 1.2, we have a book value of under seven. And I think we have a market value at least twice our capital, at least twice, maybe more. And the other point is why do we do this? Why do we invest? What are the benefits we get from E&P? First place, we expect to make some money in it. Second place, we get the purple benefits of being associated with -- as a partner with First Reserve, who I think are the primary private equity factor in the whole energy space including this. They're using rigs pretty effectively and on the services from these operations. But perhaps even more importantly, our guys, when they market rigs, they know what the story is and are much more effective at marketing because of our own direct experience. And I think that's the partial explanation why we have 40% market position in British Columbia. Before I conclude, let me take a couple of minutes to mention some of the difficulties we have in forecasting and why we run the risk of either underperforming or overperforming, mostly underperforming our projections. One obvious example is U.S. natural gas prices. There are some pretty intelligent people who are projecting 750 for gas this year and of those people frankly, I respect a lot and there are other people who obviously, pretty reasonable as well, who are projecting and are projecting four to 450. So that can be, from our viewpoint, that can be pretty significant range of what is likely to happen, particularly since not to generally consider us exclusively, North American land driller. That in fact, that's way, way below our income. That's a factor that's beyond our control but I think basically, we could do real well in a range between $6 and $8. And I think we'll probably see that and maybe better. Another example is, for example is Mexico where we have 100 customers. Firstly, we have a very good position there both on land and more particularly, offshore with platform rigs. They'll have a jack-up there but basically, the word was that they were going to increase our Land business. They are going to have a whole bunch of MASE rigs or at least several, and substitute a large number of 2% down as for jack-ups. And as that was progressing, the next thing that happened was funding was basically shut off for everybody, not just us. So when that comes back and how that comes back, is going to be the difference from whether we have a financier there or whether we over perform or underperform. And the forecast, the general forecast, the internal forecast leaves us room to overperform. Similarly, I won't go through all of them but another example is Iraq. I think everybody's aware of the great potential in Iraq and I think, we have tremendous advantage there. For one thing, we've signed our deal with Iraq joined company which gives us kind of an entrée to the company, and kind of preferential service. And that has -- that's one thing. The other thing is we have rigs and crews and all that stuff in Saudi Arabia, which is for a good reason, considered the gold standard of drilling in that part of the world. Altogether, we have really good prospects and it's manifested by a lot of the other integrated services that are coming to us. But there are political and security problems there and how they'll notice, nobody knows. Basically, we have a little bit of that in our forecast but there's a significant room for the upside. Again, I mention these things and there are several others I could mention that give you an indication of how difficult it is to project our business particularly internationally. But I think things can turn quickly and I'm pretty personally optimistic that net-net of all these things, it will end up more positive even in our internal projections. Let me close by saying I'm extremely bullish. I can't say with any degree of certainty when the absolute recovery will remanifest to the whole world. And that's mainly, even though, the business might go up, our stock is still going to be a function of when the crossover recurs in the Lower 48 drilling. When we stepped moving up, when the new work offsets the declining historical work. But I think it could happen sometime this year, second half and I'm looking forward to it."

And secondly, they by the very nature of their business, they have an excess strategy that they come in the deal. I think they won't be an impediment in selling. Frankly, as long as we get an incremental return by waiting, we'll wait. I think the first one that likely is to be monetized is going to be Colombia. And the other issue for the cell site guys is whether we take it as capital gain, maybe even a tax rate or a tax deferred, or tax capital gained or whether we take it as ordinary. And be my guess, do what you like but we look at it the same thing. Whether we make money by producing it, or we make more money [indiscernible] just to sell it all at once, they're interchangeable, tangible from our viewpoint than you guys might consider them. On nonrecurring, the other recurring. But I think Columbia will be first. I think NFR, which is a big one. As I've mentioned, we entered the high yield market. Frankly, I personally blocked some of the debt and I think within some fine odd period of time, whether it's nine months, a year or in fact, depending on the variety of circumstances, we'll go public with that. So that will give us both an opportunity to monetize or at a minimum to evaluate. I think the next likely is going to be our Canadian stuff, which is I say, is probably the sexiest of the stuff. There are buyers in there, there's at least one LNG export plant underway. There are two or any more trainings and more capacity being discussed as we speak. There are rumors of some of the big buyers, some of the big importers like gas, actually tying reserves to do that. I think that might -- we're going to wait until they come to us on that."

But otherwise, it will be cut to the absolute bone for folks like us who just look at the economics, even if we had a producing well, we'd shut it in. So basically, it would be -- even the shales would be pretty dramatically -- for my personal viewpoint, I think they should get impacted even more because if it gets to $4, it's not going to stay at $4. So there's going to be an upward, hoping pretty highly angled forward curve. So if you get a big chunk of your production in the first year.

Again, welcome to the Conference Call for the First Quarter. I want to thank you for participating this morning. As we usually do, we have posted to the Nabors website a series of slides that contain details about the performance of the various segments of the company. Please refer to these notes as we proceed.
Overall, our operating income for the quarter was $138.5 million, which was better than the First Call consensus estimate of $136 million, in spite of a lower -- the significant shortfall in our international operations. The international shortfall was approximately $16 million compared to what the First Call forecast implied. And this, actually, was more than offset by better operating results from Nabors Drilling USA, approximately $11 million more than implied by the consensus, $2.5 million each from Nabors Canada or Nabors in Alaska, and $2 million to $2.5 million in aggregate for our Nabors Well-Servicing, Nabors Offshore and other operating segments.
Earnings per share of $0.21 was in line with consensus when we add back approximately $21 million, $0.07 a share in global line expenses and tax adjustments recorded during the quarter. I'll try to briefly summarize each of these charges. 
About half of the charges were related to a currency devaluation in Venezuela which accounted for approximately $9.3 million. I think it's universal practice for reporting companies to say that those kind of charges are not quarterly charges appropriate to this quarterly-specific result. However, in our case, we actually have some prospect of collecting it, most of this was attributable to a specific customer in Venezuela. That customer wants one or two or maybe even three of incremental rigs. The company wants them pretty badly because he's prepared to guarantee dollar payment on those rigs, i.e. have no bolivar exposure. And also, it seems to be prepared to amortize to some degree the $9.0 million currency if we took. So that's the explanation, and you do what you like with it. 
In addition to which, we had a $4.5 million debt due to a lower end of quarter stock price for HH [Honghua Group Ltd.], the Chinese rig manufacturer. We hold a little more than a 13% interest. Current accounting rules require that when these market prices are down, we mark these things to market. Obviously, or you should understand that when they go up, we don't mark them back. So even though we're taking a hit this time, I think two things I'd like you to keep in mind is that our eight holdings in HH itself represent an unrealized gain, i.e. $56 million gain at current prices, which has not gone through the P&L. And similarly in the past, we had to mark down our holdings in MBIA when the market price went down. Yet at today's market price, well, actually, when I took these notes, the market price was $74. At that price, we would have had a booking of around $27 million and we would have been modestly in the black in terms of capturing cash return. And the price today is more like $78 this year.
I'm not explaining, I'm not arguing anything, I'm simply saying the way the accounting is, there's good explanation with why it isn't really super appropriate to consider the bid on the HH only. The remaining $4 million represent us here represent a spike in the tax rate, which this year was 20% even though the full year is 12%.  This is mainly due to adjustments when we finally filed a tax return in Mexico and Canada compared to what we had estimated. Unfortunately, the tax rate for the company for the year is still low because our North American earnings are low and our U.S. tax return earnings are low and we have the new interest burden on the 9% and the 12% debt that we put on a little over a year ago.
Let me turn in the USA and other business units. Operating income in the Lower 48 was, frankly, a pleasant surprise. What's developed there has been a pleasant surprise. Quarter-to-quarter, we went from $49 million to $60 million on the strap of a $20 million rig increase, affecting the rig count up from 159 in the quarter average to 139 in the prior quarter. The daily margins declined by $720 a day compared to the $1,200 decline we had previously  indicated to a total of $8,400. There is an argument to be made that adjustments might be appropriate on looking at what actually happened in the quarter for two things: One is, everybody knows and we've always said that the first quarter has $275 a day of costs which don't occur in the remaining three quarters because of Federal unemployment taxes and stuff that comes in the first quarter.
The other thing, let me take a couple of minutes to explain. Last year, for a while we have a pretty significant improvement and safety for the company as a whole. So we make provisions for workers' comp and things like that based on the preceding couple of year average. And as we're improving, frankly, pretty sharply enough, we adjust the reserve for the workers' comp. And what we do in the fourth quarter is we have to true up for the whole year. And since we wait until the whole year is over and we don't true it up entirely quarter by quarter, we do it in the year itself. In effect, by making the adjustment in the fourth quarter, we get an accurate number for the year, but it's a disproportionate credit for the fourth quarter. And when we reported earnings, we didn't emphasize that, that was nominal [ph] (14:33) in the fourth quarter. But in any event, however you want to make it, if we adjust for the annual rate of that, that was like $700 per day. That adjustment, on a quarter-over-quarter comparison, that was $700. $275 was the first quarter which we've already said difference which is $975. And if you take $975, in other words, we beat it by $975, which in essence is the amount of the net price increasing period, and we can go through that a little later, but that explains the whole thing. And if you want the comment that rate, fine. If you don't, God bless you.
Despite a [indiscernible] (15:22) and despite a   persistent mode of gas prices, this unit performs better than we and, in fact, I think anybody else expected. Today, we have, I think, 173 rigs working, which is 14 more than we averaged in the quarter. While activity in predominant gas shales is up,  leveling often, and might even decline, we don't know. We continue to see a ramp-up in coal-directed areas like the Bakken in North Dakota and Wolfberry area in the Permian basin. The shale is very more important to us. That kind of shale -- the oil shales are more important, and the oily or liquid-heavy or had been considered the gas shales, they're even more important. We have probably more 1,500-horsepower rigs than anybody in the industry. And actually, some of the mechanical rigs are able to work in some of these plays adequately and these contracts, the gross have pretty good rates. We have pretty got or very good decent electric SCR rigs that are working there, and we have the PACE rigs which are the best. We continue to set records all over the place. We are the leading driller in the Eagle Ford, we've set records there. And I think it's not exaggerating to say we either are -- or assume we probably are already the leading driller in the liquids-rich shales in the United States.
Anyway, in summary, we started out six, eight months ago thinking we'd be lucky to do $150 million operating income in this unit, and we've gradually gone up even compared to six -- compared to the middle of last quarter, we're up $40 million. So we're now -- in fact, we're expecting to do $250 million in this quarter. And the future will be a function of an underlying trend of increasing rates on the spot market for everything, including renewals of PACE rigs to a runoff of the highly-priced rigs that we did two, three years ago.
International. As indicated in my early remarks, this unit is both $21 million below last quarter, the fourth quarter, and $16 million below what we think the First Call estimates imply for this unit. To be explicit and blunt, we now expect this to be in the order of $50 million or $60 million below our prior forecast and to be, frankly, in the neighborhood of $300 million to $310 million. This full year forecast is due to several things, some of which are impacting the whole industry. These include Mexico. We're probably down for the year $35 million in Mexico, where, obviously, fewer rigs are working, and that's basically associated with the PEMEX financing issues which, frankly, affects everybody. I think eventually, they'll resolve those problems. I don't think they have any choice but to do it. And I think were in a very good position with our platform rigs, both the big ones and the bandana-type possibilities and, frankly, time will tell. And I'm not projecting it, but I'm saying 2011 could easily be the best year we ever had here.
The thing that was unexpected and a hit in Saudi Arabia, we had basically been relatively less impacted than the industry by the overall Saudi drop from 144 to 90 rigs, and that we felt we're a little better off there because we were positioned better for gas, et cetera, et cetera. But net net-net, we're going to be down $45 million this year. We're affected by it. Even next year, I expect some improvement, but we won't hit back even in 2011 to where we were to '09, and that's the nature, that's life in the fast lane. That's true for everybody there.
The other area which I originally thought was going to affect us more and it has affected the industry more was Algeria, where we expect that -- we, in fact, we did have a couple of $3 million hit earlier in the year because of the management chaos there. A lot of the government company managers were under investigation or in jail or what have you and contracts couldn't be signed. But basically, all our contracts were signed, all but two rigs were working as of yesterday. And by the end of the year, we'll catch up to where we originally expected to be although, obviously, we could have a little bit more without the government problem.
We expect to see -- we have 18 or so rigs that are scheduled to start up in the next 18 months. In addition to that, had recently I think I can say that the degree of increase has been increased. I would say, Iraq, Kuwait and North Africa are pretty good examples. In Iraq, we agree with everybody else expect that it's going to be a big oilfield. We're making our moves to get there. I think we'll do pretty well. But even though I think we'll do pretty well, our 2011 recovery doesn't include yet much of Iraq. But Iraq then -- and something about Iraq, let me tell you, I think you should wait and see how the contracts are awarded and then wait and see how the performance is on the contract. I think compared to some of our friends and competitors, if we look at earnings and cash flow rather than those volumes on these things.
Canada. Canada, the outlook is still pretty bad, but we did have an improvement in the performance compared to expectations. There was an improvement quarter-to-quarter. We are doing better there. I'm particularly pleased by a recent note we got from a major customer there saying we have the best safety record there in the last two or three years, so not everything is bad there. We expect this quarter to be negative because the breakup again explains that every year, frankly, there's a spring. But we expect to see sequential quarterly improvements for the rest of the year, and I think we lost $7 million altogether in '09. I think we'll probably make with a span of up to $10 million this year and we could do $30 million to $40 million next year.
I'll repeat again that I think the British Columbia shales are going to be a significant part of Canada down the road. And if that's an indication of where Canada Drilling is going, we go from an under 10% market position in all of Canada now to a 40%, 45% position in the British Columbia shales that are drilling good. Nabors Well-Servicing results for this unit, again, were down slightly from the fourth quarter. Again, these units are benefited pretty much like the U.S. did for -- they could be adjusted for workers' comp and in the first quarter hits as we did in the U.S. if you care to. And basically, everything is going in the right direction longer term. I think we're at a point which is long anticipated, decent or, frankly, good price for crude oil is going to be manifested in the business. And in brief summary, if you look at all our public companies, all our public company competitors where only raw service and you can see we're doing really good as well. We hadn't been doing as well for a variety of reasons, mainly, we were a little slow on our trigger with our international operations, but everybody else is now saying that's not going to be a factor. But if you compare our hours, our rates, our deltas, month-to-month, year-over-year, we're doing at least as well as our competitors in that unit.
Nabors Offshore. I won't go through this. This unit is doing pretty good. We're going to have a big improvement this year, even though it's not great, we'll have a 30%, 40% improvement. We still don't have anything further to report on the two front-end engineering things, but I won't cash my chicken before they hatch. But in any event, it's good. 
Oil and Gas. Oil and Gas this quarter significantly improved from the fourth quarter of last year. But this unit still had a modest loss in operating profits. We got stuck with big boy accounting for our stuff, I don't know how we did it, but it was there, where we have successful methods. So basically, you could try to manage those earnings by deferring seismic and things like that, but we decided to go ahead and do what's right for the bottom line as if we didn't have public reporting, but we have minor hits there. However, the important thing is -- I spent a lot of time in the last report indicating what I thought the underlying values might be of our E&P assets and I'll briefly summarize our progress in either monetizing them or proving up what the values might be. 
First thing that we've put is we recently, in fact, this month, completed a $350 million high yield offering, NFR did. So that will enable them to have a pretty robust drilling program and will carry them through beyond mid-2011. And they have talked to a number of customers, investment banks, and the feeling now is that the chances are pretty decent, in fact, pretty good that within a year. In other words, by the end of the first half of 2011, they'll be able to have a public offering in this company with at least a $2 billion, not capped. That's yet to happen, but I think if we have probably something pushing at $6 gas price, that's likely to be the case.
Alaska. The other thing I should mention on that, I'll repeat it, the first thing we're likely to actually sell 100% now is likely to be Columbia. And we have our own acreage there. We have 50% of our joint venture acreage in Remora. This is not new, so you don't have to call Remora, call me. And basically, our partner there has -- it's a private equity fund, and they have an exit plan the day they get in and it's going to be time to do that soon. I don't think that one is going to be a public offering, I think we'll likely to sell that. So I'm just reporting what everybody should have known from the beginning, except that it seems to me now that the values because it's around, because it's intensive interest, particularly among Canadians and that stuff, they would likely to do pretty well.
Alaska. Let me talk briefly about Alaska. I think the important thing there is we're down substantially. The structural outlook is not great, but we're still doing very well in terms of return on capital employed. And also, if you ask most folks, the best thing will true up there. That's exceptionally good and likely to be the tool of the future, whether it's in the kind of drilling, sidetracking, work over or even longer-term work on the heavy oil there. It's modeled on our coal tubing and drilling unit tube which has been phenomenal in every regard, and we recently, or yesterday, had a report that there's a new President of ConocoPhillips up there.  Remember the other guy got caught in a snowmobile accident. And he was reviewing the stuff and he said why don't we have more of these things. Performance is so good, so good in every respect except when we negotiate the price. 
Anyway, the other operating units are still doing well. I think Canrig with the technology arm is doing well, and that's manifested not only by their profit which is pretty decent, but also by their contribution to the technology reputation that we as  a drilling company have. One drilling rig is that reputation per store is, we're $3 million a year, in addition to what they make directly.
Let me summarize quickly. The financial condition of the company is solid. Our cash balance stands at $900 million in cash and equivalents, and another $260 million in sharp and longer-term investments, and this is after funding $155 million in CapEx during the quarter and repurchasing another $110 million of our convertible debt. This brings to around $1.4 billion, the amount of debt we owe, repurchased and redeemed in the last, say, 15 months, which leaves us a balance of $1.57 billion due on our convertible due in May of 2011.
We fully expect to redeem this, and if we had to, we could probably redeem it by squeezing CapEx a little bit more without any new financing, but we do expect to have a revolver, well, probably $500 million in place sometime in the next quarter or two. And we have total complete access to the debt markets and the convertible markets. We now could borrow probably 9% -- at least a few days ago, 5.35%. And we actually did our borrowings at 9.25% when we needed to do it. We got back a little more than half of the access between 9.25% and 5.35% by buying back the convertible debt at a discount. 
Overall, I'm obviously aware of the North American gas prices. I firmly believe that today's prices are not reflective of the cost to replace the commodity in the long-term or even the intermediate term. I remain bullish about gas and its long-term impact on Nabors. I think I've already mentioned that we're adoptable, we're going to go through the liquids-rich gas plays, and we're already the leader on that field. I don't think we can get a  big hit  there, but obviously, our outlook is materially different. There's a two-year average price of $6.50 or $6 or higher or whether it's $4.50. 
We also expect to see pretty substantial improvement in our other oil-based, oil direct businesses, notably Nabors Well-Servicing and Nabors Offshore, but obviously, International is in that category. I know our international results were disappointing, it's adversely affecting our consolidated forecast for this fiscal year. I expect, however, that overall, we'll have a pretty substantial improvement in operating income earnings per share, all the metrics for the company as a whole next year, and I expect it to be stronger internationally. 
Rightly or wrongly, I personally believe this tariff is overweighted as I am in Energy and Nabors. When the stock ramp become vested, the usual option is to get the tax and keep the rest. I haven't been doing that, I've been selling everything, I couldn't see selling below 20 and I personally think it will be higher. That concludes my comments."

We have the wherewithal, I think we have rigs available. We explained a minute ago or five minutes ago how things were dropped off in Saudi, but those rigs are ideal for Iraq. And Saudi drilling has -- that's the gold of platinum standard for all these other countries around. So we have rigs, we have Arabic-speaking crews, but even more than that, if we use that, which we hope and expect to do, we deal with the Iraq drilling company and they have every interest in getting a higher price as they can, and the lower cost as they can, and will piggyback on both of those things.

Now we're up to 750, and we think we can probably come close to paying off the debt. We surely can pay off the debt if we consider a temporary use of a revolver, other financing. It depends on the financial situation on the one hand and the opportunities on the other hand. If  you came to us a year and half ago, or even a quarter ago, if somebody had 90% of a payout in a two-year contract, we probably wouldn't do it, now we will.

But my guess is that EP had a price deck of maybe $50 or something, or maybe $60 and they tested at $40. And I think when the futures get firmed and thickened and trading, I would guess that number is going to go higher. And that unit performs reasonably well, EP is pretty rational. All the operators, they will allocate more capital, and I think that's an oil province. And I think they'll get more capital at $80 than they would have when it was in the high thirties in the last year and a half. So I personally think that will go up whether those guys -- and I think that's a bigger picture than the guys we deal with. They just know that they don't have a budget for this year, and they're hoping something will happen. But I personally think two things will happen. I think there'll be more activity because of better prices, and that better prices include working that heavy, really heavy oil, they have all over the g*****n place there. You need a good price for quite a while to get at that. When you get up to 80 or 90 and people think it's going to persist for a while, then they're going to work that stuff, which they haven't ever. And I think the other big thing is the tool we have, the coiled tubing unit, which actually could ultimately work in these superheavy oil as well. So I think the uplift is lousy for a couple of years, and it's better long term and because of our tool and our overall capabilities, our outlook is pretty poor for the next year or two, come long-term, I personally think it's better.

Again, welcome to our conference call for the second quarter. I want to thank everybody for participating. As usual, we have posted to the Nabors' website a series of slides that contain details about the performance of the various segments of the company. Please refer to these as we proceed. Also, I think, Denny and the business unit has put together a pretty comprehensive earnings release, and I suggest you refer to that too.
Overall, operating income for the quarter was $125 million, which is in more or less in line with the consensus. Earnings per share of $0.19 was essentially in-line with the consensus, which $0.19 includes an approximate $0.04 add-back in items which we feel are appropriately excluded to get a more meaningful non-GAAP product, and I'll go into that a little bit later. 
If I had to summarize my overall feeling for this quarter, I feel that we were involved in what -- pretty close to a perfect storm for our business. A confluence of events that all had significant and negative impacts on our business. And I was frankly pleasantly surprised at the result in the quarter because it was better than I thought it would have been given the external factors. And I think the outlook for the year is better than I would have thought it was, again, given the external factors that constitute the kind of the perfect storm.
Let me go through those very briefly. We had a pretty low-priced for natural gas and still it's a little higher, but still pretty low. And this affected our growing activities in Canada and the Lower 48 and even more so, the valuation of company since we're perceived to be a land gas-centric drilling company. And it obviously also affected of the perception of the value of our E&P holdings, which I'll also talk about a little later. 
Also, the overall worldwide economy is not as robust as it could be, and probably will be, and that influenced the overall demand for hydrocarbons, which didn't affect us, which didn't help us, which hurt us. Also, specifically to our business, which also affected others, there was a confusion in funding for PEMEX in Mexico, which net-net resulted in lack of funding for drilling which funding has to be -- it's internal to Mexico. It's between the government and PEMEX and that sort of thing. But that has to be resolved in the near future, and some say that it's sort of starting to be resolve. But that has had a major negative impact on our operating income obviously from international, and I'll get into that specific later. 
We also had a pretty meaningful drop-off in our oil-directed drilling in Saudi Arabia, which also had a, probably, almost an equal negative impact last year to this year on international's operations. And we don't see short-term growth in natural gas as they're still cutting back oil drilling and we won't see it increase until they do, and this isn't yet offset by natural gas drilling. 
And finally, the spill in the Gulf, which surprisingly since we're, ""primarily a land drilling operation"", has had a negative impact on our offshore operations, which will have a surprising negative impact on our Nabors Offshore operation, which I'll get into when we talk about it.
Let me talk briefly, again, about the non-GAAP EPS and talk about the factors that we think are relevant in adjusting from GAAP to non-GAAP. Let me also emphasize that this is just our view and pretty obviously, each and every investor can adjust these numbers and not adjust them as they go across. The things that we included in the adjustment refers to a $5.1 million foreign exchange loss, which we don't think is continuing and not appropriate to our continuing operation reflection. 
The next item is a loss of $3.6 million. This is sort of hard to understand accounting phenomenon where basically we have debt that's due in 2008, 2011, and we buy the debt back at yields which are no lower than 2% to 2.5% against cash, which we're saving conservatively, holding conservatively at under 0.2% interest. So it's a deal we would do all day long since buying this is just as good as treasuries for us because we're certain we're going to pay it off. Nevertheless, the accounting thing has this value to something well below the 2.5% yield, in other words, we're carrying it on the books at a real low number, which doesn't reflect the market. And then when we buy it at a low-market rate with a higher-than-market yield, it's still below the carrying value and therefore, we have to book a loss, which is not terribly logical. 
Next, we incurred a $2.3 million loss in prior years, which were not appropriate to this period and we're adjusting for that tax adjustment, and that one's specifically tax. We shouldn't have that problem on an ongoing basis. We should get it right the first time. But it's a $2.3 million are not appropriate for this particular quarter. 
And finally, we have an elimination of $1.1 million in operating income, rig income derived from working for our oil and gas joint venture, specifically the [indiscernible]. And this number is going to be bigger for the whole year [indiscernible]. If we make $2 million [indiscernible] for NFR, let's say, where the accounting works half of that sale since we own 50% of the NFR is sales to ourselves and has to be eliminated from GAAP profit reporting, and we take it in a reduction and depreciation and depletion over a longer period of time. But for every single practical purpose, we get the income, we get everything except the accounting that we're adjusting for that in this thing. So that's the story there.
Let me turn quickly to the business units. I think the NDUSA, write up in the quarterly, in the release that you already have, is pretty comprehensive. I think, just let me briefly summarize. The rig count today is 179. We figured the year we're looking to average around 174. We're projecting next year modest increase over that was 192. And in spite of the fact that we are projecting that we'll end this year with a rig count of around 190, so that's a modest increase this year, and even more modest increase for next year. But hopefully, time will tell, and we may be able to improve that.
Overall, as I've said before, our projections for this year have been ratcheting up the internal ones anyway. We started at a pretty low number, maybe a $130 million projection of our operating income for this year. And every time we looked at it but frankly, it's gotten better, so we're now projecting $250 million operating income for this year and a higher number for next year. Where it's conceivable, we will get the number we had in 2009. 
I think the other important thing to note here is that we're getting new build operations. So I think last time we told you we had four new builds for the Bakken and, I think, since then, we did five new builds. PACE had new builds, we have three functional equivalent of new builds in terms of economics with probably even higher return on those really upgraded SCR rigs. And I'd be surprised if we don't have at least five incremental additional new builds to announce by next quarter. So the rigs are doing really well and the proof of the pudding is in customer acceptance. Obviously, we're really dominant in the shale plays, which is important. And we went from, I don't know, probably up 30%, 40% in our rigs working in the shales, the liquid from shales since last quarter. 
Let me switch to NDIL [Nabors Drilling International Ltd.]. We previously forecast our international operations rebounded from the drop we experienced last quarter. Operating income of $65 million represents a nice increase over the $52 million or $53 million operating income in the first quarter. Rig count has increased, margins essentially the same. Improving activity with multiple start ups in Colombian, Kazakhstan. To get to the net cutting here, the real drop in income was in Mexico as previously described the financial conditions. I think, operationally, in terms of quality of rigs, kind of rigs that are needed for PEMEX, we're still in good shape. And we're not disproportionately adversely impacted, except that it's an important market for us. So in plain simple terms, we went down probably $40 million, $45 million in operating income last year to this year because of the funding of [indiscernible]. They'll get cleared. To me, it isn't crystal-clear how quickly we'll go back to where we were even when it is funded. But we will definitely go up. 
Similarly, in Saudi, we almost had a comparable loss, which explains some excuses, but it clearly explains of the drop in international. We also did have probably $40 million or $50 million solid drop in operating income year-to-year. And we probably have 11 stacked rigs there now. We had hope, and are still hoping, that [indiscernible] and make up for it. But that's happened a little slow. So basically that explains why we're down and it's an industry thing. And it hits us, probably a little bit more important, because Saudi and Mexico were more important to us than the average industry. And I think we'll, over a longer period, get back there. But it's not going to be a big recovery. 
Nabors Well-Servicing, we're doing pretty well there. I think the most significant factor there is just the high crude price is finally manifesting itself in demand for workover services, which is also therefore manifesting itself in pricing. So I think that there have been a number of prices instituted by us and others, and that they're continuing to come into play. A lot of these things require a 30-day notices and a lot of price increases are tentative depending on what other guys are -- basically, there's a strong pricing trend underlying the activity that's attributable to the relatively high crude price. And in some cases, we're leading price increases, in some we're following, but that's the most positive sign. So basically, what that means is, that we're going to have probably a strong second half in 2010 but I think in 2011, the stage is set for even a more robust recovery and workover. 
Nabors Offshore, in a sense, we'll probably do something -- we did about $8 million this quarter. Even this quarter, however, was impacted $2 million to $3 million by the Gulf spill. And the Gulf spill manifests itself in two ways, really, one -- I mean, one we have the moratorium and the other we have a delay in getting permits to drill. And whether it's a moratorium or otherwise, or there are no permits to drill, they're not going to drill. And we have six rigs on platforms on SPAR's that are adversely impacted. And some of the jack-ups even aren't working as they might have with permits. 
So basically, if the worse-case scenario, I think, is down $25 million for the year compared to what it would have been without the spill and I think there are hopefully signs that this might be mitigated before the end of the year, but a good in spite the end of the year, we'll do close to $10 million instead of $35 million this year. And next year, I think, we'll do $35 million, plus we still have a bunch of things that we refer to before with one SPAR platform work that will manifest itself in late 2011. And I'll talk a little bit more about that later' 
Nabors Alaska, I guess, it's a declining field. We have not been successful in new builds there for BP. And BP is also -- BP right at the moment controls vast majority of the drilling. The operator are also drilling. And they're cutting back and Nabors was not super successful with BP. But we do have probably the best tool for the future on the Slope and that's a coil tubing unit. And this is something, in other words, this year is down from last year. Next year, probably will be down as well. Not probably, will be down as well.
We still have decent returns on capital employed. But beyond that, I think some time next year, we  get one or two of these coil tubing units, which are not only good for what they're doing now, but they're super good for the shallow high-viscosity drilling that's going to be going on forever on the Slope, while crude price stays even below where it's at now but at a good level when they figure out how to optimize the extraction of those. Anyway, I think the outlook is short-term, down, but long-term, I think, considering it's a defining field, we're in relatively good shape.
Canada, again, this unit has lousy seasonal quarter, and we have a loss. But the loss was less than the obviously, less than the operating profit in the first quarter, but less -- a smaller loss than we expected. So things are doing better than we expected. We'll do better this year. This is the unit that had made as much as $180 million operating income. And I think we have a shot at that, but we won't have a shot at that until gas prices are six-ish or better. Horn River still remains a super bright spot for us in Canada. 
Oil and Gas, I think the major interest in Oil and Gas is what our plans are to monetize i.e. convert these assets, which haven't been doing us much good on a stock-price basis in cash. And I guess, to brief [ph], the situation is, we're three months closer than we were last quarter to number one, going public with NFR. I'll repeat that story briefly. NFR is joint venture, 50-50 with us and First Reserve. We have roughly the lower half $500,000 [indiscernible] invested in it. We expect to go public in less than three quarters, some time in the first quarter next year or second quarter next year. Although if the situation permits, we're prepared to pull the trigger on it. We think right now, we have three or four competent investment banks showing us that unless the world goes to hell in a hand basket, we'll have the equity knot of $2 billion, which means $1 billion for us. And I said, we invested about $500 million. The GAAP, SEC dictated fixed impairments to make our holdings around $115 million, $120 million. So that's essentially where it was before, but things are looking a bit -- our well results are really good there, which is going to help the IPO. 
The second area, which is largely the first area to actually generate cash is Colombia, where we have our own stuff, the kind of Nabors around [ph] on stuff. Now we have E&P, we have 50-50 joint venture with First Reserve. That stuff together is, we're going to market it together, that's about 7,000 barrels a day of oil and a lot pizzazz. There's universal interest in that. And I still expect to sell it before the end of the year. But we now have completed our drilling, which we had completed the dry season drilling last quarter. And we know what we got and what we can sell. In other words, we've increased the reserves, we cut the actual more producibility of our production to sell, and we have more sizzle on discoveries. 
I think the final area is Canada where essentially, which happened since last time as we interviewed, reviewed a number of bankers and we're close to finalizing a deal with the bank and we obviously want a bank who knows the area really well and has real good connections with, we think, the logical buyer, which is the Far East buyer with the liquefied natural gas interests and connections.
I think the other point on this is we are considering now, this is purely accounting, but it would help maybe present it, interpret it as the some of our data, some of our E&P operations can be at this point legitimately considered discontinued operations and therefore, separate it. And the one that is going to be continuing 100%, which is NFR, they're doing really well. It's hidden and secured by our investments in the other one's, which we have -- they're really investments, like seismic is really an investment. We [indiscernible] to write it off. 
Our other segments are doing really well and I'd say, Canrig, in particular, is doing well with its technology and that's manifesting itself in not only profit for Canrig and sales of top drives in the market and stuff like that, but also in enhancing the overall saleability of Nabors' rigs.
In summary, let me talk briefly about -- our financing is in pretty good shape. We have essentially $900 million in cash and equivalent. All of that is not available. Some of it -- a lot of it's tied up. We expect to get some more. But basically, we have enough in the way of cash and earnings over and above relative to CapEx, that we are in pretty decent shape to -- we really wanted to squeeze CapEx. We did come close to paying up the whole $1.4 million remaining in our debt due in May of 2011. Basically, we've taken that debt down from $2.75 million, which it was to $1.4 million. And I think net-net over the last year and a half, we borrowed the $1.25 million in January of '09 to make sure we didn't have a jam. And we paid out net $1.125, plus another approximately $500 million of debt. 
Let me say, I'm bullish, even -- I was always reasonably bullish long term, but now I'm bullish intermediate term and maybe even shorter. Let me go through just a few of the points that lead me to that. I think we have the best infrastructure internationally than anybody has. I mean if you look at it in terms of leading driller in Saudi and biggest private position in Algeria, biggest driller in Yemen, et cetera. And when we get together where we want to get by introducing and integrating, say our line existing operations into that logging and if we are ultimately successful in broadening our scope, I think, intermediate term, that will be a big plus. 
USA-based rigs are doing really well. I have two things I look out as one proof of the pudding in the orders and we're doing super well on new build orders. And the rest of it is, what the most discriminating buyers are doing. I mean 100% of Shell, BP, in the last three, four years, we've had essentially 100% of the incremental work and overall, we have probably 80% of their work. We did, on Exxon, we did probably the most sensitive well drilled in the last year, so which is Point Thomson and that -- in Alaska, and that was a monster, I'd say, success. And we're doing the Papua New Guinea, both of them, which they seem really happy about even though we haven't delivered the rig yet or spudded anything, but I think that's important. I think that will manifest itself with a increased utilization in the states where it hadn't been. 
We, frankly, broke H&P's monopoly on platforms and SPAR rigs with a major consumer, which is, I think, we've talked about the Fil Mosby [ph] where we clearly had the best technology. And I hope not the very best price and we'd have the best technology. So in general I think, if I look at what is fundamental, the important for long term, I'd have a basis for optimism and that covers what I have prepared to say. Thank you."

And with interest on the whole supply chain, however you want to put it, of liquefied natural gas, in other words, some electrical consumer, electrical company consumer in Japan or Korea, they now have an interest in owning a chunk of the whole thing, from the resource to the liquefaction to the transportation.

Unlike the Matsui, Mitsubishi's narrow bendings, putting things like this together and they don't go broke putting it together, like most bankers don't. And it's a kind of demand that we don't have here. And I think most players think that, that's the logical market for a stuff in British Colombia. So it's a little difficult. It isn't like say, what's EOG going to pay for this, compared to what they have now. That isn't the outlook for us. If EOG's investing in the LNG plan already. I don't know if that's the answer though. So the value for that even though it's gas is hard to quantify. It could be really big. So basically, what I'm saying is we have a pretty fix idea of what LNG is going to bring. It's likely that we can sell pretty well, Colombia because it's 100% crude and we know there [indiscernible] (56:14) for British Colombia that may be half of dozen really good buyers that might be 50 or 60 good buyers for the Colombia gas, almost everybody in Canada is interested in.

Also, I think Denny and the business units put together a pretty comprehensive earnings release, and I suggest you refer to that too.
Overall, operating income for the quarter was $125 million, which is more or less in line with the consensus. Earnings per share of $0.19 was essentially in line with the consensus, which $0.19 includes an approximate $0.04 add-back in items which we feel are appropriately excluded to get a more meaningful non-GAAP product, and I'll go into that a little bit later. 
If I had to summarize my overall feeling for this quarter, I feel that we were involved in what -- pretty close to a perfect storm for our business, a confluence of events that all had significant and negative impacts on our business. And I was frankly pleasantly surprised at the result in the quarter because it was better than I thought it would have been given the external factors. And I think the outlook for the year is better than I would have thought it was, again, given the external factors that constitute the kind of the perfect storm.
Let me go through those very briefly. We had a pretty low price for natural gas. And still it's a little higher, but still pretty low. And this affected our growing activities in Canada and the Lower 48 and even more so, the valuation of company since we're perceived to be a land gas-centric drilling company. And it did obviously also affected of the perception of the value of our E&P holdings, which I'll also talk about a little later. 
Also, the overall worldwide economy is not as robust as it could be and probably will be. And that influenced the overall demand for hydrocarbons, which didn't affect us, which didn't help us, which hurt us. Also, specifically to our business, which also affected others, there was a confusion in funding for PEMEX in Mexico, which net-net resulted in lack of funding for drilling which funding has to be -- it's internal to Mexico. It's between the government and PEMEX and that sort of thing. But that has to be resolved in the near future, and some say that it's sort of starting to be resolved. But that has had a major negative impact on our operating income obviously from international, and I'll get into that specific later. 
We also had a pretty meaningful drop-off in our oil-directed drilling in Saudi Arabia, which also had a, probably, almost an equal negative impact last year to this year on international's operations. And we don't see short-term growth in natural gas as they're still cutting back oil drilling and we won't see it increase until they do, and this isn't yet offset by natural gas drilling. 
And finally, the spill in the Gulf, which surprisingly since we're, ""primarily a land drilling operation"", has had a negative impact on our offshore operations, which will have a surprising negative impact on our Nabors Offshore operation, which I'll get into when we talk about it.
Let me talk briefly, again, about the non-GAAP EPS and talk about the factors that we think are relevant in adjusting from GAAP to non-GAAP. Let me also emphasize that this is just our view and pretty obviously, each and every investor can adjust these numbers and not adjust them as they go across. The things that we included in the adjustment refers to a $5.1 million foreign exchange loss, which we don't think is continuing and not appropriate to our continuing operation reflection. 
The next item is a loss of $3.6 million. This is sort of hard to understand accounting phenomenon where basically we have debt that's due in 2008, 2011, and we buy the debt back at yields which are no lower than 2% to 2.5% against cash, which we're saving conservatively, holding conservatively at under 0.2% interest. So it's a deal we would do all day long since buying this is just as good as treasuries for us because we're certain we're going to pay it off. Nevertheless, the accounting thing has this value to something well below the 2.5% yield, in other words, we're carrying it on the books at a real low number, which doesn't reflect the market. And then when we buy it at a low-market rate with a higher-than-market yield, it's still below the carrying value and therefore, we have to book a loss, which is not terribly logical. 
Next, we incurred a $2.3 million loss in prior years, which were not appropriate to this period and we're adjusting for that tax adjustment, and that one's specifically tax. We shouldn't have that problem on an ongoing basis. We should get it right the first time. But it's a $2.3 million are not appropriate for this particular quarter. 
And finally, we have an elimination of $1.1 million in operating income, rig income derived from working for our oil and gas joint venture, specifically the [indiscernible]. And this number is going to be bigger for the whole year [indiscernible]. If we make $2 million [indiscernible] for NFR, let's say, where the accounting works half of that sale since we own 50% of the NFR is sales to ourselves and has to be eliminated from GAAP profit reporting, and we take it in a reduction and depreciation and depletion over a longer period of time. But for every single practical purpose, we get the income, we get everything except the accounting that we're adjusting for that in this thing. So that's the story there.
Let me turn quickly to the business units. I think the NDUSA, write up in the quarterly, in the release that you already have, is pretty comprehensive. I think, just let me briefly summarize. The rig count today is 179. We figured the year we're looking to average around 174. We're projecting next year modest increase over that was 192. And in spite of the fact that we are projecting that we'll end this year with a rig count of around 190, so that's a modest increase this year, and even more modest increase for next year. But hopefully, time will tell, and we may be able to improve that.
Overall, as I've said before, our projections for this year have been ratcheting up the internal ones anyway. We started at a pretty low number, maybe a $130 million projection of our operating income for this year. And every time we looked at it but frankly, it's gotten better, so we're now projecting $250 million operating income for this year and a higher number for next year. Where it's conceivable, we will get the number we had in 2009. 
I think the other important thing to note here is that we're getting new build operations. So I think last time we told you we had four new builds for the Bakken and, I think, since then, we did five new builds. PACE had new builds, we have three functional equivalent of new builds in terms of economics with probably even higher return on those really upgraded SCR rigs. And I'd be surprised if we don't have at least five incremental additional new builds to announce by next quarter. So the rigs are doing really well and the proof of the pudding is in customer acceptance. Obviously, we're really dominant in the shale plays, which is important. And we went from, I don't know, probably up 30%, 40% in our rigs working in the shales, the liquid from shales since last quarter. 
Let me switch to NDIL [Nabors Drilling International Ltd.]. We previously forecast our International operations rebounded from the trough we experienced last quarter. Operating income of $65 million represents a nice increase over the $52 million or $53 million operating income in the first quarter. Rig count has increased, margins essentially the same. Improving activity with multiple start-ups in Colombia and Kazakhstan. To get to the net cutting here, the real drop in income was in Mexico as previously described the financial conditions. I think, operationally, in terms of quality of rigs, kind of rigs that are needed for PEMEX, we're still in good shape. And we're not disproportionately adversely impacted, except that it's an important market for us. So in plain simple terms, we went down probably $40 million, $45 million in operating income last year to this year because of the funding of [indiscernible]. They'll get cleared up. To me, it isn't crystal-clear how quickly we'll go back to where we were even when it is funded. But we will definitely go up. 
Similarly, in Saudi, we almost had a comparable loss, which explains some excuses, but it clearly explains of the drop in international. We also did have probably $40 million or $50 million solid drop in operating income year-to-year. And we probably have 11 stacked rigs there now. We had hoped and are still hoping that [indiscernible] and make up for it. But that's happened a little slow. So basically that explains why we're down and it's an industry thing. And it hits us, probably a little bit more important, because Saudi and Mexico were more important to us than the average industry. And I think we'll, over a longer period, get back there. But it's not going to be a big recovery. 
Nabors Well-Servicing, we're doing pretty well there. I think the most significant factor there is just the high crude price is finally manifesting itself in demand for workover services, which is also therefore manifesting itself in pricing. So I think that there have been a number of prices instituted by us and others, and that they're continuing to come into play. A lot of these things require a 30-day notices and a lot of price increases are tentative depending on what other guys are -- basically, there's a strong pricing trend underlying the activity that's attributable to the relatively high crude price. And in some cases, we're leading price increases, in some we're following, but that's the most positive sign. So basically, what that means is, that we're going to have probably a strong second half in 2010 but I think in 2011, the stage is set for even a more robust recovery and workover. 
Nabors Offshore, in a sense, we'll probably do something -- we did about $8 million this quarter. Even this quarter, however, was impacted $2 million to $3 million by the Gulf spill. And the Gulf spill manifests itself in two ways, really, one -- I mean, one we have the moratorium and the other we have a delay in getting permits to drill. And whether it's a moratorium or otherwise, or there are no permits to drill, they're not going to drill. And we have six rigs on platforms on SPAR's that are adversely impacted. And some of the jack-ups even aren't working as they might have with permits. 
So basically, if the worse-case scenario, I think, is down $25 million for the year compared to what it would have been without the spill and I think there are hopefully signs that this might be mitigated before the end of the year, but a good in spite the end of the year, we'll do close to $10 million instead of $35 million this year. And next year, I think, we'll do $35 million, plus we still have a bunch of things that we refer to before with one SPAR platform work that will manifest itself in late 2011. And I'll talk a little bit more about that later' 
Nabors Alaska, I guess, it's a declining field. We have not been successful in new builds there for BP. And BP is also -- BP right at the moment controls vast majority of the drilling. The operator are also drilling. And they're cutting back and Nabors was not super successful with BP. But we do have probably the best tool for the future on the Slope and that's a coil tubing unit. And this is something, in other words, this year is down from last year. Next year, probably will be down as well. Not probably, will be down as well.
We still have decent returns on capital employed. But beyond that, I think some time next year, we  get one or two of these coil tubing units, which are not only good for what they're doing now, but they're super good for the shallow high-viscosity drilling that's going to be going on forever on the Slope, while crude price stays even below where it's at now but at a good level when they figure out how to optimize the extraction of those. Anyway, I think the outlook is short-term, down, but long-term, I think, considering it's a defining field, we're in relatively good shape.
Canada, again, this unit has lousy seasonal quarter, and we have a loss. But the loss was less than the obviously, less than the operating profit in the first quarter, but less -- a smaller loss than we expected. So things are doing better than we expected. We'll do better this year. This is the unit that had made as much as $180 million operating income. And I think we have a shot at that, but we won't have a shot at that until gas prices are six-ish or better. Horn River still remains a super bright spot for us in Canada. 
Oil and Gas, I think the major interest in Oil and Gas is what our plans are to monetize i.e. convert these assets, which haven't been doing us much good on a stock-price basis in cash. And I guess, to grieve the situation, is we're three months closer than we were last quarter to number one, going public with NFR. I'll repeat that story briefly. NFR is a joint venture, 50-50 with us and First Reserve. We have roughly the lower half $500,000 [indiscernible] invested in it. We expect to go public in less than three quarters, some time in the first quarter next year or second quarter next year. Although if the situation permits, we're prepared to pull the trigger on it. We think right now, we have three or four competent investment banks showing us that unless the world goes to hell in a hand basket, we'll have the equity knot of $2 billion, which means $1 billion for us. And I said, we invested about $500 million. The GAAP, SEC dictated fixed impairments to make our holdings around $115 million, $120 million. So that's essentially where it was before, but things are looking a bit -- our well results are really good there, which is going to help the IPO. 
The second area, which is largely the first area to actually generate cash is Colombia, where we have our own stuff, the kind of Nabors around [ph] on stuff. Now we have E&P, we have 50-50 joint venture with First Reserve. That stuff together is, we're going to market it together, that's about 7,000 barrels a day of oil and a lot pizzazz. There's universal interest in that. And I still expect to sell it before the end of the year. But we now have completed our drilling, which we had completed the dry season drilling last quarter. And we know what we got and what we can sell. In other words, we've increased the reserves, we cut the actual more producibility of our production to sell, and we have more sizzle on discoveries. 
I think the final area is Canada where essentially, which happened since last time as we interviewed, reviewed a number of bankers and we're close to finalizing a deal with the bank and we obviously want a bank who knows the area really well and has real good connections with, we think, the logical buyer, which is the Far East buyer with the liquefied natural gas interests and connections.
I think the other point on this is we are considering now, this is purely accounting, but it would help maybe present it, interpret it as the some of our data, some of our E&P operations can be at this point legitimately considered discontinued operations and therefore, separate it. And the one that is going to be continuing 100%, which is NFR, they're doing really well. It's hidden and secured by our investments in the other one's, which we have -- they're really investments, like seismic is really an investment. We [indiscernible] to write it off. 
Our other segments are doing really well and I'd say, Canrig, in particular, is doing well with its technology and that's manifesting itself in not only profit for Canrig and sales of top drives in the market and stuff like that, but also in enhancing the overall saleability of Nabors' rigs.
In summary, let me talk briefly about -- our financing is in pretty good shape. We have essentially $900 million in cash and equivalent. All of that is not available. Some of it -- a lot of it's tied up. We expect to get some more. But basically, we have enough in the way of cash and earnings over and above relative to CapEx, that we are in pretty decent shape to -- we really wanted to squeeze CapEx. We did come close to paying up the whole $1.4 million remaining in our debt due in May of 2011. Basically, we've taken that debt down from $2.75 million, which it was to $1.4 million. And I think net-net over the last year and a half, we borrowed the $1.25 million in January of '09 to make sure we didn't have a jam. And we paid out net $1.125, plus another approximately $500 million of debt. 
Let me say, I'm bullish, even -- I was always reasonably bullish long term, but now I'm bullish intermediate term and maybe even shorter. Let me go through just a few of the points that lead me to that. I think we have the best infrastructure internationally than anybody has. I mean if you look at it in terms of leading driller in Saudi and biggest private position in Algeria, biggest driller in Yemen, et cetera. And when we get together where we want to get by introducing and integrating, say our line existing operations into that logging and if we are ultimately successful in broadening our scope, I think, intermediate term, that will be a big plus. 
USA-based rigs are doing really well. I have two things I look out as one proof of the pudding in the orders and we're doing super well on new build orders. And the rest of it is, what the most discriminating buyers are doing. I mean 100% of Shell, BP, in the last three, four years, we've had essentially 100% of the incremental work and overall, we have probably 80% of their work. We did, on Exxon, we did probably the most sensitive well drilled in the last year, so which is Point Thomson and that -- in Alaska, and that was a monster, I'd say, success. And we're doing the Papua New Guinea, both of them, which they seem really happy about even though we haven't delivered the rig yet or spudded anything, but I think that's important. I think that will manifest itself with a increased utilization in the states where it hadn't been. 
We, frankly, broke H&P's monopoly on platforms, SPAR rigs with a major consumer, which is -- I think we've talked about the Fil Mosby [ph] where we clearly had the best technology. And I hope not the very best price and we'd have the best technology. So in general I think, if I look at what is fundamental, the important for long term, I'd have a basis for optimism and that covers what I have prepared to say. Thank you."

And British Columbia is kind of a strange thing because what's happened in sales so far, and what's been cooking, some of has happened and some of it hasn't happened is the buyer is going to be probably from the Far East, probably -- with not probably, almost certainly, with real long-term views and with really low cost to capital, one way or another. And with interest on the whole supply chain, however you want to put it, of liquefied natural gas, in other words, some electrical consumer, electrical company consumer in Japan or Korea, they now have an interest in owning a chunk of the whole thing, from the resource to the liquefaction to the transportation. And that represents an opportunity for the guys who promote -- for example, the traders, they generally involved in putting this kind of thing together. Unlike the Matsui, Mitsubishi's narrow bendings, putting things like this together and they don't go broke putting it together, like most bankers don't. And it's a kind of demand that we don't have here. And I think most players think that, that's the logical market for a stuff in British Columbia. So it's a little difficult. It isn't like say, what's EOG going to pay for this, compared to what they have now. That isn't the outlook for us. If EOG's investing in the LNG plan already. I don't know if that's the answer though. So the value for that even though it's gas is hard to quantify. It could be really big. So basically, what I'm saying is we have a pretty fix idea of what LNG is going to bring. It's likely that we can sell pretty well Colombia [gas] because it's 100% crude and we know there [indiscernible]. For British Columbia, that may be half of dozen really good buyers that might be 50 or 60 good buyers. For the Columbia gas, almost everybody in Canada is interested in it.

Again, welcome to our conference call for the second quarter. I want to thank everybody for participating. As usual, we have posted to the Nabors' website a series of slides that contain details about the performance of the various segments of the company. Please refer to these as we proceed. Also, I think Denny and the business units put together a pretty comprehensive earnings release, and I suggest you refer to that too.
Overall, operating income for the quarter was $125 million, which is more or less in line with the consensus. Earnings per share of $0.19 was essentially in line with the consensus, which $0.19 includes an approximate $0.04 add-back in items which we feel are appropriately excluded to get a more meaningful non-GAAP product, and I'll go into that a little bit later. 
If I had to summarize my overall feeling for this quarter, I feel that we were involved in what -- pretty close to a perfect storm for our business, a confluence of events that all had significant and negative impacts on our business. And I was frankly pleasantly surprised at the result in the quarter because it was better than I thought it would have been given the external factors. And I think the outlook for the year is better than I would have thought it was, again, given the external factors that constitute the kind of the perfect storm.
Let me go through those very briefly. We had a pretty low price for natural gas. And still it's a little higher, but still pretty low. And this affected our growing activities in Canada and the Lower 48 and even more so, the valuation of company since we're perceived to be a land gas-centric drilling company. And it did obviously also affected of the perception of the value of our E&P holdings, which I'll also talk about a little later. 
Also, the overall worldwide economy is not as robust as it could be and probably will be. And that influenced the overall demand for hydrocarbons, which didn't affect us, which didn't help us, which hurt us. Also, specifically to our business, which also affected others, there was a confusion in funding for PEMEX in Mexico, which net-net resulted in lack of funding for drilling which funding has to be -- it's internal to Mexico. It's between the government and PEMEX and that sort of thing. But that has to be resolved in the near future, and some say that it's sort of starting to be resolved. But that has had a major negative impact on our operating income obviously from international, and I'll get into that specific later. 
We also had a pretty meaningful drop-off in our oil-directed drilling in Saudi Arabia, which also had a, probably almost an equal negative impact last year to this year on international's operation. And we don't see short-term growth in natural gas as they're still cutting back oil drilling and we won't see it increase until they do, and this isn't yet offset by natural gas drilling. 
And finally, the spill in the Gulf, which surprisingly since we're, ""primarily a land drilling operation"", has had a negative impact on our offshore operations, which will have a surprising negative impact on our Nabors Offshore operation, which I'll get into when we talk about it.
Let me talk briefly, again, about the non-GAAP EPS and talk about the factors that we think are relevant in adjusting from GAAP to non-GAAP. Let me also emphasize that this is just our view and pretty obviously, each and every investor can adjust these numbers and not adjust them as they go across. The things that we included in the adjustment refers to a $5.1 million foreign exchange loss, which we don't think is continuing and not appropriate to our continuing operation reflection. 
The next item is a loss of $3.6 million. This is sort of hard to understand accounting phenomenon where basically we have debt that's due in 2008, 2011, and we buy the debt back at yields which are no lower than 2% to 2½% against cash, which we're saving conservatively, holding conservatively at under 0.2% interest. So it's a deal we would do all day long since buying this is just as good as treasuries for us because we're certain we're going to pay it off. Nevertheless, the accounting thing has this value to something well below the 2½% yield, in other words, we're carrying it on the books at a real low number, which doesn't reflect the market. And then when we buy it at a low-market rate with a higher-than-market yield, it's still below the carrying value and therefore, we have to book a loss, which is not terribly logical. 
Next, we incurred a $2.3 million loss in prior years, which were not appropriate to this period and we're adjusting for that tax adjustment, and that one's specifically tax. We shouldn't have that problem on an ongoing basis. We should get it right the first time. But it's a $2.3 million are not appropriate for this particular quarter. 
And finally, we have an elimination of $1.1 million in operating income, rig income derived from working for our oil and gas joint venture, specifically the [indiscernible]. And this number is going to be bigger for the whole year [indiscernible]. If we make $2 million [indiscernible] for NFR, let's say, where the accounting works half of that sale since we own 50% of the NFR is sales to ourselves and has to be eliminated from GAAP profit reporting, and we take it in a reduction and depreciation and depletion over a longer period of time. But for every single practical purpose, we get the income, we get everything except the accounting that we're adjusting for that in this thing. So that's the story there.
Let me turn quickly to the business units. I think the NDUSA, write up in the quarterly, in the release that you already have, is pretty comprehensive. I think, just let me briefly summarize. The rig count today is 179. We figured the year we're looking to average around 174. We're projecting next year a modest increase over that about 192. And in spite of the fact that we are projecting that we'll end this year with a rig count of around 190, so that's a modest increase this year, and even more modest increase for next year. But hopefully, time will tell, and we may be able to improve that.
Overall, as I've said before, our projections for this year have been ratcheting up the internal ones anyway. We started at a pretty low number, maybe a $130 million projection of our operating income for this year. And every time we'd look at it but frankly, it's gotten better, so we're now projecting $250 million operating income for this year and a higher number for next year. Where it's conceivable, we will get the number we had in 2009. 
I think the other important thing to note here is that we're getting new build operations. So I think last time we told you we had four new builds for the Bakken and I think, since then, we've got five new builds. I think, PACE had new builds, we have three functional equivalent of new builds in terms of economics with probably even higher return and those really upgraded SCR rigs. And I'd be surprised if we don't have at least five incremental additional new builds to announce by next quarter. So the rigs are doing really well and the proof of the pudding is in customer acceptance. Obviously, we're really dominant in the shale plays, which is important. And we went from, I don't know, probably up 30%, 40% in our rigs working in the shales, the liquid from shales since last quarter. 
Let me switch to NDIL [Nabors Drilling International Ltd.]. We previously forecast our International operations rebounded from the trough we experienced last quarter. Operating income of $65 million represents a nice increase over the $52 million or $53 million operating income in the first quarter. Rig count has increased, margins essentially the same. Improving activity with multiple start-ups in Colombia and Kazakhstan. To get to the net cutting here, the real drop in income was in Mexico as previously described the financial conditions. I think, operationally, in terms of quality of rigs, kind of rigs that are needed for PEMEX, we're still in good shape. And we're not disproportionately adversely impacted, except that it's an important market for us. So in plain simple terms, we went down probably $40 million, $45 million in operating income last year to this year because of the funding of [indiscernible] while they'll get cleared up. To me, it isn't crystal-clear how quickly we'll go back to where we were even when it is funded. But we will definitely go up. 
Similarly, in Saudi, we almost had a comparable loss, which explains some excuses, but it clearly explains of the drop in international. We also did have probably $40 million or $50 million solid drop in operating income year-to-year. And we probably have 11 stacked rigs there now. We had hoped and are still hoping that [indiscernible] and make up for it. But that's happened a little slow. So basically that explains why we're down and it's an industry thing. And it hits us, probably a little bit more important, because Saudi and Mexico were more important to us than the average industry. And I think we'll, over a longer period, get back there. But it's not going to be a big recovery. 
Nabors Well-Servicing, we're doing pretty well there. I think the most significant factor there is just the high crude price is finally manifesting itself in demand for workover services, which is also therefore manifesting itself in pricing. So I think that there have been a number of prices instituted by us and others, and that they're continuing to come into play. A lot of these things require a 30-day notices and a lot of price increases are tentative depending on what other guys do, but basically, there's a strong pricing trend underlying the activity that's attributable to the relatively high crude price. And in some cases, we're leading price increases, in some we're following, but that's the most positive sign. So basically, what that means is that we're going to have probably a strong second half in 2010 but I think in 2011, the stage is set for even a more robust recovery and workover. 
Nabors Offshore, in a sense, we'll probably do something -- we did about $8 million this quarter. Even this quarter, however, was -- operating income, even this quarter was impacted $2 million or $3 million by the Gulf spill. And the Gulf spill manifests itself in two ways, really, one -- I mean, one we have the moratorium and the other, we have a delay in getting permits to drill. And whether it's a moratorium or otherwise, or there are no permits to drill, they're not going to drill. And we have six rigs on platforms or SPARs that are adversely impacted. And some of the jack-ups even aren't working as they might have with the permits. 
So basically, if the worse-case scenario, I think, is down $25 million for the year compared to what it would have been without the spill and I think there are hopefully signs that this might be mitigated before the end of the year. But I guess by the end of the year, we'll do close to $10 million instead of $35 million this year and next year, I think, we'll do $35 million, plus we still have a bunch of things that we've referred to before with one SPAR platform work that will manifest itself in late 2011. And I'll talk a little bit more about that later.
Nabors Alaska, I guess, it's a declining field. We have not been successful in new builds there for BP. And BP is also -- BP right at the moment controls vast majority of drilling. They're the operator for most of the drilling, and they're cutting back and Nabors was not super successful with BP. But we do have probably the best tool for the future on the Slope and that's a coiled tubing unit. And this is something, in other words, this year is down from last year. Next year, probably will be down as well. Not probably, will be down as well.
We still have decent returns on capital employed. But beyond that, I think some time next year, we  get one or two of these coiled tubing units, which are not only good for what they're doing now, but they're super good for the shallow high-viscosity drilling that's going to be going on forever on the Slope, while crude price stays even below where it's at now but at a good level when they figure out how to optimize the extraction of those. Anyway, I think the outlook is short-term, down, but long-term, I think, considering it's a defining field, we're in relatively good shape.
Canada, again, this unit has lousy seasonal quarter, and we have a loss. But the loss was less than the obviously, less than the operating profit in the first quarter, but less -- a smaller loss than we expected. So things are doing better than we expected. We'll do better this year. This is the unit that had made as much as $180 million operating income. And I think we have a shot at that, but we won't have a shot at that until gas prices are six-ish or better. Horn River still remains a super bright spot for us in Canada. 
Oil and Gas, I think the major interest in Oil and Gas is what our plans are to monetize, i.e. convert these assets, which haven't been doing us much good on a stock-price basis in cash. And I guess, to brief the situation is, we're three months closer than we were last quarter to number one, going public with NFR. I'll repeat that story briefly. NFR is a joint venture, 50-50 with us and First Reserve. We have roughly the lower half $500,000 [indiscernible] invested in it. We expect to go public in less than three quarters, some time in the first quarter next year or second quarter next year. Although if the situation permits, we're prepared to pull the trigger on it. We think right now, we have three or four competent investment banks showing us that unless the world goes to hell in a hand basket, we'll have the equity knot of $2 billion, which means $1 billion for us. And I said, we invested about $500 million. The GAAP, SEC dictated fixed impairments to make our holdings around $115 million, $120 million. So that's essentially where it was before, but things are looking a bit -- our well results are really good there, which is going to help the IPO. 
The second area, which is largely the first area to actually generate cash is Colombia, where we have our own stuff, the kind of sent Nabors around sort [ph] on stuff. Now we have E&P, we have 50-50 joint venture with First Reserve. That stuff together is, we're going to market it together, that's about 7,000 barrels a day of oil and a lot pizzazz. There's universal interest in that. And I still expect to sell it before the end of the year. But we now have completed our drilling, which we had completed the dry season drilling last quarter. And we know what we got and what we can sell. In other words, we've increased the reserves, we cut the actual more producibility of our production to sell, and we have more sizzle on discoveries. 
I think the final area is Canada where essentially, which happened since last time as we interviewed, reviewed a number of bankers and we're close to finalizing a deal with the bank and we obviously want a bank who knows the area really well and has real good connections with, we think, the logical buyer, which is a Far East buyer with the liquefied natural gas interests and connections.
I think the other point on this is we are considering now, this is purely accounting, but it would help maybe present it, interpret as some of our data, some of our E&P operations can be at this point legitimately considered discontinued operations and therefore, separate it. And the one that is going to be continuing 100%, which is NFR, they're doing really well. It's hidden and secured by our investments in the other one's, which we have -- they're really investments, like seismic is really an investment. We've decided we had to write it off. 
Our other segments are doing really well and I'd say, Canrig, in particular, is doing well with its technology and that's manifesting itself in not only profit for Canrig and sales of top drives in the market and stuff like that, but also in enhancing the overall saleability of Nabors' rigs.
In summary, let me talk briefly about -- our financing is in pretty good shape. We have essentially $900 million in cash and equivalent. All of that is not available. Some of it -- a lot of it's tied up. We expect to get some more. But basically, we have enough in the way of cash and earnings over and above relative to CapEx, that we're in pretty decent shape to -- we really wanted to squeeze CapEx. We did come close to paying up the whole $1.4 million remaining in our debt due in May of 2011. Basically, we've taken that debt down from $2.75 million, which it was to $1.4 million. And I think net-net over the last year and a half, we borrowed the $1.25 million in January of '09 to make sure we didn't have a jam. And we paid out net $1.125, plus another approximately $500 million of debt. 
Let me say, I'm bullish, even -- I was always reasonably bullish long term, but now I'm bullish intermediate term and maybe even shorter. Let me go through just a few of the points that lead me to that. I think we have the best infrastructure internationally than anybody has. I mean if you look at it in terms of leading driller in Saudi and biggest private position in Algeria, biggest driller in Yemen, et cetera. And when we get together where we want to get by introducing and integrating, say our line existing operations into that not logging [ph] and if we are ultimately successful in broadening our scope, I think, intermediate term, that will be a big plus. 
USA-based rigs are doing really well. I have two things I look out as one proof of the pudding in the orders and we're doing super well on new build orders. And the rest of it is, what the most discriminating buyers are doing. I mean 100% of Shell, BP, in the last three, four years, we've had essentially 100% of the incremental work and overall, we have probably 80% of their work. We did, on Exxon, we did probably the most sensitive well drilled in the last year, so which is Point Thomson and that -- in Alaska, and that was a monster, I'd say, success. And we're doing the Papua New Guinea, both of them, which they seem really happy about even though we haven't delivered the rig yet or spudded anything, but I think that's important. I think that will manifest itself with a increased utilization in the states where it hadn't been. 
We, frankly, broke H&P's monopoly on platforms, SPAR rigs with a major consumer, which is -- I think we've talked about the Fil Mosby [ph] where we clearly had the best technology. And I hope not the very best price and we'd have the best technology. So in general I think, if I look at what is fundamental, the important for long term, I'd have a basis for optimism and that covers what I have prepared to say. Thank you."

A lot of guys are drilling to secure, maintain whatever leases, so there's going to be a significant amount of drilling like that. And there'll be some -- and that'll tend to be straight vertical holes to hold leases. Potentially, there'll be a big-time directional drilling with 5,000, 4,500, 5,500-foot horizontal sections with eight to 16 -- the same story seen anywhere else. And they'll be doing some of that to see what they got, the relatively low gas prices. So I don't know what the answer is going to be. Obviously, I'll give you a real scoop, we're better off with $6 gas prices than $5."

And British Columbia is kind of a strange thing because what's happened in sales so far, and what's been cooking, some of it has happened and some of it hasn't happened is the buyer is going to be probably from the Far East, probably -- with not probably, almost certainly, with real long-term views and with really low cost to capital, one way or another. And with interest on the whole supply chain, however you want to put it, of liquefied natural gas, in other words, some electrical consumer, electrical company consumer in Japan or Korea. They now have an interest in owning a chunk of the whole thing, from the resource to the liquefaction to the transportation. And that represents an opportunity for the guys who promote -- for example, the traders, they generally involved in putting this kind of thing together. Unlike the Matsui, Mitsubishi's narrow bendings, putting things like this together and they don't go broke putting it together, like most bankers don't. And it's a kind of demand that we don't have here. And I think most players think that, that's the logical market for a stuff in British Columbia. So it's a little difficult. It isn't like say, what's EOG going to pay for this, compared to what they have now. That isn't the outlook for us. If EOG's investing in the LNG plan already. I don't know if that's the answer though. So the value for that even though it's gas is hard to quantify. It could be really big. So basically, what I'm saying is we have a pretty fix idea of what LNG is going to bring. It's likely that we can sell pretty well Colombia [gas] because it's 100% crude and we know there [indiscernible]. For British Columbia, that may be half of dozen really good buyers that might be 50 or 60 good buyers. For the Columbia gas, almost everybody in Canada is interested in it.

Again, welcome to our conference call for the second quarter. I want to thank everybody for participating. As usual, we have posted to the Nabors' website a series of slides that contain details about the performance of the various segments of the company. Please refer to these as we proceed. Also, I think Denny and the business units put together a pretty comprehensive earnings release, and I suggest you refer to that too.
Overall, operating income for the quarter was $125 million, which is more or less in line with the consensus. Earnings per share of $0.19 was essentially in line with the consensus, which $0.19 includes an approximate $0.04 add-back in items which we feel are appropriately excluded to get a more meaningful non-GAAP product, and I'll go into that a little bit later. 
If I had to summarize my overall feeling for this quarter, I feel that we were involved in what -- pretty close to a perfect storm for our business, a confluence of events that all had significant and negative impacts on our business. And I was frankly pleasantly surprised at the result in the quarter because it was better than I thought it would have been given the external factors. And I think the outlook for the year is better than I would have thought it was, again, given the external factors that constitute the kind of the perfect storm.
Let me go through those very briefly. We had a pretty low price for natural gas. And still it's a little higher, but still pretty low. And this affected our growing activities in Canada and the Lower 48 and even more so, the valuation of company since we're perceived to be a land gas-centric drilling company. And it did obviously also affected of the perception of the value of our E&P holdings, which I'll also talk about a little later. 
Also, the overall worldwide economy is not as robust as it could be and probably will be. And that influenced the overall demand for hydrocarbons, which didn't affect us, which didn't help us, which hurt us. Also, specifically to our business, which also affected others, there was a confusion in funding for PEMEX in Mexico, which net-net resulted in lack of funding for drilling which funding has to be -- it's internal to Mexico. It's between the government and PEMEX and that sort of thing. But that has to be resolved in the near future, and some say that it's sort of starting to be resolved. But that has had a major negative impact on our operating income obviously from international, and I'll get into that specific later. 
We also had a pretty meaningful drop-off in our oil-directed drilling in Saudi Arabia, which also had a, probably almost an equal negative impact last year to this year on international's operation. And we don't see short-term growth in natural gas as they're still cutting back oil drilling and we won't see it increase until they do, and this isn't yet offset by natural gas drilling. 
And finally, the spill in the Gulf, which surprisingly since we're ""primarily a land drilling operation,"" has had a negative impact on our offshore operations, which will have a surprising negative impact on our Nabors Offshore operation, which I'll get into when we talk about it.
Let me talk briefly, again, about the non-GAAP EPS and talk about the factors that we think are relevant in adjusting from GAAP to non-GAAP. Let me also emphasize that this is just our view, and pretty obviously, each and every investor can adjust these numbers or not adjust them as they feel appropriate. The things that we included in the adjustment refers to a $5.1 million foreign exchange loss, which we don't think is continuing and not appropriate to our continuing operation reflection. 
The next item is a loss of $3.6 million. This is sort of hard to understand accounting phenomenon where basically we have debt that's due in 2008, 2011, and we buy the debt back at yields which are no lower than 2% to 2½% against cash, which we're saving conservatively, holding conservatively at under 0.2% interest. So it's a deal we would do all day long since buying this is just as good as treasuries for us because we're certain we're going to pay it off. Nevertheless, the accounting thing has this value to something well below the 2½% yield, in other words, we're carrying it on the books at a real low number, which doesn't reflect the market. And then when we buy it at a low-market rate with a higher-than-market yield, it's still below the carrying value and therefore, we have to book a loss, which is not terribly logical. 
Next, we incurred a $2.3 million loss in prior years, which were not appropriate to this period and we're adjusting for that tax adjustment, and that one's specifically tax. We shouldn't have that problem on an ongoing basis. We should get it right the first time, but this $2.3 million are not appropriate for this particular quarter. 
And finally, we have an elimination of $1.1 million in operating income, rig income derived from working for our oil and gas joint venture, specifically the [indiscernible]. And this number is going to be bigger for the whole year [indiscernible]. If we make $2 million for NFR, let's say, where the accounting works half of that sale since we own 50% of the NFR sales to ourselves and has to be eliminated from GAAP profit reporting, and we take it in a reduction and depreciation and depletion over a longer period of time. But for every single practical purpose, we get the income, we get everything except the accounting and we're adjusting for that in this thing. So that's the story there.
Let me turn quickly to the business units. I think the NDUSA,write up in the quarterly, in the release that you already have, is pretty comprehensive. I think -- just let me briefly summarize. The rig count today is 179. We figure the year we're looking to average around 174. We're projecting next year a modest increase over that, about 192. And in spite of the fact that we are projecting that we'll end this year with a rig count of around 190, so that's a modest increase this year, and even more modest increase for next year. But hopefully, time will tell, and we may be able to improve that.
Overall, as I've said before, our projections for this year have been ratcheting up the internal ones anyway. We started at a pretty low number, maybe a $130 million projection of our operating income for this year. And every time we'd look at it but frankly, it's gotten better, so we're now projecting $250 million operating income for this year and a higher number for next year. Where it's conceivable, we will get the number we had in 2009. 
I think the other important thing to note here is that we're getting new build operations. So I think last time we told you we had four new builds for the Bakken and I think, since then, we've got five new builds. I think, PACE had new builds, we have three functional equivalent of new builds in terms of economics with probably even higher return and those really upgraded SCR rigs. And I'd be surprised if we don't have at least five incremental additional new builds to announce by next quarter. So the rigs are doing really well and the proof of the pudding is in customer acceptance. Obviously, we're really dominant in the shale plays, which is important. And we went from, I don't know, probably up 30%, 40% in our rigs working in the shales, the liquid from shales since last quarter. 
Let me switch to NDIL [Nabors Drilling International Ltd.]. We previously forecast our International operations rebounded from the trough we experienced last quarter. Operating income of $65 million represents a nice increase over the $52 million or $53 million operating income in the first quarter. Rig count has increased, margins essentially the same. Improving activity with multiple start-ups in Colombia and Kazakhstan. To get to the net cutting here, the real drop in income was in Mexico as previously described the financial conditions. I think, operationally, in terms of quality of rigs, kind of rigs that are needed for PEMEX, we're still in good shape. And we're not disproportionately adversely impacted, except that it's an important market for us. So in plain simple terms, we went down probably $40 million, $45 million in operating income last year to this year because of the funding of [indiscernible] while they'll get cleared up. To me, it isn't crystal-clear how quickly we'll go back to where we were even when it is funded. But we will definitely go up. 
Similarly, in Saudi, we almost had a comparable loss, which explains some excuses, but it clearly explains of the drop in international. We also did have probably $40 million or $50 million solid drop in operating income year-to-year. And we probably have 11 stacked rigs there now. We had hoped and are still hoping that [indiscernible] and make up for it. But that's happened a little slow. So basically that explains why we're down and it's an industry thing. And it hits us, probably a little bit more important, because Saudi and Mexico were more important to us than the average industry. And I think we'll, over a longer period, get back there. But it's not going to be a big recovery. 
Nabors Well-Servicing, we're doing pretty well there. I think the most significant factor there is just the high crude price is finally manifesting itself in demand for workover services, which is also therefore manifesting itself in pricing. So I think that there have been a number of prices instituted by us and others, and that they're continuing to come into play. A lot of these things require a 30-day notices and a lot of price increases are tentative depending on what other guys do, but basically, there's a strong pricing trend underlying the activity that's attributable to the relatively high crude price. And in some cases, we're leading price increases, in some we're following, but that's the most positive sign. So basically, what that means is that we're going to have probably a strong second half in 2010 but I think in 2011, the stage is set for even a more robust recovery and workover. 
Nabors Offshore, in a sense, we'll probably do something -- we did about $8 million this quarter. Even this quarter, however, was -- operating income, even this quarter was impacted $2 million or $3 million by the Gulf spill. And the Gulf spill manifests itself in two ways, really, one -- I mean, one we have the moratorium and the other, we have a delay in getting permits to drill. And whether it's a moratorium or otherwise, or there are no permits to drill, they're not going to drill. And we have six rigs on platforms or SPARs that are adversely impacted. And some of the jack-ups even aren't working as they might have with the permits. 
So basically, if the worse-case scenario, I think, is down $25 million for the year compared to what it would have been without the spill and I think there are hopefully signs that this might be mitigated before the end of the year. But I guess by the end of the year, we'll do close to $10 million instead of $35 million this year and next year, I think, we'll do $35 million, plus we still have a bunch of things that we've referred to before with one SPAR platform work that will manifest itself in late 2011. And I'll talk a little bit more about that later.
Nabors Alaska, I guess, it's a declining field. We have not been successful in new builds there for BP. And BP is also -- BP right at the moment controls vast majority of drilling. They're the operator for most of the drilling, and they're cutting back and Nabors was not super successful with BP. But we do have probably the best tool for the future on the Slope and that's a coiled tubing unit. And this is something, in other words, this year is down from last year. Next year, probably will be down as well. Not probably, will be down as well.
We still have decent returns on capital employed. But beyond that, I think some time next year, we  get one or two of these coiled tubing units, which are not only good for what they're doing now, but they're super good for the shallow high-viscosity drilling that's going to be going on forever on the Slope, while crude price stays even below where it's at now but at a good level when they figure out how to optimize the extraction of those. Anyway, I think the outlook is short-term, down, but long-term, I think, considering it's a defining field, we're in relatively good shape.
Canada, again, this unit has lousy seasonal quarter, and we have a loss. But the loss was less than the obviously, less than the operating profit in the first quarter, but less -- a smaller loss than we expected. So things are doing better than we expected. We'll do better this year. This is the unit that had made as much as $180 million operating income. And I think we have a shot at that, but we won't have a shot at that until gas prices are six-ish or better. Horn River still remains a super bright spot for us in Canada. 
Oil and Gas, I think the major interest in Oil and Gas is what our plans are to monetize, i.e. convert these assets, which haven't been doing us much good on a stock-price basis in cash. And I guess, to brief the situation is, we're three months closer than we were last quarter to number one, going public with NFR. I'll repeat that story briefly. NFR is a joint venture, 50-50 with us and First Reserve. We have roughly the lower half $500,000 [indiscernible] invested in it. We expect to go public in less than three quarters, some time in the first quarter next year or second quarter next year. Although if the situation permits, we're prepared to pull the trigger on it. We think right now, we have three or four competent investment banks showing us that unless the world goes to hell in a hand basket, we'll have the equity knot of $2 billion, which means $1 billion for us. And I said, we invested about $0.5 billion. The GAAP, SEC dictated fixed impairments to make our holdings around $115 million, $120 million. So that's essentially where it was before, but things are looking a bit -- our well results are really good there, which is going to help the IPO. 
The second area, which is largely the first area to actually generate cash is Colombia, where we have our own stuff, the kind of sent Nabors around sort [ph] on stuff. Now we have E&P, we have 50-50 joint venture with First Reserve. That stuff together is, we're going to market it together, that's about 7,000 barrels a day of oil and a lot pizzazz. There's universal interest in that. And I still expect to sell it before the end of the year. But we now have completed our drilling, which we had completed the dry season drilling last quarter. And we know what we got and what we can sell. In other words, we've increased the reserves, we cut the actual more producibility of our production to sell, and we have more sizzle on discoveries. 
I think the final area is Canada where essentially, which happened since last time as we interviewed, reviewed a number of bankers and we're close to finalizing a deal with the bank and we obviously want a banker who knows the area really well and has real good connections with, we think, the logical buyer, which is a Far East buyer with liquefied natural gas interests and connections.
I think the other point on this is we are considering now, this is purely accounting, but it would help maybe present it, interpret as some of our data, some of our E&P operations can be at this point legitimately considered discontinued operations and therefore, separated. And the one that is going to be continuing 100%, which is NFR, they're doing really well. It's hidden and obscured by our investments in the other ones, which we have -- they're really investments, like seismic is really an investment. We've decided we had to write it off. 
Our other segments are doing really well and I'd say, Canrig, in particular, is doing well with its technology and that's manifesting itself in not only profit for Canrig and sales of top drives in the market and stuff like that, but also in enhancing the overall saleability of Nabors' rigs.
In summary, we talked briefly about -- our financing is in pretty good shape. We have essentially $900 million in cash and equivalent. All of that is not available. Some of it -- a lot of it's tied up. We expect to get some more. But basically, we have enough in the way of cash and earnings over and above relative to CapEx, that we're in pretty decent shape to -- we really wanted to squeeze CapEx. We did come close to paying up the whole $1.4 million remaining in our debt due in May of 2011. Basically, we've taken that debt down from $2.75 million, which it was to $1.4 million. And I think net-net over the last year and a half, we've borrowed the $1.25 million in January of '09 to make sure we didn't have a jam. And we paid out net $1.125 million, plus another approximately $500 million of debt. 
Let me say, I'm bullish, even -- I was always reasonably bullish long term, but now I'm bullish intermediate term and maybe even shorter. Let me go through just a few of the points that lead me to that. I think we have the best infrastructure internationally than anybody has. I mean, if you look at it in terms of leading driller in Saudi and biggest private position in Algeria, biggest driller in Yemen, et cetera. And when we get together where we want to get by introducing and integrating, say our line existing operations into that not logging [ph] and if we are ultimately successful in broadening our scope, I think, intermediate term, that will be a big plus. 
USA-based rigs are doing really well. I have two things I look out as one proof of the pudding in the orders and we're doing super well on new build orders. And the rest of it is, what the most discriminating buyers are doing. I mean 100% of Shell, BP, in the last three, four years, we've had essentially 100% of the incremental work and overall, we have probably 80% of their work. We did, on Exxon, we did probably the most sensitive well drilled in the last year, so which is Point Thomson and that -- in Alaska, and that was a monster, I'd say, success. And we're doing the Papua New Guinea, both of them, which they seem really happy about even though we haven't delivered the rig yet or spudded anything, but I think that's important. I think that will manifest itself with a increased utilization in the states where it hadn't been. 
We, frankly, broke H&P's monopoly on platforms, SPAR rigs with a major consumer, which is -- I think we've talked about the Fil Mosby [ph] where we clearly had the best technology. And I hope not the very best price and we'd have the best technology. So in general I think, if I look at what is fundamental, the important for long term, I'd have a basis for optimism and that covers what I have prepared to say. Thank you."

And British Columbia is kind of a strange thing because what's happened in sales so far, and what's been cooking, some of it has happened and some of it hasn't happened is the buyer is going to be probably from the Far East, probably -- with not probably, almost certainly, with real long-term views and with really low cost to capital, one way or another. And with interest on the whole supply chain, however you want to put it, of liquefied natural gas, in other words, some electrical consumer, electrical company consumer in Japan or Korea. They now have an interest in owning a chunk of the whole thing, from the resource to the liquefaction to the transportation. And that represents an opportunity for the guys who promote -- for example, the traders, they're generally involved in putting this kind of thing together. Unlike the Matsui, Mitsubishi's narrow bendings, putting things like this together and they don't go broke putting it together, like most bankers don't. And it's a kind of demand that we don't have here. I think and I think most players think that, that's the logical market for our stuff in British Columbia. So it's a little difficult. It isn't like say, what's EOG going to pay for this, compared to what they have now. That isn't the outlook for us, if EOG's investing in the LNG plan already. I don't know if that's the answer though. So the value for that, even though it's gas, is hard to quantify. It could be really big. So basically, what I'm saying is we have a pretty fair idea of what LNG is going to bring. It's likely that we can sell pretty well ,Colombia [gas], because it's 100% crude and we know there [indiscernible]. For British Columbia, there may be half of dozen really good buyers.

Again, welcome to our conference call for the second quarter. I want to thank everybody for participating. As usual, we have posted to the Nabors' website a series of slides that contain details about the performance of the various segments of the company. Please refer to these as we proceed. Also, I think Denny and the business units put together a pretty comprehensive earnings release, and I suggest you refer to that too.
Overall, operating income for the quarter was $125 million, which is more or less in line with the consensus. Earnings per share of $0.19 was essentially in line with the consensus, which $0.19 includes an approximate $0.04 add-back in items which we feel are appropriately excluded to get a more meaningful non-GAAP product, and I'll go into that a little bit later. 
If I had to summarize my overall feeling for this quarter, I feel that we were involved in what -- pretty close to a perfect storm for our business, a confluence of events that all had significant and negative impacts on our business. And I was frankly pleasantly surprised at the result in the quarter because it was better than I thought it would have been given the external factors. And I think the outlook for the year is better than I would have thought it was, again, given the external factors that constitute the kind of the perfect storm.
Let me go through those very briefly. We had a pretty low price for natural gas. And still it's a little higher, but still pretty low. And this affected our growing activities in Canada and the Lower 48 and even more so, the valuation of company since we're perceived to be a land gas-centric drilling company. And it did obviously also affected of the perception of the value of our E&P holdings, which I'll also talk about a little later. 
Also, the overall worldwide economy is not as robust as it could be and probably will be. And that influenced the overall demand for hydrocarbons, which didn't affect us, which didn't help us, which hurt us. Also, specifically to our business, which also affected others, there was a confusion in funding for PEMEX in Mexico, which net-net resulted in lack of funding for drilling which funding has to be -- it's internal to Mexico. It's between the government and PEMEX and that sort of thing. But that has to be resolved in the near future, and some say that it's sort of starting to be resolved. But that has had a major negative impact on our operating income obviously from international, and I'll get into that specific later. 
We also had a pretty meaningful drop-off in our oil-directed drilling in Saudi Arabia, which also had a, probably almost an equal negative impact last year to this year on international's operation. And we don't see short-term growth in natural gas as they're still cutting back oil drilling and we won't see it increase until they do, and this isn't yet offset by natural gas drilling. 
And finally, the spill in the Gulf, which surprisingly since we're ""primarily a land drilling operation,"" has had a negative impact on our offshore operations, which will have a surprising negative impact on our Nabors Offshore operation, which I'll get into when we talk about it.
Let me talk briefly, again, about the non-GAAP EPS and talk about the factors that we think are relevant in adjusting from GAAP to non-GAAP. Let me also emphasize that this is just our view, and pretty obviously, each and every investor can adjust these numbers or not adjust them as they feel appropriate. The things that we included in the adjustment refers to a $5.1 million foreign exchange loss, which we don't think is continuing and not appropriate to our continuing operation reflection. 
The next item is a loss of $3.6 million. This is sort of hard to understand accounting phenomenon where basically we have debt that's due in 2008, 2011, and we buy the debt back at yields which are no lower than 2% to 2½% against cash, which we're saving conservatively, holding conservatively at under 0.2% interest. So it's a deal we would do all day long since buying this is just as good as treasuries for us because we're certain we're going to pay it off. Nevertheless, the accounting thing has this value to something well below the 2½% yield, in other words, we're carrying it on the books at a real low number, which doesn't reflect the market. And then when we buy it at a low-market rate with a higher-than-market yield, it's still below the carrying value and therefore, we have to book a loss, which is not terribly logical. 
Next, we incurred a $2.3 million loss in prior years, which were not appropriate to this period and we're adjusting for that tax adjustment, and that one's specifically tax. We shouldn't have that problem on an ongoing basis. We should get it right the first time, but this $2.3 million are not appropriate for this particular quarter. 
And finally, we have an elimination of $1.1 million in operating income, rig income derived from working for our oil and gas joint venture, specifically the [indiscernible]. And this number is going to be bigger for the whole year [indiscernible]. If we make $2 million for NFR, let's say, where the accounting works half of that sale since we own 50% of the NFR sales to ourselves and has to be eliminated from GAAP profit reporting, and we take it in a reduction and depreciation and depletion over a longer period of time. But for every single practical purpose, we get the income, we get everything except the accounting and we're adjusting for that in this thing. So that's the story there.
Let me turn quickly to the business units. I think the NDUSA,write up in the quarterly, in the release that you already have, is pretty comprehensive. I think -- just let me briefly summarize. The rig count today is 179. We figure the year we're looking to average around 174. We're projecting next year a modest increase over that, about 192. And in spite of the fact that we are projecting that we'll end this year with a rig count of around 190, so that's a modest increase this year, and even more modest increase for next year. But hopefully, time will tell, and we may be able to improve that.
Overall, as I've said before, our projections for this year have been ratcheting up the internal ones anyway. We started at a pretty low number, maybe a $130 million projection of our operating income for this year. And every time we'd look at it but frankly, it's gotten better, so we're now projecting $250 million operating income for this year and a higher number for next year. Where it's conceivable, we will get the number we had in 2009. 
I think the other important thing to note here is that we're getting new build operations. So I think last time we told you we had four new builds for the Bakken and I think, since then, we've got five new builds. I think, PACE had new builds, we have three functional equivalent of new builds in terms of economics with probably even higher return and those really upgraded SCR rigs, and I'd be surprised if we don't have at least five incremental additional new builds to announce by next quarter. So the rigs are doing really well and the proof of the pudding is in customer acceptance. Obviously, we're really dominant in the shale plays, which is important. And we went from, I don't know, probably up 30%, 40% in our rigs working in the shales, the liquid from shales since last quarter. 
Let me switch to NDIL [Nabors Drilling International Ltd.]. We previously forecast our International operations rebounded from the trough we experienced last quarter. Operating income of $65 million represents a nice increase over the $52 million or $53 million operating income in the first quarter. Rig count has increased, margins essentially the same. Improving activity with multiple start-ups in Colombia and Kazakhstan. To get to the net cutting here, the real drop in income was in Mexico as previously described the financial conditions. I think, operationally, in terms of quality of rigs, kind of rigs that are needed for PEMEX, we're still in good shape. And we're not disproportionately adversely impacted, except that it's an important market for us. So in plain simple terms, we went down probably $40 million, $45 million in operating income last year to this year because of the funding of [indiscernible] while they'll get cleared up. To me, it isn't crystal-clear how quickly we'll go back to where we were even when it is funded. But we will definitely go up. 
Similarly, in Saudi, we almost had a comparable loss, which explains some excuses, but it clearly explains of the drop in international. We also did have probably $40 million or $50 million solid drop in operating income year-to-year. And we probably have 11 stacked rigs there now. We had hoped and are still hoping that [indiscernible] and make up for it. But that's happened a little slow. So basically that explains why we're down and it's an industry thing. And it hits us, probably a little bit more important, because Saudi and Mexico were more important to us than the average industry. And I think we'll, over a longer period, get back there. But it's not going to be a big recovery. 
Nabors Well-Servicing, we're doing pretty well there. I think the most significant factor there is just the high crude price is finally manifesting itself in demand for workover services, which is also therefore manifesting itself in pricing. So I think that there have been a number of prices instituted by us and others, and that they're continuing to come into play. A lot of these things require a 30-day notices and a lot of price increases are tentative depending on what other guys do, but basically, there's a strong pricing trend underlying the activity that's attributable to the relatively high crude price. And in some cases, we're leading price increases, in some we're following, but that's the most positive sign. So basically, what that means is that we're going to have probably a strong second half in 2010 but I think in 2011, the stage is set for even a more robust recovery and workover. 
Nabors Offshore, in a sense, we'll probably do something -- we did about $8 million this quarter. Even this quarter, however, was -- operating income, even this quarter was impacted $2 million or $3 million by the Gulf spill. And the Gulf spill manifests itself in two ways, really, one -- I mean, one we have the moratorium and the other, we have a delay in getting permits to drill. And whether it's a moratorium or otherwise, or there are no permits to drill, they're not going to drill. And we have six rigs on platforms or SPARs that are adversely impacted. And some of the jack-ups even aren't working as they might have with the permits. 
So basically, if the worse-case scenario, I think, is down $25 million for the year compared to what it would have been without the spill and I think there are hopefully signs that this might be mitigated before the end of the year. But I guess by the end of the year, we'll do close to $10 million instead of $35 million this year and next year, I think, we'll do $35 million, plus we still have a bunch of things that we've referred to before with one SPAR platform work that will manifest itself in late 2011. And I'll talk a little bit more about that later.
Nabors Alaska, I guess, it's a declining field. We have not been successful in new builds there for BP. And BP is also -- BP right at the moment controls vast majority of the drilling. They're the operator for most of the drilling, and they're cutting back and Nabors was not super successful with BP. But we do have probably the best tool for the future on the Slope and that's a coiled tubing unit. And this is something, in other words, this year is down from last year. Next year, probably will be down as well. Not probably, will be down as well.
We still have decent returns on capital employed, but beyond that, I think some time next year, we  get one or two of these coiled tubing units, which are not only good for what they're doing now, but they're super good for the shallow high-viscosity drilling that's going to be going on forever on the Slope, while crude price stays even below where it's at now, but at a good level when they figure out how to optimize the extraction of those. Anyway, I think the outlook is short-term, down, but long-term, I think, considering it's a defining field, we're in relatively good shape.
Canada, again, this unit has lousy seasonal quarter, and we have a loss. But the loss was less than the obviously, less than the operating profit in the first quarter, but less of the smaller loss than we expected. So things are doing better than we expected. We'll do better this year. This is the unit that had made as much as $180 million operating income. And I think we have a shot at that, but we won't have a shot at that until gas prices are six-ish or better. Horn River still remains a super bright spot for us in Canada. 
Oil and Gas, I think the major interest in Oil and Gas is what our plans are to monetize, i.e. convert these assets, which haven't been doing us much good on a stock-price basis in cash. And I guess, to brief the situation is, we're three months closer than we were last quarter to number one, going public with NFR. I'll repeat that story briefly. NFR is a joint venture, 50-50 with us and First Reserve. We have roughly the lower half $500,000 [indiscernible] invested in it. We expect to go public in less than three quarters, some time in the first quarter next year or second quarter next year. Although if the situation permits, we're prepared to pull the trigger on it. We think right now, we have three or four competent investment banks showing us that unless the world goes to hell in a hand basket, we'll have the equity knot of $2 billion, which means $1 billion for us. And I said, we invested about $0.5 billion. The GAAP, SEC dictated fixed impairments to make our holdings around $115 million, $120 million. So that's essentially where it was before, but things are looking a bit -- our well results are really good there, which is going to help the IPO. 
The second area, which is largely the first area to actually generate cash is Colombia, where we have our own stuff, the kind of sent Nabors around sort [ph] on stuff. Now we have E&P, we have 50-50 joint venture with First Reserve. That stuff together is, we're going to market it together, that's about 7,000 barrels a day of oil and a lot pizzazz. There's universal interest in that. And I still expect to sell it before the end of the year. But we now have completed our drilling, which we had completed the dry season drilling last quarter. And we know what we got and what we can sell. In other words, we've increased the reserves, we cut the actual more producibility of our production to sell, and we have more sizzle on discoveries. 
I think the final area is Canada where essentially, which happened since last time as we interviewed, reviewed a number of bankers and we're close to finalizing a deal with the bank and we obviously want a banker who knows the area really well and has real good connections with, we think, the logical buyer, which is a Far East buyer with liquefied natural gas interests and connections.
I think the other point on this is we are considering now, this is purely accounting, but it would help maybe present it, interpret as some of our data, some of our E&P operations can be at this point legitimately considered discontinued operations and therefore, separated. And the one that is going to be continuing 100%, which is NFR, they're doing really well. It's hidden and obscured by our investments in the other ones, which we have -- they're really investments, like seismic is really an investment. We've decided we had to write it off. 
Our other segments are doing really well and I'd say, Canrig, in particular, is doing well with its technology and that's manifesting itself in not only profit for Canrig and sales of top drives in the market and stuff like that, but also in enhancing the overall saleability of Nabors' rigs.
In summary, we talked briefly about -- our financing is in pretty good shape. We have essentially $900 million in cash and equivalent. All of that is not available. Some of it -- a lot of it's tied up. We expect to get some more. But basically, we have enough in the way of cash and earnings over and above relative to CapEx, that we're in pretty decent shape to -- we really wanted to squeeze CapEx. We did come close to paying up the whole $1.4 million remaining in our debt due in May of 2011. Basically, we've taken that debt down from $2.75 million, which it was to $1.4 million. And I think net-net over the last year and a half, we've borrowed the $1.25 million in January of '09 to make sure we didn't have a jam. And we paid out net $1.125 million, plus another approximately $500 million of debt. 
Let me say, I'm bullish, even -- I was always reasonably bullish long term, but now I'm bullish intermediate term and maybe even shorter. Let me go through just a few of the points that lead me to that. I think we have the best infrastructure internationally than anybody has. I mean, if you look at it in terms of leading driller in Saudi and biggest private position in Algeria, biggest driller in Yemen, et cetera. And when we get together where we want to get by introducing and integrating, say our line existing operations into that mudlogging and if we are ultimately successful in broadening our scope, I think, the intermediate term, that will be a big plus. 
USA-based rigs are doing really well. I have two things I look out as one proof of the pudding in the orders and we're doing super well on new build orders. And the rest of it is, what the most discriminating buyers are doing. I mean 100% of Shell, BP, in the last three, four years, we've got essentially 100% of the incremental work and overall, we have probably 80% of their work. We did, on Exxon, we did probably the most sensitive well drilled in the last year, so which is Point Thomson and that work in Alaska, and that was a monster, I'd say, success. And we're doing the Papua New Guinea, both of them, which they seem really happy about even though we haven't delivered the rig yet or spudded anything, but I think that's important. I think that will manifest itself with a increased utilization in the states where it hadn't been. 
We, frankly, broke H&P's monopoly on platforms, SPAR rigs with a major consumer, which is -- I think we've talked about the Fil Mosby [ph] where we clearly had the best technology. And I hope not the very best price and we'd have the best technology. So in general I think, if I look at what is fundamental, the important for long term, I'd have a basis for optimism and that covers what I have prepared to say. Thank you."

And British Columbia is kind of a strange thing because what's happened in sales so far, and what's been cooking, some of it has happened and some of it hasn't happened is the buyer is going to be probably from the Far East, probably -- with not probably, almost certainly, with real long-term views and with really low cost of capital, one way or another. And with interest on the whole supply chain, however you want to put it, of liquefied natural gas, in other words, some electrical consumer, electrical company consumer in Japan or Korea. They now have an interest in owning a chunk of the whole thing, from the resource to the liquefaction to the transportation. And that represents an opportunity for the guys who promote -- for example, the traders, they're generally involved in putting this kind of thing together. Unlike the Matsui, Mitsubishi's narrow bendings, putting things like this together and they don't go broke putting it together, like most bankers don't. And it's a kind of demand that we don't have here. I think and I think most players think that, that's the logical market for our stuff in British Columbia. So it's a little difficult. It isn't like say, what's EOG going to pay for this, compared to what they have now. That isn't the outlook for us, if EOG's investing in the LNG plan already. I don't know if that's the answer though. So the value for that, even though it's gas, is hard to quantify. It could be really big. So basically, what I'm saying is we have a pretty fair idea of what LNG is going to bring. It's likely that we can sell pretty well ,Colombia [gas], because it's 100% crude and we know there [indiscernible]. For British Columbia, there may be half of dozen really good buyers. There might be 50 or 60 good buyers for the Columbia gas. Almost everybody in Canada is interested in it. And I think that'll sell pretty well.

As usual, we have posted to the Nabors' website a series of slides that contain details about the performance of the various segments of the company. Please refer to these as we proceed. I'll try to be as I usually try to be short of the normal and give the highlights and give room for questioning thereafter. 
Again, it was a terrific quarter. I think the clear bottom line, however, is that because of our solid operational performance in our North American businesses, we had $164 million of operating income in the quarter, overall, and $0.29 in earnings per share, exclusive of items and I'll spend a few minutes on the items.
These are changes from GAAP results and as usual, you folks are welcome to and usually do making our own adjustments to what we think is an investment. Firstly, our Canadian and Colombian E&P assets are not only on sale, but I'll discuss later how that's proceeding. And so we've previously said in ourselves to classify those as discontinued operation, and the impact of that is that they were not discontinued operations, pro forma the adjusted earnings would have been $0.27 instead of the $0.29. So that's a $0.02 impact. 
In addition, here are some of the other things, pretax. $37 million write-down of buildings in HH are Chinese rig manufacturer even though we have a sizable unrealized gain in that. We have expensed $7 million pretax cost related to the acquisition of Superior Well Services Inc. And finally, we have a number of pretax non-cash asset impairment, which added up to $0.33 per share after taxes. A pretax number of $54 million in E&P investments, which is unlikely to be recovered given the forward script of Gas. $45 million in goodwill is largely related to the spill and the impact of the spill on near term and certainty of utilization in some of Nabors offshore assets. And another $24 million pretax including North American Drilling, U.S. Wells Servicing and Canadian Drilling and our work over. So a whole bunch of stuff because of the low gas pricing and relatively little impact be in the test that's being written off. 
An important development in the quarter was the acquisition of Superior for an enterprise value of approximately $900 million and essentially in all-cash transaction, which we're able to close in a pretty quick time. We funded this transaction through the placement of the $700 million debt offering, with about a 5% yield in cash on hand. Superior is a company with excellent equipment and great technical expertise that they have recently been constrained by lack of capital for growth and Nabors is ready and willing and able to submit the capital required to achieve Superiors potential. 
Another notable achievement in the quarter was the securing of 11 new long-term contracts and new builds rigs in our Lower 48 drilling unit. A large percentage of this will go to the Bakken. We are the market leaders. Two more will go to Marcellus, we have some catching up to do. But we expect to have a dozen rigs operating there by the end of next year. 
Before I turn to the unit pad, note that we're seeing what has become an industry trend. That being the natural operations continued to be weaker than expected for our U.S. results are exceeding expectations.
I should also obviously note the obvious thing that our domestic results were augmented by regularly strong contributions from Superior Well Services affecting operations even though that only reflected 20 days of operations. These 20 days yielded $12 million in operating income, which implied an annual rate of earnings of $220 million, which I think is a reasonable standard to hold us to even though there are risk. There are risk in the rig count, there are rigs on coming frac-ing equipment. And in particular, there are fourth quarter seasonal issues as we have in work over associated with the Frac-ing business. 
Let me turn to NDUSA. Our U.S. Land Drilling operations is surprisingly well in spite of the persistently anomalous, incredibly low gas prices and pretty poor future curve. Results of $70-plus million for the quarter were up from $58 million on the prior quarter. The average rig count actually increased to 10 rigs to 182. It was an average rig margin of $8,628, which was up $840 per day from the prior period. The average margin consists of the bifurcated $11,000 margin for our 95 base rigs that operate during the quarter and roughly $7,100 for the balance of the fleet.
I think the day rate increase reflected a bunch of factors. Increased margins from rig that had been on standby. They're making 8,500 going to an operating mode with margin might be $3,000 or $4,000 higher. I think the more important thing was the leading edge of rates per existing rigs declined pretty dramatically and then improved pretty substantially, the latter was probably the main factor. These increases were offset by operating pads and we're planning on margins being essentially flat next year, maybe up a modest amount but essentially flat. 
As I previously mentioned, we secured the level of growth contracts during the quarter, bringing the year total to 20 new build contracts and three major FDR modifications with the same economic effect as a new build contract. The market acceptance of our new 1,500 horsepower B class rig is I think the particular bright spot. This rig was developed for deeper pad drilling prospects like those usually found in the Bakken and Eagle Ford.
We think the trends in the market are maintainable but there's pretty great risk. For example, our Haynesville joint venture decided that they really can't economically hedge right now and they can't economically continue six rigs in April. So they have, even though 95% of their assets eventually, we'll have to drill up there, moving probably up to four rigs of the six they have in Eagle Ford, which is probably what's going on in the industry as a whole. Anyway, right now, I think although there's risk to it, if next year, sustained account level of rig activity which is around 188 settled represented an increase of almost 15 rigs from this year's average and if that happens, as I've said it's a rig risk, if that happens, even at the same margins that will be up a notable increase in income. 
International. Results in this unit were modestly and it was $64 million for the quarter compared to our $65 million, essentially flat for the prior quarter. But they were substantially below expectations. And I think there were two major factors here. One is that Mexico and Saudi Arabia were industry that everybody knew that were involved in those two places that adversely impacted. The problem is it's a bigger portion of our portfolio than anybody else is, specifically, for example, last year versus this year, we're projecting a pretty sizable drop. And of the roughly $125 million operating income drop we're protecting, roughly $100 million of that is in Mexico and Saudi Arabia. And as I've said before, we expected a pickup in Iraq, and the good news is we're getting awards in Iraq and the bad news is the margins don't make us rich really.
So we remain confident, however, that PEMEX will sooner or later, they have to sell their financial problems but clearly [indiscernible] sooner. And we are seeing an increase in activity in international, but it's going to be offset by major hits on our jack-ups in that market, renewed at lower comp market prices. I think the bottom line, however, here is I'm now convinced that even though things are not great during the quarter and they won't be great next year either, I'm pretty much convinced we're  at the bottom. And longer term, the pressure of a strong oil price and worldwide infrastructure and the reputation and the quality of the rigs will be pretty significant and favorable. The important thing is I think the bottom is here. Nabors Well-Servicing posted probable results of $9 million, a noticeable improvement over the $3-ish million in the second quarter.
The second quarter was largely negatively impacted by gearing up for growth that we're now seeing with extra labor cost and stuff and things like that. I think we have -- with that operation I think is heading substantially in the right direction. I think the management has been unchanged, as you know, they're doing pretty well. They have a modest improvement in pricing. We have actually market position increased and sooner or later, the $80-plus crude is going to impact that favorably. 
Also, this unit will substantially benefit from the superior acquisition. Ready the same economy of scale related to real estate consolidations, and we'll probably see more of that as we get into it, and we've also moved Superior's Fluid Management business into Nabors Well-Servicing where, I think, we can effectively, more effectively drive growth and profitability. So as I look forward to sustained improved results in Nabors Well-Servicing. 
Canada. Canada was up a little bit, modestly positive compared to a loss in the preceding quarter, which was typically seasonal in nature. Our new management is performing exceptionally well and the effort for the year is expected to be more than doubled what we originally forecasted. However, double a relatively small number doesn't make us rich. We continue to be encouraged by the improving activity in this market, particularly the oil-directed drilling in the traditional areas of Saskatchewan and Alberta. And that also includes new oil shale cutting. 
In addition, we're having actually significant activity and profitability in our drilling in support of product production. So future drilling in Canada are definitely shifting to heavy doubles in Alberta. And as we frequently mentioned previously, the higher horsepower rigs or pad drilling in the British Columbia shales. Again, I'll repeat that while we traditionally have less than a 10% overall market position, we consistently have a 40% in the Horn River and to the extent that, that represents the future of the key service is pretty good.  
Nabors Offshore. We reported a loss of $1 million in the third quarter, down from a gain in the prior quarter. We expect a similar low, not bad results in the fourth quarter. This unit was pretty obviously, that is being impacted by the Gulf of Mexico, by the BP issue. And we get through our, the Haynes, we think that the impact of the BP in our operations was probably on the quarter of $30-ish million of operating income this year. 
So even though we make a positive and decent number, I guess we're now projecting $14 million operating income for the year. That was probably would have been in mid-40s after tax. And next year, we're projecting a come back, but not up to that level. It's pretty high to project. 
Alaska. Results in Alaska were $14 million for the quarter, up from the prior quarter and some of this was we recognized income that otherwise would have been recognized in the future. It's pretty good but the facts are this level of income is not likely to continue in 2011, primarily because of lack of BP stability to figure out exactly what they want to do. And obviously, it didn't help when we lost three new builds that BP awarded to competitors a couple of years ago. As a result, we believe that next year's results will be probably 40% of what we delivered this year.
With respect to BP in the last couple of weeks, I spoke probably 45 minutes with the new E&P boss of production under their new set up. This was that in the last few gain and the guy is quite good and he's acutely aware of our performance particularly in the Lower 48. And I guess he spent probably 30 hours and that was John Minge, who's the CEO of BP Alaska. Net-net I think our future with BP -- first of all, BP does not make out thinking of surviving, I think, eventually, do recently well. I think our position with them is going to be pretty good. Specifically, for example, in Alaska, everybody is certain that the heavy oil is going to be developed someday, somewhat. I think even more immediate than that is kind of the low [indiscernible] of which BP is identified based on a couple of frac well that's to be drilled. And the issue of negotiating with the state and taxes quit proposing, all that stuff. But eventually, I think it's possible to come back. Frankly, I still think we have the best two tools in Alaska, Rig 19 and CDR 2. And I think, we're going to get more profit from those and I think sooner or later, they'll be emulated. 
Superior Well Services, we completed this on September 10. And again, I repeat the $5 million we're investing in this quarter was a pleasant surprise and represented the last 20 days of the quarter. Let me emphasize that in the short time, we've been associated with very much impressed quality of equipment. The technical expertise of sales people in the whole organization, the capability of management and perhaps even more important, super favorable comments we're getting from pretty important knowledgeable customers don't let that equity head up.
The synergies as we expected when we made these acquisitions kind of relatively low-hanging fruit now. And most of you these are related to our Well-Servicing business, which has a lot of locations throughout the country as those Superior. The first deal we did on consolidating the location in Eagle Ford was Superior is going to have to pay on a lease for stepping here as we own the thing. So the difference in cost of capital and the availability of capital was making a difference. And I think I do want to emphasize though while I'm prepared to have the $12 million in 20 days be extended, that's accountable for us, there are risks in this business. There are rig risks, there are rig count risks, there are frac equipment risks, there are seasonal risk. Typically in the fourth quarter, we will have a seasonal impact that we are not used to.
Moved to Nabors Oil and Gas, as I mentioned last quarter, we have retained good investment package with the sale of our Canadian and Colombian E&P assets. And consequently, because we're pretty much on the way there, we classify this, re-classify them as discontinued operations. The marketing process that has been going on for several weeks and I'd say we're on schedule to date. We have more in expect expressions of interest than we had anticipated. I think it's virtually secular, but it's highly probable that by the next report we'll have something really firm of at least one of these two things. And our expectations in pricing haven't changed. So I think it's affected and reinforced. That we won't know until we hit the projects. 
Let me talk briefly about NFR. They're showing a profit, but also part of the profit is because we have -- most of the profit is because we have a good decent hedging program there. We continued to contemplate and prepare an IPO, although it's going to be perfectly run at these prices at yesterday's closed, an IPO won't be feasible. It won't be feasible until the gas price gets some better. Clearly, there has to be some way and a lot of them are dependent how well we do within the oil in Eagle Ford, stuff that we're now working on. 
The results in other operating segments were very good, and that's third-party sales which from Canrig that's very good and good contributions from our Alaskan last joint venture companies. The technology developed at Canrig continues to be a significant plus enable us to make money by declining the technology of the third-parties or enhanced the marketability and value of various rigs.
Our financial position is strong. We have a little over $800 million in cash and investment as of the end of quarter. This balance reflects, as I mentioned before, essentially the outcast acquisition of Superior, as well as the proceeds for $700 million of senior unsecured notes. In mid-September, we also established the first time in probably a decade a $700 million revolving credit facility, which allowed us to borrow that I find almost unbelievable rates of LIBOR plus 1.50%. We can access this market in less than 2%. And I don't see LIBOR changing very much a bit but the question will be, can we find good use for money. 
In May 2011, we redeemed our $1.4 billion remaining face, I don't know what the accounting number is but we actually owe $1.4 billion and we'll do that relatively easy. I mean, the sources to fund our cash flow and even with a substantial investment program, combination of cash flow, cash on hand and the proceeds from the sale, even if we sell half of the real estate of the E&P assets by the end of 2011. We won't need to borrow money, we might have occasionally, seasonally, temporarily use the revolver and we certainly won't have to issue equity. 
Moving further, the GAAP tax rate to non-GAAP tax rate was probably 13.5%. And we expect that the fourth quarter will be about the same. But we expect the tax rate in 2011 to be 20% and that's based on the increased income we're expecting from Superior, U.S. income. And I think that our position basically is with the investment we're making in the NOLs with 79 of the cash tax payer and we probably won't be next year either. 
Bottom line is that I'm very bullish longer term, maybe even after medium term. I'm now convinced as I was in the couple of months ago that we've reached the bottom in NDIL, and although it's going to be pretty poor this year and pretty poor next year, sooner or later. And in this case, I expect a little sooner maybe beginning at the end of 2011. The high crude price will drive recovery in the international markets and the quality of our rigs, infrastructure and personnel will enable us to fully participate. 
I think the other thing that boosted my confidence is what's going on in the U.S., I think the 23 rigs, 21 new goals and three were major FCR upgrades, which have economic equivalency of new builds. That demonstrates to me that our estimates are pretty confident that's it's going to be drilling and it's even more pleases me that we're getting more than our overall market share in this market. So that's not only good. So those two things, namely that we won't go lower internationally. And we'll likely to go stronger with Superior, domestically, to make the outlook look pretty decent. 
And just as a final comment I think the unrecognized value of some of the things that I mentioned hopefully over the next few quarters as demonstrates, we'll convert those into bottom line results and I think when it happens and I think it will. We'll be happy and our investors will be happy as well. Anyway, that concludes my comments."

Again, welcome everybody to the third quarter conference earnings conference call. Again, I want to thank you for participating. As usual, we have posted to the Nabors' website a series of slides that contain details about the performance of the various segments of the company. Please refer to these as we proceed. I'll try to be as I usually try to be short of the normal and give the highlights and give room for questioning thereafter. 
Again, it was a terrific quarter. I think the clear bottom line, however, is that because of our solid operational performance in our North American businesses, we had $164 million of operating income in the quarter, overall, and $0.29 in earnings per share, exclusive of items and I'll spend a few minutes on the items.
These are changes from GAAP results and as usual, you folks are welcome to and usually do making our own adjustments to what we think is an investment. Firstly, our Canadian and Colombian E&P assets are not only on sale, but I'll discuss later how that's proceeding. And so we've previously said in ourselves to classify those as discontinued operation, and the impact of that is that they were not discontinued operations, pro forma the adjusted earnings would have been $0.27 instead of the $0.29. So that's a $0.02 impact. 
In addition, here are some of the other things, pretax. $37 million write-down of buildings in HH are Chinese rig manufacturer even though we have a sizable unrealized gain in that. We have expensed $7 million pretax cost related to the acquisition of Superior Well Services Inc. And finally, we have a number of pretax non-cash asset impairment, which added up to $0.33 per share after taxes. A pretax number of $54 million in E&P investments, which is unlikely to be recovered given the forward script of Gas. $45 million in goodwill is largely related to the spill and the impact of the spill on near term and certainty of utilization in some of Nabors offshore assets. And another $24 million pretax including North American Drilling, U.S. Wells Servicing and Canadian Drilling and our work over. So a whole bunch of stuff because of the low gas pricing and relatively little impact be in the test that's being written off. 
An important development in the quarter was the acquisition of Superior for an enterprise value of approximately $900 million and essentially in all-cash transaction, which we're able to close in a pretty quick time. We funded this transaction through the placement of the $700 million debt offering, with about a 5% yield in cash on hand. Superior is a company with excellent equipment and great technical expertise that they have recently been constrained by lack of capital for growth and Nabors is ready and willing and able to submit the capital required to achieve Superiors potential. 
Another notable achievement in the quarter was the securing of 11 new long-term contracts and new builds rigs in our Lower 48 drilling unit. A large percentage of this will go to the Bakken. We are the market leaders. Two more will go to Marcellus, we have some catching up to do. But we expect to have a dozen rigs operating there by the end of next year. 
Before I turn to the unit pad, note that we're seeing what has become an industry trend. That being the natural operations continued to be weaker than expected for our U.S. results are exceeding expectations.
I should also obviously note the obvious thing that our domestic results were augmented by regularly strong contributions from Superior Well Services affecting operations even though that only reflected 20 days of operations. These 20 days yielded $12 million in operating income, which implied an annual rate of earnings of $220 million, which I think is a reasonable standard to hold us to even though there are risk. There are risk in the rig count, there are rigs on coming frac-ing equipment. And in particular, there are fourth quarter seasonal issues as we have in work over associated with the Frac-ing business. 
Let me turn to NDUSA. Our U.S. Land Drilling operations is surprisingly well in spite of the persistently anomalous, incredibly low gas prices and pretty poor future curve. Results of $70-plus million for the quarter were up from $58 million on the prior quarter. The average rig count actually increased to 10 rigs to 182. It was an average rig margin of $8,628, which was up $840 per day from the prior period. The average margin consists of the bifurcated $11,000 margin for our 95 base rigs that operate during the quarter and roughly $7,100 for the balance of the fleet.
I think the day rate increase reflected a bunch of factors. Increased margins from rig that had been on standby. They're making 8,500 going to an operating mode with margin might be $3,000 or $4,000 higher. I think the more important thing was the leading edge of rates per existing rigs declined pretty dramatically and then improved pretty substantially, the latter was probably the main factor. These increases were offset by operating pads and we're planning on margins being essentially flat next year, maybe up a modest amount but essentially flat. 
As I previously mentioned, we secured the level of growth contracts during the quarter, bringing the year total to 20 new build contracts and three major FDR modifications with the same economic effect as a new build contract. The market acceptance of our new 1,500 horsepower B class rig is I think the particular bright spot. This rig was developed for deeper pad drilling prospects like those usually found in the Bakken and Eagle Ford.
We think the trends in the market are maintainable but there's pretty great risk. For example, our Haynesville joint venture decided that they really can't economically hedge right now and they can't economically continue six rigs in April. So they have, even though 95% of their assets eventually, we'll have to drill up there, moving probably up to four rigs of the six they have in Eagle Ford, which is probably what's going on in the industry as a whole. Anyway, right now, I think although there's risk to it, if next year, sustained account level of rig activity which is around 188 settled represented an increase of almost 15 rigs from this year's average and if that happens, as I've said it's a rig risk, if that happens, even at the same margins that will be up a notable increase in income. 
International. Results in this unit were modestly and it was $64 million for the quarter compared to our $65 million, essentially flat for the prior quarter. But they were substantially below expectations. And I think there were two major factors here. One is that Mexico and Saudi Arabia were industry that everybody knew that were involved in those two places that adversely impacted. The problem is it's a bigger portion of our portfolio than anybody else is, specifically, for example, last year versus this year, we're projecting a pretty sizable drop. And of the roughly $125 million operating income drop we're protecting, roughly $100 million of that is in Mexico and Saudi Arabia. And as I've said before, we expected a pickup in Iraq, and the good news is we're getting awards in Iraq and the bad news is the margins don't make us rich really.
So we remain confident, however, that PEMEX will sooner or later, they have to sell their financial problems but clearly [indiscernible] sooner. And we are seeing an increase in activity in international, but it's going to be offset by major hits on our jack-ups in that market, renewed at lower comp market prices. I think the bottom line, however, here is I'm now convinced that even though things are not great during the quarter and they won't be great next year either, I'm pretty much convinced we're  at the bottom. And longer term, the pressure of a strong oil price and worldwide infrastructure and the reputation and the quality of the rigs will be pretty significant and favorable. The important thing is I think the bottom is here. Nabors Well-Servicing posted probable results of $9 million, a noticeable improvement over the $3-ish million in the second quarter.
The second quarter was largely negatively impacted by gearing up for growth that we're now seeing with extra labor cost and stuff and things like that. I think we have -- with that operation I think is heading substantially in the right direction. I think the management has been unchanged, as you know, they're doing pretty well. They have a modest improvement in pricing. We have actually market position increased and sooner or later, the $80-plus crude is going to impact that favorably. 
Also, this unit will substantially benefit from the superior acquisition. Ready the same economy of scale related to real estate consolidations, and we'll probably see more of that as we get into it, and we've also moved Superior's Fluid Management business into Nabors Well-Servicing where, I think, we can effectively, more effectively drive growth and profitability. So as I look forward to sustained improved results in Nabors Well-Servicing. 
Canada. Canada was up a little bit, modestly positive compared to a loss in the preceding quarter, which was typically seasonal in nature. Our new management is performing exceptionally well and the effort for the year is expected to be more than doubled what we originally forecasted. However, double a relatively small number doesn't make us rich. We continue to be encouraged by the improving activity in this market, particularly the oil-directed drilling in the traditional areas of Saskatchewan and Alberta. And that also includes new oil shale cutting. 
In addition, we're having actually significant activity and profitability in our drilling in support of product production. So future drilling in Canada are definitely shifting to heavy doubles in Alberta. And as we frequently mentioned previously, the higher horsepower rigs or pad drilling in the British Columbia shales. Again, I'll repeat that while we traditionally have less than a 10% overall market position, we consistently have a 40% in the Horn River and to the extent that, that represents the future of the key service is pretty good.  
Nabors Offshore. We reported a loss of $1 million in the third quarter, down from a gain in the prior quarter. We expect a similar low, not bad results in the fourth quarter. This unit was pretty obviously, that is being impacted by the Gulf of Mexico, by the BP issue. And we get through our, the Haynes, we think that the impact of the BP in our operations was probably on the quarter of $30-ish million of operating income this year. 
So even though we make a positive and decent number, I guess we're now projecting $14 million operating income for the year. That was probably would have been in mid-40s after tax. And next year, we're projecting a come back, but not up to that level. It's pretty high to project. 
Alaska. Results in Alaska were $14 million for the quarter, up from the prior quarter and some of this was we recognized income that otherwise would have been recognized in the future. It's pretty good but the facts are this level of income is not likely to continue in 2011, primarily because of lack of BP stability to figure out exactly what they want to do. And obviously, it didn't help when we lost three new builds that BP awarded to competitors a couple of years ago. As a result, we believe that next year's results will be probably 40% of what we delivered this year.
With respect to BP in the last couple of weeks, I spoke probably 45 minutes with the new E&P boss of production under their new set up. This was that in the last few gain and the guy is quite good and he's acutely aware of our performance particularly in the Lower 48. And I guess he spent probably 30 hours and that was John Minge, who's the CEO of BP Alaska. Net-net I think our future with BP -- first of all, BP does not make out thinking of surviving, I think, eventually, do recently well. I think our position with them is going to be pretty good. Specifically, for example, in Alaska, everybody is certain that the heavy oil is going to be developed someday, somewhat. I think even more immediate than that is kind of the low [indiscernible] of which BP is identified based on a couple of frac well that's to be drilled. And the issue of negotiating with the state and taxes quit proposing, all that stuff. But eventually, I think it's possible to come back. Frankly, I still think we have the best two tools in Alaska, Rig 19 and CDR 2. And I think, we're going to get more profit from those and I think sooner or later, they'll be emulated. 
Superior Well Services, we completed this on September 10. And again, I repeat the $5 million we're investing in this quarter was a pleasant surprise and represented the last 20 days of the quarter. Let me emphasize that in the short time, we've been associated with very much impressed quality of equipment. The technical expertise of sales people in the whole organization, the capability of management and perhaps even more important, super favorable comments we're getting from pretty important knowledgeable customers don't let that equity head up.
The synergies as we expected when we made these acquisitions kind of relatively low-hanging fruit now. And most of you these are related to our Well-Servicing business, which has a lot of locations throughout the country as those Superior. The first deal we did on consolidating the location in Eagle Ford was Superior is going to have to pay on a lease for stepping here as we own the thing. So the difference in cost of capital and the availability of capital was making a difference. And I think I do want to emphasize though while I'm prepared to have the $12 million in 20 days be extended, that's accountable for us, there are risks in this business. There are rig risks, there are rig count risks, there are frac equipment risks, there are seasonal risk. Typically in the fourth quarter, we will have a seasonal impact that we are not used to.
Moved to Nabors Oil and Gas, as I mentioned last quarter, we have retained good investment package with the sale of our Canadian and Colombian E&P assets. And consequently, because we're pretty much on the way there, we classify this, re-classify them as discontinued operations. The marketing process that has been going on for several weeks and I'd say we're on schedule to date. We have more in expect expressions of interest than we had anticipated. I think it's virtually secular, but it's highly probable that by the next report we'll have something really firm of at least one of these two things. And our expectations in pricing haven't changed. So I think it's affected and reinforced. That we won't know until we hit the projects. 
Let me talk briefly about NFR. They're showing a profit, but also part of the profit is because we have -- most of the profit is because we have a good decent hedging program there. We continued to contemplate and prepare an IPO, although it's going to be perfectly run at these prices at yesterday's closed, an IPO won't be feasible. It won't be feasible until the gas price gets some better. Clearly, there has to be some way and a lot of them are dependent how well we do within the oil in Eagle Ford, stuff that we're now working on. 
The results in other operating segments were very good, and that's third-party sales which from Canrig that's very good and good contributions from our Alaskan last joint venture companies. The technology developed at Canrig continues to be a significant plus enable us to make money by declining the technology of the third-parties or enhanced the marketability and value of various rigs.
Our financial position is strong. We have a little over $800 million in cash and investment as of the end of quarter. This balance reflects, as I mentioned before, essentially the outcast acquisition of Superior, as well as the proceeds for $700 million of senior unsecured notes. In mid-September, we also established the first time in probably a decade a $700 million revolving credit facility, which allowed us to borrow that I find almost unbelievable rates of LIBOR plus 1.50%. We can access this market in less than 2%. And I don't see LIBOR changing very much a bit but the question will be, can we find good use for money. 
In May 2011, we redeemed our $1.4 billion remaining face, I don't know what the accounting number is but we actually owe $1.4 billion and we'll do that relatively easy. I mean, the sources to fund our cash flow and even with a substantial investment program, combination of cash flow, cash on hand and the proceeds from the sale, even if we sell half of the real estate of the E&P assets by the end of 2011. We won't need to borrow money, we might have occasionally, seasonally, temporarily use the revolver and we certainly won't have to issue equity. 
Moving further, the GAAP tax rate to non-GAAP tax rate was probably 13.5%. And we expect that the fourth quarter will be about the same. But we expect the tax rate in 2011 to be 20% and that's based on the increased income we're expecting from Superior, U.S. income. And I think that our position basically is with the investment we're making in the NOLs with 79 of the cash tax payer and we probably won't be next year either. 
Bottom line is that I'm very bullish longer term, maybe even after medium term. I'm now convinced as I was in the couple of months ago that we've reached the bottom in NDIL, and although it's going to be pretty poor this year and pretty poor next year, sooner or later. And in this case, I expect a little sooner maybe beginning at the end of 2011. The high crude price will drive recovery in the international markets and the quality of our rigs, infrastructure and personnel will enable us to fully participate. 
I think the other thing that boosted my confidence is what's going on in the U.S., I think the 23 rigs, 21 new goals and three were major FCR upgrades, which have economic equivalency of new builds. That demonstrates to me that our estimates are pretty confident that's it's going to be drilling and it's even more pleases me that we're getting more than our overall market share in this market. So that's not only good. So those two things, namely that we won't go lower internationally. And we'll likely to go stronger with Superior, domestically, to make the outlook look pretty decent. 
And just as a final comment I think the unrecognized value of some of the things that I mentioned hopefully over the next few quarters as demonstrates, we'll convert those into bottom line results and I think when it happens and I think it will. We'll be happy and our investors will be happy as well. Anyway, that concludes my comments.

As usual, we have posted to the Nabors' website a series of slides that contain details about the performance of the various segments of the company. Please refer to these as we proceed. I'll try to be as I usually try to be, short of the normal and give the highlights and leave room for questioning thereafter. 
Again, it was a noisy quarter. I think the clear bottom line, however, is that because of our solid operational performance in our North American businesses, we had $164 million of operating income in the quarter, overall, and $0.29 in earnings per share exclusive of items. And I'll spend a few minutes on the items.
These are changes from GAAP results, and as usual, you folks are welcome to and usually do make your own adjustments to what we think is an investment. Firstly, our Canadian and Colombian E&P assets are not only on sale, but I'll discuss later how that's proceeding. And so we've previously in ourselves decided to classify those as discontinued operation, and the impact of that is that they were not discontinued operations pro forma. The adjusted earnings would have been $0.27 instead of the $0.29. So that's a $0.02 impact. 
In addition, here are some of the other things, pretax. $37 million write-down of buildings in HH, our Chinese rig manufacturer, even though we have a sizable unrealized gain in that. We have expensed $7 million pretax cost related to the acquisition of Superior Well Services Inc. And finally, we have a number of pretax non-cash asset impairment which added up to $0.33 per share after taxes, a pretax number of $54 million in E&P investments which is unlikely to be recovered given the forward script of Gas, $45 million in goodwill is largely related to the spill and the impact of the spill on near term and certainty of utilization in some of Nabors offshore assets, and another $24 million pretax including North American Drilling, U.S. Wells Servicing and Canadian Drilling and our work over. So a whole bunch of stuff because of the low gas pricing and relatively little impact be in the test that's being written off. 
An important development in the quarter was the acquisition of Superior for an enterprise value of approximately $900 million and essentially an all-cash transaction, which we were able to close in a pretty quick time. We funded this transaction through the placement of the $700 million debt offering with about a 5% yield and cash on hand. Superior is a company with excellent equipment and great technical expertise, but they have recently been constrained by a lack of capital for growth and Nabors is ready and willing and able to submit the capital required to achieve Superior's potential. 
Another notable achievement in the quarter was the securing of 11 new long-term contracts and new builds rigs in our Lower 48 drilling unit. A large percentage of these will go to the Bakken. We are the market leaders. Two more will go to Marcellus. We have some catching up to do, but we expect to have a dozen rigs operating there by the end of next year. 
Before I turn to the units, I'd note that we're seeing what has become an industry trend, that being the international operations continued to be weaker than expected, while our U.S. results are exceeding expectations.
I should also obviously note the obvious thing that our domestic results were augmented by regularly strong contributions from Superior Well Services affecting operations even though that only reflected 20 days of operations. These 20 days yielded $12 million in operating income, which implied an annual rate of earnings of $220 million, which I think is a reasonable standard to hold us to even though there are risks. There are risks in the rig count. There are risks on oncoming frac-ing equipment. And in particular, there are fourth quarter seasonal issues as we have in work over associated with the Frac-ing business. 
Let me turn to NDUSA. Our U.S. Land Drilling operations is surprisingly well in spite of the persistently anomalous, incredibly low gas prices and pretty poor future curve. Results of $70-plus million for the quarter were up from $58 million on the prior quarter. The average rig count actually increased to 10 rigs to 182 with an average rig margin of $8,628, which was up $840 per day from the prior period. The average margin consists of the bifurcated $11,000 margin for our 95 base rigs that operate during the quarter and roughly $7,100 for the balance of the fleet.
I think the day rate increase reflected a bunch of factors. Increased margins from rigs that had been on standby. They're making $8,500 going to an operating mode where the margin might be $3,000 or $4,000 higher. I think the more important thing was the leading edge of rates per existing rigs declined pretty dramatically and then improved pretty substantially. The latter was probably the main factor. These increases were offset by operating costs and we're planning on margins being essentially flat next year, maybe up a modest amount but essentially flat. 
As I previously mentioned, we secured 11 new build contracts during the quarter, bringing the year total to 20 new build contracts and three major FCR modifications with the same economic effect as a new build contract. The market acceptance of our new 1500 horsepower B class rig is, I think, a particularly bright spot. This rig was developed for deeper pad drilling prospects like those usually found in the Bakken and Eagle Ford.
We think the trends in the market are maintainable, but there's pretty great risk. For example, our Haynesville joint venture decided that they really can't economically hedge right now and they can't economically continue six rigs in Haynesville. So they have, even though 95% of their assets, eventually we'll have to drill up there, moving probably up to four rigs of the six they have in Eagle Ford, which is probably what's going on in the industry as a whole. Anyway, right now, I think although there's risk to it, if next year, sustained account level of rig activity which is around 188, that will represent an increase of almost 15 rigs from this year's average. And if that happens, as I've said it's at great risk, but if that happens, even at the same margins, that will be a notable increase in income. 
International. Results in this unit were modestly, and it was $64 million for the quarter compared to $65 million, essentially flat for the prior quarter. But they were substantially below expectations. And I think there were two major factors here. One is that Mexico and Saudi Arabia were industry that everybody knew that were involved in those two places got adversely affected. The problem is, is it's a bigger portion of our portfolio than anybody else's. So specifically, for example, last year versus this year, we're projecting a pretty sizable drop. And of the roughly $125 million operating income drop we're projecting, roughly $100 million of that is in Mexico and Saudi Arabia. And as I've said before, we expected a pickup in Iraq. And the good news is we're getting awards in Iraq and the bad news is the margins don't make us rich really.
So we remain confident, however, that PEMEX will sooner or later, they have to sell their financial problems, but clearly, so far, it's been later rather than sooner. And we are seeing an increase in activity in international, but it's going to be offset by major hits on our jack-ups in that market, renewed at lower comp market prices. I think the bottom line, however, here is I'm now convinced that even though things are not great in third quarter, and they won't be great next year either, I'm pretty much convinced we're at the bottom and that longer term, the pressure of a strong oil price and worldwide infrastructure and the reputation and the quality of the rigs will be pretty significant and favorable. The important thing is I think the bottom is here. 
Nabors Well-Servicing posted quality results of $9 million, a noticeable improvement over the $3-ish million in the second quarter.
The second quarter was largely negatively impacted by gearing up for the growth that we're now seeing with extra labor cost and stuff and things like that. I think we have -- that operation, I think, is heading substantially in the right direction. I think the management has been changed, as you know, and they're doing pretty well. They have a modest improvement in pricing. We have actually a market position increase, and sooner or later, the $80-plus crude is going to impact that favorably. 
Also, this unit will substantially benefit from the Superior acquisition, really the same economies of scale related to real estate consolidations, and we'll probably see more of that as we get into it, and we've also moved Superior's Fluid Management business into Nabors Well-Servicing where, I think, we can effectively, more effectively drive growth and profitability. So as I look forward to sustained improved results in Nabors Well-Servicing. 
Canada. Canada was up a little bit, modestly positive compared to a loss in the preceding quarter, which was typically seasonal in nature. Our new management is performing exceptionally well and the effort for the year is expected to be more than double what we originally forecasted. However, double is a relatively small number doesn't make us rich. We continue to be encouraged by the improving activity in this market, particularly the oil-directed drilling in the traditional areas of Saskatchewan and Alberta. And that also includes the new oil shale cutting. 
In addition, we're having actually significant activity and profitability in our drilling in support of product production. So future drilling in Canada are definitely shifting to heavy doubles in Alberta. And as we frequently mentioned previously, the higher horsepower rigs or pad drilling in the British Columbia shales. Again, I'll repeat that while we traditionally have less than a 10% overall market position, we consistently have a 40% in the Horn River. And to the extent that, that represents the future of the future is pretty good.  
Nabors Offshore. We reported a loss of $1 million in the third quarter, down from a gain in the prior quarter. We expect a similar low, not bad results in the fourth quarter. This unit was pretty obviously adversely impacted by the Gulf of Mexico, by the BP issue. And when you get through all the haze, we think that the impact of BP on our operations was probably on the order of $30-ish million operating expenditure.  So even though we make a positive and decent number, I guess we're now projecting $14 million operating income for the year. That was probably would have been in mid-40s after tax. And next year, we're projecting a come back, but not up to that level. It's pretty hard to project. 
Alaska. Results in Alaska were $14 million for the quarter, up from the prior quarter and some of this was we recognized income that otherwise would have been recognized in the future. It's pretty good, but the facts are that this level of income is not likely to continue in 2011, primarily because of the lack of BP's ability to figure out exactly what they want to do. And obviously, it didn't help when we lost three new builds that BP awarded to competitors a couple of years ago. As a result, we believe that next year's results will be probably 40% of what we delivered this year.
With respect to BP in the last couple of weeks, I spoke probably 45 minutes with the new E&P boss of production under their new set up. This was at an LSU game. And the guy is quite good and he's acutely aware of our performance particularly in the Lower 48. And I guess I spent probably 30 odd minutes with John Minge, who's the CEO of BP Alaska. Net-net I think our future with BP -- first of all, BP is going to make out. They're going to survive and, I think, eventually do reasonably well. I think our position with them is going to be pretty good. Specifically, for example, in Alaska, everybody is certain that the heavy oil is going to be developed someday, somewhat. I think even more immediate than that is kind of the low [indiscernible] oil of which BP is identified at least a couple thousand frac well that's to be drilled. And the issue of negotiating with the state and taxes and quid pro quos, and all that stuff, but eventually, I think it's possible to come back. And frankly, I still think we have the best two tools in Alaska, Rig 19 and CDR 2. And I think we're going to get more profit from those and I think sooner or later, they'll be emulated. 
Superior Well Services, we completed this on September 10. And again, I'll repeat the $12 million reflected in this quarter was a pleasant surprise and represented the last 20 days of the quarter. Let me emphasize that in the short time we've been associated with Superior, we've been very much impressed of quality of equipment, the technical expertise of sales people in the whole organization, the capability of management and perhaps even more important, the super favorable comments we're getting from pretty important knowledgeable customers. Don't let that that go to your head. 
The synergies we expected when we made this acquisition is kind of relatively low-hanging fruit now. And most immediate, these are related to our Well-Servicing business, which has a lot of locations throughout the country as does Superior. The first deal we did on consolidating a location in Eagle Ford was Superior is going to have to pay on a lease for -- we own the thing. So the difference in cost of capital and the availability of capital was making a difference. And I think I do want to emphasize though while I'm prepared to have the $12 million in 20 days be extended and be accountable for it, there are risks in this business. There are rig risks. There are rig count risks. There are frac equipment risks. There are seasonal risks. Typically in the fourth quarter, we will have a seasonal impact that we are not used to.
As we move to Nabors Oil and Gas, as I mentioned last quarter, we have retained good investment bankers to proceed with the sale of our Canadian and Colombian E&P assets. And consequently, because we're pretty much on the way there, we and PwC have classified these -- reclassified them as discontinued operations. The marketing process has been going on for several weeks, and I'd say we're on schedule to date. We have more expect -- expressions of interest than we had anticipated. I think it's virtually certain, but it's highly probable that by the next report we'll have something really firm on at least one of these two things. And our expectations in pricing haven't changed. And I think that fact has been reinforced. That we won't know until we get the checks. 
Let me talk briefly about NFR. They're showing a profit, but also part of the profit is because we have -- most of the profit is because we have a good decent hedging program there. We continue to contemplate and prepare an IPO, although it's got   to be perfectly blunt that these prices at yesterday's close, an IPO won't be feasible. It won't be feasible until the gas price gets some better. Clearly, there has to be some way and a lot of that is dependent on how well we do in the oil in Eagle Ford, stuff that we're now working on. 
The results in other operating segments were very good, and that's third-party sales which from Canrig that's very good and good contributions from our Alaskan joint venture companies. The technology developed at Canrig continues to be a significant plus as to whether we make money by declining the technology of the third-parties or enhance the marketability and value of various rigs.
Our financial position is strong. We have a little over $800 million in cash and investment at the end of quarter. This balance reflects, as I mentioned before, essentially the all cash acquisition of Superior, as well as the proceeds for $700 million of senior unsecured notes. In mid-September, we also established for the first time in probably a decade a $700 million revolving credit facility, which allows us to borrow what I find almost unbelievable rates of LIBOR plus 1.50%. That means we can access this market at less than 2%. And I don't see LIBOR changing very much but a bit. So the question will be, can we find good use for money. 
In May 2011, we'll redeem our $1.4 billion remaining face. I don't know what the accounting number is, but we actually owe $1.4 billion and we'll do that relatively easy. I mean, the source of the fund is our cash flow and even with a substantial investment program, combination of cash flow, cash on hand and the proceeds from the sale, even if we sell half of the real estate of the E&P assets by the end of 2011, we won't need to borrow money. We might have to occasionally, seasonally, temporarily use the revolver, and we certainly won't have to issue equity. 
Moving further, the GAAP tax rate to non-GAAP tax rate was probably 13.5%. And we expect that the fourth quarter will be about the same. But we expect the tax rate in 2011 to be 20%, and that's based on the increased income we're expecting from Superior, U.S. income. And I think that our position basically is with the investment we're making in the NOL is certainly not a cash tax payer this year and we probably won't be next year either. 
Bottom line is that I'm very bullish longer term, maybe even after medium term. I'm now convinced, which I wasn't a couple of months ago, that we've reached the bottom in NDIL, and although it's going to be pretty poor this year and pretty poor next year, sooner or later, and in this case I expect a little sooner, maybe beginning at the end of 2011, the high crude price will drive recovery in the international markets and the quality of our rigs, infrastructure and personnel will enable us to fully participate. 
I think the other thing that boosted my confidence is what's going on in the U.S., I think the 23 rigs, 21 new builds and three were major FCR upgrades, which have economic equivalency of a new build, that demonstrates to me that our customers are pretty confident that's they're going to be drilling, and it's even more pleases me that we're getting more than our overall market share in this market. So that's not only good. So those two things, namely that we won't go lower internationally and we're likely to go stronger with Superior domestically to make the outlook look pretty decent. 
And just a final comment, I think the unrecognized value of some of the things that I mentioned hopefully over the next few quarters will demonstrate -- will convert those into bottom line results. And I think when it happens, and I think it will, we'll be happy and our investors will be happy as well. Anyway, that concludes my comments."

As I said, the good news is in Iraq we will be making a little bit of money short-term and hopefully better money long term. And also, Saudi is getting a little better than we had thought initially on land with our rigs being converted to gas drilling. So it's hard to say. But whereas -- and also Mexico is not going to get worse. It's not going to get worse. So when you consider everything that's relevant, including we haven't started with the Papua New Guinea project yet, a whole bunch of things that are signed, sealed but not yet bottom line. You can never be certain, but I am way more certain than I have been recently that we're at the bottom internationally."

So that implies that in 2011, you may be able to do $1.1 billion in revenue.
