Today, we're going to briefly recap 2009 and the progress we made during the year. Significant change at Yahoo!, talk about our financial results in detail, address some of the key topics that interest for Yahoo! and our industry, and outline our strategy and some of our plans for 2010.I recently celebrated my one year anniversary with the company and what a ride it's been. In fact, I might say, I've made it through my first year with the company and it was a wonderful ride. Very bumpy, and frankly, like many other business leaders, I'm very, very glad it's over. But it was also a great opportunity to restructure, reset and position Yahoo! for the next era of growth. I view my first year at Yahoo! at three phases.  First, I took a look at our consumers and the experience we provide them. I realized that we had to invest in the product that users engaged with the most like the Homepage, Mail, Messenger, News, Sports, Finance, Entertainment. We also decided to close down products that didn't drive engagement or proudly represent Yahoo!. In that same thing [ph], I even asked employees to sign their names next to projects they've done and if they can't, then they need to go back and make it right, so that they'll be proud of what they deliver.The second phase, was listen to advertisers. Working to improve our relationships with them and to continue to deliver quality data, insights and innovative ad platforms. With 600 million users on Yahoo! branded sites, we are one of the largest, most valuable and highest-quality audiences on the Internet. And we're constantly coming up with new ways to connect advertisers with the consumers they see.Then came the third phase. I really started to focus on how we generate value. For us, it's a vast amount of data we gather and use to deliver a better, more personal experience for users, and a better, more targeted audience for our advertisers. Just look at our Homepage, for example. Since we began pairing our content optimization technology with editorial expertise, we've seen click-through rates in the today module more than double. And we're making additional improvements to this technology that will make the user experience even more personally relevant. While we have extremely sophisticated technology and brilliant scientists powering these efforts, we've been letting great data about the consumers, data that's very attractive to advertisers, fall to the floor. We're the leader in targeting in insights, but we simply aren't even close to maximizing the value of our massive audience for advertisers.Truth be told, no one has uncovered the Holy Grail of making advertising as relevant as content is 100% of the time. Beyond just offering advertisers a specific bucket, say women age 35 to 45 that have children, we instead need to deliver many more specific attributes to the scale. For example, women aged 35 to 45 with kids under three who's shopping for minivans, and on and on and on and on. If we can do this, we can create a better experience for both the user and the advertiser.Meanwhile, of course, we're also taking steps to improve consumer privacy and transparency online. Last month, we launched our Ad Interest Manager that allows users to select how we serve ads to them on our network. So that was '09. Along the way, we made progress in many areas. We reset the management team and reorganized the company. We launched the new Homepage and a suite of great mobile products and apps. We refreshed Mail, Messenger and some of our other key properties. We introduced new ad products, and upgraded existing platforms to drive improved advertiser ROI. And I'll talk more about that in a minute. And of course, we signed a Search agreement with Microsoft.We did all of these during one of the worst economic climates ever, most of the S&P 500 suffered with declining revenue last year, and that includes many of our largest customers. In that light, Yahoo!'s revenue decline of only 10% is pretty darn good. Compare that with traditional media who are really struggling and we all hold up well. After the fourth quarter, things definitely began to pick up. We beat our overall revenue guidance range and displayed strength sequentially, growing 26% from Q3. In fact, the number of our premium properties, including the Homepage, sold out due to high demand from top brand advertisers.Meanwhile, Search revenue continued to stabilize and then some.  We actually grew all in all Search revenue sequentially in Q4 for the first time since Q3 '08. Overall, things seem to be returning to a more normal state in the Online Ad business. But let me be clear, these results are not just the result of the improving economic climate. These are the direct result of hard work that culminated in Q4 and would continue into this year and beyond. Now, Tim,  Let's take a more in-depth look of our financial performance."

Revenue came in above the top end of our guidance range, as did operating income excluding restructuring and Microsoft-related costs. We saw a strong demand in our core Display and Se",1454,"Okay. Thanks, Carol. We're pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Revenue came in above the top end of our guidance range, as did operating income excluding restructuring and Microsoft-related costs. We saw a strong demand in our core Display and Search marketplaces in 4Q. And we believe that the ad market recovery is underway. Diving right into the detailed results, revenue was $1.732 billion for the quarter. While this was a 4% decrease from 2008, it was up 10% sequentially, which is our best 4Q sequential performance in several years.  As the economy seems to be gaining a firmer footing and ad budgets are recovering, Yahoo! continues to be the place that marketers come for unique high-quality ad placements that are scarce on the Internet.O&O Display was essentially flat year-over-year, which was a big improvement compared to where we were earlier in '09. But the best news was that Display grew an impressive 26% sequentially. 4Q is of course a seasonally strong quarter, but this year's sequential growth was the strongest we've seen since 2006.Drilling into the components of Display revenue, our guaranteed inventory performed very well in the quarter, and continued to increase as a percent of total Display revenue. Demand is strong throughout the quarter, and several of our key placements were sold out. Pricing recovered this quarter after a challenging 2009, with guaranteed pricing for some of our most important properties returning to fourth quarter 2008 levels. The strength we saw on the guaranteed side also improved the performance of our non-guaranteed inventory. Advertisers bid up the price of non-guaranteed placements due to the scarce availability of premium guaranteed buys. Of the major advertiser categories that we track in Display, nine out of 10 grew sequentially. Year-over-year, half were up and half were down. The Retail Consumer Products and Telecom segments grew strongly compared to last year. Autos was about flat and Entertainment and Finance declined year-over-year offsetting the growth in the stronger categories.Turning to Search, there's encouraging news to report as well. Compared to last year, we registered a revenue decline of 15% on query growth of greater than 10% globally in mid-single digits in the U.S. More importantly, on a sequential basis, we grew revenue by 4%, the first time we've done so since the third quarter of 2008.  The primary drivers of fourth quarter performance were improvements to our Matching Algorithms that yielded better than expected positive results, including an 8% sequential increase in global revenue per search. Just last week, we also introduced network distribution, a search platform enhancement that enables advertisers to more precisely tune their keyword bids to maximize ROI. And we believe this will further improve our O&O RPS in 2010.Compared to last quarter, eight of our 10 advertiser categories grew. Year-over-year, Entertainment, Consumer Products, Health and Telecom were the growth leaders for the quarter, while Travel and Finance were relatively weak.Before moving on, let's take a moment to put our Search business in perspective. Search is an important part of Yahoo!,  and growing Search revenue is a key company priority. We're focused on pulling both the volume and modernization levers to improve results. On the volume side, we're using a combination of product enhancements, search-oriented marketing spending and the power of the Yahoo! network as a Search distribution channel to reaccelerate query volume.On monetization, I mentioned the matching technologies we've recently brought into the marketplace that benefited RPS. And that's just the first step of an aggressive roadmap of monetization enhancements we'll execute upon.Returning to the quarterly highlights, the Affiliate business outpaced our overall growth rate in 4Q. And in fact, grew year-over-year. Some of this growth was attributable to favorable currency fluctuations, but we also benefited from signing new partners. Our 4Q signing of DOM in South Korea, which we won back from Google is evidence of our ability to compete for these deals.Transitioning to profitability, GAAP operating income was $119 million. This includes $32 million in cost related to our search agreement with Microsoft, and $40 million in lingering restructuring charges. Without which, we would have been well above the high-end of our guidance range. OCF was $404 million, including $21 million of cash restructuring charges and $32 million of Microsoft-related costs. This is the last time we plan to report OCF. As I mentioned at Investor Day, operating income is our key profitability metric.Operating costs landed within our expected range for fourth quarter, enabling strong flow-through of incremental revenue to the bottom line. We are working hard to maximize the productivity of our spending. And our business also has great operating leverage, which will benefit us during the economic recovery. We exited the quarter with 13,900 employees, which was an increase of about 700 from our 3Q level, including about 250 employees from two acquisitions. About a third of those new hires were in product development, and the balance was in sales and marketing.Turning to the balance sheet, we ended 2009 with $4.5 billion of cash and marketable debt securities. During the fourth quarter, we invested $170 million in CapEx and repurchased $23 million of stock. At the end of the quarter, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was $9.5 billion, or nearly $6.75 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba group's privately held businesses.Looking ahead to 2010, we expect first quarter revenue in the range of $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion. This reflects seasonality on a sequential basis, and 3% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, despite the short-term negative impact of our revenue quality initiatives. It's also noteworthy that a return to top line growth will be our first since the third quarter of 2008.To round out revenue guidance, traffic acquisition costs should be 28% to 29% of GAAP revenue. We also expect 1Q operating income in the range of $90 million to $110 million, including depreciation and amortization of roughly $170 million in stock-based compensation of about $95 million. This guidance excludes advisory and retention costs related to the Microsoft agreement, and any restructuring charges related to our ongoing cost initiatives.Briefly touching on total year 2010, we expect to grow revenue, including both O&O Search and Display. And we plan to expand GAAP margins. For the year, our effective tax rate should be in the 35% to 40% range and our CapEx spending between $600 million and $700 million. As a reminder on the Microsoft deal, we don't expect revenue sharing to begin in 2010, but once the deal closes, we will start to get reimbursements from Microsoft for the cost of running our Algo and Paid Search businesses. For 2011 and 2012, we'll start to share revenue as a Paid Search businesses combined by region. We'll provide further guidance on the revenue sharing, cost reimbursement and timing of the $150 million of payments from Microsoft, as well as the financial statement presentation of all these items, after we begin implementation.Before I turn the call back to Carol, I'd like to reiterate some of our 2010 financial priorities. First, we'll continue to invest for growth. As we proved in 4Q, this business has strong operating leverage. So we need to seize every opportunity to grow the top line. That means investments to accelerate share shift, improvements to our advertising and analytics platforms and continuing investment in our key audience properties. Whether this is via internal development or through M&A activity, we're positioning Yahoo! for its next phase of growth.Second, we will continue to simplify and streamline Yahoo! to drive margin expansion and ROIC that exceeds our cost of capital. As I outlined at Investor Day, our goal is to generate 15% to 20% operating margins and 15 % to 20% ROIC by 2012. As a point of reference, our operating margin for 2009 was 6%, and our ROIC was 5%. The Microsoft deal will improve the economics of our Search business, which will free up resources for investment in other areas of the company. We believe the combination of investments for future growth, more efficient operations and Microsoft-related savings will enable us to significantly improve Yahoo!'s financial performance. We're building an execution machine here. And you'll start to see that emerge even more during 2010.Third and final, we are committed to transparency and consistency. Given some of the complexities of the Microsoft deal, we'll be making extra efforts to help you understand the run rate of the business versus the effects of the various interim steps of the Search transaction. I look forward to reporting back to you on our progress throughout the year. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Carol."

Now I'd like to talk to you about a few things that are top of mind. First up, let's talk about Display Advertising. While many of you didn't believe me, I kept saying that throughout 2009, brand advertising would come back. It always has. De",1632,"Thanks, Tim. Now I'd like to talk to you about a few things that are top of mind. First up, let's talk about Display Advertising. While many of you didn't believe me, I kept saying that throughout 2009, brand advertising would come back. It always has. Demand for our guaranteed display inventory is growing. We're seeing advertisers reach farther into 2010 to book premium Yahoo! sites in advance. So we expect the positive momentum to keep building.We have some of the best, if not the best premium inventory on the Internet. Advertisers are competing for it now that their businesses are getting healthier, and larger budgets are finding their way back into the hands of CMOs. As these market shares look to position new products and brands in the marketplace, they'll need Display Ads to tell their stories. You can't position a brand with keywords.And as a result of better guaranteed sell-through in Q4, the obvious happened. Non-guaranteed demand also shut up during the quarter. Because we made significant improvements the Right Media platform last year, we were able to respond to this increased demand without a hitch. We are now delivering relevant audiences at scale, faster and more accurately than ever before.In addition to Right Media, we've done a tremendous amount of work on all of our ads, products, systems and analytics. For example, we introduced and implemented innovative new format such as Rich Ads in Search, and we've got many more new products planned for this year. We are also working on our relationship with advertisers. This includes making Yahoo! easier to do business with and being a better creative partner, while delivering the insights that helped marketers managed great campaign. And much of what we're working on this year, will allow advertisers to buy specific targeted audience at huge scale. They'll increasingly be able to measure their online advertising with the same kind of consistent, easy-to-use tool they use for off-line media.By the way, we're still ahead of the display game and we intend to keep it that way. Frankly, our competition is television. That's where major advertisers spend most of their money and where we're taking share. As a result, video is becoming increasingly important. It's now an area where we lead in the concept of video snacks. Our TV recap show, Primetime in No Time is one of the most streamed shows on the web. It attracts millions of streams each month, and even hit 12 million streams in one day in November. That's bigger than the TV audience who turned in to the recent season premiere of 24. But we're only getting started. Our recently announced partnership with GroupM and Electus expand our capability in this space. The partnership with Electus, Electus for example, brings heavy-hitting Hollywood firepower to Yahoo! through Ben Silverman, an Emmy and Golden Globe winning producer. He's been behind top shows like The Office, 30 Rock and more. We're excited about this because Ben and his team understand the power of Yahoo!'s audience. We give Electus massive reach but remember, we are not trying to mimic traditional TV format. We are about developing low-cost, high-quality Web content for our users that's created in partnership with advertisers.Another subject we're asked about a lot is Social, usually in the context of Facebook and Twitter. We are happy to say that we're partnering with Facebook to deliver familiar social experiences within the Yahoo! network and to enable simpler, broader sharing of great Yahoo! content as well. We view both Social and Video as features that should not exist in a silo. There are features that should be tightly integrated into all of Yahoo! properties as a way to expand and enhance the user experience.So that's Display, Video and Social. But we also have a very important Search business. And after the Microsoft deal was implemented, it's a business that we believe will become even more powerful and profitable while delivering a more engaging and relevant user experience. Yahoo! Search is also picking up steam. Last quarter, our O&O Search revenue grew 4% versus Q3, the first sequential increase since Q3 '08.Our combination of ad solutions across Search and Display is a great competitive advantage, and Search is an obvious part of our overall success. As Tim said, we did very well on the RPS side last quarter. Our work on monetization will continue, even as we now aggressively tackle Search volume. Search is a top priority for us. We recently hired Shashi Seth, an expert in the Search industry to lead our efforts. Our dedication to improving the Search experience and accelerating volume growth will be very visible. We've already made significant changes to our Search Ad capability to capture more value from queries. In 2009, we built on our dynamic pricing abilities, continue to optimize the way we served Search Ads based on user behavior, enabled advertisers to port Search campaigns from Google and other engines directly into Yahoo!, and rolled out substantially better matching technology. These efforts drove up RPS in Q4, and we have even more on the roadmap this year.We are also focused on consumer engagement and Search volume. For instance, we have a new breaking new shortcut. Search a news item like Haiti and you'll get multiple tabs with results from all over the web and the best of Yahoo! network, including news, photos, video and Twitter feeds. We'll also market Search on and off the Yahoo! network, implementing new toolbar and browser offers and launch other great new features. Using our leading Homepage, Mail and Messenger products, and key media verticals, we can effectively market our Search capabilities to people who are already no and love Yahoo!. But we won't stop there. We've done a great job so far revitalizing the Yahoo! brand with our marketing campaign, and Search will be a key ingredient of the message as we now shift to more product-centric advertising.Mobile is generating a lot of browse right now. So I want to spend a few minutes talking about our strategy. Users clearly expect to have access to the same kind of services they use on the PC but designed for their mobile phones, and they want to interactive with brands they know and trust. Our strategy is to grow and monetize the Yahoo! audience on Mobile. To do this, we're focused on building great experiences that our users love, our Mobile Homepage, Mail, Messenger, Finance, Flickr and Fantasy Sports. Today, people in 187 countries use our Mobile Internet services. And we've been developing these experiences across thousands of handsets, including high-end devices like the iPhone, BlackBerry and soon, Android.Mobile monetization is in the early stages for everyone right now, but it's growing quickly for us. We're having the Mobile advertising discussion with our biggest clients every day. In fact, we've recently signed one of the largest Mobile ad buys ever with a major auto manufacturer.Partners continue to be an important part of our Mobile strategy. We are a trusted partner in this space, and we work with more than 100 OEMs and carriers to help distribute our products. We're looking to partner with the right players and ecosystem, who can help us reach the largest number of engaged users.Moving on, I know another topic of interest is what we're going to buy and what we're going to sell. As you probably heard, we recently signed an agreement to sell Zimbra to VMware. We'll continue to look at other parts of the business, for divestiture, partnerships or outsourcing could generate incremental value and help us improve our focus. But 2010 is not about divestitures for Yahoo!. Sure, there might be a few, but they'll be an ongoing part of our business just like it is for any other company. For us, 2010 is about acquisitions and investments to make Yahoo! even stronger.We think about acquisitions in three buckets. The first is the small to medium acquisitions where we acquire important technology and the people behind it. The second is content-related, where we acquire a company for their audience, content or community. There a lot of niche sites that have highly-engaged users and specialty content that would fit well with our portfolio and our advertiser needs. And third is geographic, where we will make an acquisition to move into or strengthen markets, like our deal with Maktoob. What we don't have is any current plans for big acquisition, peer-to-peer type plays because they seldom create value.Tim and I both know that success in acquisitions isn't much about integration and performance measurement as it is about negotiating deals. Yahoo! hasn't always focused well on post-deal accountability, but you can be sure that we're committed to it now.So what's ahead for us this year? We're done looking inward, we're looking outward at the incredible opportunities ahead and are focused on the following areas: Great experiences for our consumers, including more social, mobile and video features and improved local context; super serving the largest display advertisers with our impressive region frequency, insights and analytics, and of course ROI; continuing to grow our search business with a focus on volume and revenue improvements; moving forward with the search deal with Microsoft; and of course, continuing to drive operational excellence throughout the company to drive margin expansion.So that's where we've been and where we're going. But we're just getting started and we're feeling good heading into 2010. We look forward to telling you more about our progress next quarter and at our next Investor Day, which will be late May. Moving forward, we'll meet each spring to update you on our business. So please save May 26 on your calendar, and we'll get more details to you very soon. With that, I'd like to open up the call to questions. Operator?"

And I think last quarter you talked about $240 million impact $60 million part quarter because of cleanup. Do you still think that you will have that kind of impact? And then the real question for Carol, I think recently, some of the publishers are talking about how they will take back some of their inventory from the ad network. And a couple of years ago, giving that kind of inventories to ad network had a significant pressure on that pricing. So as you think about the display advertising growth next year, obviously, the economic improvement will help. How do you think this pulling inventory away from ad network that some of other publishers are doing will infect the industry?"

We had also previously guided that we go from a 25 in the fourth quarter to 60, I think we will and that's about 35 more of impact for the last installment of these initiatives. I think it's probably a little bit less than that, but probably still in that 30 range from fourth quarter to first quarter. So overall, I'd say because of the backfill, because some of these investment is bearing fruit a little more quickly than we had even hoped, then I'd say the total impact of these initiatives, instead of $240 million, I'd put it at well south of $200 million, maybe even something like $150 million."

So we're actually trying to look at as much as anything as engagement. Frankly what we're really trying to look at is just really great revenue growth because we deliver such good quality insights to our ad partners. We're looking engagement because you guys look in engagement but seriously, it really is about taking these $600 million uniques and the engagement which is already number one on the Internet to time spent, to delivering just great revenue and insights for us and our CMOs. As far as the impact on the ad campaign, it's been out there three months now. It has sort of two real different vectors. The vector in the U.S. is not to grow users, but it's to change attitudes and behavior and to sort of reacquaint them with the Yahoo! brand and position it in places like India and parts of Europe. It's to not only engage but to get known better and to grow. And we've seen both things happen, even though three months is way, way too soon to judge any ad campaign. The other thing I mentioned on the prepared remarks that I'd like to repeat, is the campaign will now be moving to a products focus. Products around promoting search, promoting homepage, promoting Mail, Messenger, that sort of thing. And this will be online media, mostly not TV. The first was just to wake people up about the fact that Yahoo! is interesting and an exciting brand. Change their attitudes about us, and now we roll on into introducing them to our wonderful product set."

Number one, it's a seasonally down quarter in terms of our top line and it's a seasonally up quarter in terms of many of our costs, especially in the benefits and compensation area. You have payroll taxes, you have the way vacation accrual accounting works and the likes. So you'll see, usually a spike up in the cost in the first quarter and then a downdraft on them in compensation for the rest of the year, excluding obviously the impact of any headcount hires. So it's really the mix of those two different things. We certainly, we've excluded any transition costs related to Microsoft, any restructuring charges and there's nothing else that kind of missed the fork and went into the first. I think overall if you look at our cost structure, the normalized basis fourth quarter was about $800 million and for just that short-term piece of OpEx, what we use to call cash cost. In this quarter, it's maybe a little bit less than $800 million. So were taken an awful lot down in order to just make room for the benefits and the payroll taxes, et cetera, that will naturally increase in the first quarter. And then we'll continue to improve our cost position. We believe and reinvest in the business to reallocate costs of more growth areas as we go through the year and beyond. So that's kind of how I'd look at that guidance."

Today, we're going to briefly recap 2009 and the progress we made during the year. Significant change at Yahoo!, talk about our financial results in detail, address some of the key topics that interest for Yahoo! and our industry, and outline our strategy and some of our plans for 2010.I recently celebrated my one year anniversary with the company and what a ride it's been. In fact, I might say, I've made it through my first year with the company and it was a wonderful ride. Very bumpy, and frankly, like many other business leaders, I'm very, very glad it's over. But it was also a great opportunity to restructure, reset and position Yahoo! for the next era of growth. I view my first year at Yahoo! at three phases.  First, I took a look at our consumers and the experience we provide them. I realized that we had to invest in the product that users engaged with the most like the Homepage, Mail, Messenger, News, Sports, Finance, Entertainment. We also decided to close down products that didn't drive engagement or proudly represent Yahoo!. In that same thing [ph], I even asked employees to sign their names next to projects they've done and if they can't, then they need to go back and make it right, so that they'll be proud of what they deliver.The second phase, was listen to advertisers. Working to improve our relationships with them and to continue to deliver quality data, insights and innovative ad platforms. With 600 million users on Yahoo! branded sites, we are one of the largest, most valuable and highest-quality audiences on the Internet. And we're constantly coming up with new ways to connect advertisers with the consumers they see.Then came the third phase. I really started to focus on how we generate value. For us, it's a vast amount of data we gather and use to deliver a better, more personal experience for users, and a better, more targeted audience for our advertisers. Just look at our Homepage, for example. Since we began pairing our content optimization technology with editorial expertise, we've seen click-through rates in the today module more than double. And we're making additional improvements to this technology that will make the user experience even more personally relevant. While we have extremely sophisticated technology and brilliant scientists powering these efforts, we've been letting great data about the consumers, data that's very attractive to advertisers, fall to the floor. We're the leader in targeting in insights, but we simply aren't even close to maximizing the value of our massive audience for advertisers.Truth be told, no one has uncovered the Holy Grail of making advertising as relevant as content is 100% of the time. Beyond just offering advertisers a specific bucket, say women age 35 to 45 that have children, we instead need to deliver many more specific attributes to the scale. For example, women aged 35 to 45 with kids under three who's shopping for minivans, and on and on and on and on. If we can do this, we can create a better experience for both the user and the advertiser.Meanwhile, of course, we're also taking steps to improve consumer privacy and transparency online. Last month, we launched our Ad Interest Manager that allows users to select how we serve ads to them on our network. So that was '09. Along the way, we made progress in many areas. We reset the management team and reorganized the company. We launched the new Homepage and a suite of great mobile products and apps. We refreshed Mail, Messenger and some of our other key properties. We introduced new ad products, and upgraded existing platforms to drive improved advertiser ROI. And I'll talk more about that in a minute. And of course, we signed a Search agreement with Microsoft.We did all of these during one of the worst economic climates ever, most of the S&P 500 suffered with declining revenue last year, and that includes many of our largest customers. In that light, Yahoo!'s revenue decline of only 10% is pretty darn good. Compare that with traditional media who are really struggling and we all hold up well. After the fourth quarter, things definitely began to pick up. We beat our overall revenue guidance range and displayed strength sequentially, growing 26% from Q3. In fact, the number of our premium properties, including the Homepage, sold out due to high demand from top brand advertisers.Meanwhile, Search revenue continued to stabilize and then some.  We actually grew all in all Search revenue sequentially in Q4 for the first time since Q3 '08. Overall, things seem to be returning to a more normal state in the Online Ad business. But let me be clear, these results are not just the result of the improving economic climate. These are the direct result of hard work that culminated in Q4 and would continue into this year and beyond. Now, Tim,  Let's take a more in-depth look of our financial performance."

Thanks, Carol. We're pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Revenue came in above the top end of our guidance range, as did operating income excluding restructuring and Microsoft-related costs. We saw a strong demand in our core Display and Search marketplaces in 4Q. And we believe that the ad market recovery is underway. Diving right into the detailed results, revenue was $1.732 billion for the quarter. While this was a 4% decrease from 2008, it was up 10% sequentially, which is our best 4Q sequential performance in several years.  As the economy seems to be gaining a firmer footing and ad budgets are recovering, Yahoo! continues to be the place that marketers come for unique high-quality ad placements that are scarce on the Internet.O&O Display was essentially flat year-over-year, which was a big improvement compared to where we were earlier in '09. But the best news was that Display grew an impressive 26% sequentially. 4Q is of course a seasonally strong quarter, but this year's sequential growth was the strongest we've seen since 2006.Drilling into the components of Display revenue, our guaranteed inventory performed very well in the quarter, and continued to increase as a percent of total Display revenue. Demand is strong throughout the quarter, and several of our key placements were sold out. Pricing recovered this quarter after a challenging 2009, with guaranteed pricing for some of our most important properties returning to fourth quarter 2008 levels. The strength we saw on the guaranteed side also improved the performance of our non-guaranteed inventory. Advertisers bid up the price of non-guaranteed placements due to the scarce availability of premium guaranteed buys. Of the major advertiser categories that we track in Display, nine out of 10 grew sequentially. Year-over-year, half were up and half were down. The Retail Consumer Products and Telecom segments grew strongly compared to last year. Autos was about flat and Entertainment and Finance declined year-over-year offsetting the growth in the stronger categories.Turning to Search, there's encouraging news to report as well. Compared to last year, we registered a revenue decline of 15% on query growth of greater than 10% globally in mid-single digits in the U.S. More importantly, on a sequential basis, we grew revenue by 4%, the first time we've done so since the third quarter of 2008.  The primary drivers of fourth quarter performance were improvements to our Matching Algorithms that yielded better than expected positive results, including an 8% sequential increase in global revenue per search. Just last week, we also introduced network distribution, a search platform enhancement that enables advertisers to more precisely tune their keyword bids to maximize ROI. And we believe this will further improve our O&O RPS in 2010.Compared to last quarter, eight of our 10 advertiser categories grew. Year-over-year, Entertainment, Consumer Products, Health and Telecom were the growth leaders for the quarter, while Travel and Finance were relatively weak.Before moving on, let's take a moment to put our Search business in perspective. Search is an important part of Yahoo!,  and growing Search revenue is a key company priority. We're focused on pulling both the volume and modernization levers to improve results. On the volume side, we're using a combination of product enhancements, search-oriented marketing spending and the power of the Yahoo! network as a Search distribution channel to reaccelerate query volume.On monetization, I mentioned the matching technologies we've recently brought into the marketplace that benefited RPS. And that's just the first step of an aggressive roadmap of monetization enhancements we'll execute upon.Returning to the quarterly highlights, the Affiliate business outpaced our overall growth rate in 4Q. And in fact, grew year-over-year. Some of this growth was attributable to favorable currency fluctuations, but we also benefited from signing new partners. Our 4Q signing of DOM in South Korea, which we won back from Google is evidence of our ability to compete for these deals.Transitioning to profitability, GAAP operating income was $119 million. This includes $32 million in cost related to our search agreement with Microsoft, and $40 million in lingering restructuring charges. Without which, we would have been well above the high-end of our guidance range. OCF was $404 million, including $21 million of cash restructuring charges and $32 million of Microsoft-related costs. This is the last time we plan to report OCF. As I mentioned at Investor Day, operating income is our key profitability metric.Operating costs landed within our expected range for fourth quarter, enabling strong flow-through of incremental revenue to the bottom line. We are working hard to maximize the productivity of our spending. And our business also has great operating leverage, which will benefit us during the economic recovery. We exited the quarter with 13,900 employees, which was an increase of about 700 from our 3Q level, including about 250 employees from two acquisitions. About a third of those new hires were in product development, and the balance was in sales and marketing.Turning to the balance sheet, we ended 2009 with $4.5 billion of cash and marketable debt securities. During the fourth quarter, we invested $170 million in CapEx and repurchased $23 million of stock. At the end of the quarter, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was $9.5 billion, or nearly $6.75 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba group's privately held businesses.Looking ahead to 2010, we expect first quarter revenue in the range of $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion. This reflects seasonality on a sequential basis, and 3% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, despite the short-term negative impact of our revenue quality initiatives. It's also noteworthy that a return to top line growth will be our first since the third quarter of 2008.To round out revenue guidance, traffic acquisition costs should be 28% to 29% of GAAP revenue. We also expect 1Q operating income in the range of $90 million to $110 million, including depreciation and amortization of roughly $170 million in stock-based compensation of about $95 million. This guidance excludes advisory and retention costs related to the Microsoft agreement, and any restructuring charges related to our ongoing cost initiatives.Briefly touching on total year 2010, we expect to grow revenue, including both O&O Search and Display. And we plan to expand GAAP margins. For the year, our effective tax rate should be in the 35% to 40% range and our CapEx spending between $600 million and $700 million. As a reminder on the Microsoft deal, we don't expect revenue sharing to begin in 2010, but once the deal closes, we will start to get reimbursements from Microsoft for the cost of running our Algo and Paid Search businesses. For 2011 and 2012, we'll start to share revenue as a Paid Search businesses combined by region. We'll provide further guidance on the revenue sharing, cost reimbursement and timing of the $150 million of payments from Microsoft, as well as the financial statement presentation of all these items, after we begin implementation.Before I turn the call back to Carol, I'd like to reiterate some of our 2010 financial priorities. First, we'll continue to invest for growth. As we proved in 4Q, this business has strong operating leverage. So we need to seize every opportunity to grow the top line. That means investments to accelerate share shift, improvements to our advertising and analytics platforms and continuing investment in our key audience properties. Whether this is via internal development or through M&A activity, we're positioning Yahoo! for its next phase of growth.Second, we will continue to simplify and streamline Yahoo! to drive margin expansion and ROIC that exceeds our cost of capital. As I outlined at Investor Day, our goal is to generate 15% to 20% operating margins and 15 % to 20% ROIC by 2012. As a point of reference, our operating margin for 2009 was 6%, and our ROIC was 5%. The Microsoft deal will improve the economics of our Search business, which will free up resources for investment in other areas of the company. We believe the combination of investments for future growth, more efficient operations and Microsoft-related savings will enable us to significantly improve Yahoo!'s financial performance. We're building an execution machine here. And you'll start to see that emerge even more during 2010.Third and final, we are committed to transparency and consistency. Given some of the complexities of the Microsoft deal, we'll be making extra efforts to help you understand the run rate of the business versus the effects of the various interim steps of the Search transaction. I look forward to reporting back to you on our progress throughout the year. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Carol."

Now I'd like to talk to you about a few things that are top of mind. First up, let's talk about Display Advertising. While many of you didn't believe me, I kept saying that throughout 2009, brand advertising would come back. It always has. De",1632,"Thanks, Tim. Now I'd like to talk to you about a few things that are top of mind. First up, let's talk about Display Advertising. While many of you didn't believe me, I kept saying that throughout 2009, brand advertising would come back. It always has. Demand for our guaranteed display inventory is growing. We're seeing advertisers reach farther into 2010 to book premium Yahoo! sites in advance. So we expect the positive momentum to keep building.We have some of the best, if not the best premium inventory on the Internet. Advertisers are competing for it now that their businesses are getting healthier, and larger budgets are finding their way back into the hands of CMOs. As these market shares look to position new products and brands in the marketplace, they'll need Display Ads to tell their stories. You can't position a brand with keywords.And as a result of better guaranteed sell-through in Q4, the obvious happened. Non-guaranteed demand also shut up during the quarter. Because we made significant improvements the Right Media platform last year, we were able to respond to this increased demand without a hitch. We are now delivering relevant audiences at scale, faster and more accurately than ever before.In addition to Right Media, we've done a tremendous amount of work on all of our ads, products, systems and analytics. For example, we introduced and implemented innovative new format such as Rich Ads in Search, and we've got many more new products planned for this year. We are also working on our relationship with advertisers. This includes making Yahoo! easier to do business with and being a better creative partner, while delivering the insights that helped marketers managed great campaign. And much of what we're working on this year, will allow advertisers to buy specific targeted audience at huge scale. They'll increasingly be able to measure their online advertising with the same kind of consistent, easy-to-use tool they use for off-line media.By the way, we're still ahead of the display game and we intend to keep it that way. Frankly, our competition is television. That's where major advertisers spend most of their money and where we're taking share. As a result, video is becoming increasingly important. It's now an area where we lead in the concept of video snacks. Our TV recap show, Primetime in No Time is one of the most streamed shows on the web. It attracts millions of streams each month, and even hit 12 million streams in one day in November. That's bigger than the TV audience who turned in to the recent season premiere of 24. But we're only getting started. Our recently announced partnership with GroupM and Electus expand our capability in this space. The partnership with Electus, Electus for example, brings heavy-hitting Hollywood firepower to Yahoo! through Ben Silverman, an Emmy and Golden Globe winning producer. He's been behind top shows like The Office, 30 Rock and more. We're excited about this because Ben and his team understand the power of Yahoo!'s audience. We give Electus massive reach but remember, we are not trying to mimic traditional TV format. We are about developing low-cost, high-quality Web content for our users that's created in partnership with advertisers.Another subject we're asked about a lot is Social, usually in the context of Facebook and Twitter. We are happy to say that we're partnering with Facebook to deliver familiar social experiences within the Yahoo! network and to enable simpler, broader sharing of great Yahoo! content as well. We view both Social and Video as features that should not exist in a silo. There are features that should be tightly integrated into all of Yahoo! properties as a way to expand and enhance the user experience.So that's Display, Video and Social. But we also have a very important Search business. And after the Microsoft deal was implemented, it's a business that we believe will become even more powerful and profitable while delivering a more engaging and relevant user experience. Yahoo! Search is also picking up steam. Last quarter, our O&O Search revenue grew 4% versus Q3, the first sequential increase since Q3 '08.Our combination of ad solutions across Search and Display is a great competitive advantage, and Search is an obvious part of our overall success. As Tim said, we did very well on the RPS side last quarter. Our work on monetization will continue, even as we now aggressively tackle Search volume. Search is a top priority for us. We recently hired Shashi Seth, an expert in the Search industry to lead our efforts. Our dedication to improving the Search experience and accelerating volume growth will be very visible. We've already made significant changes to our Search Ad capability to capture more value from queries. In 2009, we built on our dynamic pricing abilities, continue to optimize the way we served Search Ads based on user behavior, enabled advertisers to port Search campaigns from Google and other engines directly into Yahoo!, and rolled out substantially better matching technology. These efforts drove up RPS in Q4, and we have even more on the roadmap this year.We are also focused on consumer engagement and Search volume. For instance, we have a new breaking new shortcut. Search a news item like Haiti and you'll get multiple tabs with results from all over the web and the best of Yahoo! network, including news, photos, video and Twitter feeds. We'll also market Search on and off the Yahoo! network, implementing new toolbar and browser offers and launch other great new features. Using our leading Homepage, Mail and Messenger products, and key media verticals, we can effectively market our Search capabilities to people who are already no and love Yahoo!. But we won't stop there. We've done a great job so far revitalizing the Yahoo! brand with our marketing campaign, and Search will be a key ingredient of the message as we now shift to more product-centric advertising.Mobile is generating a lot of browse right now. So I want to spend a few minutes talking about our strategy. Users clearly expect to have access to the same kind of services they use on the PC but designed for their mobile phones, and they want to interactive with brands they know and trust. Our strategy is to grow and monetize the Yahoo! audience on Mobile. To do this, we're focused on building great experiences that our users love, our Mobile Homepage, Mail, Messenger, Finance, Flickr and Fantasy Sports. Today, people in 187 countries use our Mobile Internet services. And we've been developing these experiences across thousands of handsets, including high-end devices like the iPhone, BlackBerry and soon, Android.Mobile monetization is in the early stages for everyone right now, but it's growing quickly for us. We're having the Mobile advertising discussion with our biggest clients every day. In fact, we've recently signed one of the largest Mobile ad buys ever with a major auto manufacturer.Partners continue to be an important part of our Mobile strategy. We are a trusted partner in this space, and we work with more than 100 OEMs and carriers to help distribute our products. We're looking to partner with the right players and ecosystem, who can help us reach the largest number of engaged users.Moving on, I know another topic of interest is what we're going to buy and what we're going to sell. As you probably heard, we recently signed an agreement to sell Zimbra to VMware. We'll continue to look at other parts of the business, for divestiture, partnerships or outsourcing could generate incremental value and help us improve our focus. But 2010 is not about divestitures for Yahoo!. Sure, there might be a few, but they'll be an ongoing part of our business just like it is for any other company. For us, 2010 is about acquisitions and investments to make Yahoo! even stronger.We think about acquisitions in three buckets. The first is the small to medium acquisitions where we acquire important technology and the people behind it. The second is content-related, where we acquire a company for their audience, content or community. There a lot of niche sites that have highly-engaged users and specialty content that would fit well with our portfolio and our advertiser needs. And third is geographic, where we will make an acquisition to move into or strengthen markets, like our deal with Maktoob. What we don't have is any current plans for big acquisition, peer-to-peer type plays because they seldom create value.Tim and I both know that success in acquisitions isn't much about integration and performance measurement as it is about negotiating deals. Yahoo! hasn't always focused well on post-deal accountability, but you can be sure that we're committed to it now.So what's ahead for us this year? We're done looking inward, we're looking outward at the incredible opportunities ahead and are focused on the following areas: Great experiences for our consumers, including more social, mobile and video features and improved local context; super serving the largest display advertisers with our impressive region frequency, insights and analytics, and of course ROI; continuing to grow our search business with a focus on volume and revenue improvements; moving forward with the search deal with Microsoft; and of course, continuing to drive operational excellence throughout the company to drive margin expansion.So that's where we've been and where we're going. But we're just getting started and we're feeling good heading into 2010. We look forward to telling you more about our progress next quarter and at our next Investor Day, which will be late May. Moving forward, we'll meet each spring to update you on our business. So please save May 26 on your calendar, and we'll get more details to you very soon. With that, I'd like to open up the call to questions. Operator?"

And I think last quarter you talked about $240 million impact $60 million part quarter because of cleanup. Do you still think that you will have that kind of impact? And then the real question for Carol, I think recently, some of the publishers are talking about how they will take back some of their inventory from the ad network. And a couple of years ago, giving that kind of inventories to ad network had a significant pressure on that pricing. So as you think about the display advertising growth next year, obviously, the economic improvement will help. How do you think this pulling inventory away from ad network that some of other publishers are doing will infect the industry?"

Instead of the 25 I'd say it came in less than half that. The plain truth is we great backfill. You saw it in both our guaranteed and our non-guaranteed side. So I think that work out really well. We had also previously guided that we go from a 25 in the fourth quarter to 60, I think we will and that's about 35 more of impact for the last installment of these initiatives. I think it's probably a little bit less than that, but probably still in that 30 range from fourth quarter to first quarter. So overall, I'd say because of the backfill, because some of these investment is bearing fruit a little more quickly than we had even hoped, then I'd say the total impact of these initiatives, instead of $240 million, I'd put it at well south of $200 million, maybe even something like $150 million."

Frankly what we're really trying to look at is just really great revenue growth because we deliver such good quality insights to our ad partners. We're looking engagement because you guys look in engagement but seriously, it really is about taking these $600 million uniques and the engagement which is already number one on the Internet to time spent, to delivering just great revenue and insights for us and our CMOs. As far as the impact on the ad campaign, it's been out there three months now. It has sort of two real different vectors. The vector in the U.S. is not to grow users, but it's to change attitudes and behavior and to sort of reacquaint them with the Yahoo! brand and position it in places like India and parts of Europe. It's to not only engage but to get known better and to grow. And we've seen both things happen, even though three months is way, way too soon to judge any ad campaign. The other thing I mentioned on the prepared remarks that I'd like to repeat, is the campaign will now be moving to a products focus. Products around promoting search, promoting homepage, promoting Mail, Messenger, that sort of thing. And this will be online media, mostly not TV. The first was just to wake people up about the fact that Yahoo! is interesting and an exciting brand. Change their attitudes about us, and now we roll on into introducing them to our wonderful product set."

Number one, it's a seasonally down quarter in terms of our top line and it's a seasonally up quarter in terms of many of our costs, especially in the benefits and compensation area. You have payroll taxes, you have the way vacation accrual accounting works and the likes. So you'll see, usually a spike up in the cost in the first quarter and then a downdraft on them in compensation for the rest of the year, excluding obviously the impact of any headcount hires. So it's really the mix of those two different things. We certainly, we've excluded any transition costs related to Microsoft, any restructuring charges and there's nothing else that kind of missed the fork and went into the first. I think overall if you look at our cost structure, the normalized basis fourth quarter was about $800 million and for just that short-term piece of OpEx, what we use to call cash cost. In this quarter, it's maybe a little bit less than $800 million. So were taken an awful lot down in order to just make room for the benefits and the payroll taxes, et cetera, that will naturally increase in the first quarter. And then we'll continue to improve our cost position. We believe and reinvest in the business to reallocate costs of more growth areas as we go through the year and beyond. So that's kind of how I'd look at that guidance."

Today, we're going to briefly recap 2009 and the progress we made during the year. Significant change at Yahoo!, talk about our financial results in detail, address some of the key topics that interest for Yahoo! and our industry, and outline our strategy and some of our plans for 2010.I recently celebrated my one year anniversary with the company and what a ride it's been. In fact, I might say, I've made it through my first year with the company and it was a wonderful ride. Very bumpy, and frankly, like many other business leaders, I'm very, very glad it's over. But it was also a great opportunity to restructure, reset and position Yahoo! for the next era of growth. I view my first year at Yahoo! at three phases.  First, I took a look at our consumers and the experience we provide them. I realized that we had to invest in the product that users engaged with the most like the Homepage, Mail, Messenger, News, Sports, Finance, Entertainment. We also decided to close down products that didn't drive engagement or proudly represent Yahoo!. In that same thing [ph], I even asked employees to sign their names next to projects they've done and if they can't, then they need to go back and make it right, so that they'll be proud of what they deliver.The second phase, was listen to advertisers. Working to improve our relationships with them and to continue to deliver quality data, insights and innovative ad platforms. With 600 million users on Yahoo! branded sites, we are one of the largest, most valuable and highest-quality audiences on the Internet. And we're constantly coming up with new ways to connect advertisers with the consumers they see.Then came the third phase. I really started to focus on how we generate value. For us, it's a vast amount of data we gather and use to deliver a better, more personal experience for users, and a better, more targeted audience for our advertisers. Just look at our Homepage, for example. Since we began pairing our content optimization technology with editorial expertise, we've seen click-through rates in the today module more than double. And we're making additional improvements to this technology that will make the user experience even more personally relevant. While we have extremely sophisticated technology and brilliant scientists powering these efforts, we've been letting great data about the consumers, data that's very attractive to advertisers, fall to the floor. We're the leader in targeting in insights, but we simply aren't even close to maximizing the value of our massive audience for advertisers.Truth be told, no one has uncovered the Holy Grail of making advertising as relevant as content is 100% of the time. Beyond just offering advertisers a specific bucket, say women age 35 to 45 that have children, we instead need to deliver many more specific attributes to the scale. For example, women aged 35 to 45 with kids under three who's shopping for minivans, and on and on and on and on. If we can do this, we can create a better experience for both the user and the advertiser.Meanwhile, of course, we're also taking steps to improve consumer privacy and transparency online. Last month, we launched our Ad Interest Manager that allows users to select how we serve ads to them on our network. So that was '09. Along the way, we made progress in many areas. We reset the management team and reorganized the company. We launched the new Homepage and a suite of great mobile products and apps. We refreshed Mail, Messenger and some of our other key properties. We introduced new ad products, and upgraded existing platforms to drive improved advertiser ROI. And I'll talk more about that in a minute. And of course, we signed a Search agreement with Microsoft.We did all of these during one of the worst economic climates ever, most of the S&P 500 suffered with declining revenue last year, and that includes many of our largest customers. In that light, Yahoo!'s revenue decline of only 10% is pretty darn good. Compare that with traditional media who are really struggling and we all hold up well. After the fourth quarter, things definitely began to pick up. We beat our overall revenue guidance range and displayed strength sequentially, growing 26% from Q3. In fact, the number of our premium properties, including the Homepage, sold out due to high demand from top brand advertisers.Meanwhile, Search revenue continued to stabilize and then some.  We actually grew all in all Search revenue sequentially in Q4 for the first time since Q3 '08. Overall, things seem to be returning to a more normal state in the Online Ad business. But let me be clear, these results are not just the result of the improving economic climate. These are the direct result of hard work that culminated in Q4 and would continue into this year and beyond. Now, Tim,  Let's take a more in-depth look of our financial performance."

Revenue came in above the top end of our guidance range, as did operating income excluding restructuring and Microsoft-related costs. We saw a strong demand in our core Display and Se",1453,"Okay. Thanks, Carol. We're pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Revenue came in above the top end of our guidance range, as did operating income excluding restructuring and Microsoft-related costs. We saw a strong demand in our core Display and Search marketplaces in 4Q. And we believe that the ad market recovery is underway. Diving right into the detailed results, revenue was $1.732 billion for the quarter. While this was a 4% decrease from 2008, it was up 10% sequentially, which is our best 4Q sequential performance in several years.  As the economy seems to be gaining a firmer footing and ad budgets are recovering, Yahoo! continues to be the place that marketers come for unique high-quality ad placements that are scarce on the Internet.O&O Display was essentially flat year-over-year, which was a big improvement compared to where we were earlier in '09. But the best news was that Display grew an impressive 26% sequentially. 4Q is of course a seasonally strong quarter, but this year's sequential growth was the strongest we've seen since 2006.Drilling into the components of Display revenue, our guaranteed inventory performed very well in the quarter and continued to increase as a percent of total Display revenue. Demand was strong throughout the quarter and several of our key placements were sold out. Pricing recovered this quarter after a challenging 2009 with guaranteed pricing for some of our most important properties returning to fourth quarter 2008 levels. The strength we saw on the guaranteed side also improved the performance of our non-guaranteed inventory. Advertisers bid up the price of non-guaranteed placements due to the scarce availability of premium guaranteed buys. Of the major advertiser categories that we track in Display, nine out of 10 grew sequentially. Year-over-year, half were up and half were down. The Retail Consumer Products and Telecom segments grew strongly compared to last year. Autos was about flat and Entertainment and Finance declined year-over-year offsetting the growth in the stronger categories.Turning to Search, there's encouraging news to report as well. Compared to last year, we registered a revenue decline of 15% on query growth of greater than 10% globally in mid-single digits in the U.S. More importantly, on a sequential basis, we grew revenue by 4% the first time we've done so since the third quarter of 2008.  The primary drivers of fourth quarter performance were improvements to our Matching Algorithms that yielded better than expected positive results, including an 8% sequential increase in global revenue per search. Just last week, we also introduced network distribution, a search platform enhancement that enables advertisers to more precisely tune their keyword bids to maximize ROI and we believe this will further improve our O&O RPS in 2010. Compared to last quarter, eight of our 10 advertiser categories grew. Year-over-year, Entertainment, Consumer Products, Health and Telecom were the growth leaders for the quarter while Travel and Finance were relatively weak.Before moving on, let's take a moment to put our Search business in perspective. Search is an important part of Yahoo!  and growing Search revenue is a key company priority. We're focused on pulling both the volume and monetization levers to improve results. On the volume side, we're using a combination of product enhancements, search-oriented marketing spending and the power of the Yahoo! network as a Search distribution channel to reaccelerate query volume. On monetization, I mentioned the matching technologies we've recently brought into the marketplace that benefited RPS. And that's just the first step of an aggressive roadmap of monetization enhancements we'll execute upon.Returning to the quarterly highlights, the Affiliate business outpaced our overall growth rate in 4Q and in fact grew year-over-year. Some of this growth was attributable to favorable currency fluctuations, but we also benefited from signing new partners. Our 4Q signing of DOM in South Korea, which we won back from Google is evidence of our ability to compete for these deals.Transitioning to profitability, GAAP operating income was $119 million. This includes $32 million in cost related to our search agreement with Microsoft and $40 million in lingering restructuring charges without which we would have been well above the high end of our guidance range. OCF was $404 million including $21 million of cash restructuring charges and $32 million of Microsoft-related costs. This is the last time we plan to report OCF. As I mentioned at Investor Day, operating income is our key profitability metric.Operating costs landed within our expected range for fourth quarter enabling strong flow-through of incremental revenue to the bottom line. We are working hard to maximize the productivity of our spending and our business also has great operating leverage which will benefit us during the economic recovery. We exited the quarter with 13,900 employees which was an increase of about 700 from our 3Q level, including about 250 employees from two acquisitions. About a third of those new hires were in product development and the balance was in sales and marketing.Turning to the balance sheet, we ended 2009 with $4.5 billion of cash and marketable debt securities. During the fourth quarter, we invested $170 million in CapEx and repurchased $23 million of stock. At the end of the quarter, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was $9.5 billion, or nearly $6.75 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group's privately held businesses.Looking ahead to 2010, we expect first quarter revenue in the range of $1,575,000,000 to $1,675,000,000. This reflects seasonality on a sequential basis and 3% year-over-year growth at the midpoint despite the short-term negative impact of our revenue quality initiatives. It's also noteworthy that a return to top line growth will be our first since the third quarter of 2008.To round out revenue guidance, traffic acquisition costs should be 28% to 29% of GAAP revenue. We also expect 1Q operating income in the range of $90 million to $110 million, including depreciation and amortization of roughly $170 million and stock-based compensation of about $95 million. This guidance excludes advisory and retention costs related to the Microsoft agreement and any restructuring charges related to our ongoing cost initiatives.Briefly touching on total year 2010, we expect to grow revenue including both O&O Search and Display. And we plan to expand GAAP margins. For the year, our effective tax rate should be in the 35% to 40% range and our CapEx spending between $600 million and $700 million. As a reminder on the Microsoft deal, we don't expect revenue sharing to begin in 2010, but once the deal closes we'll start to get reimbursements from Microsoft for the cost of running our Algo and Paid Search businesses. For 2011 and 2012, we'll start to share revenue as the Paid Search businesses combined by region. We'll provide further guidance on the revenue sharing, cost reimbursement and timing of the $150 million of payments from Microsoft as well as the financial statement presentation of all these items after we begin implementation.Before I turn the call back to Carol, I'd like to reiterate some of our 2010 financial priorities. First, we'll continue to invest for growth. As we proved in 4Q, this business has strong operating leverage. So we need to seize every opportunity to grow the top line. That means investments to accelerate share shift, improvements to our advertising and analytics platforms and continuing investment in our key audience properties. Whether this is via internal development or through M&A activity, we're positioning Yahoo! for its next phase of growth.Second, we will continue to simplify and streamline Yahoo! to drive margin expansion and ROIC that exceeds our cost of capital. As I outlined at Investor Day, our goal was to generate 15% to 20% operating margins and 15 % to 20% ROIC by 2012. As a point of reference, our operating margin for 2009 was 6% and our ROIC was 5%. The Microsoft deal will improve the economics of our Search business, which will free up resources for investment in other areas of the company. We believe the combination of investments for future growth, more efficient operations and Microsoft-related savings will enable us to significantly improve Yahoo!'s financial performance. We're building an execution machine here and you'll start to see that emerge even more during 2010.Third and final, we're committed to transparency and consistency. Given some of the complexities of the Microsoft deal, we'll be making extra efforts to help you understand the run rate of the business versus the effects of the various interim steps of the Search transaction. I look forward to reporting back to you on our progress throughout the year. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Carol."

Now I'd like to talk to you about a few things that are top of mind. First up, let's talk about Display Advertising. While many of you didn't believe me, I kept saying throughout 2009 that brand advertising would come back. It always has. Dem",1632,"Thanks, Tim. Now I'd like to talk to you about a few things that are top of mind. First up, let's talk about Display Advertising. While many of you didn't believe me, I kept saying throughout 2009 that brand advertising would come back. It always has. Demand for our guaranteed display inventory is growing. We're seeing advertisers reach farther into 2010 to book premium Yahoo! sites and events so we expect the positive momentum to keep building.We have some of the best, if not the best premium inventory on the Internet. Advertisers are competing for it now that their businesses are getting healthier and larger budgets are finding their way back into the hands of CMOs. As these market shares look to position new products and brands in the marketplace, they'll need Display Ads to tell their stories. You can't position a brand with keywords.And as a result of better guaranteed sell-through in Q4, the obvious happened. Non-guaranteed demand also shut up during the quarter. Because we made significant improvements the Right Media platform last year, we were able to respond to this increased demand without a hitch. We are now delivering relevant audiences at scale, faster and more accurately than ever before.In addition to Right Media, we've done a tremendous amount of work on all of our ads, products, systems and analytics. For example, we introduced and implemented innovative new format such as Rich Ads in Search, and we've got many more new products planned for this year. We are also working on our relationship with advertisers. This includes making Yahoo! easier to do business with and being a better creative partner, while delivering the insights that helped marketers managed great campaign. And much of what we're working on this year, will allow advertisers to buy specific targeted audience at huge scale. They'll increasingly be able to measure their online advertising with the same kind of consistent, easy-to-use tool they use for off-line media.By the way, we're still ahead of the display game and we intend to keep it that way. Frankly, our competition is television. That's where major advertisers spend most of their money and where we're taking share. As a result, video is becoming increasingly important. It's now an area where we lead in the concept of video snacks. Our TV recap show, Primetime in No Time is one of the most streamed shows on the web. It attracts millions of streams each month, and even hit 12 million streams in one day in November. That's bigger than the TV audience who turned in to the recent season premiere of 24. But we're only getting started. Our recently announced partnership with GroupM and Electus expand our capability in this space. The partnership with Electus, Electus for example, brings heavy-hitting Hollywood firepower to Yahoo! through Ben Silverman, an Emmy and Golden Globe winning producer. He's been behind top shows like The Office, 30 Rock and more. We're excited about this because Ben and his team understand the power of Yahoo!'s audience. We give Electus massive reach but remember, we are not trying to mimic traditional TV format. We are about developing low-cost, high-quality Web content for our users that's created in partnership with advertisers.Another subject we're asked about a lot is Social, usually in the context of Facebook and Twitter. We are happy to say that we're partnering with Facebook to deliver familiar social experiences within the Yahoo! network and to enable simpler, broader sharing of great Yahoo! content as well. We view both Social and Video as features that should not exist in a silo. There are features that should be tightly integrated into all of Yahoo! properties as a way to expand and enhance the user experience.So that's Display, Video and Social. But we also have a very important Search business. And after the Microsoft deal was implemented, it's a business that we believe will become even more powerful and profitable while delivering a more engaging and relevant user experience. Yahoo! Search is also picking up steam. Last quarter, our O&O Search revenue grew 4% versus Q3, the first sequential increase since Q3 '08.Our combination of ad solutions across Search and Display is a great competitive advantage, and Search is an obvious part of our overall success. As Tim said, we did very well on the RPS side last quarter. Our work on monetization will continue, even as we now aggressively tackle Search volume. Search is a top priority for us. We recently hired Shashi Seth, an expert in the Search industry to lead our efforts. Our dedication to improving the Search experience and accelerating volume growth will be very visible. We've already made significant changes to our Search Ad capability to capture more value from queries. In 2009, we built on our dynamic pricing abilities, continue to optimize the way we served Search Ads based on user behavior, enabled advertisers to port Search campaigns from Google and other engines directly into Yahoo!, and rolled out substantially better matching technology. These efforts drove up RPS in Q4, and we have even more on the roadmap this year.We are also focused on consumer engagement and Search volume. For instance, we have a new breaking new shortcut. Search a news item like Haiti and you'll get multiple tabs with results from all over the web and the best of Yahoo! network, including news, photos, video and Twitter feeds. We'll also market Search on and off the Yahoo! network, implementing new toolbar and browser offers and launch other great new features. Using our leading Homepage, Mail and Messenger products, and key media verticals, we can effectively market our Search capabilities to people who are already no and love Yahoo!. But we won't stop there. We've done a great job so far revitalizing the Yahoo! brand with our marketing campaign, and Search will be a key ingredient of the message as we now shift to more product-centric advertising.Mobile is generating a lot of browse right now. So I want to spend a few minutes talking about our strategy. Users clearly expect to have access to the same kind of services they use on the PC but designed for their mobile phones, and they want to interactive with brands they know and trust. Our strategy is to grow and monetize the Yahoo! audience on Mobile. To do this, we're focused on building great experiences that our users love, our Mobile Homepage, Mail, Messenger, Finance, Flickr and Fantasy Sports. Today, people in 187 countries use our Mobile Internet services. And we've been developing these experiences across thousands of handsets, including high-end devices like the iPhone, BlackBerry and soon, Android.Mobile monetization is in the early stages for everyone right now, but it's growing quickly for us. We're having the Mobile advertising discussion with our biggest clients every day. In fact, we've recently signed one of the largest Mobile ad buys ever with a major auto manufacturer.Partners continue to be an important part of our Mobile strategy. We are a trusted partner in this space, and we work with more than 100 OEMs and carriers to help distribute our products. We're looking to partner with the right players and ecosystem, who can help us reach the largest number of engaged users.Moving on, I know another topic of interest is what we're going to buy and what we're going to sell. As you probably heard, we recently signed an agreement to sell Zimbra to VMware. We'll continue to look at other parts of the business, for divestiture, partnerships or outsourcing could generate incremental value and help us improve our focus. But 2010 is not about divestitures for Yahoo!. Sure, there might be a few, but they'll be an ongoing part of our business just like it is for any other company. For us, 2010 is about acquisitions and investments to make Yahoo! even stronger.We think about acquisitions in three buckets. The first is the small to medium acquisitions where we acquire important technology and the people behind it. The second is content-related, where we acquire a company for their audience, content or community. There a lot of niche sites that have highly-engaged users and specialty content that would fit well with our portfolio and our advertiser needs. And third is geographic, where we will make an acquisition to move into or strengthen markets, like our deal with Maktoob. What we don't have is any current plans for big acquisition, peer-to-peer type plays because they seldom create value.Tim and I both know that success in acquisitions isn't much about integration and performance measurement as it is about negotiating deals. Yahoo! hasn't always focused well on post-deal accountability, but you can be sure that we're committed to it now.So what's ahead for us this year? We're done looking inward, we're looking outward at the incredible opportunities ahead and are focused on the following areas: Great experiences for our consumers, including more social, mobile and video features and improved local context; super serving the largest display advertisers with our impressive region frequency, insights and analytics, and of course ROI; continuing to grow our search business with a focus on volume and revenue improvements; moving forward with the search deal with Microsoft; and of course, continuing to drive operational excellence throughout the company to drive margin expansion.So that's where we've been and where we're going. But we're just getting started and we're feeling good heading into 2010. We look forward to telling you more about our progress next quarter and at our next Investor Day, which will be late May. Moving forward, we'll meet each spring to update you on our business. So please save May 26 on your calendar, and we'll get more details to you very soon. With that, I'd like to open up the call to questions. Operator?"

And I think last quarter you talked about $240 million impact $60 million part quarter because of cleanup. Do you still think that you will have that kind of impact? And then the real question for Carol, I think recently, some of the publishers are talking about how they will take back some of their inventory from the ad network. And a couple of years ago, giving that kind of inventories to ad network had a significant pressure on that pricing. So as you think about the display advertising growth next year, obviously, the economic improvement will help. How do you think this pulling inventory away from ad network that some of other publishers are doing will infect the industry?"

We had also previously guided that we go from a 25 in the fourth quarter to 60, I think we will and that's about 35 more of impact for the last installment of these initiatives. I think it's probably a little bit less than that, but probably still in that 30 range from fourth quarter to first quarter. So overall, I'd say because of the backfill, because some of these investment is bearing fruit a little more quickly than we had even hoped, then I'd say the total impact of these initiatives, instead of $240 million, I'd put it at well south of $200 million, maybe even something like $150 million."

The vector in the U.S. is not to grow users, but it's to change attitudes and behavior and to sort of reacquaint them with the Yahoo! brand and position it in places like India and parts of Europe. It's to not only engage but to get known better and to grow. And we've seen both things happen, even though three months is way, way too soon to judge any ad campaign. The other thing I mentioned on the prepared remarks that I'd like to repeat, is the campaign will now be moving to a products focus. Products around promoting search, promoting homepage, promoting Mail, Messenger, that sort of thing. And this will be online media, mostly not TV. The first was just to wake people up about the fact that Yahoo! is interesting and an exciting brand. Change their attitudes about us, and now we roll on into introducing them to our wonderful product set."

If you look at our search volume, we grew it over 10% globally year-over-year for fourth quarter. We think that's pretty good, but clearly we want to do better and better and better.

Number one, it's a seasonally down quarter in terms of our top line and it's a seasonally up quarter in terms of many of our costs, especially in the benefits and compensation area. You have payroll taxes, you have the way vacation accrual accounting works and the likes. So you'll see, usually a spike up in the cost in the first quarter and then a downdraft on them in compensation for the rest of the year, excluding obviously the impact of any headcount hires. So it's really the mix of those two different things. We certainly, we've excluded any transition costs related to Microsoft, any restructuring charges and there's nothing else that kind of missed the fourth and went into the first. I think overall if you look at our cost structure on a normalized basis fourth quarter was about $800 million and for just that short-term piece of OpEx, what we used to call cash costs and this quarter, it's maybe a little bit less than $800 million. So were taking an awful lot down in order to just make room for the benefits and the payroll taxes, et cetera, that will naturally increase in the first quarter. And then we'll continue to improve our cost position, we believe and reinvest in the business to reallocate costs of more growth areas as we go through the year and beyond. So that's kind of how I'd look at that guidance."

Engagement with lifestyles, gossip, all of that is really high. We've got less engagements, for instance, right now in science because last year they were hanging on the finance pages every second trying to figure out what was melting down.

Today, we're going to briefly recap 2009 and the progress we made during the year. Significant change at Yahoo!, talk about our financial results in detail, address some of the key topics that interest for Yahoo! and our industry, and outline our strategy and some of our plans for 2010.I recently celebrated my one year anniversary with the company and what a ride it's been. In fact, I might say, I've made it through my first year with the company and it was a wonderful ride. Very bumpy, and frankly, like many other business leaders, I'm very, very glad it's over. But it was also a great opportunity to restructure, reset and position Yahoo! for the next era of growth. I view my first year at Yahoo! at three phases.  First, I took a look at our consumers and the experience we provide them. I realized that we had to invest in the products that users engaged with the most like the Homepage, Mail, Messenger, News, Sports, Finance, Entertainment. We also decided to close down products that didn't drive engagement or proudly represent Yahoo!. In that same thing, I even asked employees to sign their names next to projects they've done and if they can't, then they need to go back and make it right, so that they'll be proud of what they deliver.The second phase, was listen to advertisers. Working to improve our relationships with them and to continue to deliver quality data, insights and innovative ad platforms. With 600 million users on Yahoo! branded sites, we are one of the largest, most valuable and highest-quality audiences on the Internet. And we're constantly coming up with new ways to connect advertisers with the consumers they see.Then came the third phase. I really started to focus on how we generate value. For us, it's a vast amount of data we gather and use to deliver a better, more personal experience for users, and a better, more targeted audience for our advertisers. Just look at our Homepage, for example. Since we began pairing our content optimization technology with editorial expertise, we've seen click-through rates in the today module more than double. And we're making additional improvements to this technology that will make the user experience even more personally relevant. While we have extremely sophisticated technology and brilliant scientists powering these efforts, we've been letting great data about the consumers, data that's very attractive to advertisers, fall to the floor. We're the leader in targeting in insights, but we simply aren't even close to maximizing the value of our massive audience for advertisers.Truth be told, no one has uncovered the Holy Grail of making advertising as relevant as content is 100% of the time. Beyond just offering advertisers a specific bucket, say women age 35 to 45 that have children, we instead need to deliver many more specific attributes to the scale. For example, women aged 35 to 45 with kids under three who's shopping for minivans, and on and on and on and on. If we can do this, we can create a better experience for both the user and the advertiser.Meanwhile, of course, we're also taking steps to improve consumer privacy and transparency online. Last month, we launched our Ad Interest Manager that allows users to select how we serve ads to them on our network. So that was '09. Along the way, we made progress in many areas. We reset the management team and reorganized the company. We launched the new Homepage and a suite of great mobile products and apps. We refreshed Mail, Messenger and some of our other key properties. We introduced new ad products, and upgraded existing platforms to drive improved advertiser ROI. And I'll talk more about that in a minute. And of course, we signed a Search agreement with Microsoft.We did all of these during one of the worst economic climates ever, most of the S&P 500 suffered with declining revenue last year, and that includes many of our largest customers. In that light, Yahoo!'s revenue decline of only 10% is pretty darn good. Compare that with traditional media who are really struggling and we all hold up well. After the fourth quarter, things definitely began to pick up. We beat our overall revenue guidance range and displayed strength sequentially, growing 26% from Q3. In fact, the number of our premium properties, including the Homepage, sold out due to high demand from top brand advertisers.Meanwhile, Search revenue continued to stabilize and then some.  We actually grew all in all Search revenue sequentially in Q4 for the first time since Q3 '08. Overall, things seem to be returning to a more normal state in the Online Ad business. But let me be clear, these results are not just the result of the improving economic climate. These are the direct result of hard work that culminated in Q4 and would continue into this year and beyond. Now, Tim,  Let's take a more in-depth look of our financial performance."

Thanks, Carol. We're pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Revenue came in above the top end of our guidance range, as did operating income excluding restructuring and Microsoft-related costs. We saw a strong demand in our core Display and Search marketplaces in 4Q. And we believe that the ad market recovery is underway. Diving right into the detailed results, revenue was $1.732 billion for the quarter. While this was a 4% decrease from 2008, it was up 10% sequentially, which is our best 4Q sequential performance in several years.  As the economy seems to be gaining a firmer footing and ad budgets are recovering, Yahoo! continues to be the place that marketers come for unique high-quality ad placements that are scarce on the Internet.O&O Display was essentially flat year-over-year, which was a big improvement compared to where we were earlier in '09. But the best news was that Display grew an impressive 26% sequentially. 4Q is of course a seasonally strong quarter, but this year's sequential growth was the strongest we've seen since 2006.Drilling into the components of Display revenue, our guaranteed inventory performed very well in the quarter and continued to increase as a percent of total Display revenue. Demand was strong throughout the quarter and several of our key placements were sold out. Pricing recovered this quarter after a challenging 2009 with guaranteed pricing for some of our most important properties returning to fourth quarter 2008 levels. The strength we saw on the guaranteed side also improved the performance of our non-guaranteed inventory. Advertisers bid up the price of non-guaranteed placements due to the scarce availability of premium guaranteed buys. Of the major advertiser categories that we track in Display, nine out of 10 grew sequentially. Year-over-year, half were up and half were down. The Retail Consumer Products and Telecom segments grew strongly compared to last year. Autos was about flat and Entertainment and Finance declined year-over-year offsetting the growth in the stronger categories.Turning to Search, there's encouraging news to report as well. Compared to last year, we registered a revenue decline of 15% on query growth of greater than 10% globally in mid-single digits in the U.S. More importantly, on a sequential basis, we grew revenue by 4% the first time we've done so since the third quarter of 2008.  The primary drivers of fourth quarter performance were improvements to our Matching Algorithms that yielded better than expected positive results, including an 8% sequential increase in global revenue per search. Just last week, we also introduced network distribution, a search platform enhancement that enables advertisers to more precisely tune their keyword bids to maximize ROI and we believe this will further improve our O&O RPS in 2010. Compared to last quarter, eight of our 10 advertiser categories grew. Year-over-year, Entertainment, Consumer Products, Health and Telecom were the growth leaders for the quarter while Travel and Finance were relatively weak.Before moving on, let's take a moment to put our Search business in perspective. Search is an important part of Yahoo!  And growing Search revenue is a key company priority. We're focused on pulling both the volume and monetization levers to improve results. On the volume side, we're using a combination of product enhancements, search-oriented marketing spending and the power of the Yahoo! network as a Search distribution channel to reaccelerate query volume. On monetization, I mentioned the matching technologies we've recently brought into the marketplace that benefited RPS. And that's just the first step of an aggressive road map of monetization enhancements we'll execute upon.Returning to the quarterly highlights, the Affiliate business outpaced our overall growth rate in 4Q and in fact grew year-over-year. Some of this growth was attributable to favorable currency fluctuations, but we also benefited from signing new partners. Our 4Q signing of DOM in South Korea, which we won back from Google is evidence of our ability to compete for these deals.Transitioning to profitability, GAAP operating income was $119 million. This includes $32 million in cost related to our search agreement with Microsoft and $40 million in lingering restructuring charges without which we would have been well above the high end of our guidance range. OCF was $404 million including $21 million of cash restructuring charges and $32 million of Microsoft-related costs. This is the last time we plan to report OCF. As I mentioned at Investor Day, operating income is our key profitability metric.Operating costs landed within our expected range for fourth quarter enabling strong flow-through of incremental revenue to the bottom line. We are working hard to maximize the productivity of our spending and our business also has great operating leverage which will benefit us during the economic recovery. We exited the quarter with 13,900 employees which was an increase of about 700 from our 3Q level, including about 250 employees from two acquisitions. About a third of those new hires were in product development and the balance was in sales and marketing.Turning to the balance sheet, we ended 2009 with $4.5 billion of cash and marketable debt securities. During the fourth quarter, we invested $170 million in CapEx and repurchased $23 million of stock. At the end of the quarter, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was $9.5 billion, or nearly $6.75 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group's privately held businesses.Looking ahead to 2010, we expect first quarter revenue in the range of $1,575,000,000 to $1,675,000,000. This reflects seasonality on a sequential basis and 3% year-over-year growth at the midpoint despite the short-term negative impact of our revenue quality initiatives. It's also noteworthy that a return to top line growth will be our first since the third quarter of 2008.To round out revenue guidance, traffic acquisition costs should be 28% to 29% of GAAP revenue. We also expect 1Q operating income in the range of $90 million to $110 million, including depreciation and amortization of roughly $170 million and stock-based compensation of about $95 million. This guidance excludes advisory and retention costs related to the Microsoft agreement and any restructuring charges related to our ongoing cost initiatives.Briefly touching on total year 2010, we expect to grow revenue including both O&O Search and Display. And we plan to expand GAAP margins. For the year, our effective tax rate should be in the 35% to 40% range and our CapEx spending between $600 million and $700 million. As a reminder on the Microsoft deal, we don't expect revenue sharing to begin in 2010, but once the deal closes we'll start to get reimbursements from Microsoft for the cost of running our Algo and Paid Search businesses. For 2011 and 2012, we'll start to share revenue as the Paid Search businesses combined by region. We'll provide further guidance on the revenue sharing, cost reimbursement and timing of the $150 million of payments from Microsoft as well as the financial statement presentation of all these items after we begin implementation.Before I turn the call back to Carol, I'd like to reiterate some of our 2010 financial priorities. First, we'll continue to invest for growth. As we proved in 4Q, this business has strong operating leverage. So we need to seize every opportunity to grow the top line. That means investments to accelerate share shift, improvements to our advertising and analytics platforms and continuing investment in our key audience properties. Whether this is via internal development or through M&A activity, we're positioning Yahoo! for its next phase of growth.Second, we will continue to simplify and streamline Yahoo! to drive margin expansion and ROIC that exceeds our cost of capital. As I outlined at Investor Day, our goal was to generate 15% to 20% operating margins and 15 % to 20% ROIC by 2012. As a point of reference, our operating margin for 2009 was 6% and our ROIC was 5%. The Microsoft deal will improve the economics of our Search business, which will free up resources for investment in other areas of the company. We believe the combination of investments for future growth, more efficient operations and Microsoft-related savings will enable us to significantly improve Yahoo!'s financial performance. We're building an execution machine here and you'll start to see that emerge even more during 2010.Third and final, we're committed to transparency and consistency. Given some of the complexities of the Microsoft deal, we'll be making extra efforts to help you understand the run rate of the business versus the effects of the various interim steps of the Search transaction. I look forward to reporting back to you on our progress throughout the year. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Carol."
91800,84104251,54616,"Yahoo! Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-26-2010",2010-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Now I'd like to talk to you about a few things that are top of mind. First up, let's talk about Display Advertising. While many of you didn't believe me, I kept saying throughout 2009 that brand advertising would come back. It always has. Dem",1635,"Thanks, Tim. Now I'd like to talk to you about a few things that are top of mind. First up, let's talk about Display Advertising. While many of you didn't believe me, I kept saying throughout 2009 that brand advertising would come back. It always has. Demand for our guaranteed display inventory is growing. We're seeing advertisers reach farther into 2010 to book premium Yahoo! sites and events so we expect the positive momentum to keep building.We have some of the best, if not the best premium inventory on the Internet. Advertisers are competing for it now that their businesses are getting healthier and larger budgets are finding their way back into the hands of CMOs. As these market shares look to position new products and brands in the marketplace, they'll need Display Ads to tell their stories. You can't position a brand with keywords.And as a result of better guaranteed sell-through in Q4, the obvious happened. Non-guaranteed demand also shut up during the quarter. Because we made significant improvements the Right Media platform last year, we were able to respond to this increased demand without a hitch. We are now delivering relevant audiences at scale, faster and more accurately than ever before.In addition to Right Media, we've done a tremendous amount of work on all of our ads, products, systems and analytics. For example, we introduced and implemented innovative new format such as Rich Ads in Search, and we've got many more new products planned for this year. We are also working on our relationship with advertisers. This includes making Yahoo! easier to do business with and being a better creative partner, while delivering the insights that helped marketers managed great campaign. And much of what we're working on this year, will allow advertisers to buy specific targeted audience at huge scale. They'll increasingly be able to measure their online advertising with the same kind of consistent, easy-to-use tool they use for off-line media.By the way, we're still ahead of the display game and we intend to keep it that way. Frankly, our competition is television. That's where major advertisers spend most of their money and where we're taking share. As a result, video is becoming increasingly important. It's now an area where we lead in the concept of video snacks. Our TV recap show, Primetime in No Time is one of the most streamed shows on the web. It attracts millions of streams each month, and even hit 12 million streams in one day in November. That's bigger than the TV audience who turned in to the recent season premiere of 24. But we're only getting started. Our recently announced partnership with GroupM and Electus expand our capability in this space. The partnership with Electus, Electus for example, brings heavy-hitting Hollywood firepower to Yahoo! through Ben Silverman, an Emmy and Golden Globe winning producer. He's been behind top shows like The Office, 30 Rock and more. We're excited about this because Ben and his team understand the power of Yahoo!'s audience. We give Electus massive reach but remember, we are not trying to mimic traditional TV format. We are about developing low-cost, high-quality Web content for our users that's created in partnership with advertisers.Another subject we're asked about a lot is Social, usually in the context of Facebook and Twitter. We are happy to say that we're partnering with Facebook to deliver familiar social experiences within the Yahoo! network and to enable simpler, broader sharing of great Yahoo! content as well. We view both Social and Video as features that should not exist in a silo. There are features that should be tightly integrated into all of Yahoo! properties as a way to expand and enhance the user experience.So that's Display, Video and Social. But we also have a very important Search business. And after the Microsoft deal was implemented, it's a business that we believe will become even more powerful and profitable while delivering a more engaging and relevant user experience. Yahoo! Search is also picking up steam. Last quarter, our O&O Search revenue grew 4% versus Q3, the first sequential increase since Q3 '08.Our combination of ad solutions across Search and Display is a great competitive advantage, and Search is an obvious part of our overall success. As Tim said, we did very well on the RPS side last quarter. Our work on monetization will continue, even as we now aggressively tackle Search volume. Search is a top priority for us. We recently hired Shashi Seth, an expert in the Search industry to lead our efforts. Our dedication to improving the Search experience and accelerating volume growth will be very visible. We've already made significant changes to our Search Ad capability to capture more value from queries. In 2009, we built on our dynamic pricing abilities, continue to optimize the way we served Search Ads based on user behavior, enabled advertisers to port Search campaigns from Google and other engines directly into Yahoo!, and rolled out substantially better matching technology. These efforts drove up RPS in Q4, and we have even more on the road map this year.We are also focused on consumer engagement and Search volume. For instance, we have a new breaking new shortcut. Search a news item like Haiti and you'll get multiple tabs with results from all over the web and the best of Yahoo! network, including news, photos, video and Twitter feeds. We'll also market Search on and off the Yahoo! network, implementing new toolbar and browser offers and launch other great new features. Using our leading Homepage, Mail and Messenger products, and key media verticals, we can effectively market our Search capabilities to people who are already no and love Yahoo!. But we won't stop there. We've done a great job so far revitalizing the Yahoo! brand with our marketing campaign, and Search will be a key ingredient of the message as we now shift to more product-centric advertising.Mobile is generating a lot of browse right now. So I want to spend a few minutes talking about our strategy. Users clearly expect to have access to the same kind of services they use on the PC but designed for their mobile phones, and they want to interactive with brands they know and trust. Our strategy is to grow and monetize the Yahoo! audience on Mobile. To do this, we're focused on building great experiences that our users love, our Mobile Homepage, Mail, Messenger, Finance, Flickr and Fantasy Sports. Today, people in 187 countries use our Mobile Internet services. And we've been developing these experiences across thousands of handsets, including high-end devices like the iPhone, BlackBerry and soon, Android.Mobile monetization is in the early stages for everyone right now, but it's growing quickly for us. We're having the Mobile advertising discussion with our biggest clients every day. In fact, we've recently signed one of the largest Mobile ad buys ever with a major auto manufacturer.Partners continue to be an important part of our Mobile strategy. We are a trusted partner in this space, and we work with more than 100 OEMs and carriers to help distribute our products. We're looking to partner with the right players and ecosystem, who can help us reach the largest number of engaged users.Moving on, I know another topic of interest is what we're going to buy and what we're going to sell. As you probably heard, we recently signed an agreement to sell Zimbra to VMware. We'll continue to look at other parts of the business, for divestiture, partnerships or outsourcing could generate incremental value and help us improve our focus. But 2010 is not about divestitures for Yahoo!. Sure, there might be a few, but they'll be an ongoing part of our business just like it is for any other company. For us, 2010 is about acquisitions and investments to make Yahoo! even stronger.We think about acquisitions in three buckets. The first is the small to medium acquisitions where we acquire important technology and the people behind it. The second is content-related, where we acquire a company for their audience, content or community. There a lot of niche sites that have highly-engaged users and specialty content that would fit well with our portfolio and our advertiser needs. And third is geographic, where we will make an acquisition to move into or strengthen markets, like our deal with Maktoob. What we don't have is any current plans for big acquisition, peer-to-peer type plays because they seldom create value.Tim and I both know that success in acquisitions isn't much about integration and performance measurements as it is about negotiating deals. Yahoo! hasn't always focused well on post-deal accountability, but you can be sure that we're committed to it now.So what's ahead for us this year? We're done looking inward, we're looking outward at the incredible opportunities ahead and are focused on the following areas: Great experiences for our consumers, including a more social, mobile and video features and improved local context; super serving the largest Display advertisers with our impressive region frequency, insights and analytics, and of course, ROI; continuing to grow our Search business with a focus on volume and revenue improvements; moving forward with the Search deal with Microsoft; and of course, continuing to drive operational excellence throughout the company to drive margin expansion.So that's where we've been and where we're going, but we're just getting started and we're feeling good heading into 2010. We look forward to telling you more about our progress next quarter and at our next Investor Day, which will be late May. Moving forward, we'll meet each spring to update you on our business. So please save May 26 on your calendar, and we'll get to more details to you very soon. With that, I'd like to open up the call to questions. Operator?"

And I think the last quarter you've talked about $240 million impact, $60 million per quarter because of cleanup. Do you still think that you will have that kind of impact? And then the real question for Carol, I think, recently, some of the publishers are talking about how they will take back some of their inventory from the ad network. And a couple of years ago, giving that kind of inventories to ad network had a significant pressure on that pricing. So as you think about the Display advertising growth next year, obviously, the economic improvement will help. How do you think this pulling inventory away from ad network that some of other publishers are doing will infect the industry?"

Instead of the $25 million, I'd say it came in less than half that. I mean, the plain truth is we great backfill. You saw it in both our guaranteed and our non-guaranteed side. So I think that work out really well. We had also previously guided that we go from a $25 million in the fourth quarter to $60 million. I think we will and that's about $35 million more of impact for the last installment of these initiatives. I think it's probably a little bit less than that, but probably still in that $30 million range from fourth quarter to first quarter. So overall, I'd say because of the backfill, because some of this investment is bearing fruit a little more quickly than we had even hoped, then I'd say the total impact of these initiatives, instead of $240 million, I'd put it at, well, south of $200 million, maybe even something like $150 million."

We'll look [ph] (34:34) in engagement because you guys look in engagement. But seriously, it really is about taking these $600 million uniques and the engagement, which is already number one on the Internet to time spent, to delivering just great revenue and insights for us and our CMOs. As far as the impact on the ad campaign, it's been out there three months now. It has sort of two real different vectors. The vector in the U.S. is not to grow users, but it's to change attitudes and behavior and to sort of reacquaint them with the Yahoo! brand and position it in places like India and the parts of Europe. It's to not only engage, but to get known better and to grow. And we've seen both things happen, even though three months is way, way too soon to judge any ad campaign. The other thing I mentioned on the prepared remarks, that I'd like to repeat, is the campaign will now be moving to a product focus: Products around promoting Search, promoting Homepage, promoting Mail, Messenger, that sort of thing. And this will be online media, mostly not TV. The first was just to wake people up about the fact that Yahoo! is interesting and an exciting brand, change their attitudes about us, and now we roll on into introducing them to our wonderful product sets."

Number one, it's a seasonally down quarter in terms of our top line and it's a seasonally up quarter in terms of many of our costs, especially in the benefits and compensation area. You have payroll taxes, you have the way vacation accrual accounting works and the likes. So you'll see, usually, a spike up in the costs in the first quarter and then a downdraft on them in compensation for the rest of the year, excluding obviously the impact of any headcount hires. So it's really the mix of those two different things. We certainly, we've excluded any transition costs related to Microsoft, any restructuring charges and there's nothing else that kind of missed the fourth and went into the first. I think overall if you look at our cost structure on a normalized basis fourth quarter was about $800 million and for just that short-term piece of OpEx, what we used to call cash costs and this quarter, it's maybe a little bit less than $800 million. So were taking an awful lot down in order to just make room for the benefits and the payroll taxes, et cetera, that will naturally increase in the first quarter. And then we'll continue to improve our cost position, we believe and reinvest in the business to reallocate costs of more growth areas as we go through the year and beyond. So that's kind of how I'd look at that guidance."

Hello everybody and thanks for joining us this afternoon.

Hello everybody and thanks for joining us this afternoon. Today we’ll talk about the quarter and our financial results in detail, address some topics of interest including the display and search ad markets, the implementation of our search agreement with Microsoft, and an update on reinvestments. And of course, we’re happy to answer your questions.
First let’s talk about Q1. The economy continues to improve. We delivered what I’d call a solid quarter. Revenues stabilized and profits were up. The headline news is that display advertising grew 20% year-over-year ahead of the market. More importantly, guaranteed display grew by 24% as large advertisers came back. That means their purse strings are starting to loosen up. A lot of them have been lying dormant or only doing the minimum. And now as the economy does better they’re re-emerging to aggressively position their brands online. As the market leader in display, we’re well positioned to benefit from this trend.
As for search, we told you last quarter that we really intensified our focus and efforts around search volume. These efforts, such as marketing search on and off the Yahoo! network, new toolbar and browser offers and search integration across our properties have paid off. As a result I’m very pleased to report that we stabilized our search share and believe it will trend up in Q2. 
And of course due to regulatory clearance this quarter, we have more tangible information to share with you on the Microsoft transition. 
One last thing before I turn it over to Tim. On a directional note, we started doing some really forward thinking and creative things on the advertising side. They have our sales team, agencies and advertisers really energized. We’re already seeing some of these initiatives help us engage with advertisers on a whole new level. I’ll talk about this and more, but first Tim will cover the financials. Tim?

Although revenue landed roughly 2% shy of the midpoint of our outlook, this quarter we made important strides across a wide variety of areas impacting both our income statement and balance sheet. Today I’ll review first quarter financial p",1936,"Thanks Carol. Although revenue landed roughly 2% shy of the midpoint of our outlook, this quarter we made important strides across a wide variety of areas impacting both our income statement and balance sheet. Today I’ll review first quarter financial performance in detail, provide our second quarter outlook, and additionally outline our full year expectations for the expense impact of the Microsoft search alliance.
I’ll begin with a summary of our headline metrics, revenue, operating income and earnings per share. These numbers were affected by a couple of large items this quarter; namely, Microsoft reimbursements related to our search alliance and the sale of Zimbra, which I’ll separate out for you. 
GAAP revenue of $1.597 billion grew by 1% year-over-year, the first growth we’ve registered since 3Q ’08. Operating income of $188 million grew by an impressive 87%, aided by two reimbursements from Microsoft, $35 million of search operating expense reimbursement and $43 million in net transition cost reimbursement. Neither of these reimbursements was included in the outlook we provided in January and we believe you should treat these reimbursements as two separate and unique items. 
Let me provide a bit more color there. The $35 million for search operating expenses represents the initial step on the path to the long-term cost savings we anticipate as a result of the alliance. So the favorability is an ongoing piece of our cost structure. The $43 million, on the other hand, relates to reimbursement of transition expenses incurred in 2009. That amount should be treated as non-recurring. Excluding the non-recurring item, operating income was $145 million, up 44% year-over-year with operating margin expansion to 90%. This result is the first tangible financial benefit of the search alliance.
Turning to earnings, the $0.22 per diluted share we reported included $0.07 of unusual items, primarily $0.05 from the sale of Zimbra and $0.02 from the non-recurring transition reimbursement I just discussed. Excluding those items, EPS of $0.15 per diluted share was up 77% year-over-year due to cost structure and tax rate improvements. 
I’ll return to the impact of the search alliance in more detail later, but with that as high level background, let’s start at the top of the P&L and walk through the results in more detail, beginning with our O&O display revenue. O&O display registered very solid, 20% year-over-year growth. We saw particular strength in guaranteed placement, with revenue up 24% on strong double digit yield improvements versus last year. Non-guaranteed revenue grew modestly compared to 2009 on lower impressions offset by better yields. With an improving economy, we’re seeing demand shift from non-guaranteed placement to guaranteed, as expected.
Geographically speaking, all regions grew versus prior year, with North America and Asia up strong double digits. Our latest international acquisition, Maktoob, performed in line with plan. Finally, with respect to category performance, seven of ten industry segments rose versus last year and three were roughly flat. Though the improvement was broad based, led by retail, travel, autos, and CPG. 
O&O search was more of a mix story for the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue declined 14% driven mostly by lower RPS. We’re pleased, however, that the RPS trajectory improved sequentially for the second straight quarter, led by 2% growth in the U.S. That’s particularly significant given that the December quarter is traditionally the strongest for monetization, typically followed by a lower 1Q.
From a category perspective, half of our industry segments were flat to up and half were down versus last year. We saw particular strength in CPG and telecom, and weakness in finance. Our global search volume grew slightly on a sequential basis and by 7.5% year-over-year. From a U.S. perspective, while we under performed the market in January and February, our share stabilized in March. As Carol noted, we’re aggressively working on a combination of product enhancements, search related marketing spend and perhaps most importantly, harnessing the power of the Yahoo! network as a search distribution channel. As a result of these efforts, we believe our search query this year has bottomed and will begin to trend upward in the second quarter. 
Moving to our affiliate business, results there were up 7% compared to prior year, primarily driven by currency gains and the Dom affiliate win back we discussed on our January call. 
Rounding out the top line results, our listings fees and leads businesses registered a decline of 12%, with the biggest impact coming from the shifts in our broadband relationships, which have moved from being fee driven to advertising driven. 
Turning now to costs, as you heard in my opening remarks this quarter’s results obviously have some puts and takes to them, so I’ll discuss each element to insure clarity. First, traffic acquisition costs were 29.2% of revenue, just a touch above the high end of our projected range. For the quarter, total expenses, including both costs of revenue and operating expenses, were $1.409 billion. Excluding tax of $467 million, our expenses were $942 million, down 11% from prior year. As previously noted, our expenses benefited by $78 million related to the search alliance.
I’ll take a moment now to explain the two components I mentioned earlier, the $43 million in net transition reimbursements and the $35 million in search operating reimbursements in more detail. Slide 14 of the earnings presentation may also help. Looking first at the transition cost element, recall that Microsoft agreed to pay us up to $150 million to help defray the costs associated with our transitions to their systems. Think of these costs as unique to entering into the alliance. Costs like legal fees, retention, engineering, consulting, training and more, all direct and incremental costs related to getting our search to ultimately be powered by Microsoft. If you think of the $150 million as a declining balance, this quarter we billed $43 million of 2009 costs and $24 million of 1Q 2010 costs against it. In other words, we’ve used up $67 million and there’s $83 million left. For the remainder of 2010, the transition costs we incur each quarter should roughly wash with the transition reimbursement billings, so you shouldn’t see an impact to our P&L. 
Now I’ll move to the $35 million in operating reimbursements. Since we received regulatory clearance and began implementation on February 23, Microsoft has been responsible for the costs of running our paid and algorithmic search platforms. Until we move to their system, Microsoft will be reimbursing us for specific search operating expenses. As you build your own financial projections, understand that the $35 million represents the first evidence of the ongoing savings we anticipate from executing the search alliance. 
Finally, let’s put the Microsoft related items aside. Our underlying expenses were about $45 million favorable to guidance. Roughly $13 million of that is due to spending efficiencies and the remainder was primarily attributable to stock-based compensation. Both share price and forfeitures were favorable to our original estimates. 
Continuing down the income statement, I already touched on the ongoing operating income of $145 million, up 44% from 2009. I’d briefly add that 9% operating margin on GAAP revenue is a 3 point improvement from last year’s 6% margin. As you’ll recall, we are committed to expanding margins to 15% to 20% by 2012.
Below operating income, we had two other notable contributors to our net income and EPS. First, our sale of Zimbra generated a $66 million pretax gain. We had sufficient capital losses to offset capital gain, so the full $66 million fell through to net income with no tax impact. Second, we took the benefit of certain tax advantage transactions this quarter that lowered our effective tax rate. I’ll return to this topic in a moment, when I update our full year tax rate expectations.
Before moving to the second quarter outlook, let’s take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at roughly $4.2 billion. During the quarter, we picked up the pace of our stock repurchases significantly, buying 24.8 million shares at an average price of $15.54 per share, for a total of about $385 million. Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly $144 million. While this result was lower than implied by our operating income result, over $100 million of accrued Microsoft reimbursements were not actually received as cash within the quarter. CapEx was $113 million for the quarter due to a pickup in a typical data server and other equipment purchases.
Finally, as of March 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan, and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was $10.4 billion or approximately $7.35 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba group’s privately held businesses. 
Now let’s look at our outlook for second quarter. On the top line, we see revenue in the range of $1.600 billion to $1.680 billion. At the midpoint of this range represents roughly 4% growth compared to second quarter 2009. Traffic acquisition costs should be roughly 29.5% of revenue. Our total expenses less tax are expected to be in the range of $970 million to $990 million, including D&A and stock-based compensation expense of roughly $225 million. These ranges yield an operating income outlook of roughly $155 million to $195 million, up 130% at the midpoint versus Q2 ’09, or up 24% excluding the $65 million restructuring charge we took last year. 
Taxes for the quarter should return to the 35% to 40% range and ultimately drop to 25% to 30% for the full year.
Before we leave second quarter, let’s insure that everyone understands the cost component of our guidance. Most notably, the total impact of the search alliance will be roughly the same in 2Q as it was in 1Q. The total search alliance benefit in first quarter was $78 million, with $43 million of non-recurring transition cost pickup. In 2Q, we won’t have that $43 million, but we will have a full quarter of the ongoing search operating reimbursements, which we anticipate to be in the range of $75 to $85 million. Therefore, excluding the Microsoft impact from both quarters, our costs are expected to be up approximately $40 million sequentially. The biggest drivers of any additional spending are salary increases, search advertising and seasonal marketing costs.
We intend to stick with our practice of providing only quarterly guidance for revenue in operating income this year, but since there are so many ins and outs to our 2010 expenses, we’d like to provide more insight regarding the full year view. This year we anticipate our total expenses less tax to be in the range of $3.850 billion to $3.925 billion, including roughly $880 million to $900 million of D&A and stock-based comp. At the midpoint of this range, expenses will therefore be down about 10% versus 2009. Excluding tax, D&A and stock-based comp, our core spending will be roughly flat with 2009.
As a final note, comparing our 2010 cost structure to that of 2008, total expenses less tax and goodwill impairments are down approximately 20% over the two year period. I realize that’s a lot of data to digest, so thanks for staying with me on it.
Before turning the call back to Carol, I’d just like to take things up a level for a moment. Our underlying business performance is clearly improving. Our revenue is returning to year-over-year growth, led by display. We’re transforming our cost structure to support our growth and profitability objectives, and our earnings metrics are showing substantial gains versus last year. And now back to Carol.

First up, the ad market. As I mentioned earlier, the display market is coming back. With this comeback the quality of advertisers is on the rise, and that means the quality of ads are also up. These advertisers are looking for new, creative ways to get in front of consumers. In response, we’re talking about we were taking what were ad hoc processes in the past and putting real business processes around them. This includes packaging and marketing our absolutions in a really differentiated way. We’re talking to advertisers about taking the digital canvas we own and doing something unique and creative with it, something that engages consumers on another level. And we’re merging it with our science that keeps getting better with our targeting deep consumer insights and tools that use these insights to optimize performance in real time.
We’ve been actively promoting our position in the marketplace with what we like to call the Power of Three; science, art and scale. You see only Yahoo! offers all the pieces needed for great online advertising today; the science to understand and target an audience, the art to create lasting engagements with consumers through context, and the scale to reach the right person in the right setting in meaningful numbers. 
Nobody’s taking advantage of this new approach better than one of our biggest advertisers, Wal-Mart. They wanted moms to know that Wal-Mart is the best resource for making life easier and they wanted to reach moms wherever they are, in store and online. We already knew where moms were on the web, so it was easy for us to develop a custom marketing plan to deliver Wal-Mart’s messages across the Yahoo! network. This is Wal-Mart’s single biggest digital advertising initiative to date in terms of dollars, scale, creativity, you name it; it’s huge. Each month Yahoo! will help Wal-Mart reach an estimated 23 million moms an average of 5.6 times. Put another way, more than 7 out of 10, listen to that, 7 out of 10 online moms will see this marketing message in an average month. Wal-Mart’s been very impressed.
Now I’d like to talk for a moment about search. I don’t think it’s any secret that for the past 18 to 24 months we’ve had a tough row to hoe in search. And there was definitely a sugar low after we announced the Microsoft search alliance last year. We had a lot of work to do internally to get ready for it, and we weren’t aggressive enough on volume, even though we were focusing on improving RPF. But all of that is past now. We believe search share has bottomed and will trend up in the second quarter, thanks to our work to grow volume. A key part of these efforts has been using the power of the Yahoo! network, not just externally but internally as well. Our teams are now integrated and aligned around our goal, and I can tell you that in addition to this play, there’s a renewed energy among Yahoo!s around search. We’re really excited about our product plan.
And that also includes work to improve relevance in a ROI for advertisers that will continue until the transition to Microsoft is complete. Speaking of Microsoft, we’re deep into detailed planning to insure we transition users, advertisers and publishers with quality. Our aim is a high quality transition starting with the U.S. prior to the 2010 holiday season. Both companies are very engaged in this process, and there’s a lot of work to do. Remember, it’s all about providing the best product to users, advertisers and publishers, and we’ll only begin the transition when we’re absolutely ready.
Tim already walked you through the financials around the Microsoft search alliance and how we plan to use some of the cost savings to reinvest back in the company. Hopefully these plans come as no surprise. A year ago on this call, I talked about major initiatives we had planned to better position Yahoo! And I really want to re-emphasize where we’re putting our dollar. First, our investment to globalize, modernize and improve our consumer products and second, our efforts to improve the advertising experience and ad serving and monetization platforms. As I said then, that first initiative was a two year effort. We’re right in the middle of the process of modernizing our platforms and we won’t see these costs begin to fall until the summer of next year. The idea is to develop platforms in the cloud where we can quickly retrieve content, and put it anywhere on any property in the world. And of course, that gives us greater scale and efficiencies.
On the second initiative, we’re continuing to enhance our ad platform. The latest release allows for improvements in forecasting and delivery management, to drive better accuracy and yields. We also deployed the next generation of our behavioral targeting capabilities and we’re experimenting with yield optimization across guaranteed and non-guaranteed marketplaces. Look for us to roll off our two old ad platforms to this latest release of app over the next 18 months, first in the U.S., then in international markets. 
We anticipate that all of the investments I just mentioned will run $200 million this year. If you remember back to when we talked to you about the efficiencies and rationale behind the Microsoft search alliance, this is where the reinvestments we discussed are going. 
I want to discuss another item, and that’s the interest that people seem to have around executive transitions. To be honest, it’s borderline strange, the obsession some of these folks have. What surprises me is all the great people we’re tracking seem to get less attention. I mentioned last quarter we hired Shashi Seth, an expert in the search industry, to lead our efforts around search. And of course we just announced our new Chief Product Officer, Blake Irving. Blake brings large scale Internet experience, most recently with Microsoft as Corporate VP of the Windows Live Platform group. Blake will lead our talented team and is responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of our global consumer and advertising products. 
I’d also like to take a moment to thank Ari Balogh, who’s been our CTO and head of Products. Ari’s been instrumental in our product initiatives and we wish him all the best and safe travels. 
Let’s move on to discuss some of our user highlights from the quarter. I know a lot of you tuned in to our Olympic coverage in February, and we are so pleased, as you are, with our performance. We racked up 70% more users and logged 40% more time spent than NBC’s online Olympics coverage. And we didn’t pay a cent for broadcast rights. We’ve always been focused on specific events like the Olympics, not just as short term traffic drivers but also as ways to draw users into the Yahoo! experience, and more deeply engage with them over time. Yet we know we can’t run a business just waiting for major sporting events, award shows and natural disasters. In earlier quarters you heard me mention that we need to attract these types of audiences every day. That’s why we’ve been using our unique approach of combining human editors to choose great stories, and letting our content optimization engine determine the best content for our users.
I want to talk with this content engine for a second because it’s an amazing technology that has been growing more and more advanced over the last several months. In its first iteration, our content optimization engine recommended the most popular news items to our users. The result was 100% click through rate increase over time. In January, we introduced release two of the engine, which included some of our behavioral targeting technology. This capability, coupled of course with great content, led our today module to experience click through rates 160% over pre-engine implementation. Our large and engaged audience is also an important reason why our content partners choose to work with us. 
Case in point, this past quarter Yahoo! Sports scored an exclusive deal with major league baseball to become the league’s official Fantasy Baseball Game. And while we’re on the subject of sports, we also made an important acquisition with Citizen Sports. They create popular games for the iPhone, Android, Facebook and more. In fact, their Sportsacular iPhone app is ranked in the top 20 for sports, and is highly rated by users. Citizen Sports brings to Yahoo! a combination of mobile, social and interactive experience that will begin with our sports properties but will then be incorporated to really jazz up our other media sites. Look for us to remain focused on acquisitions like these that improve the Yahoo! experience.
Elsewhere on the social front, we entered into a global partnership to integrate Twitter’s real time social experiences throughout Yahoo!’s global network, not just in search but on our homepage and all of our media properties, too. And you know we’re also increasing the level of integration with Facebook, allowing users to update their Yahoo! Social and Facebook status at the same time. These kinds of integrations are important to us. While we’re not a social network, social interactions are becoming increasingly important to everything we do. 
Just look at what happened when we recently introduced comments on our news stories. Two weeks after launching the feature, we had more than 60,000 comments on just one article. It’s an amazing example of how our users want to interact on our network. 
On the mobile side, we signed a major mobile search and search advertising dealer with Telefónica in Europe. We also released a trio of new apps; Yahoo! Sketch-a-Search and Yahoo! Search for the iPhone. And we were one of the first apps on the iPad, with Yahoo! Entertainment. All of these apps have gotten great reviews from users and have been ranked highly in their respective categories.
And just last week we launched a product from our video partnership with Reveille. The show called Who Knew? is sponsored by Toyota and runs on Yahoo! News. Already it’s a proven success. On its second day, it hit 1 million streams. That’s an insanely high number in the world of online original programming for a show that just launched. Now all of our key verticals, sports, news, finance, entertainment have sponsored video programs. We’ve been doing a lot of these programs on our own out of a closet in Santa Monica, but now we have producers in their agencies like Reveille coming over the transom to work with us. Consumers love these videos and they’re in very high demand with advertisers because they command consumer attention in a much more impactful way. By the way, that means not just higher ROI for advertisers, but premium pricing for us. Look for more of these original, low cost, highly relevant video snacks from us in the future.
These branded entertainment partnerships are just one example of how we’re using our unique combination of science, art and scale to improve the importance and outcome of online advertising. We’re constantly finding new ways to go to market with advertisers to help them shift their budgets online. Toyota and Wal-Mart are just two examples. Look for us to launch new ad experiences around cooking, travel, and more in the future.
It’s all about creating a new approach to help advertisers with the biggest challenges they share with us. One, they want to shift more budget to where consumers are online. They want to stand out and be creative in how they reach consumers. And they want a Yahoo! that’s easier and meets their needs.
We recently took on a challenge that faced the PhRMA industry, how to use interactive online video to brand their products while at the same time meeting FDA legal requirements. So we developed a compelling new ad unit for the industry called an enhanced, interactive ad. And we’re doing it at a scale that only Yahoo! can deliver. We just launched this and already we’re getting great feedback. Last week a huge PhRMA advertiser told us that this new ad unit now gives them the justification to move a significant amount of TV dollars online. And that’s just scratching the surface. 
We’re now innovating at a much more rapid pace. In the last three weeks alone, we’ve created multiple new ad units that have major retailers and auto manufacturers excited to use our network to reach their target audience. And this isn’t just talk. Just this week, Yahoo! ranked first in a survey about value for the investments among online media. The survey, conducted by Jack Myers Media Business Report, puts us ahead of Google, AOL, MSN and everyone else.
Before I close, I’d like to draw your attention to a significant event that occurred on March 2, Yahoo!’s 15th birthday. We’ve come a long way from our humble beginnings in a trailer at Stanford to our more than 600 million users today. And while many major sites have come and gone on the web, we’re still here and thriving. Yahoo! is important to a huge consumer audience and a key ingredient in many, many media plans. We’re looked to for innovation and leadership within the digital space; not many other Internet companies can say that. 
And while I’ve only been here a little more than a year out of those 15, I can guarantee you that we have much, much more in store. We’re excited about it, and it’s why I’d like to remind you to join us for our upcoming investor day on May 26 at the San Jose Fairmont. 
And with that, let’s bring this part of the call to a close. As you come away from today, I’d like you to remember at least three important things. One, we’re hard at work executing the Microsoft search alliance. Two, we’re investing for growth and efficiency. And three, we are leaders in online advertising as evidenced by meaningful 20% growth year-over-year in our display performance. 
Now let’s open up the call to your questions. Operator?

So we feel great about our momentum. We’re not going to break out our guidance for next quarter nor for any of the coming quarters, but again I think we’re well positioned. We feel good.

But we talk about how to get it up, we’re focusing a lot on this and this is everything from having more interactivity on our sites through comments and voting and buzzing, video, real time content, better targeting. Because if we target better, people will stay engaged. For instance, on my home page I see something different than Tim does. You know he gets sports, I’m right now getting diet recipes, which is irritating a little bit. I don’t know why they targeted that, but the point of the matter is better targeting, more video, more interactivity, these are things we’re working on because these things really affect engagement.

You know we feel like we’re doing a really good job on RPS, put in a lot of improvements in the fourth quarter that I think contributed if I remember the numbers correctly 8% sequential growth then.

Over the last few quarters we have certain tax advantage transactions that, depending on factual circumstances you put up reserves against. And as those facts and circumstances change, you release reserves. So some of these transactions we’re able to release reserves this quarter, so in classic kind of tax language that’s a discrete item as was the fact that Zimbra fell through to the bottom line without tax, because we had sufficient capital losses on our balance sheet to offset the capital gains. So that’s kind of what happened with first quarter.
If you take out, you know, versus the guidance the normalized rate was in the low 20s versus guidance of 35 to 40, so there was probably $28 million aside from Zimbra that you could tag to the discrete item.
In terms of total year being down in the 25 to 30% range, essentially what you see is 18% from first quarter, 35 to 40% in the second quarter. That puts the half at roughly 25% if you do the math. And so what we’re implying then is the second half will also be maybe a little bit north of that, maybe as high as 30%. When you put them together you get 25 to 30%. So what we’re doing is we’re working on a number of items, discrete items, yes, there could be more discrete items, but the things that are more interesting to me are the structural items. Just changing the ongoing baseline tax rate for our company, and I would say that we probably made from the typical baseline that people think about in the low 40s, we’ve probably made 5 or a little bit more than 5 points progress there. And we’re continuing to kind of bash away at that.
In terms of your second question on results, with O&O flat, what ended up happening is we saw some good strength in display, basically as expected. Search was a little bit weaker than we expected, primarily based on volume. And from what I’ve read anyway, the whole market was a little bit slower pace in the first quarter than we had anticipated. So even though we a little bit under performed the market in January and February, shares stabilized in March but for the whole industry from what I’ve read that volume query growth was no great shape. So that was definitely part of it. And then of course affiliates picked up a little bit to obscure some of that. And that’s basically kind of the math on it.

I think it was exactly this call a year ago when I talked about globalization and product silos and so forth, and maybe a few months after that as I was busy discovering things talked about the fact that we had three ad platforms and we really needed to get that modernized. You know, and at the time I said this was a two year process. Let me tell you what it really gives us and by the way as I said in the script, that’s when you’ll start seeing the costs start filtering off is mid next summer. What it really means for us is a lot more speed and flexibility in serving up great content for our users. 
Now, what do I mean by that? Right now, just as our products are in silos, our content is in silos. So if for instance finance wants to put a news article up, if they didn’t do a deal with that news feed, they can’t find that piece of data because that’s owned by the front page or the newsgroup. And so everybody’s out there, on their own, in each property and each property times each country, trying to get information up on the site. Equally important is, for instance when we do the Twitter deals and Facebook deals we talked about, every property has to integrate it uniquely. So for instance we can’t just integrate Twitter across our media properties or Facebook across our media properties. Everything has to be done one off, which is why we’re doing what we’re doing. So we’re talking about content agility in the cloud, we’re talking about just faster and more real time information for our users, and our benefit of really sharing content around the world.
The other thing that I would tell you is so important is we are for the first time putting in a consistent video platform for the company. We have had, again, every property had a unique video platform so we could not serve videos up in a consistent way, even in the U.S., much less anyplace else. And as I just said, video drives engagement. Video is exactly what advertisers are interested in. In fact, there’s an interesting fact that a TV user is willing to watch 6 to 7 minutes of video ads per month on a site versus an average of 4 minutes on it with everybody else. So getting video in a big way for us is really important.
So when you ask, you know, what are you going to see? Well, you are going to see costs coming off. You’re also going to see a lot more real time and interesting content on our site.

Where that goes in 2011 really depends on how quickly we transition onto all of the platforms and start to get more of the, if you recall the $650 savings is broken down into $225 of kind of the non-cash charges, which we’re starting to make progress on and we’ll continue to make progress on I think into next year, some good progress. The other piece then is $425 of what we used to call cash costs. So you could say 80 times 4 is 320, 320 of the 425 is this product cost. So that say $100 million delta, you know we’re continuing to work on it and have to figure out how much of that we can do now before complete transition, how much of it takes a couple of years. 
A lot of kind of moving pieces to this, so we’re not really in a position to give you really good numbers for next year yet, but we’ll continue to work in that direction obviously.
In terms of the share repurchase in first quarter, you know, we’ve said that we want to offset dilution of our equity programs. We made some great progress on our equity program expense obviously this quarter, some of which is just pure accounting tailwinds for us as earlier years at much higher volatility rates and share price rates kind of roll off from the expense statement. So a lot of it is a lot of discipline on our part, too, and getting better on awarding people with stock-based compensation in more targeted ways. So that has come down. But nevertheless we are committed to continuing to offset that dilution. I wouldn’t say necessarily in any one quarter over any one year. I mean what you saw in the first quarter is we had a great opportunity to buy the stock at you know prices that we thought were terrific and represented on a long-term value. I mean we bought them at $15.54 if you recall from the script. So that felt like the right thing to do. We’re always going to be looking opportunistically to buy back stock where we see a great deal. 
I’m obviously not going to tip our hand in terms of quarterly run rates or anything like that because I think it defeats our purpose. But you can definitely look for us to always be opportunistic in this regard.

Hello, everybody, and thanks for joining us this afternoon. Today we'll talk about the quarter and our financial results in detail, address some topics of interest, including the Display and Search Ad Market, the implementation of our Search agreement with Microsoft and an update on the investments. And of course, we're happy to answer your questions.
First, let's talk about Q1. The economy continues to improve. We delivered what I call a solid quarter. Revenues stabilized and profits were up. The headline news is that Display Advertising grew 20% year-over-year ahead of the market. More importantly, guaranteed Display grew by 24% as large advertisers came back. That means their purse strings are starting to loosen up. A lot of them have been lying dormant or only doing the minimum. And as the economy does better, they're reemerging to aggressively position their brands online. As the market leader in Display, we're well-positioned to benefit from this trend.
After Search, we told you last quarter that we really intensified our focus and efforts around Search volume. These efforts, such as Marketing Search on and off the Yahoo! network, new toolbar and browser offers and Search integration, across our properties have paid off. As a result, I'm very pleased to report that we've stabilized our Search share and believe that we'll trend up in Q2.
And of course, due to regulatory clearance this quarter, we have more tangible information to share with you on the Microsoft transition. One last thing before I turn it over to Tim, on a directional note, we've started doing some really forward thinking and creative things on the Advertising side. They have our sales team, agencies and advertisers really energized. We're already seeing some of these initiatives help us engage with advertisers on a whole new level. I'll talk about this and more, but first, Tim will cover the financials. Tim?"

Total revenue landed roughly 2% shy of the midpoint of our outlook. This quarter we made important strides across a wide variety of areas impacting both our income statement and balance sheet. Today, I'll review first quarter financial perf",1909,"Thanks, Carol. Total revenue landed roughly 2% shy of the midpoint of our outlook. This quarter we made important strides across a wide variety of areas impacting both our income statement and balance sheet. Today, I'll review first quarter financial performance in detail, provide our second quarter outlook and additionally, outline our full-year expectations for the extensive impact of the Microsoft Search Alliance.
I'll begin with a summary of our headline metrics, revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. These numbers were affected by a couple of large items this quarter, namely, Microsoft reimbursements related to our Search Alliance and the sale of Zimbra, which I'll separate out for you.
GAAP revenue of $1,597,000,000 grew by 1% year-over-year. The first growth we've registered since 3Q '08. Operating income of $188 million grew by an impressive 87%, aided by two reimbursements from Microsoft, $35 million of Search operating expense reimbursements and $43 million in net transition cost reimbursements. Neither of these reimbursements was included in the outlook we provided in January, and we believe you should treat these reimbursements as two separate annuity items.
Let me provide a bit more color there. The $35 million for Search operating expenses represents the initial step on the path to the long-term cost savings we anticipate as a result of the Alliance. So the favorability is an ongoing piece of our cost structure. The $43 million on the other hand, relates to reimbursement of transition expenses incurred in 2009. That amount should be treated as nonrecurring.
Excluding the nonrecurring item, operating income was $145 million, up 44% year-over-year with operating margin expansion to 9%. This result is the first tangible financial benefit of the Search Alliance.
Turning to earnings. The $0.22 per diluted share we reported included $0.07 of unusual items, primarily $0.05 from the sale of Zimbra and $0.02 from the nonrecurring transition reimbursement I just discussed. Excluding those items, EPS of $0.58 per diluted share was up 77% year-over-year, due to cost structure and tax rate improvements.
I'll return to the impact of the Search Alliance in more detail later. But with that, at high-level background, let's start at the top of the P&L then walk through the results in more detail, beginning with our O&O Display revenue. O&O Display registered very solid, 20% year-over-year growth. We saw particular strength in guaranteed placements, with revenue up 24% on strong double-digit yield improvements versus last year. Non-guaranteed revenue grew modestly compared to 2009 on lower impressions offset by better yield.
With an improving economy, we're seeing demand shift from non-guaranteed placements to guaranteed, as expected. Geographically speaking, all regions grew versus prior year with North America and Asia up strong double digits. Our latest international acquisition, Maktoob, performed in line with the plan. Finally, with respect to category performance, seven of 10 industry segments rose versus last year and three were roughly flat. The improvement was broad-based, led by retail, travel, autos and CPG. O&O Search was more of a mixed story for the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue declined 14%, driven mostly by lower RPS. We're pleased however, that the RPS trajectory improved sequentially for the second straight quarter, led by 2% growth in the U.S. That's particularly significant, given that the December quarter is traditionally the strongest for monetization, typically followed by lower 1Q. From a category perspective, half of our industry segments were flat to up and half were down versus last year. We saw particular strength in CPG Telecom and weakness in Finance.
Our global Search volume grew slightly on a sequential basis and by 7.5% year-over-year. For the U.S. perspective, while we underperformed the market in January and February, our share stabilized in March. As Carol noted, we're aggressively working on a combination of product enhancements, Search-related marketing spend and perhaps most importantly, harnessing the power of the Yahoo! network as a search distribution channel. As a result of these efforts, we believe our Search query share has bottomed and will begin to trend upward in the second quarter.
Moving to our affiliate business. Results there were up 7% compared to prior-year, primarily driven by currency gains and the dollar affiliate win back we discussed on our January call. Rounding out the top line results, our Listing Speed and Leads businesses registered a decline of 12%, with the biggest impact coming from the shifts in our broadband relationships, which have moved from being fee-driven to advertising-driven.
Turning now to cost. As you heard in my opening remarks, this quarter's results obviously had some puts and takes to them, so I'll discuss each element to ensure clarity. First, traffic acquisition costs were 29.2% of revenue, just a touch above the high end of our projected range. For the quarter, total expenses, including both cost of revenue and operating expenses grew $1,409,000,000. Excluding TAC of $467 million, our expenses were $942 million, down 11% from prior-year. As previously noted, our expenses benefited by $78 million related to Search Alliance. 
I'll take a moment now to explain the two components I mentioned earlier, the $43 million in net transition reimbursements and the $35 million in Search operating reimbursements in more detail.
Slide 14 in the earnings presentation may also help.
Looking first at the transition cost element, recall that Microsoft agreed to pay us up to $150 million to help defray the costs associated with our transition to their systems. Each of these costs is unique to entering into the Alliance, costs like legal fees, retention, engineering, consulting, training and more. All direct in incremental costs related to getting our Search to ultimately be powered by Microsoft. If you think of the $150 million as a declining balance, this quarter we billed $43 million of 2009 costs and $24 million of 1Q 2010 cost against it. In other words, we've used up $57  million and there's $83 million left. For the remainder of 2010, the transition costs we incur each quarter should roughly wash with the transition reimbursement billings. But you shouldn't impact to our P&L.
Now I'll move to the $35 million in operating reimbursements. If we receive regulatory clearance and began implementation on February 23, Microsoft has been responsible for the cost of running our paid and algorithmic Search platforms. Until we move to their systems, Microsoft will be reimbursing us for specific Search operating expenses. As you build your own financial projections, understand that the $35 million represents the first evidence of the ongoing savings we anticipate with executing the Search Alliance. 
Finally, let's put the Microsoft-related items aside. Our underlying expenses were about $45 million payroll to guidance. Roughly $13 million of that includes spending efficiencies, and the remainder is primarily attributable to stock-based compensation, while share price and forfeitures were favorable to our original estimates. Continuing down the income statement, I already touched on the ongoing operating income of $145 million, up 44% from 2009. I'd briefly add that 9% operating margin on GAAP revenue is a three-point improvement from last year's 6% margin. As you'll recall, we are committed to expanding margins to 15% to 20% by 2012.
Below operating income, we had two other notable contributors to our net income and EPS. First, our sale of Zimbra generated a $66 million pretax gain. We had sufficient capital losses to offset that capital gain for the full $66 million sell-through to net income with no tax impact. Second, we took the benefit of certain tax advantage transactions this quarter that lowered our effective tax rate. I'll return to this topic in a moment, when I've updated our full-year tax rate expectations.
Before moving to the second quarter outlook, let's take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable bank securities ended the quarter at roughly $4.2 billion. During the quarter, we picked up the pace of our stock repurchases significantly, buying 24.8 million shares at an average price of $15.54 per share, for a total of about $385 million. Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly $144 million. While this result was lower than implied by our operating income results, over $100 million of accrued Microsoft reimbursements were not actually received as cash within the quarter.
CapEx was $113 million for the quarter due to a pickup in a typical data server and other equipment purchases. Finally, as of March 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake at Alibaba.com was $10.4 billion or approximately $7.35 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group's privately held businesses.
Now let's look at our outlook for second quarter. On the top line, we see revenue in the range of $1,600,000,000 to $1,680,000 million. At the midpoint of this range represents roughly 4% growth compared to second quarter 2009. Traffic acquisition costs should be roughly 29.5% of revenue. Our total expenses less tax are expected to be in the range of $970 million to $990 million including D&A and stock-based compensation expense of roughly $225 million. These ranges yield an operating income outlook of roughly $155 million to $195 million, up 130% at the midpoint versus 2Q '09 for about 24% excluding the $65 million restructuring charge we took last year.
Taxes for the quarter should return to the 35% to 40% range and ultimately drop to 25% to 30% for the full year.
Before leaving second quarter, let's be sure that everyone understands the cost component of our guidance. Most notably, the total impact of the Search Alliance will be roughly the same in 2Q as it was in 1Q. The total Search Alliance benefit in the first quarter was $78 million, with $43 million of nonrecurring transition cost pickup. In 2Q, we won't have that $43 million, but we will have a full quarter of the ongoing Search operating reimbursements, which we anticipate to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million. Therefore, excluding the Microsoft impact from both quarters, our costs are expected to be up approximately $40 million sequentially. The biggest drivers of the additional spending are salary increases, Search advertising and seasonal marketing costs.
We intend to stick with our practice of providing only quarterly guidance for revenue and operating income this year, but since there are so many ins and outs to our 2010 expenses, we'd like to provide more insight regarding the full-year review. This year, we anticipate our total expenses less tax to be in the range of $3,850,000,000 to $3,925,000,000 including roughly $880 million to $900 million of D&A in stock-based comp. At the midpoint of this range, expect as we'll therefore be down about 10% versus 2011. Excluding TAC D&A and stock-based comp, our core spending will be roughly flat for 2009. As a final note, comparing our 2010 cost structure to that of 2008, total expenses plus tax and goodwill impairment are down approximately 20% over the two-year period.
I realize that's a lot of data to digest, so thanks for staying with me on it. Before turning the call back to Carol, I'd just like take things up a little for a moment. Our underlying business performance is clearly improving. Our revenue is returning to year-over-year growth led by Display. We're transforming our cost structure to support our growth and profitability objectives, and our earnings metrics are showing substantial gains versus last year. And now back to Carol."

First up, the Ad Market. As I mentioned earlier, the Display market is coming back. With this comeback, the quality of advertisers is on the rise, and that means the quality of ads are also up.
These advertisers are looking for new, creative ways to get in front of consumers. In response, we're talking about -- we were taking what were ad hoc prophecies in the past and putting real business prophecies around them. This includes packaging and marketing our Ad solutions in a really differentiated way. We're talking to advertisers about taking the digital canvas we own and doing something unique and creative with it, something that engages consumers on another level. And then merging it with our science that keeps getting better with our targeting, deep consumer insight and tools that use these insights to optimize performance in realtime.
We've been actively promoting our position in the marketplace with what we like to call the power of three: science, art and scale. You see, only Yahoo! offers all the pieces needed for great online advertising today. The science to understand in targeting audience, the art to create lasting engagements with consumers through contests and the scale to reach the right person in the right setting in meaningful numbers.
Nobody's taking advantage of this new approach better than one of our biggest advertisers, Wal-Mart. They wanted moms to know that Wal-Mart is the best resource for making life easier. And they wanted to reach moms wherever they are, in-store and online. We already knew where moms where on the web, so it's easy for us to develop a custom marketing plan to deliver Wal-Mart's messages across the Yahoo! network. This is Wal-Mart's single biggest digital advertising initiative to date, in terms of dollar, sale, creativity, you name it. It's huge.
Each month, Yahoo! will help Wal-Mart reach an estimated 23 million moms, an average of 5.6 times. Put another way, more than seven out of 10. Listen to that. Seven out of 10 online moms will see this marketing message in an average month. Wal-Mart's been very impressed. Now I'd like to talk for a moment about Search.
I don't think it's any secret that for the past 18 to 24 months, we've had a tough road to hold [ph] (22:34) in Search. And it was definitely a sugar low after we announced the Microsoft Search Alliance last year. We had a lot of work to do internally, to get ready for it. And we weren't aggressive enough on volume, even though we were focusing on improving RPS. But all of that is past now. We believe Search here has bottomed and will trend up in the second quarter, thanks to our work to grow volume. A key part of these efforts has been using the power of the Yahoo! network, not just externally but internally as well.
Our chains are now integrated and aligned around our goals, and I can tell you that in addition to Display, there's a renewed energy among Yahoo!'s around Search. We're really excited about our product plan.
And that also includes work to improve relevance in our ROI for advertisers, that will continue until the transition to Microsoft is complete. Speaking of Microsoft, we're deep into detailed planning to ensure we transition users, advertisers and publishers with quality. Our aim is a high-quality transition starting with the U.S. prior to the 2010 holiday season. Both companies are very engaged in this process, and there's a lot of work to do. Remember, it's all about providing the best product to users, advertisers and publishers. And we'll only begin the transition when we're absolutely ready.
Tim already walked you through the financials around the Microsoft Search Alliance and how we plan to use some of the cost savings to reinvest back in the company. Hopefully, these plans come as no surprise. A year ago on this call, I talked about major initiatives we had planned to better position Yahoo!. And I really want to re-emphasize where we're putting our dollars: First, on investment, to globalize, modernize and improve our consumer products; and second, our efforts to improve the Advertising experience and Ad serving and modernization platforms. As I said then, that first initiative is a two-year effort. We're right in the middle of the process of modernizing our platforms, and we won't see these costs begin to fall until the summer of next year. The idea to develop platforms in the cloud, where we can quickly retrieve content and put it anywhere on any property in the world. And of course, that gives us greater scale and efficiency.
On the second initiative, we're continuing to enhance our Ad platform. The latest release allows for improvements in forecasting and delivering management to drive better accuracy and yield. We also deployed the next generation of our behavioral targeting capabilities and we're experimenting with yield optimization across guaranteed and non-guaranteed marketplaces. Look for us to roll off our two old ad platforms to this latest release of apps over the next 18 months, first in the U.S. then in the international markets.
We anticipate that all of the investments I just mentioned will run a couple hundred million dollars this year. If you remember back when we talked to you about the efficiencies and rationale behind the Microsoft Search Alliance, this is where the reinvestments we discussed are going. 
I want to discuss another item. A nasty interest people seem to have around executive transitions. To be honest, it's borderline strange, the obsession some of these folks have. What surprises me is all the great people we're attracting seem to get less attention. I mentioned last quarter, we hired Shashi Seth, an expert in the search industry, to lead our efforts around Search. And of course, we've just announced our new Chief Product Officer, Blake Irving. Blake brings large-scale internet experience, most recently with Microsoft as Corporate VP of their Windows Live platform group. Blake will lead our talented team and is responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of our global consumer and advertising products.
I'd also like to take a moment to thank Ari Balogh, who's been our CTO and Head of Products. Ari's been instrumental in our product initiative, and we wish him all the best and safe travel.
Let's move on to discuss some of our user highlights from the quarter. I know a lot of you turned in to our Olympic coverage in February, and we are so pleased as you are with our performance. We wrapped up 70% more users and logged 40% more timestamps than NBC's online Olympic's coverage. And we didn't pay a cent for broadcast rights. We've always been focused on specific events like the Olympics. Not just as short-term traffic drivers but also as ways to drive users into the Yahoo! experience and more deeply engage with them over time. Yet, we know we can't run a business just waiting for major sporting events, award shows and natural disasters. In earlier quarters, you heard me mention that we need to attract these types of audiences everyday. That's why we've been using our unique approach of combining human editors to choose great stories and letting our content optimization engine determine the best content for our users. 
I want to talk with this topic engine for a second, because it's an amazing technology that has been growing more and more advanced over the last several months. In its first generation, our content optimization engine recommended the most popular news items to our users. The result was a 100% click-through rate increase over time. In January, we introduced release two of the engine, which included some of our behavioral targeting technology. This capability, coupled of course with great content, led our today module to experience click-through rates 160% over pre-engine implementation. 
Our large and engaged audience is also an important reason why our content partners choose to work with us. Case in point, this past quarter, Yahoo! Sports scored an inclusive deal with Major League Baseball to become the league's official Fantasy Baseball game. And while we're on the subject of Sports, we also made an important acquisition with Citizen Sports. They create popular games for the iPhone, Android, Facebook and more. In fact, their Sportacular iPhone app is ranked in the top 20 for sport and is highly rated by users. Citizen Sports brings to Yahoo! a combination of mobile, social and interactive experience that will begin with our sports properties, but will then be incorporated to really jazz up our other media sites. Look for us to remain focused on acquisitions like this that improve the Yahoo! experience.
Elsewhere on the social front, we entered into a global partnership to integrate Twitter's realtime social experiences throughout Yahoo!'s global network, not just in Search but on our Homepage and all of our media properties, too. And you know, we're also increasing the level of integration with Facebook, allowing users to update their Yahoo! social and Facebook status at the same time. These kind of integrations are important to us. While we're not a social network, social interactions are becoming increasingly important to everything we do. Just look at what happened when we recently introduced comments on our news stories. Two weeks after launching the feature, we have more than 60,000 comments on just one article. It's an amazing example of how our users want to interact on our network.
On the Mobile side, we signed a major Mobile Search and Search advertising deal with Telefónica in Europe. We also released the trio of new apps, Yahoo! Sketch and Search and Yahoo! Search for the iPhone. And we were one of the first apps on the iPad with Yahoo! Entertainment. All of these apps have gotten great reviews from users and have been ranked highly in their respective categories. And just lastly, we launched a product from our video partnership with Reveille. The show called, Who Knew? is sponsored by Toyota and runs on Yahoo! News. Already, it's a proven success. On its second day, it hit one million streams. That's an insanely high number in the world of online original programming for a show that just launched. Now all of our key verticals: Sports, News, Finance, Entertainment have sponsored video programs. We've been doing a lot of these programs on our own out of a closet in Santa Monica, but now we have producers and there are agencies like Reveille coming over the transom to work with us. 
Consumers love these videos, and they're in very high demand with advertisers because they command consumer attention in a much more impactful way. By the way, that means not just higher ROI for advertisers, but premium pricing for us. Look for more of these original, low-cost, highly-relevant video snacks from us in the future.  
These branded entertainment partnerships are just one example of how we're using our unique combination of science, art and scale to improve the importance and outcomes of online advertising. We're constantly finding new ways to go to market with advertisers to help them shift their budgets online. Toyota and Wal-Mart are just two examples. Look for us to launch new ad experiences around cooking, travel and more in the future. 
It's all about creating a new approach to help advertisers with the biggest challenges they share with us. One, they want to shift more budget to where consumers are online. They want to standout and be creative in how they reach consumers. And they want a Yahoo! that's easier and meets their needs. 
We recently took on a challenge that faced the Pharma industry. How to use interactive online video to brand their products while at the same time meeting FDA legal requirements. So we developed the compelling new ad unit for the industry called an enhanced, interactive ad. And we're doing it at a scale that only Yahoo! can deliver. We just launched this, and already we're getting great feedback. Last week, a huge Pharma advertiser told us that this new ad unit now gives them the justification to move a significant amount of TV dollars online. And that's just scratching the surface. 
We're now innovating at a much more rapid pace. In the last three weeks alone, we've created multiple new ad units that have major retailers and auto manufacturers excited to use our network to reach their target audience. And this isn't just talk. Just this week, Yahoo! ranked first in a survey about value for the investments among online media. The survey, conducted by Jack Myers of Media Business Report, puts us ahead of Google, AOL, MSN and everyone else.
Before I close, I'd like to draw your attention to a significant event that occurred on March 2, Yahoo!'s 15th birthday. We have come a long way from our humble beginnings in a trailer at Stanford to our more than 600 million users today. And while many major sites have come and gone on the Web, we're still here and thriving. Yahoo! is important to a huge consumer audience and a key ingredient in many, many media plan. We're looked to for innovation and leadership within the digital space, not many other Internet companies can say that. 
And while I've only been here a little more than a year out of those 15, I can guarantee that we have much, much more in store. We're excited about it, and it's why I'd like to remind you to join us for our upcoming Investor Day on May 26 at the San Jose Fairmont. 
So with that, let's bring this part of the call to a close. As you come away from today, I'd like you to remember at least three important things. One, we're hard at work executing the Microsoft Search Alliance. Two, we're investing for growth and efficiency. And three, we are leaders in online advertising as evidenced by a meaningful 20% growth year-over-year in our display performance. 
Now let's open up the call to your questions. Operator?"

Engagement's really flopped around a lot by mail engagement, which when it just hiccups a little bit, it moves the whole company around. But when you talk about how to get it up, we're focusing a lot on this and this is everything from having more interactivity on our sites through comments and voting and buzzing, video, real-time content, better targeting. Because if we target better, people will stay engaged. For instance, on my home page, I see something different than Tim does. He gets Sports, I'm right now getting diet recipes, which is irritating me a little bit. I don't know why they targeted that, but the point of the matter is better targeting, more video, more interactivity, these are things we're working on because these things really affect engagement."

But after the second straight quarter, as I said in my script, it's up in terms of sequential growth. So from fourth quarter to first quarter, most notably up 2%. We feel like we're doing a really good job on RPS, put in a lot of improvements in the fourth quarter that I think contributed, if I remember the numbers correctly, 8% sequential growth then. So we feel like that's on a pretty good trajectory.

I mean, we were able to -- for the last few quarters, we have certain tax advantage transactions that, depending on factual circumstances you put up reserves against. And as those facts and circumstances change, you release reserves. So some of these transactions we're able to release reserves this quarter, so in classic kind of tax language, that's a discrete item as was the fact that Zimbra fell through the bottom line without tax, because we had sufficient capital losses on our balance sheet to offset the capital gains. So that's kind of what happened with first quarter. If you take out, versus the guidance the normalized rate was in the low 20s versus guidance of 35% to 40%. So there was probably $28 million aside from Zimbra that you could tag to the discrete item. In terms of total year being down in the 25% to 30% range, essentially what you see is 18% from first quarter, 35% to 40% in the second quarter. That puts the half at roughly 25%, if you do the math. And so what we're implying then is the second half will also be kind of maybe a little bit north of that, maybe as high as 30%. You put them together you get 25% to 30%. So what we're doing is we're working on a number of items, discrete items, yes, there could be more discrete items. But the things that are more interesting to me are the structural items. Just changing the ongoing baseline tax rate for our company, and I would say that we probably need, from a typical baseline that people think about in the low 40s, we probably need five or maybe a little more than five-points progress there. And we're continuing to kind of bash away at that. In terms of your second question on results, with O&O flat, what ended up happening is we saw some good strength in Display, basically as expected. Search was a little bit weaker than we expected, primarily based on volume. I think, and from what I've read anyway, the whole market was a little bit slower paced in the first quarter than we had anticipated. So even though we stayed a little bit underperformed the market in January and February, shares stabilized in March, but for the whole industry, from what I've read, the volume query growth was no great shape. So that was definitely part of it. And then, of course, Affiliates picked up a little bit to obscure some of that miss, and that's basically kind of the math on it. Next question, please."

I think it was exactly this call a year ago when I talked about globalization and product silos and so forth, and maybe a few months after that as I was busy discovering things, talked about the fact that we had three ad platforms and we really needed to get that modernized. And at the time, I said this was a two-year process. Let me tell you what it really gives us, and by the way, as I said in my script, that's when you'll see the costs start filtering off is mid next summer. What it really means for us is a lot more speed and flexibility in serving up great content for our users. Now what do I mean by that? Right now, just as our products are in silos, our content is in silos. So if, for instance, Finance wants to put a news article up, if they didn't do a deal with that Finance or that news feed, they can't find that piece of data because that's owned by the front page or the newsgroup. And so everybody is out there, on their own, in each property and each property times each country, trying to get information up on the site. Equally important is, for instance, when we do these Twitter deals and Facebook deals we talk about, every property has to integrate it uniquely. So for instance, we can't just integrate Twitter across our media properties or Facebook across our media properties. Everything has to be done one-off, which is why we're doing what we're doing. So we're talking about content agility in the cloud, we're talking about just faster and more real-time information for our users, and our benefit of really sharing content around the world. The other thing that I would tell you is so important is, we are for the first time putting in a consistent video platform for the company. We have had, again, every property had a unique video platform, so we could not serve videos up in a consistent way, even in the U.S., much less anyplace else. And as I just said, video drives engagement. Video is exactly what advertisers are interested in. In fact, there's an interesting fact that a TV user is willing to watch six to seven minutes of video ads per month on a site versus an average of four minutes on it with everybody else. So getting video in a big way for us is really important. So when you ask, what are you going to see? Well, you are going to see costs coming off. You're also going to see a lot more real time and interesting content on our sites."

Where that goes in 2011 really depends on how quickly we transition onto all of the platforms and start to get more of the, if you recall the $650 million savings is broken down into $225 million of kind of the non-cash charges, which we're starting to make progress on and we'll continue to make progress on, I think, into next year some good progress. It's also broken into the other piece then is $425 million of what we used to call cash costs. So you can say 80 times four is 320. $320 million of the $425 million is this product cost. So that say $100 million delta, we're continuing to work on it and have to figure out how much of that we can do now before complete transition, how much of it takes a couple of years. There's a lot of kind of moving pieces to this, so we're not really in position to give you really good numbers for next year yet, but we'll continue to work in that direction obviously. In terms of the share repurchase in the first quarter, we've said that we want to offset dilution of our equity programs. We made some great progress on our equity program expense, obviously, this quarter. Some of which is just pure accounting tailwinds for us as earlier years at much higher volatility rates and share price rates kind of roll off from the expense statement. So a lot of it is a lot of discipline on our part, too, in getting better on awarding people with stock-based compensation in more targeted ways. So that has come down. But nevertheless, we are committed to continuing to offset that dilution. I wouldn't say necessarily in what quarter over any one year. I mean what you saw in the first quarter is we had a great opportunity to buy the stock at prices that we thought were terrific. It represented our long-term value. I mean we bought them at $15.54, if you recall from the script. So that felt like the right thing to do. We're always going to be looking opportunistically to buyback stock where we see a great deal.

Hello, everybody, and thanks for joining us this afternoon. Today we'll talk about the quarter and our financial results in detail, address some topics of interest, including the Display and Search Ad Market, the implementation of our Search agreement with Microsoft and an update on the investments. And of course, we're happy to answer your questions.
First, let's talk about Q1. The economy continues to improve. We delivered what I call a solid quarter. Revenues stabilized and profits were up. The headline news is that Display Advertising grew 20% year-over-year ahead of the market. More importantly, guaranteed Display grew by 24% as large advertisers came back. That means their purse strings are starting to loosen up. A lot of them have been lying dormant or only doing the minimum. And as the economy does better, they're reemerging to aggressively position their brands online. As the market leader in Display, we're well-positioned to benefit from this trend.
After Search, we told you last quarter that we really intensified our focus and efforts around Search volume. These efforts, such as Marketing Search on and off the Yahoo! network, new toolbar and browser offers and Search integration, across our properties have paid off. As a result, I'm very pleased to report that we've stabilized our Search share and believe that we'll trend up in Q2.
And of course, due to regulatory clearance this quarter, we have more tangible information to share with you on the Microsoft transition. One last thing before I turn it over to Tim, on a directional note, we've started doing some really forward thinking and creative things on the Advertising side. They have our sales team, agencies and advertisers really energized. We're already seeing some of these initiatives help us engage with advertisers on a whole new level. I'll talk about this and more, but first, Tim will cover the financials. Tim?"

Today, I'll review first quarter financial perf",1909,"Thanks, Carol. Total revenue landed roughly 2% shy of the midpoint of our outlook. This quarter we made important strides across a wide variety of areas impacting both our income statement and balance sheet. Today, I'll review first quarter financial performance in detail, provide our second quarter outlook and additionally, outline our full-year expectations for the extensive impact of the Microsoft Search Alliance.
I'll begin with a summary of our headline metrics, revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. These numbers were affected by a couple of large items this quarter, namely, Microsoft reimbursements related to our Search Alliance and the sale of Zimbra, which I'll separate out for you.
GAAP revenue of $1,597,000,000 grew by 1% year-over-year. The first growth we've registered since 3Q '08. Operating income of $188 million grew by an impressive 87%, aided by two reimbursements from Microsoft, $35 million of Search operating expense reimbursements and $43 million in net transition cost reimbursements. Neither of these reimbursements was included in the outlook we provided in January, and we believe you should treat these reimbursements as two separate annuity items.
Let me provide a bit more color there. The $35 million for Search operating expenses represents the initial step on the path to the long-term cost savings we anticipate as a result of the Alliance. So the favorability is an ongoing piece of our cost structure. The $43 million on the other hand, relates to reimbursement of transition expenses incurred in 2009. That amount should be treated as nonrecurring.
Excluding the nonrecurring item, operating income was $145 million, up 44% year-over-year with operating margin expansion to 9%. This result is the first tangible financial benefit of the Search Alliance.
Turning to earnings. The $0.22 per diluted share we reported included $0.07 of unusual items, primarily $0.05 from the sale of Zimbra and $0.02 from the nonrecurring transition reimbursement I just discussed. Excluding those items, EPS of $0.58 per diluted share was up 77% year-over-year, due to cost structure and tax rate improvements.
I'll return to the impact of the Search Alliance in more detail later. But with that, at high-level background, let's start at the top of the P&L then walk through the results in more detail, beginning with our O&O Display revenue. O&O Display registered very solid, 20% year-over-year growth. We saw particular strength in guaranteed placements, with revenue up 24% on strong double-digit yield improvements versus last year. Non-guaranteed revenue grew modestly compared to 2009 on lower impressions offset by better yield.
With an improving economy, we're seeing demand shift from non-guaranteed placements to guaranteed, as expected. Geographically speaking, all regions grew versus prior year with North America and Asia up strong double digits. Our latest international acquisition, Maktoob, performed in line with the plan. Finally, with respect to category performance, seven of 10 industry segments rose versus last year and three were roughly flat. The improvement was broad-based, led by retail, travel, autos and CPG. O&O Search was more of a mixed story for the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue declined 14%, driven mostly by lower RPS. We're pleased however, that the RPS trajectory improved sequentially for the second straight quarter, led by 2% growth in the U.S. That's particularly significant, given that the December quarter is traditionally the strongest for monetization, typically followed by lower 1Q. From a category perspective, half of our industry segments were flat to up and half were down versus last year. We saw particular strength in CPG Telecom and weakness in Finance.
Our global Search volume grew slightly on a sequential basis and by 7.5% year-over-year. For the U.S. perspective, while we underperformed the market in January and February, our share stabilized in March. As Carol noted, we're aggressively working on a combination of product enhancements, Search-related marketing spend and perhaps most importantly, harnessing the power of the Yahoo! network as a search distribution channel. As a result of these efforts, we believe our Search query share has bottomed and will begin to trend upward in the second quarter.
Moving to our affiliate business. Results there were up 7% compared to prior-year, primarily driven by currency gains and the dollar affiliate win back we discussed on our January call. Rounding out the top line results, our Listing Speed and Leads businesses registered a decline of 12%, with the biggest impact coming from the shifts in our broadband relationships, which have moved from being fee-driven to advertising-driven.
Turning now to cost. As you heard in my opening remarks, this quarter's results obviously had some puts and takes to them, so I'll discuss each element to ensure clarity. First, traffic acquisition costs were 29.2% of revenue, just a touch above the high end of our projected range. For the quarter, total expenses, including both cost of revenue and operating expenses grew $1,409,000,000. Excluding TAC of $467 million, our expenses were $942 million, down 11% from prior-year. As previously noted, our expenses benefited by $78 million related to Search Alliance. 
I'll take a moment now to explain the two components I mentioned earlier, the $43 million in net transition reimbursements and the $35 million in Search operating reimbursements in more detail.
Slide 14 in the earnings presentation may also help.
Looking first at the transition cost element, recall that Microsoft agreed to pay us up to $150 million to help defray the costs associated with our transition to their systems. Each of these costs is unique to entering into the Alliance, costs like legal fees, retention, engineering, consulting, training and more. All direct in incremental costs related to getting our Search to ultimately be powered by Microsoft. If you think of the $150 million as a declining balance, this quarter we billed $43 million of 2009 costs and $24 million of 1Q 2010 cost against it. In other words, we've used up $57  million and there's $83 million left. For the remainder of 2010, the transition costs we incur each quarter should roughly wash with the transition reimbursement billings. But you shouldn't impact to our P&L.
Now I'll move to the $35 million in operating reimbursements. If we receive regulatory clearance and began implementation on February 23, Microsoft has been responsible for the cost of running our paid and algorithmic Search platforms. Until we move to their systems, Microsoft will be reimbursing us for specific Search operating expenses. As you build your own financial projections, understand that the $35 million represents the first evidence of the ongoing savings we anticipate with executing the Search Alliance. 
Finally, let's put the Microsoft-related items aside. Our underlying expenses were about $45 million payroll to guidance. Roughly $13 million of that includes spending efficiencies, and the remainder is primarily attributable to stock-based compensation, while share price and forfeitures were favorable to our original estimates. Continuing down the income statement, I already touched on the ongoing operating income of $145 million, up 44% from 2009. I'd briefly add that 9% operating margin on GAAP revenue is a three-point improvement from last year's 6% margin. As you'll recall, we are committed to expanding margins to 15% to 20% by 2012.
Below operating income, we had two other notable contributors to our net income and EPS. First, our sale of Zimbra generated a $66 million pretax gain. We had sufficient capital losses to offset that capital gain for the full $66 million sell-through to net income with no tax impact. Second, we took the benefit of certain tax advantage transactions this quarter that lowered our effective tax rate. I'll return to this topic in a moment, when I've updated our full-year tax rate expectations.
Before moving to the second quarter outlook, let's take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable bank securities ended the quarter at roughly $4.2 billion. During the quarter, we picked up the pace of our stock repurchases significantly, buying 24.8 million shares at an average price of $15.54 per share, for a total of about $385 million. Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly $144 million. While this result was lower than implied by our operating income results, over $100 million of accrued Microsoft reimbursements were not actually received as cash within the quarter.
CapEx was $113 million for the quarter due to a pickup in a typical data server and other equipment purchases. Finally, as of March 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake at Alibaba.com was $10.4 billion or approximately $7.35 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group's privately held businesses.
Now let's look at our outlook for second quarter. On the top line, we see revenue in the range of $1,600,000,000 to $1,680,000 million. At the midpoint of this range represents roughly 4% growth compared to second quarter 2009. Traffic acquisition costs should be roughly 29.5% of revenue. Our total expenses less tax are expected to be in the range of $970 million to $990 million including D&A and stock-based compensation expense of roughly $225 million. These ranges yield an operating income outlook of roughly $155 million to $195 million, up 130% at the midpoint versus 2Q '09 for about 24% excluding the $65 million restructuring charge we took last year.
Taxes for the quarter should return to the 35% to 40% range and ultimately drop to 25% to 30% for the full year.
Before leaving second quarter, let's be sure that everyone understands the cost component of our guidance. Most notably, the total impact of the Search Alliance will be roughly the same in 2Q as it was in 1Q. The total Search Alliance benefit in the first quarter was $78 million, with $43 million of nonrecurring transition cost pickup. In 2Q, we won't have that $43 million, but we will have a full quarter of the ongoing Search operating reimbursements, which we anticipate to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million. Therefore, excluding the Microsoft impact from both quarters, our costs are expected to be up approximately $40 million sequentially. The biggest drivers of the additional spending are salary increases, Search advertising and seasonal marketing costs.
We intend to stick with our practice of providing only quarterly guidance for revenue and operating income this year, but since there are so many ins and outs to our 2010 expenses, we'd like to provide more insight regarding the full year view. This year, we anticipate our total expenses less tax to be in the range of $3,850,000,000 to $3,925,000,000 including roughly $880 million to $900 million of D&A in stock-based comp. At the midpoint of this range, expenses will therefore be down about 10% versus 2009. Excluding TAC D&A and stock-based comp, our core spending will be roughly flat with 2009. As a final note, comparing our 2010 cost structure to that of 2008, total expenses less TAC and goodwill impairment are down approximately 20% over the two-year period.
I realize that's a lot of data to digest, so thanks for staying with me on it. Before turning the call back to Carol, I'd just like take things up a little for a moment. Our underlying business performance is clearly improving. Our revenue is returning to year-over-year growth led by Display. We're transforming our cost structure to support our growth and profitability objectives, and our earnings metrics are showing substantial gains versus last year. And now back to Carol."

First up, the Ad Market. As I mentioned earlier, the Display market is coming back. With this comeback, the quality of advertisers is on the rise, and that means the quality of ads are also up.
These advertisers are looking for new, creative ways to get in front of consumers. In response, we're talking about -- we were taking what were ad hoc prophecies in the past and putting real business prophecies around them. This includes packaging and marketing our Ad solutions in a really differentiated way. We're talking to advertisers about taking the digital canvas we own and doing something unique and creative with it, something that engages consumers on another level. And then merging it with our science that keeps getting better with our targeting, deep consumer insight and tools that use these insights to optimize performance in realtime.
We've been actively promoting our position in the marketplace with what we like to call the power of three: science, art and scale. You see, only Yahoo! offers all the pieces needed for great online advertising today. The science to understand in targeting audience, the art to create lasting engagements with consumers through contests and the scale to reach the right person in the right setting in meaningful numbers.
Nobody's taking advantage of this new approach better than one of our biggest advertisers, Wal-Mart. They wanted moms to know that Wal-Mart is the best resource for making life easier. And they wanted to reach moms wherever they are, in-store and online. We already knew where moms where on the web, so it's easy for us to develop a custom marketing plan to deliver Wal-Mart's messages across the Yahoo! network. This is Wal-Mart's single biggest digital advertising initiative to date, in terms of dollar, sale, creativity, you name it. It's huge.
Each month, Yahoo! will help Wal-Mart reach an estimated 23 million moms, an average of 5.6 times. Put another way, more than seven out of 10. Listen to that. Seven out of 10 online moms will see this marketing message in an average month. Wal-Mart's been very impressed. Now I'd like to talk for a moment about Search.
I don't think it's any secret that for the past 18 to 24 months, we've had a tough road to hold [ph] (22:34) in Search. And it was definitely a sugar low after we announced the Microsoft Search Alliance last year. We had a lot of work to do internally, to get ready for it. And we weren't aggressive enough on volume, even though we were focusing on improving RPS. But all of that is past now. We believe Search here has bottomed and will trend up in the second quarter, thanks to our work to grow volume. A key part of these efforts has been using the power of the Yahoo! network, not just externally but internally as well.
Our chains are now integrated and aligned around our goals, and I can tell you that in addition to Display, there's a renewed energy among Yahoo!'s around Search. We're really excited about our product plan.
And that also includes work to improve relevance in our ROI for advertisers, that will continue until the transition to Microsoft is complete. Speaking of Microsoft, we're deep into detailed planning to ensure we transition users, advertisers and publishers with quality. Our aim is a high-quality transition starting with the U.S. prior to the 2010 holiday season. Both companies are very engaged in this process, and there's a lot of work to do. Remember, it's all about providing the best product to users, advertisers and publishers. And we'll only begin the transition when we're absolutely ready.
Tim already walked you through the financials around the Microsoft Search Alliance and how we plan to use some of the cost savings to reinvest back in the company. Hopefully, these plans come as no surprise. A year ago on this call, I talked about major initiatives we had planned to better position Yahoo!. And I really want to re-emphasize where we're putting our dollars: First, on investment, to globalize, modernize and improve our consumer products; and second, our efforts to improve the Advertising experience and Ad serving and modernization platforms. As I said then, that first initiative is a two-year effort. We're right in the middle of the process of modernizing our platforms, and we won't see these costs begin to fall until the summer of next year. The idea to develop platforms in the cloud, where we can quickly retrieve content and put it anywhere on any property in the world. And of course, that gives us greater scale and efficiency.
On the second initiative, we're continuing to enhance our Ad platform. The latest release allows for improvements in forecasting and delivering management to drive better accuracy and yield. We also deployed the next generation of our behavioral targeting capabilities and we're experimenting with yield optimization across guaranteed and non-guaranteed marketplaces. Look for us to roll off our two old ad platforms to this latest release of apps over the next 18 months, first in the U.S. then in the international markets.
We anticipate that all of the investments I just mentioned will run a couple hundred million dollars this year. If you remember back when we talked to you about the efficiencies and rationale behind the Microsoft Search Alliance, this is where the reinvestments we discussed are going. 
I want to discuss another item. A nasty interest people seem to have around executive transitions. To be honest, it's borderline strange, the obsession some of these folks have. What surprises me is all the great people we're attracting seem to get less attention. I mentioned last quarter, we hired Shashi Seth, an expert in the search industry, to lead our efforts around Search. And of course, we've just announced our new Chief Product Officer, Blake Irving. Blake brings large-scale internet experience, most recently with Microsoft as Corporate VP of their Windows Live platform group. Blake will lead our talented team and is responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of our global consumer and advertising products.
I'd also like to take a moment to thank Ari Balogh, who's been our CTO and Head of Products. Ari's been instrumental in our product initiative, and we wish him all the best and safe travel.
Let's move on to discuss some of our user highlights from the quarter. I know a lot of you turned in to our Olympic coverage in February, and we are so pleased as you are with our performance. We wrapped up 70% more users and logged 40% more timestamps than NBC's online Olympic's coverage. And we didn't pay a cent for broadcast rights. We've always been focused on specific events like the Olympics. Not just as short-term traffic drivers but also as ways to drive users into the Yahoo! experience and more deeply engage with them over time. Yet, we know we can't run a business just waiting for major sporting events, award shows and natural disasters. In earlier quarters, you heard me mention that we need to attract these types of audiences everyday. That's why we've been using our unique approach of combining human editors to choose great stories and letting our content optimization engine determine the best content for our users. 
I want to talk with this topic engine for a second, because it's an amazing technology that has been growing more and more advanced over the last several months. In its first generation, our content optimization engine recommended the most popular news items to our users. The result was a 100% click-through rate increase over time. In January, we introduced release two of the engine, which included some of our behavioral targeting technology. This capability, coupled of course with great content, led our today module to experience click-through rates 160% over pre-engine implementation. 
Our large and engaged audience is also an important reason why our content partners choose to work with us. Case in point, this past quarter, Yahoo! Sports scored an inclusive deal with Major League Baseball to become the league's official Fantasy Baseball game. And while we're on the subject of Sports, we also made an important acquisition with Citizen Sports. They create popular games for the iPhone, Android, Facebook and more. In fact, their Sportacular iPhone app is ranked in the top 20 for sport and is highly rated by users. Citizen Sports brings to Yahoo! a combination of mobile, social and interactive experience that will begin with our sports properties, but will then be incorporated to really jazz up our other media sites. Look for us to remain focused on acquisitions like this that improve the Yahoo! experience.
Elsewhere on the social front, we entered into a global partnership to integrate Twitter's realtime social experiences throughout Yahoo!'s global network, not just in Search but on our Homepage and all of our media properties, too. And you know, we're also increasing the level of integration with Facebook, allowing users to update their Yahoo! social and Facebook status at the same time. These kind of integrations are important to us. While we're not a social network, social interactions are becoming increasingly important to everything we do. Just look at what happened when we recently introduced comments on our news stories. Two weeks after launching the feature, we have more than 60,000 comments on just one article. It's an amazing example of how our users want to interact on our network.
On the Mobile side, we signed a major Mobile Search and Search advertising deal with Telefónica in Europe. We also released the trio of new apps, Yahoo! Sketch and Search and Yahoo! Search for the iPhone. And we were one of the first apps on the iPad with Yahoo! Entertainment. All of these apps have gotten great reviews from users and have been ranked highly in their respective categories. And just lastly, we launched a product from our video partnership with Reveille. The show called, Who Knew? is sponsored by Toyota and runs on Yahoo! News. Already, it's a proven success. On its second day, it hit one million streams. That's an insanely high number in the world of online original programming for a show that just launched. Now all of our key verticals: Sports, News, Finance, Entertainment have sponsored video programs. We've been doing a lot of these programs on our own out of a closet in Santa Monica, but now we have producers and there are agencies like Reveille coming over the transom to work with us. 
Consumers love these videos, and they're in very high demand with advertisers because they command consumer attention in a much more impactful way. By the way, that means not just higher ROI for advertisers, but premium pricing for us. Look for more of these original, low-cost, highly-relevant video snacks from us in the future.  
These branded entertainment partnerships are just one example of how we're using our unique combination of science, art and scale to improve the importance and outcomes of online advertising. We're constantly finding new ways to go to market with advertisers to help them shift their budgets online. Toyota and Wal-Mart are just two examples. Look for us to launch new ad experiences around cooking, travel and more in the future. 
It's all about creating a new approach to help advertisers with the biggest challenges they share with us. One, they want to shift more budget to where consumers are online. They want to stand out  and be creative in how they reach consumers. And they want a Yahoo! that's easier and meets their needs. 
We recently took on a challenge that faced the Pharma industry, how to use interactive online video to brand their products while at the same time meeting FDA legal requirements. So we developed a compelling new ad unit for the industry called an enhanced, interactive ad. And we're doing it at a scale that only Yahoo! can deliver. We just launched this, and already we're getting great feedback. Last week, a huge Pharma advertiser told us that this new ad unit now gives them the justification to move a significant amount of TV dollars online. And that's just scratching the surface. 
We're now innovating at a much more rapid pace. In the last three weeks alone, we've created multiple new ad units that have major retailers and auto manufacturers excited to use our network to reach their target audience. And this isn't just talk. Just this week, Yahoo! ranked first in a survey about value for the investments among online media. The survey, conducted by Jack Myers of Media Business Report, puts us ahead of Google, AOL, MSN and everyone else.
Before I close, I'd like to draw your attention to a significant event that occurred on March 2, Yahoo!'s 15th birthday. We have come a long way from our humble beginnings in a trailer at Stanford to our more than 600 million users today. And while many major sites have come and gone on the Web, we're still here and thriving. Yahoo! is important to a huge consumer audience and a key ingredient in many, many media plan. We're looked to for innovation and leadership within the digital space, not many other Internet companies can say that. 
And while I've only been here a little more than a year out of those 15, I can guarantee that we have much, much more in store. We're excited about it, and it's why I'd like to remind you to join us for our upcoming Investor Day on May 26 at the San Jose Fairmont. 
So with that, let's bring this part of the call to a close. As you come away from today, I'd like you to remember at least three important things. One, we're hard at work executing the Microsoft Search Alliance. Two, we're investing for growth and efficiency. And three, we are leaders in online advertising as evidenced by a meaningful 20% growth year-over-year in our display performance. 
Now let's open up the call to your questions. Operator?"

Engagement's really flopped around a lot by mail engagement, which when it just hiccups a little bit, it moves the whole company around. But when you talk about how to get it up, we're focusing a lot on this and this is everything from having more interactivity on our sites through comments and voting and buzzing, video, real-time content, better targeting. Because if we target better, people will stay engaged. For instance, on my home page, I see something different than Tim does. He gets Sports, I'm right now getting diet recipes, which is irritating me a little bit. I don't know why they targeted that, but the point of the matter is better targeting, more video, more interactivity, these are things we're working on because these things really affect engagement."

But after the second straight quarter, as I said in my script, it's up in terms of sequential growth. So from fourth quarter to first quarter, most notably up 2%. We feel like we're doing a really good job on RPS, put in a lot of improvements in the fourth quarter that I think contributed, if I remember the numbers correctly, 8% sequential growth then. So we feel like that's on a pretty good trajectory. As far as large advertisers becoming smarter about, the different ways they buy and then the key words, I'd say -- I don't know that we've seen anything like that, certainly not as a contributor to RPS."

I mean, we were able to -- for the last few quarters, we have certain tax advantage transactions that, depending on factual circumstances you put up reserves against. And as those facts and circumstances change, you release reserves. So some of these transactions we're able to release reserves this quarter, so in classic kind of tax language, that's a discrete item as was the fact that Zimbra fell through the bottom line without tax, because we had sufficient capital losses on our balance sheet to offset the capital gains. So that's kind of what happened with first quarter. If you take out, versus the guidance the normalized rate was in the low 20s versus guidance of 35% to 40%. So there was probably $28 million aside from Zimbra that you could tag to the discrete item. In terms of total year being down in the 25% to 30% range, essentially what you see is 18% from first quarter, 35% to 40% in the second quarter. That puts the half at roughly 25%, if you do the math. And so what we're implying then is the second half will also be kind of maybe a little bit north of that, maybe as high as 30%. You put them together you get 25% to 30%. So what we're doing is we're working on a number of items, discrete items, yes, there could be more discrete items. But the things that are more interesting to me are the structural items. Just changing the ongoing baseline tax rate for our company, and I would say that we probably need, from a typical baseline that people think about in the low 40s, we probably need five or maybe a little more than five-points progress there. And we're continuing to kind of bash away at that. In terms of your second question on results, with O&O flat, what ended up happening is we saw some good strength in Display, basically as expected. Search was a little bit weaker than we expected, primarily based on volume. I think, and from what I've read anyway, the whole market was a little bit slower paced in the first quarter than we had anticipated. So even though we stayed a little bit underperformed the market in January and February, shares stabilized in March, but for the whole industry, from what I've read, the volume query growth was no great shape. So that was definitely part of it. And then, of course, Affiliates picked up a little bit to obscure some of that miss, and that's basically kind of the math on it. Next question, please."

I think it was exactly this call a year ago when I talked about globalization and product silos and so forth, and maybe a few months after that as I was busy discovering things, talked about the fact that we had three ad platforms and we really needed to get that modernized. And at the time, I said this was a two-year process. Let me tell you what it really gives us, and by the way, as I said in my script, that's when you'll see the costs start filtering off is mid next summer. What it really means for us is a lot more speed and flexibility in serving up great content for our users. Now what do I mean by that? Right now, just as our products are in silos, our content is in silos. So if, for instance, Finance wants to put a news article up, if they didn't do a deal with that Finance or that news feed, they can't find that piece of data because that's owned by the front page or the newsgroup. And so everybody is out there, on their own, in each property and each property times each country, trying to get information up on the site. Equally important is, for instance, when we do these Twitter deals and Facebook deals we talk about, every property has to integrate it uniquely. So for instance, we can't just integrate Twitter across our media properties or Facebook across our media properties. Everything has to be done one-off, which is why we're doing what we're doing. So we're talking about content agility in the cloud, we're talking about just faster and more real-time information for our users, and our benefit of really sharing content around the world. The other thing I would tell you is so important is, we are for the first time putting in a consistent video platform for the company. We have had, again, every property had a unique video platform, so we could not serve videos up in a consistent way, even in the U.S., much less anyplace else. And as I just said, video drives engagement. Video is exactly what advertisers are interested in. In fact, there's an interesting fact that a TV user is willing to watch six to seven minutes of video ads per month on a site versus an average of four minutes on it with everybody else. So getting video in a big way for us is really important. So when you ask, what are you going to see? Well, you are going to see costs coming off. You're also going to see a lot more real time and interesting content on our sites."

It's a great way to play the Chinese market, the management team there is fantastic. They've got a great position. We're very have to be part of that. We think that that'll be worth much more again as we go forward here. So really, not a whole bunch we can do, especially when you talk about the private parts of Alibaba Group.

Where that goes in 2011 really depends on how quickly we transition onto all of the platforms and start to get more of the, if you recall the $650 million savings is broken down into $225 million of kind of the non-cash charges, which we're starting to make progress on and we'll continue to make progress on, I think, into next year some good progress. It's also broken into the other piece then is $425 million of what we used to call cash costs. So you can say 80 times four is 320. $320 million of the $425 million is this product cost. So that say $100 million delta, we're continuing to work on it and have to figure out how much of that we can do now before complete transition, how much of it takes a couple of years. There's a lot of kind of moving pieces to this, so we're not really in position to give you really good numbers for next year yet, but we'll continue to work in that direction obviously. In terms of the share repurchase in the first quarter, we've said that we want to offset dilution of our equity programs. We made some great progress on our equity program expense, obviously, this quarter. Some of which is just pure accounting tailwinds for us as earlier years at much higher volatility rates and share price rates kind of roll off from the expense statement. So a lot of it is a lot of discipline on our part, too, in getting better on awarding people with stock-based compensation in more targeted ways. So that has come down. But nevertheless, we are committed to continuing to offset that dilution. I wouldn't say necessarily in what quarter over any one year. I mean what you saw in the first quarter is we had a great opportunity to buy the stock at prices that we thought were terrific. It represented our long-term value. I mean we bought them at $15.54, if you recall from the script. So that felt like the right thing to do. We're always going to be looking opportunistically to buyback stock where we see a great deal. I'm not obviously not going to tip our hand in terms of quarterly run rates or anything like that because I think it defeats our purpose. But you can definitely look for us to always be opportunistic in this regard. Next question, please."

Hello, everybody, and thanks for joining us this afternoon. Today we'll talk about the quarter and our financial results in detail, address some topics of interest, including the Display and Search Ad markets, the implementation of our Search Agreement with Microsoft and an update on reinvestments. And of course, we're happy to answer your questions.First, let's talk about Q1. The economy continues to improve. We delivered what I'd call a solid quarter. Revenues stabilized and profits were up. The headline news is that Display Advertising grew 20% year-over-year, ahead of the market. More importantly, guaranteed display grew by 24% as large advertisers came back. That means their purse strings are starting to loosen up. A lot of them have been lying dormant or only doing the minimum. And as the economy does better, they're re-emerging to aggressively position their brands online. As the market leader in Display, we're well-positioned to benefit from this trend.As for Search, we told you last quarter that we really intensified our focus and efforts around Search volume. These efforts, such as Marketing Search on and off the Yahoo! network, new toolbar and browser offers and Search integration across our properties have paid off. As a result, I'm very pleased to report that we've stabilized our Search share and believe it we'll trend up in Q2.And of course, due to regulatory clearance this quarter, we have more tangible information to share with you on the Microsoft transition. One last thing before I turn it over to Tim. On a directional note, we've started doing some really forward thinking and creative things on the Advertising side. They have our sales team, agencies and advertisers really energized. We're already seeing some of these initiatives help us engage with advertisers on a whole new level. I'll talk about this and more, but first, Tim will cover the financials. Tim?"

Although revenue landed roughly 2% shy of the midpoint of our outlook, this quarter we made important strides across a wide variety of areas impacting both our income statement and balance sheet. Today, I'll review first quarter financial performance in detail, provide our second quarter outlook and additionally, outline our full year expectations for the extensive impact of the Microsoft Search Alliance.I'll begin with a summary of our headline metrics, revenue, operating income and earnings per share. These numbers were affected by a couple of large items this quarter, namely, Microsoft reimbursements related to our Search Alliance and the sale of Zimbra, which I'll separate out for you.GAAP revenue of $1,597,000,000 grew by 1% year-over-year, the first growth we've registered since 3Q '08. Operating income of $188 million grew by an impressive 87%, aided by two reimbursements from Microsoft; $35 million of Search operating expense reimbursements and $43 million in net transition cost reimbursements. Neither of these reimbursements was included in the outlook we provided in January, and we believe you should treat these reimbursements as two separate and unique items.Let me provide a bit more color there. The $35 million for Search operating expenses represents the initial step on the path to the long-term cost savings we anticipate as a result of the Alliance. So the favorability is an ongoing piece of our cost structure. The $43 million, on the other hand, relates to reimbursement of transition expenses incurred in 2009. That amount should be treated as nonrecurring.Excluding the nonrecurring item, operating income was $145 million, up 44% year-over-year with operating margin expansion to 9%. This result is the first tangible financial benefit of the Search Alliance.Turning to earnings, the $0.22 per diluted share we reported included $0.07 of unusual items, primarily $0.05 from the sale of Zimbra and $0.02 from the non-recurring transition reimbursement I just discussed. Excluding those items, EPS of $0.15 per diluted share was up 77% year-over-year, due to cost structure and tax rate improvements.I'll return to the impact of the Search Alliance in more detail later. But with that as high-level background, let's start at the top of the P&L then walk through the results in more detail, beginning with our O&O Display revenue. O&O Display registered very solid, 20% year-over-year growth. We saw particular strength in guaranteed placements, with revenue up 24% on strong double-digit yield improvements versus last year. Non-guaranteed revenue grew modestly compared to 2009 on lower impressions offset by better yield.With an improving economy, we're seeing demand shift from non-guaranteed placements to guaranteed, as expected. Geographically speaking, all regions grew versus prior year with North America and Asia up strong double digits. Our latest international acquisition, Maktoob, performed in line with plan. Finally, with respect to category performance, seven of 10 industry segments rose versus last year and three were roughly flat, though the improvement was broad-based, led by retail, travel, autos and CPG. O&O Search was more of a mixed story for the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue declined at 14%, driven mostly by lower RPS. We're pleased, however, that the RPS trajectory improved sequentially for the second straight quarter, led by 2% growth in the U.S. That's particularly significant, given that the December quarter is traditionally the strongest for monetization, typically followed by lower 1Q. From a category perspective, half of our industry segments were flat to up and half were down versus last year. We saw particular strength in CPG and telecom and weakness in finance.Our Global Search volume grew slightly on a sequential basis and by 7.5% year-over-year. From a U.S. perspective, while we underperformed the market in January and February, our share stabilized in March. As Carol noted, we're aggressively working on a combination of product enhancements, Search-related marketing spend and perhaps most importantly, harnessing the power of the Yahoo! network as a search distribution channel. As a result of these efforts, we believe our Search query share has bottomed and will begin to trend upward in the second quarter.Moving to our Affiliate business, results there were up 7% compared to prior year, primarily driven by currency gains and the DOM affiliate win back we discussed on our January call. Rounding out the top-line results, our Listing Speed and Leads businesses registered a decline of 12%, with the biggest impact coming from the shifts in our broadband relationships, which have moved from being fee-driven to advertising-driven.Turning now to cost. As you heard in my opening remarks, this quarter's results obviously have some puts and takes to them, so I'll discuss each element to ensure clarity. First, traffic acquisition costs were 29.2% of revenue, just a touch above the high end of our projected range. For the quarter, total expenses, including both costs of revenue and operating expenses grew $1,409,000,000. Excluding TAC of $467 million, our expenses were $942 million, down 11% from prior year. As previously noted, our expenses benefited by $78 million related to the Search Alliance. I'll take a moment now to explain the two components I mentioned earlier, the $43 million in net transition reimbursements and the $35 million in Search operating reimbursements in more detail. Slide 14 in the earnings presentation may also help.Looking first at the transition cost element, recall that Microsoft agreed to pay us up to $150 million to help defray the costs associated with our transition to their systems. Think of these costs as unique to entering into the Alliance; costs like legal fees, retention, engineering, consulting, training and more, all direct and incremental costs related to getting our Search to ultimately be powered by Microsoft. If you think of the $150 million as a declining balance, this quarter we billed $43 million of 2009 costs and $24 million of 1Q 2010 costs against it. In other words, we've used up $67 million and there's $83 million left. For the remainder of 2010, the transition costs we incur each quarter should roughly wash with the transition reimbursement billings. But you shouldn't an impact to our P&L.Now I'll move to the $35 million in operating reimbursements. If we received regulatory clearance and began implementation on February 23, Microsoft has been responsible for the cost of running our paid and algorithmic Search platforms. Until we move to their systems, Microsoft will be reimbursing us for specific Search operating expenses. As you build your own financial projections, understand that the $35 million represents the first evidence of the ongoing savings we anticipate for executing the Search Alliance. Finally, let's put the Microsoft-related items aside. Our underlying expenses were about $45 million favorable to guidance. Roughly $13 million of that included spending efficiencies, and the remainder was primarily attributable to stock-based compensation. Both share price and forfeitures were favorable to our original estimates. Continuing down the income statement, I already touched on the ongoing operating income of $145 million, up 44% from 2009. I'd briefly add that 9% operating margin on GAAP revenue is a three-point improvement from last year's 6% margin. As you'll recall, we are committed to expanding margins to 15% to 20% by 2012.Below operating income, we had two other notable contributors to our net income and EPS. First, our sale of Zimbra generated a $66 million pretax gain. We had sufficient capital losses to offset that capital gain, so the full $66 million fell through to net income with no tax impact. Second, we took the benefit of certain tax advantage transactions this quarter that lowered our effective tax rate. I'll return to this topic in a moment, when I've updated our full-year tax rate expectations.Before moving to the second quarter outlook, let's take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable bank securities ended the quarter at roughly $4.2 billion. During the quarter, we picked up the pace of our stock repurchases significantly, buying 24.8 million shares at an average price of $15.54 per share, for a total of about $385 million. Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly $144 million. While this result was lower than implied by our operating income results, over $100 million of accrued Microsoft reimbursements were not actually received as cash within the quarter.CapEx was $113 million for the quarter due to a pickup in the typical data server and other equipment purchases. Finally, as of March 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was $10.4 billion or approximately $7.35 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group's privately held businesses.Now let's look at our outlook for second quarter. On the top line, we see revenue in the range of $1,600,000,000 to $1,680,000,000. At the midpoint of this range represents roughly 4% growth compared to second quarter of 2009. Traffic acquisition costs should be roughly 29.5% of revenue. Our total expenses less tax are expected to be in the range of $970 million to $990 million including D&A and stock-based compensation expense of roughly $225 million. These ranges yield an operating income outlook of roughly $155 million to $195 million, up 130% at the midpoint versus 2Q '09 or up 24% excluding the $65 million restructuring charge we took last year.Taxes for the quarter should return to the 35% to 40% range and ultimately drop to 25% to 30% for the full year.Before leaving second quarter, let's be sure that everyone understands the cost component of our guidance. Most notably, the total impact of the Search Alliance will be roughly the same in 2Q as it was in 1Q. The total Search Alliance benefit in first quarter was $78 million, with $43 million of nonrecurring transition cost pickup. In 2Q, we won't have that $43 million, but we will have a full quarter of the ongoing Search operating reimbursements, which we anticipate to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million. Therefore, excluding the Microsoft impact from both quarters, our costs are expected to be up approximately $40 million sequentially. The biggest drivers of the additional spending are salary increases, Search advertising and seasonal marketing costs.We intend to stick with our practice of providing only quarterly guidance for revenue and operating income this year, but since there are so many ins and outs to our 2010 expenses, we'd like to provide more insight regarding the full-year view. This year, we anticipate our total expenses less tax to be in the range of $3,850,000,000 to $3,925,000,000 including roughly $880 million to $900 million of D&A in stock-based comp. At the midpoint of this range, expenses will therefore be down about 10% versus 2009. Excluding TAC, D&A and stock-based comp, our core spending will be roughly flat with 2009. As a final note, comparing our 2010 cost structure to that of 2008, total expenses less TAC and goodwill impairment are down approximately 20% over the two-year period.I realize that's a lot of data to digest, so thanks for staying with me on it. Before turning the call back to Carol, I'd just like take things up a little for a moment. Our underlying business performance is clearly improving. Our revenue is returning to year-over-year growth led by Display, we're transforming our cost structure to support our growth and profitability objectives and our earnings metrics are showing substantial gains versus last year.

First up, the ad market. As I mentioned earlier, the Display market is coming back. With this comeback, the quality of advertisers is on the rise, and that means the quality of ads are also up.These advertisers are looking for new, creative ways to get in front of consumers. In response, we were taking what were ad hoc processes in the past and putting real business processes around them. This includes packaging and marketing our Ad solutions in a really differentiated way. We're talking to advertisers about taking the digital canvas we own and doing something unique and creative with it, something that engages consumers on another level, and then merging it with our science that keeps getting better with our targeting, deep consumer insights and tools that use these insights to optimize performance in real time.We've been actively promoting our position in the marketplace with what we like to call the power of three: science, art and scale. You see, only Yahoo! offers all the pieces needed for great online advertising today: The science to understand and target an audience; the art to create lasting engagements with consumers through context; and the scale to reach the right person in the right setting in meaningful numbers.Nobody's taking advantage of this new approach better than one of our biggest advertisers, Wal-Mart. They wanted moms to know that Wal-Mart is the best resource for making life easier. And they wanted to reach moms wherever they are, in-store and online. We already knew where moms were on the web, so it was easy for us to develop a custom marketing plan to deliver Wal-Mart's messages across the Yahoo! network. This is Wal-Mart's single biggest digital advertising initiative to date in terms of dollar, sale, creativity, you name it. It's huge.Each month, Yahoo! will help Wal-Mart reach an estimated 23 million moms an average of 5.6 times. Put another way, more than seven out of 10 -- listen to that, seven out of 10 online moms will see this marketing message in an average month. Wal-Mart's been very impressed. Now I'd like to talk for a moment about Search.I don't think it's any secret that for the past 18 to 24 months, we've had a tough road (sic) [row] to hoe in Search. And it was definitely a sugar low after we announced the Microsoft Search Alliance last year. We had a lot of work to do internally to get ready for it. And we weren't aggressive enough on volume, even though we were focusing on improving RPS. But all of that is past now. We believe Search share has bottomed and will trend up in the second quarter, thanks to our work to grow volume. A key part of these efforts has been using the power of the Yahoo! network, not just externally but internally as well.Our teams are now integrated and aligned around our goals, and I can tell you that in addition to Display, there's a renewed energy among Yahoo!s around Search. We're really excited about our product plans.And that also includes work to improve relevance in ROI for advertisers that will continue until the transition to Microsoft is complete. Speaking of Microsoft, we're deep into detailed planning to ensure we transition users, advertisers and publishers with quality. Our aim is a high-quality transition starting with the U.S. prior to the 2010 holiday season. Both companies are very engaged in this process, and there's a lot of work to do. Remember, it's all about providing the best product to users, advertisers and publishers. And we'll only begin the transition when we're absolutely ready.Tim already walked you through the financials around the Microsoft Search Alliance and how we plan to use some of the cost savings to reinvest back in the company. Hopefully, these plans come as no surprise. A year ago on this call, I talked about major initiatives we had planned to better position Yahoo!. And I really want to re-emphasize where we're putting our dollars: First, on investment, to globalize, modernize and improve our consumer products; and second, our efforts to improve the Advertising experience and Ad serving and modernization platforms. As I said then, that first initiative is a two-year effort. We're right in the middle of the process of modernizing our platforms, and we won't see these costs begin to fall until the summer of next year. The idea is to develop platforms in the cloud where we can quickly retrieve content and put it anywhere on any property in the world. And of course, that gives us greater scale and efficiencies.On the second initiative, we're continuing to enhance our Ad platform. The latest release allows for improvements in forecasting and delivery management to drive better accuracy and yield. We also deployed the next generation of our behavioral targeting capabilities and we're experimenting with yield optimization across guaranteed and non-guaranteed marketplaces. Look for us to roll off our two old ad platforms for this latest release of apps over the next 18 months, first in the U.S. then in the international markets.We anticipate that all of the investments I just mentioned will run a couple hundred million dollars this year. If you remember back when we talked to you about the efficiencies and rationale behind the Microsoft Search Alliance, this is where the reinvestments we discussed are going. I want to discuss another item; a nasty interest people seem to have around executive transitions. To be honest, it's borderline strange, the obsession some of these folks have. What surprises me is all the great people we're attracting seem to get less attention. I mentioned last quarter, we hired Shashi Seth, an expert in the search industry, to lead our efforts around Search. And of course, we just announced our new Chief Product Officer, Blake Irving. Blake brings large-scale Internet experience, most recently with Microsoft as Corporate VP of their Windows Live Platform group. Blake will lead our talented team and is responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of our global consumer and advertising products.I'd also like to take a moment to thank Ari Balogh, who's been our CTO and Head of Products. Ari's been instrumental in our product initiatives, and we wish him all the best and safe travels.Let's move on to discuss some of our user highlights from the quarter. I know a lot of you turned in to our Olympic coverage in February, and we are so pleased, as you are, with our performance. We racked up 70% more users and logged 40% more timestamps at NBC's online Olympics coverage. And we didn't pay a cent for broadcast rights. We've always been focused on specific events like the Olympics, not just as short-term traffic drivers but also as ways to drive users into the Yahoo! experience and more deeply engage with them over time. Yet we know we can't run a business just waiting for major sporting events, awards shows and natural disasters. In earlier quarters, you heard me mention that we need to attract these types of audiences every day. That's why we've been using our unique approach of combining human editors to choose great stories and letting our content optimization engine determine the best content for our users. I want to talk with this content engine for a second, because it's an amazing technology that has been growing more and more advanced over the last several months. In its first iteration, our Content Optimization Engine recommended the most popular news item to our users. The result was a 100% click-through rate increase over time. In January, we introduced release two of the Engine, which included some of our behavioral targeting technology. This capability, coupled of course with great content, led our Today module to experience click-through rates 160% over pre-engine implementation. Our large and engaged audience is also an important reason why our content partners choose to work with us. Case in point, this past quarter, Yahoo! Sports scored an exclusive deal with Major League Baseball to become the League's official Fantasy Baseball game. And while we're on the subject of Sports, we also made an important acquisition with Citizen Sports. They create popular games for the iPhone, Android, Facebook and more. In fact, their Sportacular iPhone app is ranked in the top 20 for sports and is highly rated by users. Citizen Sports brings to Yahoo! a combination of mobile, social and interactive experience that will begin with our Sports properties, but will then be incorporated to really jazz up our other media sites. Look for us to remain focused on acquisitions like these that improve the Yahoo! experience.Elsewhere on the social front, we entered into a global partnership to integrate Twitter's real-time social experiences throughout Yahoo!'s global network, not just in Search but on our Homepage and all of our media properties, too. And you know we're also increasing the level of integration with Facebook, allowing users to update their Yahoo! Social and Facebook status at the same time. These kind of integrations are important to us. While we're not a social network, social interactions are becoming increasingly important to everything we do. Just look at what happened when we recently introduced comments on our news stories. Two weeks after launching the feature, we had more than 60,000 comments on just one article. It's an amazing example of how our users want to interact on our network.On the Mobile side, we signed a major Mobile Search and Search Advertising deal with Telefónica in Europe. We also released a trio of new apps; Yahoo! Sketch-a-Search and Yahoo! Search for the iPhone. And we were one of the first apps on the iPad with Yahoo! Entertainment. All of these apps have gotten great reviews from users and have been ranked highly in their respective categories. And just last week, we launched a product from our video partnership with Reveille. The show called, ""Who Knew?"" is sponsored by Toyota and runs on Yahoo! News. Already, it's a proven success. On its second day, it hit 1 million streams. That's an insanely high number in the world of online original programming for a show that just launched. Now all of our key verticals, Sports, News, Finance, Entertainment, have sponsored video programs. We've been doing a lot of these programs on our own out of a closet in Santa Monica, but now we have producers and their agencies like Reveille coming over the transom to work with us. _______________________________________This segment does not need re-editing.Consumers love these videos, and they're in very high demand with advertisers because they command consumer attention in a much more impactful way. By the way, that means not just higher ROI for advertisers, but premium pricing for us. Look for more of these original, low-cost, highly-relevant video snacks from us in the future.  These branded entertainment partnerships are just one example of how we're using our unique combination of science, art and scale to improve the importance and outcomes of online advertising. We're constantly finding new ways to go to market with advertisers to help them shift their budgets online. Toyota and Wal-Mart are just two examples. Look for us to launch new ad experiences around cooking, travel and more in the future. It's all about creating a new approach to help advertisers with the biggest challenges they share with us. One, they want to shift more budget to where consumers are online. They want to stand out and be creative in how they reach consumers. And they want a Yahoo! that's easier and meets their needs. We recently took on a challenge that faced the Pharma industry, how to use interactive online video to brand their products while at the same time meeting FDA legal requirements. So we developed a compelling new ad unit for the industry called an enhanced, interactive ad. And we're doing it at a scale that only Yahoo! can deliver. We just launched this, and already we're getting great feedback. Last week, a huge Pharma advertiser told us that this new ad unit now gives them the justification to move a significant amount of TV dollars online. And that's just scratching the surface. We're now innovating at a much more rapid pace. In the last three weeks alone, we've created multiple new ad units that have major retailers and auto manufacturers excited to use our network to reach their target audience. And this isn't just talk. Just this week, Yahoo! ranked first in a survey about value for the investments among online media. The survey, conducted by Jack Myers of Media Business Report, puts us ahead of Google, AOL, MSN and everyone else.Before I close, I'd like to draw your attention to a significant event that occurred on March 2, Yahoo!'s 15th birthday. We have come a long way from our humble beginnings in a trailer at Stanford to our more than 600 million users today. And while many major sites have come and gone on the Web, we're still here and thriving. Yahoo! is important to a huge consumer audience and a key ingredient in many, many media plan. We're looked to for innovation and leadership within the digital space, not many other Internet companies can say that. And while I've only been here a little more than a year out of those 15, I can guarantee that we have much, much more in store. We're excited about it, and it's why I'd like to remind you to join us for our upcoming Investor Day on May 26 at the San Jose Fairmont. So with that, let's bring this part of the call to a close. As you come away from today, I'd like you to remember at least three important things. One, we're hard at work executing the Microsoft Search Alliance. Two, we're investing for growth and efficiency. And three, we are leaders in online advertising as evidenced by a meaningful 20% growth year-over-year in our display performance. Now let's open up the call to your questions. Operator?"

Engagement's really flopped around a lot by mail engagement, which when it just hiccups a little bit, it moves the whole company around. But when you talk about how to get it up, we're focusing a lot on this and this is everything from having more interactivity on our sites through comments and voting and buzzing, video, real-time content, better targeting. Because if we target better, people will stay engaged. For instance, on my home page, I see something different than Tim does. He gets Sports, I'm right now getting diet recipes, which is irritating me a little bit. I don't know why they targeted that, but the point of the matter is better targeting, more video, more interactivity, these are things we're working on because these things really affect engagement."

But after the second straight quarter, as I said in my script, it's up in terms of sequential growth. So from fourth quarter to first quarter, most notably up 2%. We feel like we're doing a really good job on RPS, put in a lot of improvements in the fourth quarter that I think contributed, if I remember the numbers correctly, 8% sequential growth then. So we feel like that's on a pretty good trajectory. As far as large advertisers becoming smarter about, the different ways they buy and then the key words, I'd say -- I don't know that we've seen anything like that, certainly not as a contributor to RPS."

I mean, we were able to -- for the last few quarters, we have certain tax advantage transactions that, depending on factual circumstances you put up reserves against. And as those facts and circumstances change, you release reserves. So some of these transactions we're able to release reserves this quarter, so in classic kind of tax language, that's a discrete item as was the fact that Zimbra fell through the bottom line without tax, because we had sufficient capital losses on our balance sheet to offset the capital gains. So that's kind of what happened with first quarter. If you take out, versus the guidance the normalized rate was in the low 20s versus guidance of 35% to 40%. So there was probably $28 million aside from Zimbra that you could tag to the discrete item. In terms of total year being down in the 25% to 30% range, essentially what you see is 18% from first quarter, 35% to 40% in the second quarter. That puts the half at roughly 25%, if you do the math. And so what we're implying then is the second half will also be kind of maybe a little bit north of that, maybe as high as 30%. You put them together you get 25% to 30%. So what we're doing is we're working on a number of items, discrete items, yes, there could be more discrete items. But the things that are more interesting to me are the structural items. Just changing the ongoing baseline tax rate for our company, and I would say that we probably need, from a typical baseline that people think about in the low 40s, we probably need five or maybe a little more than five-points progress there. And we're continuing to kind of bash away at that. In terms of your second question on results, with O&O flat, what ended up happening is we saw some good strength in Display, basically as expected. Search was a little bit weaker than we expected, primarily based on volume. I think, and from what I've read anyway, the whole market was a little bit slower paced in the first quarter than we had anticipated. So even though we stayed a little bit underperformed the market in January and February, shares stabilized in March, but for the whole industry, from what I've read, the volume query growth was no great shape. So that was definitely part of it. And then, of course, Affiliates picked up a little bit to obscure some of that miss, and that's basically kind of the math on it. Next question, please."

I think it was exactly this call a year ago when I talked about globalization and product silos and so forth, and maybe a few months after that as I was busy discovering things, talked about the fact that we had three ad platforms and we really needed to get that modernized. And at the time, I said this was a two-year process. Let me tell you what it really gives us, and by the way, as I said in my script, that's when you'll see the costs start filtering off is mid next summer. What it really means for us is a lot more speed and flexibility in serving up great content for our users. Now what do I mean by that? Right now, just as our products are in silos, our content is in silos. So if, for instance, Finance wants to put a news article up, if they didn't do a deal with that Finance or that news feed, they can't find that piece of data because that's owned by the front page or the newsgroup. And so everybody is out there, on their own, in each property and each property times each country, trying to get information up on the site. Equally important is, for instance, when we do these Twitter deals and Facebook deals we talk about, every property has to integrate it uniquely. So for instance, we can't just integrate Twitter across our media properties or Facebook across our media properties. Everything has to be done one-off, which is why we're doing what we're doing. So we're talking about content agility in the cloud, we're talking about just faster and more real-time information for our users, and our benefit of really sharing content around the world. The other thing I would tell you is so important is, we are for the first time putting in a consistent video platform for the company. We have had, again, every property had a unique video platform, so we could not serve videos up in a consistent way, even in the U.S., much less anyplace else. And as I just said, video drives engagement. Video is exactly what advertisers are interested in. In fact, there's an interesting fact that a TV user is willing to watch six to seven minutes of video ads per month on a site versus an average of four minutes on it with everybody else. So getting video in a big way for us is really important. So when you ask, what are you going to see? Well, you are going to see costs coming off. You're also going to see a lot more real time and interesting content on our sites."

In terms of monetizing the China assets, to be honest, again, we see those as a terrific, terrific investment that are becoming more and more valuable over time. It's a great way to play the Chinese market, the management team there is fantastic. They've got a great position. We're very have to be part of that.

Where that goes in 2011 really depends on how quickly we transition onto all of the platforms and start to get more of the, if you recall the $650 million savings is broken down into $225 million of kind of the non-cash charges, which we're starting to make progress on and we'll continue to make progress on, I think, into next year some good progress. It's also broken into the other piece then is $425 million of what we used to call cash costs. So you can say 80 times four is 320. $320 million of the $425 million is this product cost. So that say $100 million delta, we're continuing to work on it and have to figure out how much of that we can do now before complete transition, how much of it takes a couple of years. There's a lot of kind of moving pieces to this, so we're not really in position to give you really good numbers for next year yet, but we'll continue to work in that direction obviously. In terms of the share repurchase in the first quarter, we've said that we want to offset dilution of our equity programs. We made some great progress on our equity program expense, obviously, this quarter. Some of which is just pure accounting tailwinds for us as earlier years at much higher volatility rates and share price rates kind of roll off from the expense statement. So a lot of it is a lot of discipline on our part, too, in getting better on awarding people with stock-based compensation in more targeted ways. So that has come down. But nevertheless, we are committed to continuing to offset that dilution. I wouldn't say necessarily in what quarter over any one year. I mean what you saw in the first quarter is we had a great opportunity to buy the stock at prices that we thought were terrific. It represented our long-term value. I mean we bought them at $15.54, if you recall from the script. So that felt like the right thing to do. We're always going to be looking opportunistically to buyback stock where we see a great deal. I'm not obviously not going to tip our hand in terms of quarterly run rates or anything like that because I think it defeats our purpose. But you can definitely look for us to always be opportunistic in this regard. Next question, please."

Hello, everybody, and thanks for joining us this afternoon. Today we'll talk about the quarter and our financial results in detail, address some topics of interest, including the Display and Search Ad markets, the implementation of our Search Agreement with Microsoft and an update on reinvestments. And of course, we're happy to answer your questions.
First, let's talk about Q1. The economy continues to improve. We delivered what I'd call a solid quarter. Revenues stabilized and profits were up. The headline news is that Display Advertising grew 20% year-over-year, ahead of the market. More importantly, guaranteed display grew by 24% as large advertisers came back. That means their purse strings are starting to loosen up. A lot of them have been lying dormant or only doing the minimum. And as the economy does better, they're re-emerging to aggressively position their brands online. As the market leader in Display, we're well-positioned to benefit from this trend.
As for Search, we told you last quarter that we really intensified our focus and efforts around Search volume. These efforts, such as Marketing Search on and off the Yahoo! network, new toolbar and browser offers and Search integration across our properties have paid off. As a result, I'm very pleased to report that we've stabilized our Search share and believe it we'll trend up in Q2.
And of course, due to regulatory clearance this quarter, we have more tangible information to share with you on the Microsoft transition. One last thing before I turn it over to Tim. On a directional note, we've started doing some really forward thinking and creative things on the Advertising side. They have our sales team, agencies and advertisers really energized. We're already seeing some of these initiatives help us engage with advertisers on a whole new level. I'll talk about this and more, but first, Tim will cover the financials. Tim?"

Although revenue landed roughly 2% shy of the midpoint of our outlook, this quarter we made important strides across a wide variety of areas impacting both our income statement and balance sheet. Today, I'll review first quarter financial performance in detail, provide our second quarter outlook and additionally, outline our full year expectations for the extensive impact of the Microsoft Search Alliance.
I'll begin with a summary of our headline metrics, revenue, operating income and earnings per share. These numbers were affected by a couple of large items this quarter, namely, Microsoft reimbursements related to our Search Alliance and the sale of Zimbra, which I'll separate out for you.
GAAP revenue of $1,597,000,000 grew by 1% year-over-year, the first growth we've registered since 3Q '08. Operating income of $188 million grew by an impressive 87%, aided by two reimbursements from Microsoft; $35 million of Search operating expense reimbursements and $43 million in net transition cost reimbursements. Neither of these reimbursements was included in the outlook we provided in January, and we believe you should treat these reimbursements as two separate and unique items.
Let me provide a bit more color there. The $35 million for Search operating expenses represents the initial step on the path to the long-term cost savings we anticipate as a result of the Alliance. So the favorability is an ongoing piece of our cost structure. The $43 million, on the other hand, relates to reimbursement of transition expenses incurred in 2009. That amount should be treated as nonrecurring.
Excluding the nonrecurring item, operating income was $145 million, up 44% year-over-year with operating margin expansion to 9%. This result is the first tangible financial benefit of the Search Alliance.
Turning to earnings, the $0.22 per diluted share we reported included $0.07 of unusual items, primarily $0.05 from the sale of Zimbra and $0.02 from the non-recurring transition reimbursement I just discussed. Excluding those items, EPS of $0.15 per diluted share was up 77% year-over-year, due to cost structure and tax rate improvements.
I'll return to the impact of the Search Alliance in more detail later. But with that as high-level background, let's start at the top of the P&L then walk through the results in more detail, beginning with our O&O Display revenue. O&O Display registered very solid, 20% year-over-year growth. We saw particular strength in guaranteed placements, with revenue up 24% on strong double-digit yield improvements versus last year. Non-guaranteed revenue grew modestly compared to 2009 on lower impressions offset by better yield.
With an improving economy, we're seeing demand shift from non-guaranteed placements to guaranteed, as expected. Geographically speaking, all regions grew versus prior year with North America and Asia up strong double digits. Our latest international acquisition, Maktoob, performed in line with plan. Finally, with respect to category performance, seven of 10 industry segments rose versus last year and three were roughly flat, though the improvement was broad-based, led by retail, travel, autos and CPG. 
O&O Search was more of a mixed story for the quarter. Year-over-year, revenue declined at 14%, driven mostly by lower RPS. We're pleased, however, that the RPS trajectory improved sequentially for the second straight quarter, led by 2% growth in the U.S. That's particularly significant, given that the December quarter is traditionally the strongest for monetization, typically followed by lower 1Q. From a category perspective, half of our industry segments were flat to up and half were down versus last year. We saw particular strength in CPG and telecom and weakness in finance.
Our Global Search volume grew slightly on a sequential basis and by 7.5% year-over-year. From a U.S. perspective, while we underperformed the market in January and February, our share stabilized in March. As Carol noted, we're aggressively working on a combination of product enhancements, Search-related marketing spend and perhaps most importantly, harnessing the power of the Yahoo! network as a search distribution channel. As a result of these efforts, we believe our Search query share has bottomed and will begin to trend upward in the second quarter.
Moving to our Affiliate business, results there were up 7% compared to prior year, primarily driven by currency gains and the DOM affiliate win back we discussed on our January call. Rounding out the top-line results, our Listing Speed and Leads businesses registered a decline of 12%, with the biggest impact coming from the shifts in our broadband relationships, which have moved from being fee-driven to advertising-driven.
Turning now to cost. As you heard in my opening remarks, this quarter's results obviously have some puts and takes to them, so I'll discuss each element to ensure clarity. First, traffic acquisition costs were 29.2% of revenue, just a touch above the high end of our projected range. For the quarter, total expenses, including both costs of revenue and operating expenses grew $1,409,000,000. Excluding TAC of $467 million, our expenses were $942 million, down 11% from prior year. As previously noted, our expenses benefited by $78 million related to the Search Alliance. 
I'll take a moment now to explain the two components I mentioned earlier, the $43 million in net transition reimbursements and the $35 million in Search operating reimbursements in more detail. Slide 14 in the earnings presentation may also help.
Looking first at the transition cost element, recall that Microsoft agreed to pay us up to $150 million to help defray the costs associated with our transition to their systems. Think of these costs as unique to entering into the Alliance; costs like legal fees, retention, engineering, consulting, training and more, all direct and incremental costs related to getting our Search to ultimately be powered by Microsoft. If you think of the $150 million as a declining balance, this quarter we billed $43 million of 2009 costs and $24 million of 1Q 2010 costs against it. In other words, we've used up $67 million and there's $83 million left. For the remainder of 2010, the transition costs we incur each quarter should roughly wash with the transition reimbursement billings. But you shouldn't an impact to our P&L.
Now I'll move to the $35 million in operating reimbursements. If we received regulatory clearance and began implementation on February 23, Microsoft has been responsible for the cost of running our paid and algorithmic Search platforms. Until we move to their systems, Microsoft will be reimbursing us for specific Search operating expenses. As you build your own financial projections, understand that the $35 million represents the first evidence of the ongoing savings we anticipate for executing the Search Alliance. 
Finally, let's put the Microsoft-related items aside. Our underlying expenses were about $45 million favorable to guidance. Roughly $13 million of that included spending efficiencies, and the remainder was primarily attributable to stock-based compensation. Both share price and forfeitures were favorable to our original estimates. Continuing down the income statement, I already touched on the ongoing operating income of $145 million, up 44% from 2009. I'd briefly add that 9% operating margin on GAAP revenue is a three-point improvement from last year's 6% margin. As you'll recall, we are committed to expanding margins to 15% to 20% by 2012.
Below operating income, we had two other notable contributors to our net income and EPS. First, our sale of Zimbra generated a $66 million pretax gain. We had sufficient capital losses to offset that capital gain, so the full $66 million fell through to net income with no tax impact. Second, we took the benefit of certain tax advantage transactions this quarter that lowered our effective tax rate. I'll return to this topic in a moment, when I've updated our full-year tax rate expectations.
Before moving to the second quarter outlook, let's take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable bank securities ended the quarter at roughly $4.2 billion. During the quarter, we picked up the pace of our stock repurchases significantly, buying 24.8 million shares at an average price of $15.54 per share, for a total of about $385 million. Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly $144 million. While this result was lower than implied by our operating income results, over $100 million of accrued Microsoft reimbursements were not actually received as cash within the quarter.
CapEx was $113 million for the quarter due to a pickup in the typical data server and other equipment purchases. Finally, as of March 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was $10.4 billion or approximately $7.35 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group's privately held businesses.
Now let's look at our outlook for second quarter. On the top line, we see revenue in the range of $1,600,000,000 to $1,680,000,000. At the midpoint of this range represents roughly 4% growth compared to second quarter of 2009. Traffic acquisition costs should be roughly 29.5% of revenue. Our total expenses less tax are expected to be in the range of $970 million to $990 million including D&A and stock-based compensation expense of roughly $225 million. These ranges yield an operating income outlook of roughly $155 million to $195 million, up 130% at the midpoint versus 2Q '09 or up 24% excluding the $65 million restructuring charge we took last year.
Taxes for the quarter should return to the 35% to 40% range and ultimately drop to 25% to 30% for the full year.
Before leaving second quarter, let's be sure that everyone understands the cost component of our guidance. Most notably, the total impact of the Search Alliance will be roughly the same in 2Q as it was in 1Q. The total Search Alliance benefit in first quarter was $78 million, with $43 million of nonrecurring transition cost pickup. In 2Q, we won't have that $43 million, but we will have a full quarter of the ongoing Search operating reimbursements, which we anticipate to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million. Therefore, excluding the Microsoft impact from both quarters, our costs are expected to be up approximately $40 million sequentially. The biggest drivers of the additional spending are salary increases, Search advertising and seasonal marketing costs.
We intend to stick with our practice of providing only quarterly guidance for revenue and operating income this year, but since there are so many ins and outs to our 2010 expenses, we'd like to provide more insight regarding the full-year view. This year, we anticipate our total expenses less tax to be in the range of $3,850,000,000 to $3,925,000,000 including roughly $880 million to $900 million of D&A in stock-based comp. At the midpoint of this range, expenses will therefore be down about 10% versus 2009. Excluding TAC, D&A and stock-based comp, our core spending will be roughly flat with 2009. As a final note, comparing our 2010 cost structure to that of 2008, total expenses less TAC and goodwill impairment are down approximately 20% over the two-year period.
I realize that's a lot of data to digest, so thanks for staying with me on it. Before turning the call back to Carol, I'd just like take things up a little for a moment. Our underlying business performance is clearly improving. Our revenue is returning to year-over-year growth led by Display, we're transforming our cost structure to support our growth and profitability objectives and our earnings metrics are showing substantial gains versus last year. And now back to Carol."

First up, the ad market. As I mentioned earlier, the Display market is coming back. With this comeback, the quality of advertisers is on the rise, and that means the quality of ads are also up.
These advertisers are looking for new, creative ways to get in front of consumers. In response, we were taking what were ad hoc processes in the past and putting real business processes around them. This includes packaging and marketing our Ad solutions in a really differentiated way. We're talking to advertisers about taking the digital canvas we own and doing something unique and creative with it, something that engages consumers on another level, and then merging it with our science that keeps getting better with our targeting, deep consumer insights and tools that use these insights to optimize performance in real time.
We've been actively promoting our position in the marketplace with what we like to call the power of three: science, art and scale. You see, only Yahoo! offers all the pieces needed for great online advertising today: The science to understand and target an audience; the art to create lasting engagements with consumers through context; and the scale to reach the right person in the right setting in meaningful numbers.
Nobody's taking advantage of this new approach better than one of our biggest advertisers, Wal-Mart. They wanted moms to know that Wal-Mart is the best resource for making life easier. And they wanted to reach moms wherever they are, in-store and online. We already knew where moms were on the web, so it was easy for us to develop a custom marketing plan to deliver Wal-Mart's messages across the Yahoo! network. This is Wal-Mart's single biggest digital advertising initiative to date in terms of dollar, sale, creativity, you name it. It's huge.
Each month, Yahoo! will help Wal-Mart reach an estimated 23 million moms an average of 5.6 times. Put another way, more than seven out of 10 -- listen to that, seven out of 10 online moms will see this marketing message in an average month. Wal-Mart's been very impressed. Now I'd like to talk for a moment about Search.
I don't think it's any secret that for the past 18 to 24 months, we've had a tough road (sic) [row] to hoe in Search. And it was definitely a sugar low after we announced the Microsoft Search Alliance last year. We had a lot of work to do internally to get ready for it. And we weren't aggressive enough on volume, even though we were focusing on improving RPS. But all of that is past now. We believe Search share has bottomed and will trend up in the second quarter, thanks to our work to grow volume. A key part of these efforts has been using the power of the Yahoo! network, not just externally but internally as well.
Our teams are now integrated and aligned around our goals, and I can tell you that in addition to Display, there's a renewed energy among Yahoo!s around Search. We're really excited about our product plans.
And that also includes work to improve relevance in ROI for advertisers that will continue until the transition to Microsoft is complete. Speaking of Microsoft, we're deep into detailed planning to ensure we transition users, advertisers and publishers with quality. Our aim is a high-quality transition starting with the U.S. prior to the 2010 holiday season. Both companies are very engaged in this process, and there's a lot of work to do. Remember, it's all about providing the best product to users, advertisers and publishers. And we'll only begin the transition when we're absolutely ready.
Tim already walked you through the financials around the Microsoft Search Alliance and how we plan to use some of the cost savings to reinvest back in the company. Hopefully, these plans come as no surprise. A year ago on this call, I talked about major initiatives we had planned to better position Yahoo!. And I really want to re-emphasize where we're putting our dollars: First, on investment, to globalize, modernize and improve our consumer products; and second, our efforts to improve the Advertising experience and Ad serving and modernization platforms. As I said then, that first initiative is a two-year effort. We're right in the middle of the process of modernizing our platforms, and we won't see these costs begin to fall until the summer of next year. The idea is to develop platforms in the cloud where we can quickly retrieve content and put it anywhere on any property in the world. And of course, that gives us greater scale and efficiencies.
On the second initiative, we're continuing to enhance our Ad platform. The latest release allows for improvements in forecasting and delivery management to drive better accuracy and yield. We also deployed the next generation of our behavioral targeting capabilities and we're experimenting with yield optimization across guaranteed and non-guaranteed marketplaces. Look for us to roll off our two old ad platforms for this latest release of apps over the next 18 months, first in the U.S. then in the international markets.
We anticipate that all of the investments I just mentioned will run a couple hundred million dollars this year. If you remember back when we talked to you about the efficiencies and rationale behind the Microsoft Search Alliance, this is where the reinvestments we discussed are going. 
I want to discuss another item; a nasty interest people seem to have around executive transitions. To be honest, it's borderline strange, the obsession some of these folks have. What surprises me is all the great people we're attracting seem to get less attention. I mentioned last quarter, we hired Shashi Seth, an expert in the search industry, to lead our efforts around Search. And of course, we just announced our new Chief Product Officer, Blake Irving. Blake brings large-scale Internet experience, most recently with Microsoft as Corporate VP of their Windows Live Platform group. Blake will lead our talented team and is responsible for the vision, strategy, design and development of our global consumer and advertising products.
I'd also like to take a moment to thank Ari Balogh, who's been our CTO and Head of Products. Ari's been instrumental in our product initiatives, and we wish him all the best and safe travels.
Let's move on to discuss some of our user highlights from the quarter. I know a lot of you turned in to our Olympic coverage in February, and we are so pleased, as you are, with our performance. We racked up 70% more users and logged 40% more timestamps at NBC's online Olympics coverage. And we didn't pay a cent for broadcast rights. We've always been focused on specific events like the Olympics, not just as short-term traffic drivers but also as ways to drive users into the Yahoo! experience and more deeply engage with them over time. Yet we know we can't run a business just waiting for major sporting events, awards shows and natural disasters. In earlier quarters, you heard me mention that we need to attract these types of audiences every day. That's why we've been using our unique approach of combining human editors to choose great stories and letting our content optimization engine determine the best content for our users. 
I want to talk with this content engine for a second, because it's an amazing technology that has been growing more and more advanced over the last several months. In its first iteration, our Content Optimization Engine recommended the most popular news item to our users. The result was a 100% click-through rate increase over time. In January, we introduced release two of the Engine, which included some of our behavioral targeting technology. This capability, coupled of course with great content, led our Today module to experience click-through rates 160% over pre-engine implementation. 
Our large and engaged audience is also an important reason why our content partners choose to work with us. Case in point, this past quarter, Yahoo! Sports scored an exclusive deal with Major League Baseball to become the League's official Fantasy Baseball game. And while we're on the subject of Sports, we also made an important acquisition with Citizen Sports. They create popular games for the iPhone, Android, Facebook and more. In fact, their Sportacular iPhone app is ranked in the top 20 for sports and is highly rated by users. Citizen Sports brings to Yahoo! a combination of mobile, social and interactive experience that will begin with our Sports properties, but will then be incorporated to really jazz up our other media sites. Look for us to remain focused on acquisitions like these that improve the Yahoo! experience.
Elsewhere on the social front, we entered into a global partnership to integrate Twitter's real-time social experiences throughout Yahoo!'s global network, not just in Search but on our Homepage and all of our media properties, too. And you know we're also increasing the level of integration with Facebook, allowing users to update their Yahoo! Social and Facebook status at the same time. These kind of integrations are important to us. While we're not a social network, social interactions are becoming increasingly important to everything we do. Just look at what happened when we recently introduced comments on our news stories. Two weeks after launching the feature, we had more than 60,000 comments on just one article. It's an amazing example of how our users want to interact on our network.
On the Mobile side, we signed a major Mobile Search and Search Advertising deal with Telefónica in Europe. We also released a trio of new apps; Yahoo! Sketch-a-Search and Yahoo! Search for the iPhone. And we were one of the first apps on the iPad with Yahoo! Entertainment. All of these apps have gotten great reviews from users and have been ranked highly in their respective categories. And just last week, we launched a product from our video partnership with Reveille. The show called, ""Who Knew?"" is sponsored by Toyota and runs on Yahoo! News. Already, it's a proven success. On its second day, it hit 1 million streams. That's an insanely high number in the world of online original programming for a show that just launched. Now all of our key verticals, Sports, News, Finance, Entertainment, have sponsored video programs. We've been doing a lot of these programs on our own out of a closet in Santa Monica, but now we have producers and their agencies like Reveille coming over the transom to work with us. 
_______________________________________
This segment does not need re-editing.
Consumers love these videos, and they're in very high demand with advertisers because they command consumer attention in a much more impactful way. By the way, that means not just higher ROI for advertisers, but premium pricing for us. Look for more of these original, low-cost, highly-relevant video snacks from us in the future.  
These branded entertainment partnerships are just one example of how we're using our unique combination of science, art and scale to improve the importance and outcomes of online advertising. We're constantly finding new ways to go to market with advertisers to help them shift their budgets online. Toyota and Wal-Mart are just two examples. Look for us to launch new ad experiences around cooking, travel and more in the future. 
It's all about creating a new approach to help advertisers with the biggest challenges they share with us. One, they want to shift more budget to where consumers are online. They want to stand out and be creative in how they reach consumers. And they want a Yahoo! that's easier and meets their needs. 
We recently took on a challenge that faced the Pharma industry, how to use interactive online video to brand their products while at the same time meeting FDA legal requirements. So we developed a compelling new ad unit for the industry called an enhanced, interactive ad. And we're doing it at a scale that only Yahoo! can deliver. We just launched this, and already we're getting great feedback. Last week, a huge Pharma advertiser told us that this new ad unit now gives them the justification to move a significant amount of TV dollars online. And that's just scratching the surface. 
We're now innovating at a much more rapid pace. In the last three weeks alone, we've created multiple new ad units that have major retailers and auto manufacturers excited to use our network to reach their target audience. And this isn't just talk. Just this week, Yahoo! ranked first in a survey about value for the investments among online media. The survey, conducted by Jack Myers of Media Business Report, puts us ahead of Google, AOL, MSN and everyone else.
Before I close, I'd like to draw your attention to a significant event that occurred on March 2, Yahoo!'s 15th birthday. We have come a long way from our humble beginnings in a trailer at Stanford to our more than 600 million users today. And while many major sites have come and gone on the Web, we're still here and thriving. Yahoo! is important to a huge consumer audience and a key ingredient in many, many media plan. We're looked to for innovation and leadership within the digital space, not many other Internet companies can say that. 
And while I've only been here a little more than a year out of those 15, I can guarantee that we have much, much more in store. We're excited about it, and it's why I'd like to remind you to join us for our upcoming Investor Day on May 26 at the San Jose Fairmont. 
So with that, let's bring this part of the call to a close. As you come away from today, I'd like you to remember at least three important things. One, we're hard at work executing the Microsoft Search Alliance. Two, we're investing for growth and efficiency. And three, we are leaders in online advertising as evidenced by a meaningful 20% growth year-over-year in our display performance. 
Now let's open up the call to your questions. Operator?"

But when you talk about how to get it up, we're focusing a lot on this and this is everything from having more interactivity on our sites through comments and voting and buzzing, video, real-time content, better targeting. Because if we target better, people will stay engaged. For instance, on my home page, I see something different than Tim does. He gets Sports, I'm right now getting diet recipes, which is irritating me a little bit. I don't know why they targeted that, but the point of the matter is better targeting, more video, more interactivity, these are things we're working on because these things really affect engagement."

I mean, we were able to -- for the last few quarters, we have certain tax advantage transactions that, depending on factual circumstances you put up reserves against. And as those facts and circumstances change, you release reserves. So some of these transactions we're able to release reserves this quarter, so in classic kind of tax language, that's a discrete item as was the fact that Zimbra fell through the bottom line without tax, because we had sufficient capital losses on our balance sheet to offset the capital gains. So that's kind of what happened with first quarter. If you take out, versus the guidance the normalized rate was in the low 20s versus guidance of 35% to 40%. So there was probably $28 million aside from Zimbra that you could tag to the discrete item. In terms of total year being down in the 25% to 30% range, essentially what you see is 18% from first quarter, 35% to 40% in the second quarter. That puts the half at roughly 25%, if you do the math. And so what we're implying then is the second half will also be kind of maybe a little bit north of that, maybe as high as 30%. You put them together you get 25% to 30%. So what we're doing is we're working on a number of items, discrete items, yes, there could be more discrete items. But the things that are more interesting to me are the structural items. Just changing the ongoing baseline tax rate for our company, and I would say that we probably need, from a typical baseline that people think about in the low 40s, we probably need five or maybe a little more than five-points progress there. And we're continuing to kind of bash away at that. In terms of your second question on results, with O&O flat, what ended up happening is we saw some good strength in Display, basically as expected. Search was a little bit weaker than we expected, primarily based on volume. I think, and from what I've read anyway, the whole market was a little bit slower paced in the first quarter than we had anticipated. So even though we stayed a little bit underperformed the market in January and February, shares stabilized in March, but for the whole industry, from what I've read, the volume query growth was no great shape. So that was definitely part of it. And then, of course, Affiliates picked up a little bit to obscure some of that miss, and that's basically kind of the math on it. Next question, please."

I think it was exactly this call a year ago when I talked about globalization and product silos and so forth, and maybe a few months after that as I was busy discovering things, talked about the fact that we had three ad platforms and we really needed to get that modernized. And at the time, I said this was a two-year process. Let me tell you what it really gives us, and by the way, as I said in my script, that's when you'll see the costs start filtering off is mid next summer. What it really means for us is a lot more speed and flexibility in serving up great content for our users. Now what do I mean by that? Right now, just as our products are in silos, our content is in silos. So if, for instance, Finance wants to put a news article up, if they didn't do a deal with that Finance or that news feed, they can't find that piece of data because that's owned by the front page or the newsgroup. And so everybody is out there, on their own, in each property and each property times each country, trying to get information up on the site. Equally important is, for instance, when we do these Twitter deals and Facebook deals we talk about, every property has to integrate it uniquely. So for instance, we can't just integrate Twitter across our media properties or Facebook across our media properties. Everything has to be done one-off, which is why we're doing what we're doing. So we're talking about content agility in the cloud, we're talking about just faster and more real-time information for our users, and our benefit of really sharing content around the world. The other thing I would tell you is so important is, we are for the first time putting in a consistent video platform for the company. We have had, again, every property had a unique video platform, so we could not serve videos up in a consistent way, even in the U.S., much less anyplace else. And as I just said, video drives engagement. Video is exactly what advertisers are interested in. In fact, there's an interesting fact that a TV user is willing to watch six to seven minutes of video ads per month on a site versus an average of four minutes on it with everybody else. So getting video in a big way for us is really important. So when you ask, what are you going to see? Well, you are going to see costs coming off. You're also going to see a lot more real time and interesting content on our sites."

In terms of monetizing the China assets, to be honest, again, we see those as a terrific, terrific investment that are becoming more and more valuable over time. It's a great way to play the Chinese market, the management team there is fantastic. They've got a great position. We're very have to be part of that.

Where that goes in 2011 really depends on how quickly we transition onto all of the platforms and start to get more of the, if you recall the $650 million savings is broken down into $225 million of kind of the non-cash charges, which we're starting to make progress on and we'll continue to make progress on, I think, into next year some good progress. It's also broken into the other piece then is $425 million of what we used to call cash costs. So you can say 80 times four is 320. $320 million of the $425 million is this product cost. So that say $100 million delta, we're continuing to work on it and have to figure out how much of that we can do now before complete transition, how much of it takes a couple of years. There's a lot of kind of moving pieces to this, so we're not really in position to give you really good numbers for next year yet, but we'll continue to work in that direction obviously. In terms of the share repurchase in the first quarter, we've said that we want to offset dilution of our equity programs. We made some great progress on our equity program expense, obviously, this quarter. Some of which is just pure accounting tailwinds for us as earlier years at much higher volatility rates and share price rates kind of roll off from the expense statement. So a lot of it is a lot of discipline on our part, too, in getting better on awarding people with stock-based compensation in more targeted ways. So that has come down. But nevertheless, we are committed to continuing to offset that dilution. I wouldn't say necessarily in what quarter over any one year. I mean what you saw in the first quarter is we had a great opportunity to buy the stock at prices that we thought were terrific. It represented our long-term value. I mean we bought them at $15.54, if you recall from the script. So that felt like the right thing to do. We're always going to be looking opportunistically to buyback stock where we see a great deal. I'm not obviously not going to tip our hand in terms of quarterly run rates or anything like that because I think it defeats our purpose. But you can definitely look for us to always be opportunistic in this regard. Next question, please."

It was great to see so many of you in person at our Investor Day. On today's call, we'll recap the recent quarter, discuss our efforts around engagement, as well as our performance in the search and display",1550,"Thanks, Marta. Hello and thanks for joining us. It was great to see so many of you in person at our Investor Day. On today's call, we'll recap the recent quarter, discuss our efforts around engagement, as well as our performance in the search and display ad market. We'll address some key milestones we've hit in our transition with the Microsoft Search Alliance, as well as what to expect next with the migration, and of course answer your questions.
So let's start with Q2. We continued to deliver on our promise to improve operating income and margins, but we were on the low end of our revenue guidance. We saw operating margins expand more than 600 basis points to 11% year-over-year, and excluding restructuring charges in 2009 and 2010, income from operations grew 32%.
So we did great on operations and controlling expenses, but why did we hit the low end of the revenue? Well, it's a combination of factors. Of course, one is FX, but the majority of the story is split evenly between the search and display marketplaces. With regard to search, we gained share in the quarter, but we didn't monetize searches as much as we expected.
On the display side, with our owned and operated sites, we saw healthy ad spending of 19%. But the second week of June, we saw demand slow down as a handful of big advertisers pulled back. There was also no last-minute spot market this quarter. We believe it was due to quarterly expense management for their companies. The first three weeks in July indicate we are back to normal. In June, we attended the world's largest ad conference, where we had numerous conversations with advertisers. It did not get the sense of a persistent problem.
Before we turn the call over to Tim to discuss the quarter in detail, I'd like to answer a question that most of you ask me. How do we measure our business?
Obviously, we watch revenue and operating margin very closely. Those are our most important metrics. We also have many internal metrics that we use to run our business and of course, we track third-party reports. While there is no one metric that captures everything, we concern ourselves our most with users and their engagement on our network. This includes how engaged are our users around our communication and social products like mail, messengers, Flickr, and Answers, how engaged are they with search, and how engaged are they with our rich and varied content sites.
So let me talk a bit about what we are doing to drive engagement. On the content side, having great content that's real-time, interesting, and entertaining is one thing, but that's not enough to ensure engagement. Users today want to go beyond words presented on the screen. They want video, they want to interact, they want a social aspect, they want it anywhere, anytime, on any device, and they want it very personally relevant and local. These are the four Os I talked about it at Investor Day; video, social, mobile, and local.
The big content move we made in Q2 was our acquisition of Associated Content. Their crowdsource approach with 380,000 contributors rounds out our content strategy. We now have an incredible resource to tap that extends our ability to provide high-quality, personally-relevant content to our users and advertisers.
Meanwhile, we also continue to make investments in our existing content and media sites. With Yahoo! News, we focus on building out a voice and identity for the site, much like we've done for sports.
We've recently established a politics and opinion team in Washington, D.C, and since then we've seen click-through rates increase up to 50% on political content. And in early July, we launched The Upshot. The blog focuses on politics, the media, and breaking news. The team behind it uses their incredible reporting skills, as well as analysis of what's trending on Yahoo! to deliver content that's designed to be relevant for our audience.
What's great about both Associated Content and new products like The Upshot is how we use Yahoo!'s unique strengths. We are pairing editorial expertise with a huge treasure trove of data on Yahoo! about users, their interests, and their intent to deliver content that we know they want and will respond to.
We also continue to build other platforms that enable us to quickly and effectively launch new properties around the globe. For instance, we've recently launched our Lifestyle site in the U.K. In its first five days, the site garnered 7.8 million page views and 2 million uniques. And after just two weeks, it's landed in the top 10 lifestyle sites for the country. I ask you, ""What other website besides Yahoo! could have such an impact in such a short amount of time""? We have plans to roll out similar sites using the same platform to France, Germany, Italy, and Spain in Q3 and look for us to follow this model in LatAm and Asia as well.
Now let's talk about those four Os. First up is social. One of the levers we are using to create engagement and distribute our great content is through social channels. Our acquisition of Citizen Sports is beginning to pay off in this area. We've already signed a number of multi-million dollar joint partnerships with major consumer-facing brands.
Fantasy Football is a big business. In this season, users will be able to like their own Fantasy team on Yahoo! and receive personalized updates about players, injuries, and advice delivered directly to their news feed on Facebook and their Yahoo! Updates, all sponsored by Miller Lite.
College football passions run deep. This season, users on Yahoo! will be able to pick who they believe is going to win and broadcast it and debate it with their friends on Facebook, sponsored by Southwest Airlines. Big brands love these unique social campaigns that allow users to engage more deeply with Yahoo! content and interact with friends and advertisers.
Speaking of Facebook, we deepened our integration with them in a big way this past quarter. Now, users who are on both Yahoo! and Facebook can link their accounts to view and share updates with friends across those networks. We call this new level of social integration Yahoo! Pulse. It's still in early innings, but so far we are encouraged by what we are seeing. The good news is users who connect their Facebook accounts with Yahoo! view more pages and spend more time on our network.
Social games are also a big engagement draw, and it's why we announced our recent partnership with Zynga. Starting in August, we will integrate Yahoo! IDs with Zynga and publish updates into Yahoo! and notifications into Yahoo! Mail. Then in Q4, we expect to begin hosting hit games like Farmville on the Yahoo! network.
Now turning to mobile, our reach continues to grow. In the U.S. alone, we've grown almost 15% quarter-over-quarter with 45 million users and a 52% reach. And we continue to release apps and form partnerships. We recently launched new Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Messenger apps for Android, as well as HTML-5-based Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! News sites for the iPhone. These new apps and sites give user a faster, more sophisticated mobile browsing experience.
We also deepened our value partnership with top handset makers Nokia and Samsung to make sure Yahoo!'s industry-leading services are front and center with their users all over the globe. Our new alliance with Nokia has the added benefit of leveraging their strength in map and navigation to enhance our products and it helps us gain access to Nokia's users in emerging markets where their phones are especially popular.
Another important content vehicle for us is video. We all know that video adoption has grown exponentially, especially now that it's easy for people to consume at their desk or on the phone, and it's a format that advertisers really like. That's why we are working hard to integrate more of it into our properties where we see video driving even more engagement for us. We are also finding more ways to monetize it. Our Front Page now points to video with pre-roll ads. And next month, the video that appears in line on the Front Page will have a new interactive ad format.
At the same time, we continue to launch more of our original sponsored video snacks and they are performing well. Early this month on Yahoo! News, we launched the Newsmakers series and already the first video in the series about Warren Buffett generated more than 2.3 million video streams.
On Yahoo! Shine, we also launched my favorite, Bikini 101 with NIVEA. It targets women who are looking to get into shape for this summer's swimsuit season. Pairing content with video is a perfect fit. This series is reaching roughly 200,000 uniques a day and it's over-delivering what we promised for page views (inaudible) by more than 60%.
Remember, all the moves that I just talked about across content, social, mobile, video, and local were made with one goal in mind; improving user engagement, and it will continue to be a major goal for us in the quarters to come.
So with that, let's hear from Tim about the quarter's financials. Tim?

Let's begin with an overview of revenue, operating income, and earnings per share, then progress to a more detailed discussion of the dynamics impacting our second quarter financial results. Before turning the call back to Carol, I'll also",1941,"Thanks, Carol. Let's begin with an overview of revenue, operating income, and earnings per share, then progress to a more detailed discussion of the dynamics impacting our second quarter financial results. Before turning the call back to Carol, I'll also provide third quarter guidance and an updated outlook for second half expenses.
Revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $1.601 billion in the second quarter. That result was roughly $40 million below the midpoint of our guidance, with $6 million attributable to adverse foreign currency movements and the remainder split roughly evenly between search and display.
Operating income was $175 million, more than doubling last year's $76 million and right at the midpoint of guidance, despite the revenue shortfall. Excluding restructuring charges from both years, operating income improved 32% versus 2009.
GAAP operating margins were 11% for second quarter, again more than double last year's rate on a reported basis and up approximately 260 basis points excluding restructuring. First half GAAP operating margins were also 11% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the $43 million first quarter Search Alliance favorability related to prior year. It's early yet, but we are clearly making progress toward our goals of 15% to 20% margins by 2012 and 18% to 24% by 2013.
Finally, EPS grew 53% year-over-year to $0.15 per diluted share. As a reminder, prior-year earnings were impacted by two largely offsetting events; a gain on the sale of our Gmarket stake and the restructuring charge referenced a few moments ago.
With that brief overview of headline metrics, let's turn now to our revenue components and begin with owned and operated display. Revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $468 million. Sequential growth registered a healthy 5% as well.
We saw good momentum for most of the quarter, but as Carol described a few moments ago, we did experience a pullback in the latter half of June by a handful of large customers. The beginning of July has returned to a more positive trend line. So the data isn't conclusive enough to draw any macro conclusions at this point.
Revenue from guaranteed placements grew 23% in second quarter. Graphical display impression volume was strong and overall yields followed suit. Non-guaranteed revenue also grew in the low-single digits.
With respect to category performance in display, revenue in five of 10 industry segments rose versus last year, with particular strength in retail, technology, and CPG. Telecom and travel were notably weak.
From a geographic perspective, display in Americas and Asia-Pac grew double digits, and EMEA grew middle-single digits. As a housekeeping note, on April 1st, we reorganized our business segments into a three-region format; Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pac. Our external disclosures now mirror the structure. The supplemental financial data in our press release contains revenue and direct cost for each region.
Turning to search, second quarter O&O search revenue was $331 million, a decline of 8% versus the prior year. Excluding our paid-inclusion ad product, which was discontinued as of January 1st, 2010, our search revenue was flat year-over-year. Query volume grew by a little more than 7%, but that was essentially offset with an equivalent decline in revenue per search.
However, it's interesting to note that RPS in each of our individual geographies was closer to flat year-over-year with the U.S. actually registering 4% growth. With lower RPS internationally and international volume growth outpacing the U.S., the mix shift brought overall RPS down.
With regard to U.S. search query share, in second quarter, we grew headline numbers as expected but fell a little short of our internal goal to improve the trajectory of monetizable searches. Nevertheless, underlying share dynamics did beginning trending upward. For instance, the reach of Yahoo! Search improved to 41% in 2Q, up nearly 150 basis points from 1Q, an increase that outpaced all of our competitors. In other words, we succeeded in leveraging our assets to induce more people to Yahoo! Search.
Consumers are engaging with search in different ways and the products and experiences we are building are evolving too. Our strength in media, content, and communications enable us to interpret user interest and intent with ever-greater precision and at massive scale regardless of whether a traditional search box is involved.
While not all of these contextual searches, as we call them, monetize at similar levels as traditional search today, over time, we believe they will. For example, the Trending Now box on our homepage is contributing three times more search volume this year than it did last year and monetization has improved materially as well. At several hundred million Trending Now searches per month, that's a big deal. Looking forward, we intend to leverage our strength in both contextual and traditional search to engage users and grow revenue.
Finally on search, from a category perspective, revenue was up year-over-year in five of our 10 industry segments. We saw particular strength in telecom, CPG, and health, and weakness in entertainment.
Moving to our affiliate business, revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $557 million. Once again, Asia-Pac, and specifically Korea, led the way. On a global basis, affiliate TAC rates finished the quarter slightly favorable to expectations.
Rounding out the top line picture, I'll now provide more color on our fees, listings, and leads revenue. These businesses performed essentially in line with our expectations for the quarter, but both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons clearly reflect the fact that we are progressing through a transition period.
Our repositioning plans fall into three categories; divestitures, outsourcing partnerships, and internal reinvestment. Zimbra and HotJobs are obviously the lines we've decided to divest. Personals, Local, and most recently, Real Estate are examples of our intent to increasingly partner with best-in-class websites to help power our offerings.
Finally, with respect to reinvestment, we are returning focus and funding to Yahoo! Small Business, Shopping, Autos, and Travel to grow these profitable businesses. While obviously unfavorable on the revenue line in the short term, collectively, these initiatives better serve our long- term growth, profitability, and strategic focus.
In total, the fees, listings, and leads businesses declined in second quarter by 19% from prior year to roughly $245 million. Given the unfavorable prior-year comparisons associated with this transition period, we expect second half performance to stay in the range of a 15% to 20% decline versus 2009.
So that's our revenue performance this quarter. Now, let's move down the income statement and discuss cost structure.
For the quarter, total expenses, including both cost of revenue and operating expenses, were $1.426 billion. Excluding TAC of $473 million, our expenses were $953 million, down 10% versus prior year. Noteworthy highlights include the following.
As we've commented in the past, we are committed to ensuring that our expense plans are consistent with our revenue environment. In order to preserve profitability this quarter, the business did a nice job across all functions to proactively moderate spending. As a result, expenses landed $27 million favorable to the midpoint of our guidance range despite incurring $10 million of restructuring cost.
Operating reimbursements from Microsoft landed at the high end of expectations, thereby contributing to the overall cost favorability. As a reminder, these reimbursements related to running our page search and algo platforms. Ultimately, as we transition in each geography, these reimbursements will begin to step down and be replaced with permanent reductions to Yahoo!'s cost structure.
In addition to the ongoing operating reimbursements, Microsoft is also responsible for up to $150 million of Yahoo!'s transition costs. This quarter, $18 million was incurred against this declining balance. These transition costs were equivalent to transition reimbursements, so the impact to our P&L was neutral this quarter as expected. Since receiving regulatory clearance, Yahoo! has been reimbursed roughly $85 million of transition cost, so $65 million remains on the $150 million commitment.
Including the income statement discussion, as previously noted, operating income landed at $175 million. Below operating income, our equity investment line grew by 51% year-over-year. Yahoo! Japan's results were the primary driver with both revenue and operating income growing by 9% in the March ending quarter. Recall that we recognized our proportional share of Yahoo! Japan's results one quarter in arrears. Finally, the Yahoo! Inc. effective tax rate was 36% for the quarter, toward the low end of our 35% to 40% guidance.
Before moving to the third quarter outlook, let's take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at roughly $3.8 billion.
During the quarter, we repurchased roughly 32 million shares for $496 million. Year-to-date, including July, we've repurchased 63 million shares for $973 million, an average price of $15.40 per share. Our 2006 share repurchase authorization has now been fully utilized. On June 24th, Yahoo!'s Board of Directors approved a new $3 billion authorization.
As I've said in the past, it remains our goal to use repurchases to offset dilution from our equity programs, but we will continue to be opportunistic as well. Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly $347 million for second quarter and $491 million for first half.
As of June 30th, our receivable balance with Microsoft related to the Search Alliance was approximately $75 million. CapEx was $190 million for the quarter, an increase of roughly $78 million from first quarter. The additional spending is primarily related to build-outs of our more efficient data center and grid infrastructure.
Finally, as of June 30th, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in alibaba.com was just over $11 billion or approximately $8 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group's privately held businesses.
Now, let's look at our outlook for third quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.570 billion to $1.650 billion. This outlook assumes roughly $15 million of adverse impact resulting from foreign currencies compared to second quarter.
Traffic acquisition costs should remain roughly 29% to 29.5% of revenue. Our total expenses less TAC are expected to be in the range of $945 million to $965 million, including D&A and stock-based compensation of roughly $215 million.
We expect transition costs related to the Search Alliance to continue to be fully offset by transition reimbursement billings and for the Search Alliance operating cost benefits to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million.
Please note, however, that as the agreed upon transfer of employees to Microsoft occurs and we move on to Microsoft's paid and algorithmic search platforms, reimbursements will begin to fall and the underlying expenses will be removed from our cost structure. These revenue and cost ranges yield an outlook of $160 million to $200 million for operating income. The midpoint expectation of $180 million would be essentially double the operating income generated in third quarter 2009.
Including third quarter guidance, we are forecasting a range of roughly 35% to 40% for our effective tax rate, but would note that we are in dialogue with the IRS over a matter that could result in a rate in the low-20% range. We'll provide an update on this effort during our October call.
Before handing the call back to Carol, I'd like to update our expectation for full year total expenses less tax. Given the second and third quarter efficiencies we are generating versus our original spending plans, we are narrowing and lowering our full-year range to $3.795 billion to $3.835 billion. The midpoint of $3.815 billion is down by roughly $70 million from what we shared with you in April. It also represents an 11% reduction compared to 2009.
And now, back to Carol.

Recapping Tim's comments on the quarter, we are pleased that revenue grew, display growth is very strong, and search is stabilizing. We've got our arms around the listing leads and fees businesses, but there is a lot of transitioning happening in those lines and it will be a few quarters before we cycle through the changes and begin to see the results from our investments. Finally, and most important, we are making great progress on growing profits and margins.
Now, I'd like to talk a bit more about the ad market. First up, let's spend a little time on display. Overall, the continued growth in display reflects that the promise we are delivering to advertisers that only Yahoo! offers a science, art, and scale needed for great online campaigns is resonating.
Let me give you an example that most of you are familiar with, the login page ad we previewed at Investor Day and rolled out in mid June. General Motors was the first to use the new format and the results were simply fantastic. Those ads for the Chevrolet Malibu, Traverse, and Equinox saw an incredible level of engagement from users and we saw it across three specific areas.
First, users who saw the Malibu login ad conducted seven times more searches for Chevrolet brand turns than those who didn't see the ad - seven times. That's a display ad of having a direct impact on search behavior. Second, the day the Malibu ad ran, we had the biggest spike in searches for Chevy Malibu we've seen all year. And third, on the day the ad ran, Malibu Make, Model, and Trim page views on Yahoo! Autos nearly doubled.
Equally as interesting, the day the ads ran for the other two models, similar Traverse page views on Yahoo! Autos were up 32% and those for Equinox were up 50%. That's what advertising is all about. The new login ad truly influenced consumer behavior to use our search or visit Yahoo! Autos for more information.
So these are great numbers and a big reason why the ads did so well is they just looked great. This kind of execution is a huge differentiator for us. We are using artful and interesting presentation to drive engagement with a brand and its product. We have a huge digital canvas that we are letting advertisers paint on and it's something no one else can do on the web.
Those ads, of course, are for big national campaigns, but we are also focused on growing the local ad market. That's why we've established a relationship with local publishers to help address their challenge of bringing more local advertising dollars online.
Last week, we announced the partnership with Gannett and their 81 local publishing organizations and 7 broadcast divisions. Gannett will now sell Yahoo! ad inventory as part of their local advertising strategy. And in doing so, they are able to take advantage of the advanced display ad targeting and ordering capabilities of our ad platform. In addition to ad revenue, there is also a nice side benefit of the partnership. We plan to feature select Gannett content across the Yahoo! network.
As for search, we remain focused on growing our search business with an emphasis on search revenue, query growth and share. As Tim mentioned, due to mix, overall search RPS was down, but we feel good that RPS was up 4% in the U.S. and year-over-year trajectory is definitely improving.
We are also getting traction in improving our search growth and as the latest June numbers for comScore show, we are gaining share. While some of the gains were organic, others were due to changes in our sites, so they would be counted correctly by comScore. I know some have been confused or even criticize this approach. What's not well understood is comScore results historically counted the same kind of activities differently on leading search engines, therefore, resulting in inaccurate competitive comparison.
The new contextual search experiences we've introduced, like slideshows for example, are not a matter of retagging something in our network and calling it search. These experiences are generated automatically using our search back-end technology and counted as a search based on user's action and intent. The result is that people love them. It's become another way for us to deliver personalization and relevance to users through search.
Meanwhile, we are looking for gains to be driven more by organic growth later this year when the result of additional efforts to drive more search volume are expected to take effect.
While we are in search, let's touch on the Search Alliance with Microsoft. Their transition is progressing well. We've already hit several significant milestones that I'd like to share with you. This past quarter, we transitioned more than 125 employees to Microsoft. We started a regular cadence of communication to our advertisers and publishers in the U.S. and Canada to help them prepare for the transition. We trained nearly 600 sales and account management Yahoos and continue to work through the feature and system enhancements for future releases across algo and paid search.
I know that the timing of the transition is a question on top of everybody's mind. The algo transition is progressing very well. In fact, we recently began internal testing on Yahoo! Search where Microsoft will power up to 25% of our algo search results in the U.S. and a smaller percentage of paid search results.
Speaking of paid, we are testing, training, and working with Microsoft to get adCenter ready to serve our advertisers. We feel good about our progress, but I want to continue to emphasize that because the holiday season is so important to our advertisers, we will not give the go-ahead for the U.S. and Canada unless we are confident of a smooth transition with quality.
Finally, I'd like to recap a few more events from the quarter before I take your questions. In case you were hiding under a rock for the past two months, the World Cup has held the globe's attention and Yahoo! has been right in the middle of it. When it comes to online coverage of the World Cup, our site was hugely successful, thanks mostly to our efforts to bring the event to users in new and innovative ways.
In addition to a special soccer channel on our network, we unveiled new shortcuts in search and launched a new Yahoo! Toolbar featuring World Cup coverage. That toolbar had more than 250,000 downloads and very high engagement. Scores and news modules received more than 50% of total clicks on the toolbar, and initial engagement showed four times more click intensity and eight times more searches per user when compared with our normal toolbar.
We also had the largest global launch of any fantasy product yet. Fans were able to play the World Cup game in 22 countries and 10 languages. This was due to the investments we made in the underlying fantasy platform, in line with what we did with the entertainment platforms that I talked about earlier.
Last but not least, we had a hit on our hands with the Yahoo! Penalty Shootout. It was a simple social contest that we created. Users played more than 2 million times for more than 11.6 million minutes. It was a great way to enhance user engagement.
In the background of all of our content and advertising efforts, we are also hard at work driving innovation around our products and technology. Late last month, we hosted our 3rd Annual Hadoop Summit, attracting more than 1,000 developers. In case you haven't heard of it, Hadoop is an open source technology we pioneered. It's also one of the most advanced software technologies in the world for crunching huge amounts of data and it's essential in processing the vast pools of data we capture in our cloud to deliver everything from display ads to content.
Hadoop is a core technology that's behind every click on Yahoo! But it's not just us. Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and the rest of those 1,000 developers I just mentioned also rely on Hadoop. And our approach to Hadoop's development has earned us a lot of admirers, not just for the huge amount of technology expertise needed to build it, but also for making it open source. Technology plays an essential part in what we do. Hadoop and the great talent we've recently added demonstrate how we are elevating science, technology, and innovation even more within the company.
So that was the quarter. Before we take your questions, I just want to reiterate what we talked about today. Our metrics around margins and operating income continue to grow, as we told you they would. We are pleased by the performance of display overall and the engagement numbers that we are seeing with our new ad formats. We made carefully orchestrated moves to deepen our focus on content and the social, mobile, video, and local levers we used to deliver it.
We remain laser-focused on the Microsoft Search Alliance and transition, plus our own efforts to improve search RPS and volume growth are trending in the right direction. And from the World Cup to our Hadoop technology, we are focused on creating industry-leading products, technologies and experiences for our users, developers, advertisers, and publishers.
With that, let's take your questions.

The interesting thing - of course, so we've been watching very carefully. In the first weeks in July, it's like it never happened. It's just back to the same run rate we've had, so - which really has us believing that's what it was. Also, we got to be able to look at the exchange, and it was definitely not a Yahoo! anomaly.

In terms of page views, I guess I'd make of couple of contextual comments. They are obviously a traditional measure of engagement on static websites, but the Internet has evolved through video streams, mobile experiences, and rich Web experiences, where engagement doesn't generate page views. So what we are trying to do is move to more of a holistic view. Page views will always still be valuable because they closely correlate with the way displays ads are sold, but improvements in ad effectiveness and ad platform technology for instance, are enabling us to grow revenue rapidly without increasing page views.
That being said, we are diving into the minus 4% we are seeing. There is more analysis to be had on this. It is honestly a little bit of surprise to see it at that level. We need to break it, for instance, between our mail, messenger, and community properties, and homepage, and the media properties, for instance, because we look for very different dynamics there.
As a proxy, I could talk a little bit about the comScore minutes for homepage and for that matter, most of our other media properties having actually a pretty nice performance. Homepage was up, in comScore minutes, 10% year-over-year. So a lot of the initiatives that Carol talked about during the call around social, mobile, local, video and certainly our content strategy, all are certainly driven to increase that engagement, whether it's a page view number that, again, we have to get a little bit smarter on, having just seen this one published or more likely minutes going forward. That's where our investments are in creating that engagement and we do think we are starting to see things pay off.
A last note on engagement is, quarter-over-quarter, if you look at the minutes, again, split off the comms properties - communications' properties, you will see the rest of the Yahoo! properties grow about 10% quarter-over-quarter. So we do think that we are starting to see traction for our investments. Next question, please?

And when you combine those two things, the multi-year view and a self-funding discipline, then what you end up getting is people not making decisions for these three-month periods, but making them for the longer term and having to actually make tradeoffs into side-on priorities, and we are getting much better at this now.
So we are generating an awful lot of opportunity within existing cost structures and finding more cost-effective ways to invest in the business like we talked about at Investor Day - more cost-effective ways to do that as you become more creative and are forced to do it.
As far as the margins go, having 10% for the first half excluding that $43 million of kind of non-recurring favorability in the first quarter related to the Search Alliance, 10% is pretty good; 11% for the second quarter, pretty good, again when we were between 5% and 6% at this time last year.

That said, there are three things that I'd call out is the end - what happened at the end part of the quarter, mostly in the second half of June unquestionably has influenced our thinking for third quarter. 3Q is always a tougher quarter to call because it always seems to come down at September. And when you see things in the second quarter, like in absence of spot buying in those last couple of weeks, it should make you incrementally more cautious.
I would note, though - the third thing that - I said this in my script, but there is about $15 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact 3Q versus 2Q. So if you go from our 16.01 in second quarter, just for easy math, just on same FX basis, that's 15.85 right away. So same basis, 15.85 up to a midpoint of 16.10, we do see growth there.

So for instance, it was very obvious always to target - find a male on Yahoo! Sports, but when we started actually doing the targeting across properties and selling across properties, we found young males on the gossip sites, we found young males on the women sites, we found them all over the place.
And so it was - once we started targeting an audience and not just assuming things, but using our technology in finer and finer ways - and it still is I think pretty growth targeting, but I mean, it's still much more than young male or young female, but where they live income levels, so on and so on, we get really great results, and therefore, higher CPM. So - and we are just at the beginning of this, Sameet. This is a real area of advantage for the company.
And since you mentioned, science, art, and scale, I think that real - I think one of the most interesting things happening in the industry right now is that not only are people - advertisers looking at Internet marketing, but they are finally understanding that it can be very unique and very interesting.
Let's face it; those first ads in those first years are just goofy. I mean, they are - the little banner ads and a couple of words. But when you think about interactivity and the beauty of like the login pages, when you think of pulling people into experience, I don't know how many of you saw a day we actually did our own takeover of the login page, we had a 3D site. There's so many things you can do now and advertisers are kind of catching - they are kind of catching that fever, if you will. I mean, that Malibu ad was just beautiful and people responded to it, and that's just the beginning of what's going to happen.

They are really very independent things and you'll be able to see because we break out depreciation, amortization, and stock-based comp away from the more traditional core spending dollars.
But - I'll say two things. First on the CapEx side, the bump was expected. We are just spending to support our infrastructure efficiency plans. I talked a lot about this at Investor Day. We are spending on our cloud infrastructure so that we can reduce our data platforms, our ad systems, our development in Q&A infrastructure massively down by two-thirds, reduce those items as we invest in the cloud. And then secondly, on the data center side, we are completely transforming our data center footprint, and that's going to result in 35% lower costs in a few years.
So those - that's the kind of stuff we are spending on, yet we are going to stay within the $600 million to $700 million range I gave for CapEx at the beginning of the year. I came out last quarter and I said, look, I think we are going to be at the low end of the range. I still think we are. All of this spending is very much in plan. But it's not a substitute or a flip-flop with OpEx. They are really pretty parallel but different paths.
Can we take one more question, please?

Again, like the mail login page demonstrated, we think that those pieces are really beginning to come into play here or fall into play.

It was great to see so many of you in person at our Investor Day. On today's call, we'll recap the recent quarter, discuss our efforts around engagement, as well as our performance in the search and display",1542,"Thanks, Marta. Hello, and thanks for joining us. It was great to see so many of you in person at our Investor Day. On today's call, we'll recap the recent quarter, discuss our efforts around engagement, as well as our performance in the search and display ad markets. We'll address some key milestones we've hit in our transition with the Microsoft Search Alliance, as well as what to expect next with the migration and of course, answer your questions.
So let's start with Q2. We continue to deliver on our promise to improve operating income and margins, but we were on the low end of our revenue guidance. We saw operating margins expand more than 600 basis points to 11% year-over-year. And excluding restructuring charges in 2009 and '10, income from operations grew 32%.
So we did great on operations and controlling expenses, but why did we hit the low end of the revenue? Well, it's a combination of factors. Of course, one is FX, but the majority of the story is split evenly between the search and display marketplaces. With regard to Search, we gained share in the quarter, but we didn't monetize searches as much as we expected. 
On the Display side with our Owned and Operated sites, we saw healthy ad spending of 19%. But the second week of June, we saw demand slow down as a handful of big advertisers pulled back. There was also no last-minute spot market this quarter. We believe it was due to quarterly expense management for their companies.
The first three weeks in July indicate we're back to normal. In June, we attended the world's largest ad conference, where we had numerous conversations with advertisers and did not get a sense of a persistent problem. Before we turn the call over to Tim to discuss the quarter in detail, I'd like to answer a question that most of you ask me, how do we measure our business? 
Obviously, we watch revenue and operating margin very closely. Those are our most important metrics. We also have many internal metrics that we use to run our business. And of course, we track third-party reports. While there's no one metric that captures everything, we concern ourselves most with users and their engagement on our network. This includes how engaged are our users around our communication and social products like Mail, Messenger, Flickr and Answers? How engaged are they with Search and how engaged are they with our rich and varied content site. 
so let me talk a bit about what we're doing to drive engagement. On the content side, having great content that's realtime, interesting and entertaining is one thing, but that's not enough to ensure engagement. Users today want to go beyond words presented on the screen. They want video, they want to interact, they want a social aspect. They want it anywhere, any time and any device. And they want it very personally relevant and local. These are the four Os I've talked about at Investor Day: video, social, mobile and local.
The big content move we made in Q2 was our acquisition of Associated Content. Their crowd sourced approach with 380,000 contributors rounds out our content strategy. We now have an incredible resource to tap that extends our ability to provide high-quality, personally relevant content to our users and advertisers. 
Meanwhile, we also continue to make investments in our existing content and media sites with Yahoo! News we're focused on building out a voice and identity for the site much like we've done for Sports. 
We recently established a politics and opinion team in Washington, D.C. And since then, we've seen click-through rates increase up to 50% on political content. And in early July, we launched the Upshot. The blog focuses on politics, the media and breaking news. The team behind it uses their incredible reporting skills, as well as analysis of what's trending on Yahoo! to deliver content that's designed to be relevant for our audience.
What's great about both Associated Content and new products like the Upshot, is how we use Yahoo!'s unique strength. We're pairing editorial expertise with the huge treasure trove of data on Yahoo! about users, their interest and their intent to deliver content that we know they want and will respond to.
We also continue to build our platforms that enable us to quickly and effectively launch new properties around the globe. For instance, we recently launched our lifestyle site in the U.K. In its first five days, five days, the site garnered 7.8 million page views and 2 million uniques. And after just two weeks it's landed in the top 10 lifestyle sites for the country. I ask you, what other website besides Yahoo!, could have such an impact in such a short amount of time. We have plans to roll out similar sites using the same platform to France, Germany, Italy and Spain in Q3 and look for us to follow this model in Lat Am and Asia as well.  
Now let's talk about those four Os. First off is social. One of the leverage we're using to create engagement and distribute our great content is through social channels. Our acquisition of Citizen Sports is beginning to pay off in this area. We've already signed a number of multimillion dollar joint partnerships with major consumer-facing brands. 
Tennessee football is big business in this season, users will be able to like their own Tennessee team on Yahoo! and receive personalized updates about players, injuries and advice delivered directly to their newsfeed on Facebook and their Yahoo! updates, all sponsored by Miller Lite. 
College football passions run deep. This season, users on Yahoo! will be able to pick who they believe is going to win and broadcast it and debate it with their friends on Facebook, sponsored by Southwest Airlines. Big brands love these unique social campaigns that allow users to engage more deeply with Yahoo! content and interact with friends and advertisers.
Speaking of Facebook, we deepened our integration with them in a big way this past quarter. Now users who are on both Yahoo! and Facebook can link their accounts to view and share updates with friends across both networks. We call this new level of social integration Yahoo! Pulse. It's still in early innings but so far, we're encouraged by what we're seeing. The good news is, users who connect their Facebook accounts with Yahoo! view more pages and spend more time on our network.
Social gains are also a big engagement draw, and that's why we announced our recent partnership with Zynga. Starting in August, we'll integrate Yahoo! IDs with Zynga and publish updates into Yahoo! and notifications into Yahoo! Mail. Then in Q4, we expect to begin hosting hit games like Farmville on the Yahoo! network.
Now turning to mobile. Our reach continues to grow. In the U.S. alone, we've grown almost 15% quarter-over-quarter, with 45 million users and a 52% reach. And we continue to release apps and form partnerships. We recently launched new Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Messenger apps for Android, as well as HTML5-based Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! News sites for the iPhone. These new apps and sites give user a faster, more sophisticated mobile browsing experience.
We also deepened our value partnership with top handset makers, Nokia and Samsung, to make sure Yahoo!'s industries-leading services are front and center, with their users all over the globe. Our new alliance with Nokia have the added benefit of leveraging their strength in maps and navigation to enhance our products. And it helps us gain access to Nokia's users in emerging markets with their phones are especially popular.
Another important content vehicle for us is video. We all know that video adoption has grown exponentially, especially now that it's easy for people to consume at their desk around the phone. And it's a format that advertisers really like. That's why we're working hard to integrate more of it into our properties, where we see video driving even more engagement for us. 
We're also finding more ways to monetize it. Our front page now points to video with free roll adds. And next month, the video that appears in line on the front page will have a new interactive ad format.
At the same time, we continue to launch more of our original sponsored video snacks and they're performing well. Early this month on Yahoo! News, we launched the Newsmaker Series and already the first video on the series, about Warren Buffett, generated more than 2.3 million video streams. 
On Yahoo! Shine, we also launched my favorite, Bikini 101 with Nivea. It targets women who are looking to get into shape for this summer swimsuit season. Pairing content with video is a perfect fit. This series is reaching roughly 200,000 uniques a day and it's over-delivering what we promised for page views to nearly by more than 60%.
Remember, all the moves that I just talked about across content, social, mobile video and local, were made with one goal in mind: improving user engagement. And it will continue to be a major goal for us in the quarters to come.
So with that, let's hear from Tim about the quarter's financials. Tim?"
91800,109056666,68000,"Yahoo! Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2010",2010-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Let's begin with an overview of revenue, operating income and earnings per share, then progress to a more detailed discussion of the dynamics impacting our second quarter financial results. Before turning the call back to Carol, I'll also p",1930,"Thanks, Carol. Let's begin with an overview of revenue, operating income and earnings per share, then progress to a more detailed discussion of the dynamics impacting our second quarter financial results. Before turning the call back to Carol, I'll also provide third quarter guidance and an updated outlook for second half expenses.
Revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $1,601,000,000 in the second quarter. That result was roughly $40 million below the midpoint of our guidance, with $6 million attributable to adverse foreign currency movements and the remainder split roughly evenly between Search and Display. 
Operating income was $175 million, more than doubling last year's $76 million and right at the midpoint of guidance despite the revenue shortfall. Excluding restructuring charges from both years, operating income improved 32% versus 2009.
GAAP operating margins were 11% for second quarter. Again, more than double last year's rate on a reported basis and up approximately 260 basis points, excluding restructuring. First half GAAP operating margins were also 11% on a reported basis and 10%, excluding the $43 million first quarter Search Alliance favorability, related to prior year.
It's early yet, but we're clearly making progress toward our goals of 15% to 20% margins by 2012 and 18% to 24% by 2013.
Finally, EPS grew 53% year-over-year to $0.15 per diluted share. As a reminder, prior-year earnings were impacted by two largely offsetting events: A gain on the sale of our Gmarket stake and the restructuring charge referenced a few moments ago.
With that brief overview of headline metrics, let's turn now to our revenue components and begin with Owned and Operated Display. Revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $468 million. Sequential growth registered a healthy 5% as well. We saw a good momentum for most of the quarter, but as Carol described a few moments ago, we did experience a pullback in the latter half of June by a handful of large customers.
The beginning of July has returned to a more positive trendline, so the data isn't conclusive enough to draw any macro conclusions at this point. Revenue from guaranteed placements grew 23% in second quarter. Graphical display impression volume was strong and overall yields followed suit. Non-guaranteed revenue also grew in the low-single digits. 
With respect to category performance in Display, revenue in five of 10 industry segments rose versus last year, with particular strength in Retail, Technology and CPG. Telecom and Travel were notably weak.
From a geographic perspective, Display in Americas and Asia Pac grew double digits. And EMEA grew middle single digits. As a housekeeping note, on April 1, we reorganized our business segments into a three-region format: Americas, EMEA and Asia Pac. Our external disclosures now mirror this structure. The supplemental financial data in our press release contains revenue and direct cost for each region.
Turning to Search. Second quarter O&O Search revenue was $331 million, a decline of 8% versus the prior year. Excluding our paid inclusion ad product, which was discontinued as of January 1, 2010, our Search revenue was flat year-over-year. 
Query volume grew by a little more than 7%, but that was essentially offset with an equivalent decline in revenue per search. However, it's interesting to note that RPS in each of our individual geographies was closer to flat year-over-year, with the U.S. actually registering 4% growth. With lower RPS internationally and international volume growth outpacing the U.S., the mixed shift brought overall RPS down.
With regard to U.S. search query share, in second quarter, we grew headline numbers as expected, but fell a little short of our internal goal to improve the trajectory of monetizable searches. Nevertheless, underlying share dynamics did begin trending upward. For instance, the reach of Yahoo! Search improved to 41% in 2Q, up nearly 150 basis points from 1Q, an increase that outpaced all of our competitors. In other words, we succeeded in leveraging our assets to induce more people to Yahoo! Search.
Consumers are engaging with Search in different ways, and the products and experiences we are building are evolving, too. Our strengths in media, content and communications enable us to interpret user interest and intent with ever-greater precision and at massive scale, regardless of whether a traditional search box is involved. While not all of these contextual searches, as we call them, monetize at similar levels as traditional search today, over time, we believe they will.
For example, the Trending Now box on our homepage is contributing three times more search volume this year than it did last year, and monetization has improved materially as well. At several hundred million Trending Now searches per month, that's a big deal. Looking forward, we intend to leverage our strength in both contextual and traditional search to engage users and grow revenue.
Finally, on Search from a category perspective, revenue was up year-over-year in five of our 10 industry segments. We saw particular strength in Telecom, CPG and Health and weakness in Entertainment.
Moving to our Affiliate business, revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $557 million. Once again, Asia Pac, and specifically Korea, led the way. On a global basis, Affiliate TAC rates finish the quarter slightly favorable to expectations. Rounding out the top line picture, I'll now provide more color on our Fees, Listings and Leads revenue.
These businesses performed essentially with line in our expectations for the quarter, but both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons clearly reflect the fact that we're progressing through a transition period. Our repositioning plans fall into three categories: divestitures, outsourcing partnerships and internal reinvestment. Zimbra and HotJobs are obviously the lines we've decided to divest. Personals, Local and most recently, Real Estate, are examples of our intent to increasingly partner with best-in-class websites to help power our offerings.
Finally, with respect to reinvestment, we're returning focus and funding to Yahoo! Small Business, Shopping, Autos, and Travel to grow these profitable businesses. While obviously unfavorable on the revenue line in the short-term, collectively these initiatives better serve our longer-term growth, profitability and strategic focus.
In total, the Fees, Listings and Leads businesses declined in second quarter by 19% from prior year to roughly $245 million. Given the unfavorable prior-year comparisons associated with this transition period, we expect second-half performance to stay in the range of a 15% to 20% decline versus 2009.
So that's our revenue performance this quarter. Now let's move down the income statement and discuss cost structure. For the quarter, total expenses, including both cost of revenue and operating expenses, were $1,426,000,000. Excluding TAC of $473 million, our expenses were $953 million, down 10% versus prior year. Noteworthy highlights include the following: As we've commented in the past, we're committed to ensuring that our expense plans are consistent with our revenue environment. In order to preserve profitability this quarter, the business did a nice job across all functions to proactively moderate spending. As a result, expenses landed $27 million favorable to the midpoint of our guidance range, despite incurring $10 million of restructuring costs.
Operating reimbursements for Microsoft landed at the high end of expectations, thereby contributing to the overall cost favorability. As a reminder, these reimbursements are related to running our paid search in algo platforms. Ultimately, as we transition in each geography, these reimbursements will begin to step down and be replaced with permanent reductions to Yahoo!'s cost structure.
In addition to the ongoing operating reimbursements, Microsoft is also responsible for up to $150 million of Yahoo!'s transition costs. This quarter, $18 million was incurred against this declining balance. These transition costs were equivalent to transition reimbursements, so the impact to our P&L was neutral this quarter as expected. Since receiving regulatory clearance, Yahoo! has been reimbursed roughly $85 million of transition costs, so $65 million remains on the $150 million commitment.
Including the income statement discussion, as previously noted, operating income landed at $175 million. Below operating income, our equity investment line grew by 51% year-over-year. Yahoo! Japan's results were the primary driver, with both revenue and operating income growing by 9% in the March-ending quarter. Recall that we recognized our proportional share of Yahoo! Japan's results one quarter in arrears. Finally, the Yahoo! Inc. effective tax rate was 36% for the quarter, toward the low end of our 35% to 40% guidance.
Before moving to the third quarter outlook, let's take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at roughly $3.8 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased roughly 32 million shares for $496 million. Year-to-date, including July, we repurchased 63 million shares for $973 million, an average price of $15.40 per share. Our 2006 share repurchase authorization has now been fully utilized. 
On June 24, Yahoo's Board of Directors approved a new $3 billion authorization. As I've said in the past, it remains our goal to use repurchases to offset dilution from our equity programs, but we will continue to be opportunistic as well.
Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly $347 million for second quarter and $491 million for first half. As of June 30, our receivable balance with Microsoft, related to the Search Alliance, was approximately $75 million. CapEx was $190 million for the quarter, an increase of roughly $78 million from first quarter. The additional spending is primarily related to buildouts of our more efficient data center and grid infrastructure.
Finally, as of June 30, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was just over $11 billion or approximately $8 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes, and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group's privately held businesses.
Now let's look at our outlook for third quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,570,000,000 to $1,650,000,000. This outlook assumes roughly $15 million of adverse impact, resulting from foreign currencies compared to second quarter. Traffic acquisition costs should remain roughly 29% to 29.5% of revenue. Our total expenses, less TAC are expected to be in the range of $945 million to $965 million, including D&A of stock-based compensation of roughly $250 million.
We expect transition costs related to the Search Alliance to continue to be fully offset by transition reimbursement billings and for the Search Alliance's operating cost benefits to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million. Please note, however, that as the agreed upon transfer of employees to Microsoft occurs and we move on to Microsoft's paid and algorithmic search platforms, reimbursements will begin to fall and the underlying expenses will be removed from our cost structure.
These revenue and cost ranges yield an outlook of $160 million to $200 million for operating income. The midpoint expectation of $180 million would be essentially double the operating income generated in third quarter 2009. Including third quarter guidance, we're forecasting a range of roughly 35% to 40% for our effective tax rate, but would note that we're in dialogue with the IRS over a matter that could result in a rate in the low 20% range. We'll provide an update on this effort during our October call.
Before handing the call back to Carol, I'd like to update our expectations for full year total expenses, less TAC. Given the second and third quarter efficiencies we're generating versus our original spending plans, we're narrowing and lowering our full year range to $3,795,000,000 to $3,835,000,000. The midpoint of $3,815,000,000 is down by roughly $70 million from what we shared with you in April, and also represents an 11% reduction compared to 2009.
And now back to Carol."

Recapping Tim's comments on the quarter, we're pleased that revenue grew, Display growth is very strong and Search is stabilizing. We've got our arms around the Listing Leads and Fees businesses, but there's a lot of transitioning happening in those lines and it'll be a few quarters before we cycle to the changes and begin to see the results from our investments. Finally and most important, we're making great progress on growing profits and margin.
Now I'd like to talk a bit more about the ad market. First off, let's spend a little time on Display. Overall, the continued growth in Display reflects that the promise we're delivering to advertisers, that only Yahoo! offers a science, art and scale needed for great online campaigns, is resonating. Let me give you an example that most of you are familiar with, the Login Page ad we previewed at Investor Day and rolled out in mid-June.
General Motors was the first to use the new format and the results were simply fantastic. Both ads for the Chevrolet Malibu, Trevor and Equinox saw an incredible level of engagement from users, and we saw it across three specific areas.
First, users who saw the Malibu login ad conducted seven times more searches for Chevrolet brand terms than those who didn't see the adds, 7x. That's a display in having a direct impact on search behavior. Second, the day the Malibu ad ran, we had the biggest spike in searches for Chevy Malibu we've seen all year. And third, on the day the ad ran, Malibu make, model and trim page views on Yahoo! Autos, nearly doubled.
Equally as interesting, the day the ads ran for the other two models, similar Trevor's pageviews on Yahoo! Autos were up 32% and those for Equinox were up 50%. That's what advertising is all about, the new login ad truly influenced consumer behavior to use our Search or visit Yahoo! Autos for more information.
So these are great numbers and a big reason why the ads did so well is they just look great. This kind of execution is a huge differentiator for us. We're using artful and interesting presentation to drive engagement with a brand and its products. We have a huge digital canvas that we're letting advertisers paint on, and it's something no one else can do on the web.
Those ads, of course, are for big national campaigns but we're also focused on growing the local ad market. That's why we've established relationships with local publishers to help address their challenge of bringing more local advertising dollars online. Last week, we announced a partnership with Gannett and their 81 local publishing organization and seven broadcast divisions. Gannett will now sell Yahoo! ad inventory as part of their local advertising strategy. And in doing so, they're able to take advantage of the advanced display ad targeting and ordering capabilities of our ad platform.
In addition to ad revenue, there's also a nice side benefit of the partnership. We plan to feature select Gannett content across the Yahoo! network. After search, we remain focused on growing our Search business, with an emphasis on Search revenue, Query growth and Share. 
As Tim mentioned, due to mix, overall search RPS was down, but we feel good that RPS was at 4% in the U.S. and year-over-year trajectory is definitely improving. We're also gaining traction in improving our search growth and as the latest June numbers for comScore show, we're gaining share. 
While some of the gains were organic, others were due to changes in our site so they would be counted correctly by comScore. I know some have been confused or even criticized this approach. But it's not well understood that comScore results historically counted the same kind of activities differently on leading search engines. Therefore, resulting in inaccurate competitive comparisons. 
The new contextual search experiences we've introduced, like slide shows for example, are not a matter of re-tagging something in our network and calling it search. These experiences are generated automatically using our search back-end technology and counted as a search based on users action and intent. The result is, that people love them. It's become another way for us to deliver personalization and relevance to users through Search.
Meanwhile we're looking for gains to be driven more by organic growth later this year when results of additional efforts to drive more search volumes are expected to take effect. While we're on Search, let's touch on the Search Alliance with Microsoft. The transition is progressing well. We've already hit several significant milestones that I'd like to share with you. 
This past quarter, we transitioned more than 125 employees to Microsoft. We started a regular cadence of communication to our advertisers and publishers in U.S. and Canada to help them prepare for the transition. We trained nearly 600 sales and account management Yahoo! and continue to work through the feature and system enhancements for future releases across algo [algorithm] and paid search.
I know that the timing of the transition is the question on top of everybody's mind. The algo transition is progressing very well. In fact, we've recently began internal testing on Yahoo! Search where Microsoft will power up to 25% of our algo search results in the U.S. and a smaller percentage of paid search results. 
Speaking of paid, we're testing, training and working with Microsoft to get ad center ready to serve our advertisers. We feel good about our progress. But I want to continue to emphasize that because the holiday season is so important for our advertisers, we will not give the go-ahead for the U.S. and Canada unless we're confident of a smooth transition with quality.
Finally, I'd like to recap a few more events from the quarter before I take your questions. In case you are hiding under a rock for the past two months, the World Cup has held the globe's attention and Yahoo!'s been right in the middle of it. When it comes to online coverage of the World Cup, our site was hugely successful, thanks mostly to our efforts to bring the event to users in new and innovative ways. 
In addition, to a special soccer Channel on our network, we unveiled new shortcuts and launched a new Yahoo! toolbar featuring World Cup coverage. That toolbar had more than 250,000 downloads and very high engagements. Scores and News modules received more than 50% of total clicks on the toolbar and initial engagement showed 4x more click intensity and 8x more searches per user when compared with our normal toolbar.
We also had the largest global launch of any fantasy product yet. Fans were able to play the World Cup game in 22 countries and 10 languages. This was due to the investments we made in the underlying fantasy platform, in line with what we did with the entertainment platform that I talked about earlier.
Last but not least, we had hit in our hands with the Yahoo! penalty shootout, given the simple social contest that we created. Users played more than 2 million times for more than 11.6 million minutes. It was a great way to enhance user engagement.
In the background of all of our content and advertising efforts, we're also hard at work driving innovation around our products and technology. Like last month, we hosted our third annual Hadoop Summit, attracting more than 1,000 developers. In case you haven't heard of it, Hadoop is an open source technology we pioneered. It's also one of the most advanced software technologies in the world for crunching huge amounts of data and it's essential in processing the vast pools of data we capture in our cloud to deliver everything from display ads to content. 
Hadoop is a core technology that's behind every click on Yahoo! But it's not just us. Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and the rest of those 1,000 developers I just mentioned also rely on Hadoop. And our approach to Hadoop's development has earned us a lot of admirers, not just for the huge amount of technology expertise needed to build it, but also for making it open-source.
Technology plays an essential part in what we do. Hadoop and the great talent we've recently added demonstrates how we're elevating science, technology and innovation even more within the company.
So that was the quarter. Before we take your questions, I just want to reiterate what we talked about today. Our metrics around margins and operating income continue to grow as we told you they would. We're pleased by the performance of Display overall and the engagement numbers we're seeing with our new ad format. We made carefully orchestrated moves to deepen our focus on content and the social, mobile, video and local leverage we used to deliver it. We remain laser focused on the Microsoft Search Alliance and transition, plus our own efforts to improve search RPS and volume growth are trending in the right direction. And from the World Cup to our Hadoop technology, we're focused on creating industry-leading products, technologies and experiences for our users, developers, advertisers and publishers.
With that, let's take your questions."

Most of our big display advertisers are multinational companies. They have FX issues like everybody else does and marketing is one of those areas that is easy to dial on and off. The interesting thing, of course, so we've been watching very carefully in the first weeks in July, it's like it never happened. It's just back to the same run rate we've had, which really has us believing that's what it was. Also, we've got to be able to look at the exchange and it was definitely not a Yahoo! anomaly. It looks like this was something that was going on in the market in display, which is why, normally, we wouldn't give you this sort of intra-quarter information but we thought we had a mirror of what happened in the last three weeks in June, with what happened in the first three weeks of July."

There are, obviously, a traditional measure of engagement on static websites. But the Internet has evolved through video streams, mobile experiences, rich web experiences, were engagement doesn't generate page views. So what we're trying to do is move to more of a holistic view. Page views will always still be valuable because they closely correlate with the way display ads are sold. But improvements and ad effectiveness and ad platform technology, for instance, are enabling us to grow revenue rapidly without increasing page views. That being said, we are diving into the minus 4% we're seeing. There's more analysis to be had on this. It is honestly a little bit of surprise to see it at that level. We need to break it, for instance, between our Mail, Messenger and community properties and homepage in the media properties for instance because we look for very different dynamics there. As a proxy, I could talk a little bit about the comScore minutes for homepage and for that matter, most of our other media properties having actually a pretty nice performance. Homepage was up in comScore minutes, 10% year-over-year. So a lot of the initiative that Carol talked about during the call, around social, mobile, local, video and certainly, our content strategy, all are certainly driven to increase that engagement, whether it's a page view number that, again, we have to get a little bit smarter on having just seen this one published or more likely minutes going forward. That's where our investments are in creating that kind of engagement and we do think we're starting to see things pay off. A last note on engagement is, quarter over quarter if you look at the minutes, again, split off the communications properties, you'll see the rest of the Yahoo! properties grow about 10% quarter-over-quarter. So we do think that we're starting to see traction for our investments."

I mean, it's fundamentally a different way we're managing here. I talked a lot about it at Investor Day, but we're taking a very multiyear view and we really have a concept of self funding that we're driving throughout the organization. And when you combine those two things, a multiyear view and a self-funding discipline, then what you end up getting is people not making decisions for these three-month periods, but making them for the longer-term and having to actually make trade-offs and decide on priorities. And we're getting much better at this now. So we're generating an awful lot of opportunity within existing cost structures and finding more cost-effective ways to invest in the business, like we talked about at Investor Day, more cost-effective ways to do that as you become more creative and are forced to do it. As far as the margins go, having 10% for the first half, excluding that $43 million of kind of nonrecurring favorability in the first quarter related to the search lines, 10% is pretty good. 11% for the second quarter, pretty good. Again, when we were between 5% and 6% at this time last year. So we're making an awful lot of progress.

And when you see things in the second quarter like an absence of spot buying over the last couple of weeks, it should make you incrementally more cautious. I would note, though, as the third thing that -- I said this in my script, but there's about $15 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact 3Q versus 2Q.

But when we started actually doing the targeting across properties and selling across properties. We found young males on the gossip sites, we found young males on the women's sites. We found them all over the place. And so it was, once we started targeting an audience and not just assuming things, but using our technology in finer and finer ways, and it still is, I think pretty growth targeting, but I mean, it's still much more than just see young male or young female, where they live, income levels, so on and so on.

Let's face it, those first ads in the first years are just goofy. I mean, the little banner ads and a couple of words, that when you think about interactivity and the beauty of, like, the login pages, when you think of pulling people into experience, I don't know how many of you saw a day we actually did our own takeover of the login page. We have a 3D site. There are so many things you can do now and advertisers are kind of catching that fever, if you will. I mean, that Malibu ad was just beautiful, and people responded to it.

But I'll say two things. First, on the CapEx side, the bump was expected. We are just spending to support our infrastructure efficiency plans. I talked a lot about this at Investor Day. We're spending on our cloud infrastructure, so that we can reduce our data platforms, our ad systems, our development in Q&A infrastructure, massively down by 2/3, reduce those items as we invest in the cloud. And then secondly, the data center side, we're completely transforming our data center footprint and that's going to result in 35% lower cost in a few years. So that's the kind of stuff we're spending on yet we're going to stay within the $600 million to $700 million range I gave for CapEx at the beginning of the year. I came out last quarter and I said, look I think we're going to be at the low end of that range. I still think we are all of this spending is very much in plan. But it's not a substitute or a flip-flop with OpEx, that's really pretty parallel but different past."

They're about, yes, these are profitable businesses, but they can be more profitable and they will contribute to our operating margin expansion plan. But it's also about growth. It's not about stunting these businesses. We are reinvesting in them. We are partnering with partners that we think will enable us to grow and enable us to focus on the things that we do well. Not too dissimilar from the Microsoft Search Alliance. If we can partner on the back end with best-in-class sites, focus on the front-end experiences and integrating them into, especially with the rest of our Display and Search businesses, again like the Mail Login Page demonstrated, we think that those pieces are really beginning to come into play here or fall into play."

It was great to see so many of you in person at our Investor Day. On today's call, we'll recap the recent quarter, discuss our efforts around engagement, as well as our performance in the search and display",1542,"Thanks, Marta. Hello, and thanks for joining us. It was great to see so many of you in person at our Investor Day. On today's call, we'll recap the recent quarter, discuss our efforts around engagement, as well as our performance in the search and display ad markets. We'll address some key milestones we've hit in our transition with the Microsoft Search Alliance, as well as what to expect next with the migration and of course, answer your questions.
So let's start with Q2. We continue to deliver on our promise to improve operating income and margins, but we were on the low end of our revenue guidance. We saw operating margins expand more than 600 basis points to 11% year-over-year. And excluding restructuring charges in 2009 and '10, income from operations grew 32%.
So we did great on operations and controlling expenses, but why did we hit the low end of the revenue? Well, it's a combination of factors. Of course, one is FX, but the majority of the story is split evenly between the search and display marketplaces. With regard to Search, we gained share in the quarter, but we didn't monetize searches as much as we expected. 
On the Display side with our Owned and Operated sites, we saw healthy ad spending of 19%. But the second week of June, we saw demand slow down as a handful of big advertisers pulled back. There was also no last-minute spot market this quarter. We believe it was due to quarterly expense management for their companies.
The first three weeks in July indicate we're back to normal. In June, we attended the world's largest ad conference, where we had numerous conversations with advertisers and did not get a sense of a persistent problem. Before we turn the call over to Tim to discuss the quarter in detail, I'd like to answer a question that most of you ask me, how do we measure our business? 
Obviously, we watch revenue and operating margin very closely. Those are our most important metrics. We also have many internal metrics that we use to run our business. And of course, we track third-party reports. While there's no one metric that captures everything, we concern ourselves most with users and their engagement on our network. This includes how engaged are our users around our communication and social products like Mail, Messenger, Flickr and Answers? How engaged are they with Search and how engaged are they with our rich and varied content site. 
so let me talk a bit about what we're doing to drive engagement. On the content side, having great content that's realtime, interesting and entertaining is one thing, but that's not enough to ensure engagement. Users today want to go beyond words presented on the screen. They want video, they want to interact, they want a social aspect. They want it anywhere, any time and any device. And they want it very personally relevant and local. These are the four Os I've talked about at Investor Day: video, social, mobile and local.
The big content move we made in Q2 was our acquisition of Associated Content. Their crowd sourced approach with 380,000 contributors rounds out our content strategy. We now have an incredible resource to tap that extends our ability to provide high-quality, personally relevant content to our users and advertisers. 
Meanwhile, we also continue to make investments in our existing content and media sites with Yahoo! News we're focused on building out a voice and identity for the site much like we've done for Sports. 
We recently established a politics and opinion team in Washington, D.C. And since then, we've seen click-through rates increase up to 50% on political content. And in early July, we launched the Upshot. The blog focuses on politics, the media and breaking news. The team behind it uses their incredible reporting skills, as well as analysis of what's trending on Yahoo! to deliver content that's designed to be relevant for our audience.
What's great about both Associated Content and new products like the Upshot, is how we use Yahoo!'s unique strength. We're pairing editorial expertise with the huge treasure trove of data on Yahoo! about users, their interest and their intent to deliver content that we know they want and will respond to.
We also continue to build our platforms that enable us to quickly and effectively launch new properties around the globe. For instance, we recently launched our lifestyle site in the U.K. In its first five days, five days, the site garnered 7.8 million page views and 2 million uniques. And after just two weeks it's landed in the top 10 lifestyle sites for the country. I ask you, what other website besides Yahoo!, could have such an impact in such a short amount of time. We have plans to roll out similar sites using the same platform to France, Germany, Italy and Spain in Q3 and look for us to follow this model in Lat Am and Asia as well.  
Now let's talk about those four Os. First off is social. One of the leverage we're using to create engagement and distribute our great content is through social channels. Our acquisition of Citizen Sports is beginning to pay off in this area. We've already signed a number of multimillion dollar joint partnerships with major consumer-facing brands. 
Tennessee football is big business in this season, users will be able to like their own Tennessee team on Yahoo! and receive personalized updates about players, injuries and advice delivered directly to their newsfeed on Facebook and their Yahoo! updates, all sponsored by Miller Lite. 
College football passions run deep. This season, users on Yahoo! will be able to pick who they believe is going to win and broadcast it and debate it with their friends on Facebook, sponsored by Southwest Airlines. Big brands love these unique social campaigns that allow users to engage more deeply with Yahoo! content and interact with friends and advertisers.
Speaking of Facebook, we deepened our integration with them in a big way this past quarter. Now users who are on both Yahoo! and Facebook can link their accounts to view and share updates with friends across both networks. We call this new level of social integration Yahoo! Pulse. It's still in early innings but so far, we're encouraged by what we're seeing. The good news is, users who connect their Facebook accounts with Yahoo! view more pages and spend more time on our network.
Social gains are also a big engagement draw, and that's why we announced our recent partnership with Zynga. Starting in August, we'll integrate Yahoo! IDs with Zynga and publish updates into Yahoo! and notifications into Yahoo! Mail. Then in Q4, we expect to begin hosting hit games like Farmville on the Yahoo! network.
Now turning to mobile. Our reach continues to grow. In the U.S. alone, we've grown almost 15% quarter-over-quarter, with 45 million users and a 52% reach. And we continue to release apps and form partnerships. We recently launched new Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Messenger apps for Android, as well as HTML5-based Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! News sites for the iPhone. These new apps and sites give user a faster, more sophisticated mobile browsing experience.
We also deepened our value partnership with top handset makers, Nokia and Samsung, to make sure Yahoo!'s industries-leading services are front and center, with their users all over the globe. Our new alliance with Nokia have the added benefit of leveraging their strength in maps and navigation to enhance our products. And it helps us gain access to Nokia's users in emerging markets with their phones are especially popular.
Another important content vehicle for us is video. We all know that video adoption has grown exponentially, especially now that it's easy for people to consume at their desk around the phone. And it's a format that advertisers really like. That's why we're working hard to integrate more of it into our properties, where we see video driving even more engagement for us. 
We're also finding more ways to monetize it. Our front page now points to video with free roll adds. And next month, the video that appears in line on the front page will have a new interactive ad format.
At the same time, we continue to launch more of our original sponsored video snacks and they're performing well. Early this month on Yahoo! News, we launched the Newsmaker Series and already the first video on the series, about Warren Buffett, generated more than 2.3 million video streams. 
On Yahoo! Shine, we also launched my favorite, Bikini 101 with Nivea. It targets women who are looking to get into shape for this summer swimsuit season. Pairing content with video is a perfect fit. This series is reaching roughly 200,000 uniques a day and it's over-delivering what we promised for page views to nearly by more than 60%.
Remember, all the moves that I just talked about across content, social, mobile video and local, were made with one goal in mind: improving user engagement. And it will continue to be a major goal for us in the quarters to come.
So with that, let's hear from Tim about the quarter's financials. Tim?"
91800,109056666,68016,"Yahoo! Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2010",2010-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Let's begin with an overview of revenue, operating income and earnings per share, then progress to a more detailed discussion of the dynamics impacting our second quarter financial results. Before turning the call back to Carol, I'll also p",1930,"Thanks, Carol. Let's begin with an overview of revenue, operating income and earnings per share, then progress to a more detailed discussion of the dynamics impacting our second quarter financial results. Before turning the call back to Carol, I'll also provide third quarter guidance and an updated outlook for second half expenses.
Revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $1,601,000,000 in the second quarter. That result was roughly $40 million below the midpoint of our guidance, with $6 million attributable to adverse foreign currency movements and the remainder split roughly evenly between Search and Display. 
Operating income was $175 million, more than doubling last year's $76 million and right at the midpoint of guidance despite the revenue shortfall. Excluding restructuring charges from both years, operating income improved 32% versus 2009.
GAAP operating margins were 11% for second quarter. Again, more than double last year's rate on a reported basis and up approximately 260 basis points, excluding restructuring. First half GAAP operating margins were also 11% on a reported basis and 10%, excluding the $43 million first quarter Search Alliance favorability, related to prior year.
It's early yet, but we're clearly making progress toward our goals of 15% to 20% margins by 2012 and 18% to 24% by 2013.
Finally, EPS grew 53% year-over-year to $0.15 per diluted share. As a reminder, prior-year earnings were impacted by two largely offsetting events: A gain on the sale of our Gmarket stake and the restructuring charge referenced a few moments ago.
With that brief overview of headline metrics, let's turn now to our revenue components and begin with Owned and Operated Display. Revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $468 million. Sequential growth registered a healthy 5% as well. We saw a good momentum for most of the quarter, but as Carol described a few moments ago, we did experience a pullback in the latter half of June by a handful of large customers.
The beginning of July has returned to a more positive trendline, so the data isn't conclusive enough to draw any macro conclusions at this point. Revenue from guaranteed placements grew 23% in second quarter. Graphical display impression volume was strong and overall yields followed suit. Non-guaranteed revenue also grew in the low-single digits. 
With respect to category performance in Display, revenue in five of 10 industry segments rose versus last year, with particular strength in Retail, Technology and CPG. Telecom and Travel were notably weak.
From a geographic perspective, Display in Americas and Asia Pac grew double digits. And EMEA grew middle single digits. As a housekeeping note, on April 1, we reorganized our business segments into a three-region format: Americas, EMEA and Asia Pac. Our external disclosures now mirror this structure. The supplemental financial data in our press release contains revenue and direct cost for each region.
Turning to Search. Second quarter O&O Search revenue was $331 million, a decline of 8% versus the prior year. Excluding our paid inclusion ad product, which was discontinued as of January 1, 2010, our Search revenue was flat year-over-year. 
Query volume grew by a little more than 7%, but that was essentially offset with an equivalent decline in revenue per search. However, it's interesting to note that RPS in each of our individual geographies was closer to flat year-over-year, with the U.S. actually registering 4% growth. With lower RPS internationally and international volume growth outpacing the U.S., the mixed shift brought overall RPS down.
With regard to U.S. search query share, in second quarter, we grew headline numbers as expected, but fell a little short of our internal goal to improve the trajectory of monetizable searches. Nevertheless, underlying share dynamics did begin trending upward. For instance, the reach of Yahoo! Search improved to 41% in 2Q, up nearly 150 basis points from 1Q, an increase that outpaced all of our competitors. In other words, we succeeded in leveraging our assets to induce more people to Yahoo! Search.
Consumers are engaging with Search in different ways, and the products and experiences we are building are evolving, too. Our strengths in media, content and communications enable us to interpret user interest and intent with ever-greater precision and at massive scale, regardless of whether a traditional search box is involved. While not all of these contextual searches, as we call them, monetize at similar levels as traditional search today, over time, we believe they will.
For example, the Trending Now box on our homepage is contributing three times more search volume this year than it did last year, and monetization has improved materially as well. At several hundred million Trending Now searches per month, that's a big deal. Looking forward, we intend to leverage our strength in both contextual and traditional search to engage users and grow revenue.
Finally, on Search from a category perspective, revenue was up year-over-year in five of our 10 industry segments. We saw particular strength in Telecom, CPG and Health and weakness in Entertainment.
Moving to our Affiliate business, revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $557 million. Once again, Asia Pac, and specifically Korea, led the way. On a global basis, Affiliate TAC rates finish the quarter slightly favorable to expectations. Rounding out the top line picture, I'll now provide more color on our Fees, Listings and Leads revenue.
These businesses performed essentially with line in our expectations for the quarter, but both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons clearly reflect the fact that we're progressing through a transition period. Our repositioning plans fall into three categories: divestitures, outsourcing partnerships and internal reinvestment. Zimbra and HotJobs are obviously the lines we've decided to divest. Personals, Local and most recently, Real Estate, are examples of our intent to increasingly partner with best-in-class websites to help power our offerings.
Finally, with respect to reinvestment, we're returning focus and funding to Yahoo! Small Business, Shopping, Autos, and Travel to grow these profitable businesses. While obviously unfavorable on the revenue line in the short-term, collectively these initiatives better serve our longer-term growth, profitability and strategic focus.
In total, the Fees, Listings and Leads businesses declined in second quarter by 19% from prior year to roughly $245 million. Given the unfavorable prior-year comparisons associated with this transition period, we expect second-half performance to stay in the range of a 15% to 20% decline versus 2009.
So that's our revenue performance this quarter. Now let's move down the income statement and discuss cost structure. For the quarter, total expenses, including both cost of revenue and operating expenses, were $1,426,000,000. Excluding TAC of $473 million, our expenses were $953 million, down 10% versus prior year. Noteworthy highlights include the following: As we've commented in the past, we're committed to ensuring that our expense plans are consistent with our revenue environment. In order to preserve profitability this quarter, the business did a nice job across all functions to proactively moderate spending. As a result, expenses landed $27 million favorable to the midpoint of our guidance range, despite incurring $10 million of restructuring costs.
Operating reimbursements for Microsoft landed at the high end of expectations, thereby contributing to the overall cost favorability. As a reminder, these reimbursements are related to running our paid search in algo platforms. Ultimately, as we transition in each geography, these reimbursements will begin to step down and be replaced with permanent reductions to Yahoo!'s cost structure.
In addition to the ongoing operating reimbursements, Microsoft is also responsible for up to $150 million of Yahoo!'s transition costs. This quarter, $18 million was incurred against this declining balance. These transition costs were equivalent to transition reimbursements, so the impact to our P&L was neutral this quarter as expected. Since receiving regulatory clearance, Yahoo! has been reimbursed roughly $85 million of transition costs, so $65 million remains on the $150 million commitment.
Including the income statement discussion, as previously noted, operating income landed at $175 million. Below operating income, our equity investment line grew by 51% year-over-year. Yahoo! Japan's results were the primary driver, with both revenue and operating income growing by 9% in the March-ending quarter. Recall that we recognized our proportional share of Yahoo! Japan's results one quarter in arrears. Finally, the Yahoo! Inc. effective tax rate was 36% for the quarter, toward the low end of our 35% to 40% guidance.
Before moving to the third quarter outlook, let's take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at roughly $3.8 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased roughly 32 million shares for $496 million. Year-to-date, including July, we've repurchased 63 million shares for $973 million, an average price of $15.40 per share. Our 2006 share repurchase authorization has now been fully utilized. 
On June 24, Yahoo's Board of Directors approved a new $3 billion authorization. As I've said in the past, it remains our goal to use repurchases to offset dilution from our equity programs, but we will continue to be opportunistic as well.
Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly $347 million for second quarter and $491 million for first half. As of June 30, our receivable balance with Microsoft, related to the Search Alliance, was approximately $75 million. CapEx was $190 million for the quarter, an increase of roughly $78 million from first quarter. The additional spending is primarily related to buildouts of our more efficient data center and grid infrastructure.
Finally, as of June 30, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was just over $11 billion or approximately $8 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes, and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group's privately held businesses.
Now let's look at our outlook for third quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,570,000,000 to $1,650,000,000. This outlook assumes roughly $15 million of adverse impact, resulting from foreign currencies compared to second quarter. Traffic acquisition costs should remain roughly 29% to 29.5% of revenue. Our total expenses, less TAC are expected to be in the range of $945 million to $965 million, including D&A of stock-based compensation of roughly $215 million.
We expect transition costs related to the Search Alliance to continue to be fully offset by transition reimbursement billings and for the Search Alliance's operating cost benefits to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million. Please note, however, that as the agreed upon transfer of employees to Microsoft occurs and we move on to Microsoft's paid and algorithmic search platforms, reimbursements will begin to fall and the underlying expenses will be removed from our cost structure.
These revenue and cost ranges yield an outlook of $160 million to $200 million for operating income. The midpoint expectation of $180 million would be essentially double the operating income generated in third quarter 2009. Including third quarter guidance, we're forecasting a range of roughly 35% to 40% for our effective tax rate, but would note that we're in dialogue with the IRS over a matter that could result in a rate in the low 20% range. We'll provide an update on this effort during our October call.
Before handing the call back to Carol, I'd like to update our expectations for full year total expenses, less TAC. Given the second and third quarter efficiencies we're generating versus our original spending plans, we're narrowing and lowering our full year range to $3,795,000,000 to $3,835,000,000. The midpoint of $3,815,000,000 is down by roughly $70 million from what we shared with you in April, and also represents an 11% reduction compared to 2009.
And now, back to Carol."

Recapping Tim's comments on the quarter, we're pleased that revenue grew, Display growth is very strong and Search is stabilizing. We've got our arms around the Listing Leads and Fees businesses, but there's a lot of transitioning happening in those lines and it'll be a few quarters before we cycle through the changes and begin to see the results from our investments. Finally and most important, we're making great progress on growing profits and margins.
Now I'd like to talk a bit more about the ad market. First off, let's spend a little time on Display. Overall, the continued growth in Display reflects that the promise we're delivering to advertisers, that only Yahoo! offers a science, art and scale needed for great online campaigns, is resonating. Let me give you an example that most of you are familiar with, the Login Page ad we previewed at Investor Day and rolled out in mid-June.
General Motors was the first to use the new format and the results were simply fantastic. Those ads for the Chevrolet Malibu, Trevor and Equinox saw an incredible level of engagement from users, and we saw it across three specific areas.
First, users who saw the Malibu login ad conducted 7x more searches for Chevrolet brand terms than those who didn't see the adds, 7x. That's a display ad having a direct impact on search behavior. Second, the day the Malibu ad ran, we had the biggest spike in searches for Chevy Malibu we've seen all year. And third, on the day the ad ran, Malibu make, model and trim page views on Yahoo! Autos, nearly doubled.
Equally as interesting, the day the ads ran for the other two models, similar Trevor's pageviews on Yahoo! Autos were up 32% and those for Equinox were up 50%. That's what advertising is all about, the new login ad truly influenced consumer behavior to use our Search or visit Yahoo! Autos for more information.
So these are great numbers and a big reason why the ads did so well is they just look great. This kind of execution is a huge differentiator for us. We're using artful and interesting presentation to drive engagement with a brand and its products. We have a huge digital canvas that we're letting advertisers paint on, and it's something no one else can do on the web.
Those ads, of course, are for big national campaigns but we're also focused on growing the local ad market. That's why we've established relationships with local publishers to help address their challenge of bringing more local advertising dollars online. Last week, we announced a partnership with Gannett and their 81 local publishing organization and seven broadcast divisions. Gannett will now sell Yahoo! ad inventory as part of their local advertising strategy. And in doing so, they're able to take advantage of the advanced display ad targeting and ordering capabilities of our ad platform.
In addition to ad revenue, there's also a nice side benefit of the partnership. We plan to feature select Gannett content across the Yahoo! network. After search, we remain focused on growing our Search business, with an emphasis on Search revenue, Query growth and Share. 
As Tim mentioned, due to mix, overall search RPS was down, but we feel good that RPS was at 4% in the U.S. and year-over-year trajectory is definitely improving. We're also gaining traction in improving our search growth and as the latest June numbers for comScore show, we're gaining share. 
While some of the gains were organic, others were due to changes in our site so they would be counted correctly by comScore. I know some have been confused or even criticized this approach. But it's not well understood that comScore results historically counted the same kind of activities differently on leading search engines. Therefore, resulting in inaccurate competitive comparisons. 
The new contextual search experiences we've introduced, like slide shows for example, are not a matter of re-tagging something in our network and calling it search. These experiences are generated automatically using our search back-end technology and counted as a search based on users action and intent. The result is, that people love them. It's become another way for us to deliver personalization and relevance to users through Search.
Meanwhile we're looking for gains to be driven more by organic growth later this year when results of additional efforts to drive more search volumes are expected to take effect. While we're on Search, let's touch on the Search Alliance with Microsoft. The transition is progressing well. We've already hit several significant milestones that I'd like to share with you. 
This past quarter, we transitioned more than 125 employees to Microsoft. We started a regular cadence of communication to our advertisers and publishers in U.S. and Canada to help them prepare for the transition. We trained nearly 600 sales and account management Yahoo! and continue to work through the feature and system enhancements for future releases across algo [algorithm] and paid search.
I know that the timing of the transition is the question on top of everybody's mind. The algo transition is progressing very well. In fact, we've recently began internal testing on Yahoo! Search where Microsoft will power up to 25% of our algo search results in the U.S. and a smaller percentage of paid search results. 
Speaking of paid, we're testing, training and working with Microsoft to get ad center ready to serve our advertisers. We feel good about our progress. But I want to continue to emphasize that because the holiday season is so important for our advertisers, we will not give the go-ahead for the U.S. and Canada unless we're confident of a smooth transition with quality.
Finally, I'd like to recap a few more events from the quarter before I take your questions. In case you are hiding under a rock for the past two months, the World Cup has held the globe's attention and Yahoo!'s been right in the middle of it. When it comes to online coverage of the World Cup, our site was hugely successful, thanks mostly to our efforts to bring the event to users in new and innovative ways. 
In addition, to a special soccer Channel on our network, we unveiled new shortcuts and launched a new Yahoo! toolbar featuring World Cup coverage. That toolbar had more than 250,000 downloads and very high engagements. Scores and News modules received more than 50% of total clicks on the toolbar and initial engagement showed 4x more click intensity and 8x more searches per user when compared with our normal toolbar.
We also had the largest global launch of any fantasy product yet. Fans were able to play the World Cup game in 22 countries and 10 languages. This was due to the investments we made in the underlying fantasy platform, in line with what we did with the entertainment platform that I talked about earlier.
Last but not least, we had hit in our hands with the Yahoo! penalty shootout, given the simple social contest that we created. Users played more than 2 million times for more than 11.6 million minutes. It was a great way to enhance user engagement.
In the background of all of our content and advertising efforts, we're also hard at work driving innovation around our products and technology. Like last month, we hosted our third annual Hadoop Summit, attracting more than 1,000 developers. In case you haven't heard of it, Hadoop is an open source technology we pioneered. It's also one of the most advanced software technologies in the world for crunching huge amounts of data and it's essential in processing the vast pools of data we capture in our cloud to deliver everything from display ads to content. 
Hadoop is a core technology that's behind every click on Yahoo! But it's not just us. Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and the rest of those 1,000 developers I just mentioned also rely on Hadoop. And our approach to Hadoop's development has earned us a lot of admirers, not just for the huge amount of technology expertise needed to build it, but also for making it open-source.
Technology plays an essential part in what we do. Hadoop and the great talent we've recently added demonstrates how we're elevating science, technology and innovation even more within the company.
So that was the quarter. Before we take your questions, I just want to reiterate what we talked about today. Our metrics around margins and operating income continue to grow as we told you they would. We're pleased by the performance of Display overall and the engagement numbers we're seeing with our new ad format. We made carefully orchestrated moves to deepen our focus on content and the social, mobile, video and local leverage we used to deliver it. We remain laser focused on the Microsoft Search Alliance and transition, plus our own efforts to improve search RPS and volume growth are trending in the right direction. And from the World Cup to our Hadoop technology, we're focused on creating industry-leading products, technologies and experiences for our users, developers, advertisers and publishers.
With that, let's take your questions."

Most of our big display advertisers are multinational companies. They have FX issues like everybody else does and marketing is one of those areas that is easy to dial on and off. The interesting thing, of course, so we've been watching very carefully in the first weeks in July, it's like it never happened. It's just back to the same run rate we've had, which really has us believing that's what it was. Also, we've got to be able to look at the exchange and it was definitely not a Yahoo! anomaly. It looks like this was something that was going on in the market in display, which is why, normally, we wouldn't give you this sort of intra-quarter information but we thought we had a mirror of what happened in the last three weeks in June, with what happened in the first three weeks of July."

There are, obviously, a traditional measure of engagement on static websites. But the Internet has evolved through video streams, mobile experiences, rich web experiences, were engagement doesn't generate page views. So what we're trying to do is move to more of a holistic view. Page views will always still be valuable because they closely correlate with the way display ads are sold. But improvements and ad effectiveness and ad platform technology, for instance, are enabling us to grow revenue rapidly without increasing page views. That being said, we are diving into the minus 4% we're seeing. There's more analysis to be had on this. It is honestly a little bit of surprise to see it at that level. We need to break it, for instance, between our Mail, Messenger and community properties and homepage in the media properties for instance because we look for very different dynamics there. As a proxy, I could talk a little bit about the comScore minutes for homepage and for that matter, most of our other media properties having actually a pretty nice performance. Homepage was up in comScore minutes, 10% year-over-year. So a lot of the initiative that Carol talked about during the call, around social, mobile, local, video and certainly, our content strategy, all are certainly driven to increase that engagement, whether it's a page view number that, again, we have to get a little bit smarter on having just seen this one published or more likely minutes going forward. That's where our investments are in creating that kind of engagement and we do think we're starting to see things pay off. A last note on engagement is, quarter over quarter if you look at the minutes, again, split off the communications properties, you'll see the rest of the Yahoo! properties grow about 10% quarter-over-quarter. So we do think that we're starting to see traction for our investments."

I mean, it's fundamentally a different way we're managing here. I talked a lot about it at Investor Day, but we're taking a very multiyear view and we really have a concept of self funding that we're driving throughout the organization.

And we're getting much better at this now. So we're generating an awful lot of opportunity within existing cost structures and finding more cost-effective ways to invest in the business, like we talked about at Investor Day, more cost-effective ways to do that as you become more creative and are forced to do it. As far as the margins go, having 10% for the first half, excluding that $43 million of kind of nonrecurring favorability in the first quarter related to the search lines, 10% is pretty good. 11% for the second quarter, pretty good. Again, when we were between 5% and 6% at this time last year. So we're making an awful lot of progress.

What happened at the end part of the quarter, mostly in the second half of June, unquestionably has influenced our thinking for the third quarter. 3Q is always a tougher quarter to call because it always seems to come down to September. And when you see things in the second quarter like an absence of spot buying on those last couple of weeks, it should make you incrementally more cautious. I would note, though, as the third thing that -- I said this in my script, but there's about $15 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact 3Q versus 2Q. So if you go from our 16 01 in second quarter just for easy math, just on same FX basis, that's 15 85 right away. So same basis, 15 85 up to a midpoint of 16 10, we do see growth there."

But with that scale, we have a lot, we have breadth and depth. So for instance, it was very obvious always to target, find a male on Yahoo! Sports. But when we started actually doing the targeting across properties and selling across properties. We found young males on the gossip sites, we found young males on the women's sites. We found them all over the place. And so it was, once we started targeting an audience and not just assuming things, but using our technology in finer and finer ways, and it still is, I think pretty growth targeting, but I mean, it's still much more than just see young male or young female, where they live, income levels, so on and so on. We get really great results and therefore, higher CPM. And we're just at the beginning of this, Sameet. This is a real area of advantage for the company. And since you mentioned science, art and scale, I think the real -- I think one of the most interesting things happening in the industry right now is that, not only are people, advertisers looking at Internet marketing, but they're finally understanding that it can be very unique and very interesting. Let's face it, those first ads in those first years are just goofy. I mean, the little banner ads and a couple of words, but when you think about interactivity and the beauty of, like, the login pages, when you think of pulling people into experience, I don't know how many of you saw a day we actually did our own takeover of the login page. We have a 3D sites. There are so many things you can do now and advertisers are kind of catching that fever, if you will. I mean, that Malibu ad was just beautiful, and people responded to it. And that's just the beginning of what's going to happen."

But I'll say two things. First, on the CapEx side, the bump was expected. We are just spending to support our infrastructure efficiency plans. I talked a lot about this at Investor Day. We're spending on our cloud infrastructure, so that we can reduce our data platforms, our ad systems, our development in Q&A infrastructure, massively down by 2/3, reduce those items as we invest in the cloud. And then secondly, on the data center side, we're completely transforming our data center footprint and that's going to result in 35% lower cost in a few years. So that's the kind of stuff we're spending on yet we're going to stay within the $600 million to $700 million range I gave for CapEx at the beginning of the year. I came out last quarter and I said, look I think we're going to be at the low end of that range, I still think we are. All of this spending is very much in plan.

On today's call, we'll discuss how we're executing on our plan for Yahoo!, talk about our performance during the quarter, answer questions we know are top of mind and of course, as Marta said open the c",1692,"Thanks, Marta, and thanks, everybody for joining us. On today's call, we'll discuss how we're executing on our plan for Yahoo!, talk about our performance during the quarter, answer questions we know are top of mind and of course, as Marta said open the call to Q&A.
Before I get to how we did during the quarter, I want to reiterate our vision for Yahoo!, our plan and how we're executing against it. Yahoo! is an innovative technology company that operates the largest digital media, content and communication business in the world. The key words here are innovative, technology, media, content and communication. That's what we're all about. 
Technology certainly makes the Internet possible, but content and communication is why we use it. Content drives everything from search to social networks. The creation and curation of content is more important than ever and will continue to be, as the use of the Internet grows and evolves.
As for our plan, it revolves around the two things we have always told you, growing our revenue and increasing profitability. Everything we're doing is designed to drive us towards these two goals. To do this, we're working to reverse years of decelerating growth. To increase profitability, we have to be extremely focused and efficient. And to grow our revenue, we have to grow our users and engagement.
When I first arrived here almost 21 months ago, we stepped back and took a good look at the company. To deliver higher profitability and stronger growth, we realized we had to make a series of substantial changes. We had to reorganize the company to break down silos so we can move faster, eliminate redundancy and improve our cost structure. We had to organize and make better use of the incredible amounts of data we collect to improve the user and advertiser experience. 
We had to answer the big question about how best to compete in Search, which at that time, was another declining trend for the company. And we needed to create fundamentally better platforms and infrastructure across the company so we could move more quickly to deliver the kind of quality content and experiences our users and advertisers deserve.
Since then, we've been working hard to create a stronger, more disciplined and focused company. This also includes making our organization more efficient, more lean and more nimble. One by-product of any change is all with movement of people. Some people leave, some get promoted and some good new people arrive. The most important thing is making sure the right person is in the right job at the right time. So with that said, what have we done to reengineer Yahoo!.
First, we partnered with Microsoft on Search and are executing a massive transition of our algo [algorithmic] and paid platforms beginning in the U.S. and Canada, all on schedule. Second, we continued to enhance our apps platform to make buying and selling Display advertising easier. We've been working hard, beginning to move off our old systems. The result of that will be higher yields through better targeting, inventory management and serving systems. Ultimately, we'll be able to combine our class one and class two inventory on apps into a unified marketplace.
Third, we've divested parts of the business that did not fit with our vision or our plans for profitability and growth, and we acquired companies that did. Fourth, we're increasing efficiencies bringing down our operating costs by more than $1.1 billion over the past two years. Fifth, we've been working hard to revamp our engineering processes so we can innovate and get new products out as fast as the market demands. Sixth, we're pulling on data out of silos, so we can optimize and in conjunction with the technology we use for our content grid in the cloud. The result would be a more personalized experience for users and advertisers that continues to get better and better.
Seventh, we have completely revamped Mail and Messenger to deliver better, modern functionality and speed. And lastly, we've been working hard to roll out new infrastructure like our just opened data center in New York, that is one of the most advanced environmental friendly in the world. A new platform that allows to better deliver content and experiences with a focus on local, mobile, social and video.
This last part is especially important because content is a huge driver of engagement for us. Our legacy platform just weren't able to scale. It was complex, time-consuming and expensive to get a feature or product to market. So we began rebuilding and modernizing our platforms across the entire company to allow us to innovate and rollout new sites, features and functionality much more quickly. We talked about this with you several times, about the need to improve our underlying infrastructure. This work is ongoing and we expect it to have huge payoffs.
For example, just yesterday, we rolled out our first global platform, News. Our previous News platform was made up of nine different code bases. It maxed out at 24 countries and 12 languages. The cost of adding additional countries and languages were prohibited. We could hardly change anything even here in the U.S.. 
The new platform by contrast is light-years ahead, it's on one single code base. It's not limited by the number of countries and languages we can support. In fact,, we can bring up new countries in a fraction of the time it used take. We can do multiple experiments with content and ad placements in a single day. We can create a new page in less than five minutes as opposed to weeks. And it's infused with an incredible amount of science and personalization. It's search optimized, that runs our content optimization engine and much more.
I met with the teams that worked on this just last week and the engineers and editors are very excited. They can do things they used to only be able to dream of. It will dramatically change the way we innovate. It will improve both our user and advertiser experiences worldwide. 
That's just one example, yet it illustrates the point I want to drive home here. To grow revenue and improve profitability, we have to move forward in a disciplined sequential way. First you walk, then you run, [indiscernible]. Once we get the right things in place, with the new global News platform or the completion of the Search transition in Microsoft, we can really fly.
We told you earlier this year on our Q1 call that we expect the majority of our product platform work to be completed by next summer. This includes our efforts to implement the next phase of functionality for our Display Advertising platform app, and our Exchange platform, RMX. So we're going to relentlessly pounding away at these and other initiatives we have planned for our users and advertisers in the months to come, and we're well on our way.
As I just told you, we have two main goals: Increase profitability, reinvigorate revenue growth. Let's take a look at how these played out during the quarter.
For profitability, we continue to deliver increasing margins and operating income. Operating margins more than doubled for the second quarter in a row to 12% compared with 6% in the third quarter of '09. Excluding restructuring charges from Q3 this year and last year, income from operations grew 80% in the quarter. So we are seeing very good progress with profitability. 
This past quarter, we delivered revenue near the midpoint of our guidance, which amounted to a 2% increase over last year, driven by 17% growth in O&O display. Advertisers are clearly impressed by the science, art and scale we can bring to their campaign. It's a big reason why CBS chose Yahoo! for the online promotion of its fall lineup. The program spanned more than a week and included two Home page and three Login page placements, in addition to buying out 90% of our Entertainment properties. And it's why companies like State Farm and Dodge recently launched sponsored video entertainment to connect with the consumers they want to reach.
Our team in Asia continues to knock the bar out of the park with the highest year-over-year Display growth of our three regions, well ahead of the market. We're also seeing strong advertiser response to our innovative targeting products like Smart adds, and new ad units like OPA formats in the Login page. 
So we have solid results this quarter. Our revenue growth would've been even better if not for two items related to the Search transition. First, Search campaigns slowed as advertisers waited to move to Microsoft adCenter rather than entering your campaigns twice. And second, as Tim will explain later, when we transitioned to our algo search, the new results were so much better that users click on the top organic results more and click on paid ads less. Despite these transitional items, RPS was up roughly 1% over last year and last quarter. The last time RPS was up year-over-year was eight quarters ago in Q3 of '08.
We are also intently focused on growing Search volume and we feel very good about the steps we're taking. Case in point, the first in a series of enhancements to the Search experience that we just launched are showing promising results with increases in click throughs and engagement. 
The very good news as I'll talk about later in the call, is that we expect the paid Search transition in the U.S. and Canada to be completed this month, which will improve the quality of our paid results over time. In the background of all of these, we also continued to effectively manage our balance sheet. We recognize the value of our assets and believe our stock is undervalued. That's why this year alone, we bought back more than 7% of the company stock.
I have more like I'd to share with you about our progress this quarter and some topics I know are on your mind, but first, let's turn the call over to Tim to talk about our Q3 financials in more detail. Tim?"

Today we'll address third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook and also a cosmetic accounting change impacting revenue presentation that's required as we transition to Microsoft's paid search platform. Highlights of our t",1978,"Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Today we'll address third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook and also a cosmetic accounting change impacting revenue presentation that's required as we transition to Microsoft's paid search platform. Highlights of our third quarter performance include 17% O&O Display growth, 107% operating income growth and meaningful progress transforming our Search business.
Let's begin with an overview of headline revenue, core profitability and EPS metrics. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $1,601,000,000 in the third quarter. The difference versus midpoint of our guidance was driven by the divestitures of HotJobs, which was completed in late August, in our algo search transition to Microsoft, which I'll touch on more in a moment. 
Operating income was $189 million, more than double in prior year for the second straight quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding restructuring charges from both years, operating income improved 80% versus third quarter 2009. GAAP operating margins were 12% for third quarter, again, more than double last year's rate on a reported basis and up more than 500 basis points, excluding restructuring. 
Finally, EPS grew 126% year-over-year to $0.29 per diluted share. The current quarter included a $0.13 gain from the divestiture of HotJobs and third quarter 2009 included a $0.04 gain from the sale of our direct stake in AliBaba.com. Excluding both of those nonrecurring gains, EPS grew 86% year-over-year.
Diving into the top line narrative, let's begin with another good quarter for Owned and Operated Display. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $465 million, led by guaranteed revenue growth of 20%. Both Americas and Asia-Pac Display grew strong double digits, while EMEA grew strong single digits. From a big picture perspective, quarter-end customer dynamics were stronger in September than June.
With respect to category performance in Display, revenue in seven of 10 industry segments rose versus last year, with particular strength in retail and technology, telecom was notably weak. Turning to Search, third quarter O&O Search revenue was $331 million, a decline of 7% versus the prior year, but notably flat sequentially. Excluding our paid inclusion ad product, which is discontinued as of January 1, 2010, our Search revenue was up 1% year-over-year. This quarter, we saw half of our Search categories rise and half decline, with particular strength in auto and retail, largely offset by softer results in Entertainment and Finance.
Operationally, search query volume was flat both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and RPS was up roughly 1% versus both comparisons. That's the first year-over-year RPS growth we've seen since third quarter 2008, an encouraging signs of stabilization. While the RPS trend is improving, it did fall roughly $10 million shy of expectations this quarter for reasons related to our transition to Microsoft's algo platform. Specifically, as users experience pressure in more relevant results on Yahoo!'s Search page is powered by Microsoft, they clicked more on the organic result and less on the paid results, lowering RPS. This accounted for the majority of the revenue difference relative to our expectations.
We also noted a Search page view decline as users found what a needed faster and therefore, clicked through to the next page of Search results less often, lowering volume. Despite the unfavorable revenue impact in the third quarter, the user experience is clearly better and we're confident that will lead to longer-term volume and market share improvements. Likewise, our initial test on Microsoft's paid search platform are increasing our confidence that once the combined marketplaces is fully tuned, the RPS uplift will be even greater than originally anticipated.
Moving to our Affiliate business. Revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $557 million. Affiliate tax rates were in line with what we expected, the traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of total GAAP revenue exceeded our guidance range principally driven by the mixed impact related to lower RPS and the HotJobs divestitures. 
Finally, with respect to our Listing, Leads and Fees businesses, as expected, revenue declined year-over-year by 16% to $248 million. On our last call, we had guided second half revenue for these segments to decline 15% to 20% versus prior year, so we landed at the low end of the range for 3Q despite divesting HotJobs.
That rounds out my comment on revenue for third quarter. So let's move down the income statement and discuss costs. For the quarter, total expenses less TAC were down 10% versus the prior year to $935 million. The midpoint of our guidance was $955 million or essentially flat to the second quarter, so we're pleased to have generated roughly $20 million of cost efficiencies versus both prior quarter and guidance. We're making great progress in becoming more efficient and that focus will continue in the upcoming quarters.
Before moving on, two cost related housekeeping rules. Operating reimbursements from Microsoft landed at $81 million for the quarter, in line with our guidance. Transition cost reimbursements of $18 million from Microsoft, once again, were equivalent to the incurred transition cost themselves and consequently, the impact to our P&L this quarter was neutral as expected. Continuing down the income statement, other income this quarter included a pre-tax gain of $186 million related to our disposition of HotJobs. Farther down, earnings and equity interest grew 52% compared to last year, driven by solid results from both Yahoo! Japan and AliBaba group.
Finally, our effective tax rate was 23% for third quarter. We had guided a range of 35% to 40%, but noted that outstanding discussions with the IRS could reduce our rate to the low 20% range. The lower rate this quarter stemmed not from the IRS dialogue, but from our ability to offset most of the HotJobs divestiture gain with capital losses we generated in prior years. The IRS dialogue is ongoing and expected now to be resolved in the fourth quarter.
Now let's take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at just under $3.5 billion. During the quarter, we stepped up our repurchases, buying roughly 62 million shares for $868 million in average price of $13.89 per share. For the year, we've repurchased nearly 120 million shares for roughly $1,750,000,000, an average price of $14.68 per share. That means we have repurchased 7% of the company's shares since January 1.
Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly $347 million for third quarter and $837 million year-to-date. CapEx was $164 million for third quarter and $467 million year-to-date. We continue to focus on modernizing our data center infrastructure to drive operational and cost efficiencies in the coming years.
Finally, as of September 30, the pre-tax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in AliBaba.com was roughly $10 billion or approximately $7.74 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of AliBaba groups privately held businesses.
Before moving to fourth quarter outlook, I'd like to take a little time to walk you through how our GAAP revenue will change as we transition our paid Search business to Microsoft's platform. Transition will include two components. The first is an accounting change that will not have any economic impact on our results. The second, of course, is the 12% revenue share with Microsoft that you already know about. 
Today, we present our revenue on what's known as a growth's basis. That is we record 100% of the advertising revenue for our O&O properties and 100% of the advertising revenue generated on our Affiliate sites. As you know, our Affiliate business carries with it a substantial traffic acquisition costs or TAC, and for GAAP purposes, that TAC is recorded as a cost of revenue on our income statement. As a result, TAC offsets the vast majority of Affiliate GAAP revenue so that the net effect is much smaller.
As the Yahoo! and Yahoo! affiliates Search transactions begin running through Microsoft's paid search system in each market, accounting guidelines require a change in our GAAP-revenue presentation for that market to net basis. That simply means that we will no longer recognize 100% of the advertising revenue generated on Affiliate sites. We will only recognize the net revenue after traffic acquisition costs.
Since the newly required accounting will take effect literally market by market as we move to Microsoft's platforms, this transition will take effect early 2012. Once we have fully transitioned paid Search Microsoft, our GAAP revenue at that point will look very similar to how our revenue x TAC looks today. In the meantime, we believe it is most helpful and consistent to guide and report our top line on the basis of revenue x TAC going forward. Doing so, will much more accurately reflect the underlying dynamics of the business and facilitate comparisons to prior periods.
For a simple example of the impact of both our TAC related accounting change and the 12% revenue share, please see Slide #14 in the quarterly earnings presentation on our IR website.
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter outlook itself. Revenue x TAC is expected to be in the range of $100,125,000,000 to $1,225,000,000. This outlook assumes that the paid search transition to Microsoft's adCenter platform in the U.S. and Canada is complete by the end of October, and it incorporates our expectation that some of the algo related RPS and volume shifts we saw in September continue into 4Q. Given the transition timing, we anticipate revenue share to Microsoft to be in the range of $30 million.
It's important to find out that given the magnitude of the Search platform transition we're undertaking this quarter, very abilities is inherent in our projections, as literally thousands of search advertisers migrate budgets to adCenter and adjust to a larger, more liquid marketplace, some of the operational implications and related financial impact are difficult to predict, including those related to our RPS guarantee. While we believe in the adverse volume in RPS dynamics will be transient in nature, caution is warranted nonetheless.
We're committed to transparency throughout the transition of Microsoft search platforms. We recognize that this quarter is particularly challenging to model. So we are additionally providing guidance for x TAC Display revenue to grow 18% to 22% compared to the September quarter. Top half of that range is in line with the seasonal average over the last four years. As a reminder, when comparing revenue to prior year, the Search Alliance transition and HotJobs divestitures and discontinuance of paid inclusion, together represent roughly an eight-point impact on growth.
Shifting to 4Q costs. Our total expenses less TAC are expected to be in the range of $925 million to $945 million, with a midpoint flat to third quarter despite the upward pressures associated with the higher volume quarter. The operating reimbursements from Microsoft will decline slightly this quarter and the underlying expenses will be removed from our cost structure. As a final cost-related note, this outlook yields a full year midpoint for total expenses less TAC of $3,765,000,000. That's a 12% reduction from 2009 and a 23% reduction from 2008. And we're not done yet.
Returning to fourth quarter, at the midpoint of our revenue and expense ranges, operating income is expected to be $240 million, once again double that of the comparable period in 2009. Concluding 4Q guidance, we're forecasting a 15% to 20% effective tax rate as we expected a number of discrete initiatives to be favorably resolved. To summarize where we stand financially, we're pleased with our third quarter results. Display growth remain healthy, the Search transformation is progressing well and profitability has improved significantly, even as we invest to reposition Yahoo! for both greater efficiency and innovation in the coming years.
We also continue to generate significant cash flow and to redeploy funds to benefit shareholders by nearly $1.8 billion of share repurchases year-to-date. With that, I'll turn the call back to Carol."

We're making extraordinary progress. As we told you many times, th",1139,"Thanks, Tim. I'd now like to address two areas I know are on top of mind for you, a little bit more about the Search Alliance and our relationship with AliBaba. First, the Search Alliance. We're making extraordinary progress. As we told you many times, this is an enormously complex undertaking with tens of thousands of advertisers involved. The fact that this transition continues on schedule says a lot about the talent, skill and determination of the teams here at Yahoo! and Microsoft.
Last month, we completed step one of the transition, completing the algo search move to Microsoft for the U.S. and Canada, our biggest market place. It happened on the exact date we planned. And after the algo switch, we were really pleased to see a big improvement in the freshness and relevance of the search results. 
Step two was a transition of paid search in the U.S. and Canada. Over the last two months, we've been working closely with our advertisers and their agencies to move their campaigns from Yahoo! to Microsoft's adCenter. As a result, 86% of billing transactions are completed, 97% of our premium accounts have transitioned to adCenter, and we're now more than halfway through shifting our Yahoo! search queries to use adCenter. We expect the full shift to be completed on schedule this month.
Step three is running a fully transitioned unified market place with Microsoft, enabling our advertisers and publishers to recap the benefits and efficiencies of the larger marketplace. Recall that Yahoo! is exclusively managing the premier search sales and related relationships for the largest advertisers. This puts us in an important strategic position to advise our advertisers and agencies regarding optimizing their online spend across our large combined search marketplace, as well as our Display offerings. Advertisers will in one buy, get a full online advertising solution based on Yahoo!'s superior relationship and user insights. We've undertaken a immense amount of training for our sales team so they can best anticipate in the advertiser and publisher needs.
Of course, it's going to take time to get the marketplace to the state we wanted. We need time to  fine tune and get the gears to mesh perfectly. It's a big transition and advertisers will also need to adjust. There's a lot for our advertisers to get used to. For example, Microsoft editorial and trademark policies are different. Some shopping aggregators will have to alter their campaign significantly to generate the same results. And as advertisers adjust to the new bigger marketplace, we're expecting to see days when advertisers will literally submit tens of millions of updates, causing some temporary swings in marketplace performance. Together with Microsoft, we plan in advance for these and many other situations. Our teams are ready to work out alongside our advertisers while we aim to deliver a stable marketplace by the holiday season. By Q2 next year, we expect the U.S. marketplace to be fully tuned.
Next up, AliBaba. Yahoo! made the investment in AliBaba five years ago and it was great foresight by Jerry and the team to invest in a strong, local player in the Chinese market. To this day, no other Internet company outside of China has done as well with their investment in the country as we have, no one. Our tremendous respect for Jack Ma, the AliBaba team and what they have accomplished. We know there's tremendous value in the businesses they're growing. It's an important investment and we're committed to a good, productive business relationship.
Beyond that I'm not going to speculate today or in the future on our investment with them. Just know that as with any investment we're focused on maximizing value for shareholders.
Before we close, I'd like to briefly discuss some of our accomplishments last quarter. The main focus is on our content strategy and how we use mobile, local, social and video to drive user engagement. On the Search side, we unveiled the first in a series of new, more visually compelling search results for information rich topics like music, movies and news. We also improved our local search relevance. With content, our recently launched Ask America program is creating a social experience around the News, combining interactive polling with content, enabling users to read about important issues and vote. This kind of unique content experience is something only Yahoo! can do. It's also leading to impress some engagements. We've had more than 7 million votes in the short time the program has been up.
For Mobile, we launched a raft of new apps. On Android, we released eight new apps including the Yahoo! Mobile Home page, Finance, OMG, Movies, Fantasy Football, Sportacular and more. On the Apple side we upgraded the Yahoo! Mobile Home page, released Sportacular to the iPod and iPhone, as well as Fantasy Football, and an updated Yahoo! Messenger, with video chat for the iPhone. Users can now make voice and video calls over 3G and Wi-Fi networks and connect with the PC.
And lastly, we introduced fantastic new mobile experiences for Yahoo! Mail on both the iPhone and Android. Speaking of Mail, as you know, it's a big driver of user engagement. Very soon, we'll launch our new Mail data. It has great new communications, social and photo features, and a lot more. It's also incredibly fast, which is important everywhere but especially in emerging markets where load times are so important to successful adoption. 
And lastly, our social integration with Twitter will go live with the Mail data. Similar to our integration with Facebook, people who use Yahoo! and Twitter will be able to link their accounts to view and share updates across both networks. It's one thing to talk about the power of your Yahoo! Mail combined with your Facebook wall and your Twitter feeds, it's another to see it in action. We get lots of wows every time we show people their Yahoo! Mail at high speed, fully integrated with their favorite social services. It's just awesome.
All of these items are part of our plan to grow our revenue and increase profitability. And as I shared earlier, we're solidly executing on that plan. Margins are expanding, revenue growth is stabilizing after a long period of decelerating trends. Display advertising continues to grow and it's up 18% year-to-date. Product rollouts are accelerating as we modernize our infrastructure. Our Search Alliance with Microsoft continues on schedule and more.
At the end of the day, Yahoo! is a company with tremendous potential. Our 600 million users and hundreds of thousands of advertisers are a testament to that. We have a lot more work to do in the months ahead, but we're clearly making progress. And the payoff, I believe, in return to our shareholders will be substantial. So with that, let's open it up to your questions. Operator?"

I'm not going to go out and say how long it will take us to overcome the 12%, but over the period, we're clearly, clearly aiming to grow Search revenue.

And it's going to do a lot for our ability to sell an audience as opposed to a site or a position on a site, which is the next step in launching step for a Display. The other thing, the fastest growing area of Display advertising is video. So it's really important for us to not only have video advertising, but interactive video advertising. So that's important. And frankly, when we talk about the four Os, I mean: Video is important; Mobile, of course; local, a lot of advertising is going to go to the local market and we're focused on local with a passion here. So I think there's a lot of areas that we can see with smart selling and product backing up with data and the right modernization platform with apps.

That's a nice growth even if at that puts us in the 15%, 15%-plus range for the entire year, so well within that longer-term 13% to 16% range we want for Display. We're going to continue, as Carol said, to work on the local aspect, video, mobile, social, they're all going to be a big piece of the volume, part of the equation, and then the app side of things, the combined marketplace for C1 and C2, very big in terms of the pricing and visibility there, that capability.

So we feel good about where we're positioned on Display. As for progress, in terms of getting to the operating income goals by 2013, I feel good. I feel that this year, we're getting our cost structure in line. As I said, we're down 12% versus last year, 23% versus 2008. We're not done yet. We're going to keep going. We've got, as you heard at Investor Day, an awful lot of things in the hopper that we're actively working, where many of them, again, streamline us, make us go faster. Carol gave you a number of examples of platforms that we've improved. She talked about the Buffalo data center that's much more economical, in addition to be more a vision to be more eco-friendly. So really, across the board, we've got a lot of initiatives underway that will help us become a much more higher margin business. You look at this year and you see last year, 6% operating margin rate go into 12%, doubling the operating margin. That's terrific progress in one year. Not too much obviously, revenue uplift. So there's not a whole lot of volume leverage in that number. We are going to obviously, as I said, in 2011, I talked about this at Investor Day also, many of the headwinds over the three-year period are much heavier in 2011, but we still are executing on our growth plans.

That will change and start growing in the upside by Q2. By the end of this next year, all of that compare that you're suffering with and we're suffering with, will get cleaned. So all of the stuff I talked about will be off as part of a drag. But the most important things other than trending list and listings around, which we have when we told you the timeframe, the main drag on our growth has been Search revenue. I mean, it's very hard to outgrow, I mean, outperform something that's dropping in the mid- to high-single-digit every quarter. So once we get Search stabilized, which we honestly believe we can, that's why we did this Search deal with Microsoft, we get Search stabilized from a revenue standpoint and start going positive, lifting leads positive and Display in these areas we're talking about in that 15% to 20%, we got an entirely different company here. But you can't basically, if you look at the data from 2004, these growth rates have been falling every year. This is the first year we're going to start seeing an upside relative to the date of the last six years. So 2011 is still going to be kind of messy because of all these compares I just talked about, but once we get to the end of 2011, 2012, you're going to have the correct TAC compared to Microsoft, as we talked earlier. Perhaps hopefully, it's not the full 12%. And all of these other things and us inherently growing our business either with great content or technology acquisition and, of course, with our own inherent growth and of course, Tim just talked about profits. I mean, that -- what we're not trying to do is take so much profit out of here, we can't grow. So we're going to be very, as we told you repeatedly, very careful about that because revenue growth is number one."

Pro-blogging, we put our first News blog, Pro-News blog up six months ago, called the Upshot, and in six months, we've gotten 80 million page views and 7 million minutes -- from 7 million minutes to 270 million minutes. So basically, 80 million page views, 270 million minutes because we put professional blogging on News, and I want to comment more on that in a minute. And then of ours, the bottom of the funnel, if you will, is crowd sourced, and that's what associate content is all about. So better content and then interactivity. I mean one of the problems we've had with our site the last year and a half is, we couldn't get as much interactivity because of our platform problem. So to do a blogging advance was extremely hard engineering feat. Six, eight weeks of recoding and you just can't have that if you're trying to move with the marketplace. So blogging, comments, video, all the ways that one does interaction. If you look at our Yahoo! original videos, year-over-year, UNIX have grown 52%; minutes are up 35%; streams are up 92%. In Europe, the page views on our media properties year-over-year, on average, are up 18%. So the way we're talking about page views and minutes of engagement is great, better content, more interesting, more modern, more interactive."

On today’s call, we’ll discuss how we’re executing on our plan for Yahoo!, talk about our performance during the quarter, answer questions we know are top of mind, and of course as Marta said open",1685,"Thanks, Marta, and thanks everybody for joining us. On today’s call, we’ll discuss how we’re executing on our plan for Yahoo!, talk about our performance during the quarter, answer questions we know are top of mind, and of course as Marta said open the call to Q&A.
Before I get to how we did during the quarter, I want to reiterate our vision for Yahoo!, our plan, and how we’re executing against it. Yahoo! is an innovative technology company that operates the largest digital media, content, and communications business in the world. The key words here are innovative, technology, media, content and communications. That’s what we’re all about.
Technology certainly makes Internet possible, but content and communication is widely used. Content drives everything from search to social network. The creation and curation of content is more important than ever, and will continue to be as the use of Internet grows and evolves.
As for our plan, it revolves around the two things we have always told you, growing our revenue and increasing profitability. Everything we are doing is designed to drive us towards these two goals.
To do that, we’re working to reverse years of decelerating growth. To increase profitability, we have to be extremely focused and efficient, and to grow our revenue, we have to grow our users and engagement.
When I first arrived here almost 21 months ago, we stepped back and took a good look at the company. To deliver higher profitability and stronger growth, we realized we had to make a series of substantial changes. We had to reorganize the company to breakdown silos, so we can move faster, eliminate redundancy, and improve our cost structure. We had to organize and make better use of the incredible amounts of data we collect to improve the user and advertiser experience.
We had to answer the big question about how best to compete in search, which at the time was another declining trend for the company; and we needed to create fundamentally better platforms and infrastructure across the company so we could move more quickly to deliver the kind of quality content and experiences our users and advertisers deserve.
Since then we’ve been working hard to create a stronger, more disciplined and focused company. This also includes making our organization more efficient, more lean, and more nimble.
One byproduct of any change is always movement of people. Some people leave, some get promoted, and some good new people arrive. The most important thing is making sure the right person is in the right job at the right time.
So with that said, what have we done to reengineer Yahoo! First, we partnered with Microsoft in search, and are executing a massive transition of our algo and paid platforms beginning in the U.S. and Canada all on schedule.
Second, we continued to enhance our APT platform to make buying and selling display advertising easier. We’ve been working hard, beginning to move off our old systems. The result of that will be higher yields through better targeting, inventory management, and serving systems. Ultimately, we will be able to combine our Class 1 and Class 2 inventory on APT into a unified marketplace.
Third, we’ve divested parts of the business that did not fit with our vision or our plan for profitability and growth and we acquired companies that did.
Fourth, we are increasing efficiencies bringing down our operating costs by more than $1.1 billion over the past two years.
Fifth, we’ve been working hard to revamp our engineering processes, so we can innovate and get new products out as fast as the market demands.
Sixth, we’re pulling our data out of silos, so we can optimize in conjunction with the technology we use for our content grid in the cloud. The result will be a more personalized experience for users and advertisers that continues to get better and better.
Seventh, we have completely revamped Mail and Messenger to deliver better modern functionality and speed. And lastly, we’ve been working hard to rollout new infrastructures, like our just opened datacenter in New York. That is one of the most advanced environmental friendly in the world. A new platform that allows it to better deliver content and experiences with a focus on local, mobile, social and video.
This last part is especially important because content is a huge driver of engagement for us. Our legacy platforms just weren’t able to scale. It was complex, time consuming, and expensive to get a feature or a product to market.
So we began rebuilding and modernizing our platforms across the entire company to allow us to innovate and rollout new sites, features, and functionality much more quickly. We’ve talked about this with you several times, about the need to improve our underlying infrastructure. This work is ongoing and we expect it to have huge payoffs.
For example, just yesterday, we rolled out our first global platform, News. Our previous news platform was made up of nine different code bases. It maxed out at 24 countries and 12 languages. The cost of adding additional countries and languages were prohibited. We could hardly change anything even here in the U.S.
The new platform by contrast is light years ahead. It’s on one single code base. It’s not limited by the number of countries or languages we can support. In fact, we can bring up new countries in a fraction of the time it used to take.
We can do multiple experiments with content and ad placements in a single day. We can create a new page in less than five minutes as opposed to weeks, and it’s infused with an incredible amount of science and personalization. It’s search-optimized. It runs our content optimization engine and much more.
I met with the teams that worked on this just last week and the engineers and editors are very excited. They can do things they used to only be able to dream of. It will dramatically change the way we innovate. It will improve both our user and advertiser experiences worldwide. That’s just one example, yet it illustrates the point I want to drive home here.
To grow revenue and improve profitability, we have to move forward in a disciplined sequential way. First you walk, then you run, finally you fly. Once we get the right things in place like the new global News platform or the completion of the search transition to Microsoft, we can really fly.
We told you earlier this year on our Q1 call that we expect the majority of our product platform work to be completed by next summer. This includes our efforts to implement the next phase of functionality for our display advertising platform, APT, and our exchange platform, RMX.
So we’re going to be relentlessly pounding away at these and other initiatives we have planned for our users and advertisers in the months to come, and we’re well on our way. As I just told you, we have two main goals increased profitability, reinvigorate revenue growth. Let’s take a look at how these played out during the quarter.
For profitability, we continued to deliver increasing margins and operating income. Operating margins more than doubled for the second quarter in a row to 12% compared with 6% in the third quarter of ‘09.
Excluding restructuring charges from Q3 this year, and last year income from operations grew 80% in the quarter. So we’re seeing very good progress with profitability. This past quarter we delivered revenue near the midpoint of our guidance, which amounted to a 2% increase over last year, driven by 17% growth in O&O display.
Advertisers are clearly impressed by the science, art and scale we can bring to their campaign. It’s a big reason why CBS chose Yahoo! for the online promotion of its fall lineup. The program spanned more than a week and included two homepage and three log-in page placements, in addition to buying out 90% of our entertainment properties. And it’s why companies like State Farm and Dodge recently launched sponsored video entertainment to connect with the consumers they want to reach.
Our team in Asia continues to knock the ball out of the park with the highest year-over-year display growth of our three regions, well ahead of the market. We’re also seeing strong advertiser response to our innovative targeting products like Smart Ads and new ad units like OPA Formats on the log-in page.
So we had results this quarter. Our revenue growth would have been even better if not for two items related to the search transition. First, search campaigns slowed as advertisers waited to move to Microsoft adCenter rather than entering their campaigns twice.
Second, as Tim will explain later, when we transitioned the algo search, the new results were so much better that users clicked on the top organic results more and clicked on paid ads less.
Despite these transitional items, RPS was up roughly 1% over last year and last quarter. The last time RPS was up year-over-year was eight quarters ago in Q3 of ‘08.
We’re also intently focused on growing search volume and we feel very good about the steps we’re taking. Case in point, the first in a series of enhancements of the search experience that we just launched are showing promising results with increases in click-throughs and engagement.
The very good news, as I’ll talk about later in the call, is that we expect the paid search transition in the U.S. and Canada to be completed this month, which will improve the quality of our paid results over time.
In the background of all of this, we also continued to effectively manage our balance sheet. We recognize the value of our assets and believe our stock is undervalued; that’s why this year alone, we bought back more 7% of the company’s stock.
I have more I’d like to share with you about our progress this quarter and some topics I know are on your mind, but first let’s turn the call over to Tim to talk about our Q3 financials in more detail. Tim?

Today’s we’ll address third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook, and also a cosmetic accounting change impacting revenue presentation that’s required as we transition to Microsoft’s paid search platform.Highlig",1978,"Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Today’s we’ll address third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook, and also a cosmetic accounting change impacting revenue presentation that’s required as we transition to Microsoft’s paid search platform.
Highlights of our third quarter performance include 17% O&O display growth, 107% operating income growth and meaningful progress transforming our search business. Let’s begin with an overview of headline revenue, core profitability, and EPS metrics.
Revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $1.601 billion in the third quarter. The difference versus midpoint of our guidance was driven by the divestiture of HotJobs, which was completed in late August, and our algo search transition to Microsoft, which I’ll touch on more in a moment.
Operating income was $189 million more than doubling prior year for the second straight quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding restructuring charges from both years, operating income improved 80% versus third quarter 2009.
GAAP operating margins were 12% for third quarter, again more than double last year’s rate on a reported basis and up more than 500 basis points excluding restructuring.
Finally, EPS grew 126% year-over-year to $0.29 per diluted share. The current quarter included a $0.13 gain from the divestiture of HotJobs and third quarter 2009 included a $0.04 gain from the sale of our direct stake in Alibaba.com. Excluding both of those non-recurring gains, EPS grew 86% year-over-year.
Diving into the top line narrative, let’s begin with another good quarter for owned and operated display. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $465 million led by guaranteed revenue growth of 20%.
Both Americas and Asia Pac display grew strong double-digits, while EMEA grew strong single-digits. From a big picture perspective, quarter end customer dynamics were stronger in September than June.
With respect to category performance in display, revenue in seven of 10 industry segments rose versus last year, with particular strength in retail and technology. Telecom was notably weak.
Turning to search, third quarter O&O search revenue was $331 million, a decline of 7% versus the prior year, but notably flat sequentially. Excluding our paid inclusion ad product, which was discontinued as of January 1, 2010, our search revenue was up 1% year-over-year.
This quarter we saw half of our search categories rise, and half decline with particular strength in auto and retail largely offset by softer results in entertainment and finance.
Operationally, search query volume was flat both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and RPS was up roughly 1% versus both comparisons. That’s the first year-over-year RPS growth we’ve seen since third quarter 2008, an encouraging sign of stabilization. While the RPS trend is improving, it did fall roughly $10 million shy of expectations this quarter, the reasons related to our transition to Microsoft’s algo platform.
Specifically, as users experience fresher and more relevant results on Yahoo! search pages powered by Microsoft, they clicked more on the organic results and less on the paid results lowering RPS. This accounted for the majority of the revenue difference relative to our expectations.
We also noted a search page view decline as users found what they needed faster, and therefore clicked through to the next page of search results less often, lowering volume.
Despite the unfavorable revenue impact in the third quarter, the user experience is clearly better, and we’re confident that will lead to longer term volume and market share improvements.
Likewise our initial tests on Microsoft’s paid search platform are increasing our confidence that once the combined marketplace is fully tuned the RPS uplift will be even greater than originally anticipated.
Moving to our affiliate business revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $557 million. Affiliate TAC rates were in line with what we expected. The traffic acquisition cost as a percentage of total GAAP revenue exceeded our guidance range principally driven by the mix impact related to lower RPS and the HotJobs divestiture.
Finally with respect to our listing leads and fees businesses as expected revenue declined year-over-year by 16% to $248 million. On our last call, we had guided second half revenue for these segments to decline 15% to 20% versus prior year, so we’ve made it at the low end of the range for 3Q despite divesting HotJobs.
That rounds out my comments on revenue for third quarter, so let’s move down the income statement and discuss costs. For the quarter, total expenses less TAC were down 10% versus the prior year to $935 million.
The midpoint of our guidance was $955 million or essentially flat with second quarter, so we’re pleased to have generated roughly $20 million of cost efficiencies versus both prior quarter and the guidance.
We’re making great progress on becoming more efficient and that focus will continue in the upcoming quarters.
Before moving on two cost-related housekeeping notes. Operating reimbursements from Microsoft landed at $81 million for the quarter in line with our guidance. Transition cost reimbursements of $18 million from Microsoft once again were equivalent to the incurred transition cost themselves and consequently the impact to our P&L this quarter was neutral as expected.
Continuing down the income statement, other income this quarter included a pre-tax gain of $186 million related to our disposition of HotJobs. Further down, earnings in equity interest grew 52% compared to last year driven by solid results from both Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba Group.
Finally our effective tax rate was 23% for third quarter. We had guided a range of 35% to 40%, but noted that outstanding discussions with the IRS could reduce our rate to the low 20% range.
The lower rate this quarter stemmed not from the IRS dialogue, but from our ability to offset most of the HotJobs divestiture gain with capital losses we generated in prior years. The IRS dialogue is ongoing and expected now to be resolved in the fourth quarter.
Now let’s take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at just under $3.5 billion. During the quarter, we stepped up our repurchases buying roughly 62 million shares for $868 million and average price of $13.89 per share.
For the year, we’ve repurchased nearly 120 million shares for roughly $1.750 billion, an average price of $14.68 per share. That means we’ve repurchased 7% of the company’s shares since January 1.
Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly $347 million for third quarter and $837 million year-to-date. CapEx was $164 million for third quarter and $467 million year-to-date. We continue to focus on modernizing our datacenter infrastructure to drive operational and cost efficiencies in the coming years.
Finally, as of September 30, the pre-tax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was roughly $10 billion or approximately $7.74 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group’s privately held businesses.
Before moving to fourth quarter outlook, I’d like to take a little time to walk you through how our GAAP revenue will change as we transition our paid search business to Microsoft’s platform.
Transition will include two components. The first is an accounting change that will not have any economic impact on our results. The second of course is the 12% revenue share with Microsoft that you already know about.
Today, we present our revenue on what’s known as a gross basis. That is, we record 100% of the advertisement revenue for our O&O properties, and 100% of the advertising revenue generated on our affiliate sites. As you know, our Affiliate business carries with it substantial traffic acquisition costs or TAC, and for GAAP purposes that TAC is recorded as a cost of revenue on our income statement. As a result, TAC offsets the vast majority of affiliate GAAP revenue, so that the net effect is much smaller.
As the Yahoo! and Yahoo! Affiliate search transactions begin running through Microsoft’s paid search system in each market, accounting guidelines require a change in our GAAP revenue presentation for that market to net basis. That simply means that we will no longer recognize 100% of the advertising revenue generated on affiliate sites, we will only recognize the net revenue after traffic acquisition costs.
Since the newly required accounting will take affect literally market-by-market as we move to Microsoft’s platforms, this transition will take until early 2012. Once we have fully transitioned paid search to Microsoft, our GAAP revenue at that point will look very similar to how our revenue ex-TAC looks today.
In the meantime, we believe it is most helpful and consistent to guide and report our top line on the basis of revenue ex-TAC going forward. Doing so will much more accurately reflect the underlying dynamics of the business, and facilitate comparisons to prior periods.
For a simple example of the impact of both our TAC-related accounting change and the 12% revenue share, please see slide number 14 in the quarterly earnings presentation on our IR Web site.
Now let’s turn to the fourth quarter outlook itself. Revenue ex-TAC is expected to be in the range of $1.125 billion $1.225 billion, this outlook assumes that the paid search transition to Microsoft’s adCenter platform in the U.S. and Canada is complete by the end of October.
And it incorporates our expectation that some of the algo-related RPS and volume shifts we saw in September continue into 4Q. Given the transition timing, we anticipate revenues share to Microsoft to be in the range of $30 million.
It’s important to point out that given the magnitude of the search platform transition we’re undertaking this quarter variability is inherent in our projections, as literally thousands of search advertisers migrate budgets to adCenter and adjust to a larger more liquid marketplace, some of the operational implication and related financial impact are difficult to predict, including those related to our RPS guarantee.
While we believe any adverse volume and RPS dynamics will be transient in nature, caution is warranted nonetheless. We are committed to transparency throughout the transition to Microsoft search platform.
We recognize that this quarter is particularly challenging to model. So we are additionally providing guidance for ex-TAC display revenue to grow 18% to 22% compared to the September quarter. Top half of that range is in line with the seasonal average over the last four years.
As a reminder, when comparing revenue to prior year the search alliance transition, Zimbra and HotJob divestitures, and discontinuance of paid inclusion together represent roughly an 8 point impact on growth.
Shifting to 4Q costs, our total expenses less TAC are expected to be in the range of $925 million to $945 million with the midpoint flat to third quarter despite the upward pressures associated with a higher volume quarter. The operating reimbursements from Microsoft will decline slightly in this quarter and the underlying expenses will be removed from our cost structure.
As a final cost related note, this outlook yields a full year midpoint for total expenses less TAC of $3.765 billion, that’s a 12% reduction from 2009, and a 23% reduction from 2008, and we’re not done yet.
Returning to fourth quarter at the midpoint of our revenue and expense ranges operating income is expected to be $240 million once again double that of the comparable period in 2009. Concluding 4Q guidance, we’re forecasting a 15% to 20% effective tax rate as we expect a number of discrete initiatives to be favorably resolved.
To summarize where we stand financially, we are pleased with our third quarter results, display growth remained healthy, the search transformation is progressing well, and profitability has improved significantly even as we invest to reposition Yahoo! for both greater efficiency and innovation in the coming years.
We also continue to generate significant cash flow and to redeploy funds to benefit shareholders by nearly $1.8 billion of share repurchases year-to-date.
With that, I’ll turn the call back to Carol.

I’d now like to address two areas I know are top of minds for you. A little bit more about the search alliance and our relationship with Alibaba. First, the search alliance; we are making extraordinary progress. As we’ve told you many tim",1132,"Thanks, Tim. I’d now like to address two areas I know are top of minds for you. A little bit more about the search alliance and our relationship with Alibaba. First, the search alliance; we are making extraordinary progress. As we’ve told you many times this is an enormously complex undertaking with tens of thousands of advertisers involved. The fact that this transition continues on schedule says a lot about the talent, skill and determination of the teams here at Yahoo! and Microsoft.
Last month, we completed step one of the transition completing the algo search move to Microsoft for the U.S. and Canada, our biggest marketplace. It happened on the exact day we planned and after the algo switch, we were really pleased to see a big improvement in the freshness and relevance of the search results.
Step two is a transition of paid search in the U.S. and Canada. Over the last two months, we’ve been working closely with our advertisers and their agencies to move their campaigns from Yahoo! to Microsoft’s adCenter.
As a result, 86% of billing transactions are completed, 97% of our premium accounts have transitioned to adCenter, and we’re now more than half way through shifting our Yahoo! search queries to use adCenter. We expect the full shift to be completed on schedule this month.
Step three is running the fully transitioned unified marketplace with Microsoft, enabling our advertisers and publishers to reap the benefits and efficiencies of the larger marketplace. Recall that Yahoo! is exclusively managing the premier search sales and related relationships for the largest advertisers.
This puts us in an important strategic position to advise our advertisers and agencies regarding optimizing their online spend across our large combined search marketplace as well as our display offerings.
Advertisers will in one buy get a full online advertising solution based on Yahoo! superior relationship and user insight. We’ve undertaken immense amount of training for our sales team so they can best anticipate and meet advertiser and publisher needs.
Of course, it’s going to take time to get the marketplace to the state we want it. We’ll need time to fine tune and get the gears to mesh perfectly. It’s a big transition, and advertisers will also need to adjust. There’s a lot for our advertisers to get used to.
For example, Microsoft editorial and trademark policies are different. Some shopping aggregators will have to alter their campaigns significantly to generate the same results. And as advertisers adjust to the new bigger marketplace, we’re expecting to see days when advertisers will literally submit tens of millions of updates, causing some temporary swings in marketplace performance.
Together with Microsoft we plan in advance for these and many other situations. Our teams are ready to work alongside our advertisers, while we aim to deliver a stable marketplace by the holiday season. By Q2 next year, we expect the U.S. marketplace to be fully tuned.
Next up, Alibaba. Yahoo! made the investment in Alibaba five years ago, and it was great foresight by Jerry and the team to invest in a strong local player in the Chinese market. To this day, no other internet company outside of China has done as well with their investment in the country as we have; no one.
I have tremendous respect for Jack Ma, the Alibaba team and what they’ve accomplished. We know there is tremendous value in the businesses they are growing.
It’s an important investment and we’re committed to a good productive business relationship. Beyond that I’m not going to speculate today, or in the future on our investment with them. Just know that as with any investment, we’re focused on maximizing value for shareholders.
Before we close, I’d like to briefly discuss some of our accomplishments last quarter. The main focus is on our content strategy, and how we use mobile, local, social, and video to drive user engagement.
On the search side, we unveiled the first in a series of new, more visually compelling search results for information-rich topics like music, movies and news. We also improved our local search relevance.
With content our recently launched Ask America program is creating a social experience around the News, combining interactive polling with content, enabling users to read about important issues and vote. This kind of unique content experience is something only Yahoo! can do. It’s also leading to impressive engagements. We’ve had more than 7 million votes in a short time the program has been up.
For mobile we launched a raft of new apps. On Android, we released 8 new apps, including the Yahoo! Mobile Homepage, Finance, OMG, Movies, Fantasy Football, Sportacular and more.
On the Apple side, we upgraded the Yahoo! mobile homepage. Released Sportacular for the iPad and iPhone, as well as Fantasy Football and an updated Yahoo Messenger with video chat for the iPhone. Users can now make voice and video calls over 3G and Wi-Fi networks and connect with the PC.
Lastly, we introduced fantastic new mobile experiences for Yahoo! Mail on both the iPhone and Android. Video mail, as you know, it’s a big driver of user engagement. Very soon we’ll launch our new mail beta. It has great new communication, social and photo features, and a lot more. It’s also incredibly fast, which is important to everywhere, but especially in emerging markets where load times are so important to successful adoption.
Lastly our social integration with Twitter will go live with the mail beta. Similar to our integration with Facebook, people who use Yahoo! and Twitter will be able to link their accounts to view and share updates across both networks. It’s one thing to talk about the power of your Yahoo! Mail combined with your Facebook wall and your Twitter Feeds, it’s another to see it in action. We get lots of wows every time we show people the Yahoo! Mail at high speed, fully integrated with their favorite social services; it’s just awesome.
All of these items are part of our plan to grow our revenue and increase profitability. And as I shared earlier, we are solidly executing on that plan, margins are expanding, revenue growth is stabilizing after a long period of decelerating trends. Display advertising continues to grow and is up 18% year-to-date. Product roll-outs are accelerating as we modernize our infrastructure. Our search alliance with Microsoft continues on schedule and more.
At the end of the day Yahoo! is a company with tremendous potential. Our 600 million users and hundreds of thousands of advertisers are testament to that. We’ve a lot more work to do in the months ahead, but we’re clearly making progress, and the payoff I believe and return to our shareholders will be substantial.
So with that let’s open it up to your questions. Operator?

We’re starting to feel certainly better at initial testing that that could be more, so we feel good about that. I’m not going to go out and say how long it will take us to overcome the 12% but over the period, we’re clearly, clearly aiming to grow search revenue. I mean that’s one of the big reasons we did this deal. It’s RPS uplift from the bigger in more liquid marketplace and we’re innovating like crazy on search to improve volume.

The other thing, the fastest growing area of display advertising is video, so it’s really important for us to not only have video advertising, but interactive video advertising, so that’s important. Frankly, when we talk about the four Os, I mean, video is important, mobile of course, local, a lot of advertising is going to go to the local market, and we’re focused on local with a passion here. So I think there is a lot of areas that we can see with smart selling and product backing up with data and the right monetization platform with APT, I think we see a lot of ability to move forward on display in the next two years.

That’s the highest of any of the last four or five years that we’ve seen. I think there was a tremendous kind of upward pressure in the economy at that point, so it was a little bit unusual. Against that tougher comp, we think we’re still performing well. As you observed, we’ll be in the double-digits, that’s some nice growth. Even at that, it puts us in the 15%, 15% plus range for the entire year, so well within that longer term 13% to 16% range we want the display.
We’re going to continue, as Carol said, to work on the local aspect, video, mobile, social, they’re all going to be a piece of the volume part of the equation, and then the APT side of things, the combined marketplaces for C1 and C2, very big in terms of the pricing and visibility there, that capability. So we feel good about the yield side too, especially as we continue to leverage as we’ve said our science, art and scale, and work with the really big customers and the big branded campaigns. So, we feel good about where we’re positioned on display.
As for progress, in terms of getting to the operating income goals by 2013, I feel good. I feel that this year we’re getting our cost structure in line as I said, we’re down 12% versus last year, 23% versus 2008. We are not done yet; we’re going to keep going, as you heard at Investor Day an awful lot of things in offer that we’re actively working. We’re many of them, again, streamline us make us go faster Carol gave you number of examples of platforms that we’ve improved. She talked about the Buffalo Data Center that’s much more economical in addition to be more eco-friendly.
So really across the board we’ve got a lot of initiatives underway that will help us become a much more higher margin business. You look at this year and you see last year’s 6% operating margin rate going to 12%, doubling the operating margin that’s terrific progress in one year. Not too much obviously revenue uplift, so there is not a whole lot of volume leverage in that number.
We are going to obviously as I said in 2011, I talked about this at Investor Day also, many of the headwinds over the three year period are much heavier in 2011, but we still are executing on our growth plans and over the period we feel great about our ability to leverage off the investments that we’re making last year and this year to get where we need to for 2013.

As you guys know we made several very deliberate decisions, whether that was Zimbra, Personal, HotJobs, paid inclusion, revenue we didn’t like on the mail pages and so forth to clean up our market place and to make some definitive decisions about what kind of company we wanted to be. We also are listing, keep listing small business as we’ve been telling you and you can see is has been falling in that 15% to 20% range.
Let me comment on that one first. That will change and start going in the upside by Q2. By the end of this next year all of that compare that you’re suffering with and we’re suffering with will get clean. So all of the stuff I talked about will be off as part of a drag but the most important thing other than turning, lease and listing around which we have and we told you the timeframe. The main drag on our growth has been search revenue. I mean it’s very hard to outgrow I mean outperform something is dropping in the mid to high single digits every quarter.
So one, we get search stabilized which we honestly believe we can that’s why we did the search deal with Microsoft we get search stabilized from a revenue standpoint and start going positive, listing leads, positive and display in these areas we’re talking about in that 15% to 20% we’ve got a entirely different company here. But you can’t basically I mean if you look at the data from 2004, these growth rates have been falling every year. This is the first year; we’re going to start seeing an upside relative to the data over the last six years.
So 2011 is still going to be kind of messy because of all these compares I just talked about. Once we get to the end of 2011, 2012, we’re going to have the correct TAC compared to Microsoft and as we talked earlier perhaps hopefully if not the full 12% and all of these other things and us inherently growing our business either with great content or technology acquisitions and of course with our own inherent growth and of course Tim just talked about profits. I mean that, what we’re not trying to do is take so much profit out of here we can’t grow. So we’re going to be very - as we told you repeatedly, very careful about that, because revenue growth is number one.

We think of content, I think of it as sort of a content stack that at the top is our own original content, our original voice which we have some of the best editorial talent in the online space.
And of course license content, you know our deals with the various, AP, Reuters etc., Pro-blogging, we put our first news blog, pro-news blog up six months ago, called the Upshot, and in six months we’ve gotten from seven million minutes to 270 million minutes. So basically, 80 million page views, 270 million minutes, because we put professional blogging on News, and I want to comment more on that in a minute.
And then of course the bottom of the funnel, if you will, is crowd sourced, and that’s what associate content is all about. So better content and then interactivity, I mean, one of the problems we’ve had with our site, the last year and a half is we couldn’t get as much interactivity because of our platform problem. So to do a blogging event was extremely hard engineering feet, six to eight weeks of recoding and you just can’t have that if you’re trying to move with the marketplace. So blogging, comments, video, all the way that one does interaction.
If you look at our Yahoo! original videos, year-over-year uniques have grown 52%, minutes are up 35%, streams are up 92%. In Europe the page views on our media properties year-over-year on average are up 18%. So the way, we’re talking about page views and minutes of engagement is great, better content, more interesting, more modern, more interactive.

And secondly, Carol, are you concerned that you are losing ground on the display advertising? I think Google talked about doing $2.5 billion run rate gross revenue on display. Some of the press report we see that Facebook and some of the smaller companies are growing faster, so are you concerned that in next 12 months to 15 months we might have a situation that you are losing ground on the display?

Absolutely, there is more to go, and there is a whole lot more of shifting cost out of places we’re investing today and into places that will generate better returns for us tomorrow.
So, look, we’re expanding margins, absent a lot of the headwinds we’ve talked about, we’re beginning to see a lot of things going in the right direction on revenue, display revenue being up again at the midpoint right around 15 points percent for the year is a good indication of that.
So, the best way for those metrics, as I call derivative metrics that you just referenced to get better is to us, just keep executing on our plan of getting into growth mode on revenue, letting that work through the bad comparisons, things will get better, and just dividing by headcount doesn’t do a whole lot for me, but as we see margins expand, and especially expand in this 18% to 24% range, we’ll feel terrific about it.

So, that’s what we talk about science, art and scale, because it is not only scale which clearly the two competitors you have mentioned have.
But it’s our unique ability to work with these large advertisers for great campaign to use the science and data we have to allow them to reach their intended consumer as perfectly as possible.

On today's call, we'll discuss how we're executing on our plan for Yahoo!, talk about our performance during the quarter, answer questions we know are top of mind and of course, as Marta said open the call to Q&A.
Before I get to how we did during the quarter, I want to reiterate our vision for Yahoo!, our plan and how we're executing against it. Yahoo! is an innovative technology company that operates the largest digital media, content and communications business in the world. The key words here are innovative, technology, media, content and communications. That's what we're all about. 
Technology certainly makes the Internet possible, but content and communication is why we use it. Content drives everything from search to social networks. The creation and curation of content is more important than ever and will continue to be, as the use of the Internet grows and evolves.
As for our plan, it revolves around the two things we have always told you, growing our revenue and increasing profitability. Everything we're doing is designed to drive us towards these two goals. To do this, we're working to reverse years of decelerating growth. To increase profitability, we have to be extremely focused and efficient. And to grow our revenue, we have to grow our users and engagement.
When I first arrived here almost 21 months ago, we stepped back and took a good look at the company. To deliver higher profitability and stronger growth, we realized we had to make a series of substantial changes. We had to reorganize the company to break down silos so we can move faster, eliminate redundancy and improve our cost structure. We had to organize and make better use of the incredible amounts of data we collect to improve the user and advertiser experience. 
We had to answer the big question about how best to compete in Search, which at the time, was another declining trend for the company. And we needed to create fundamentally better platforms and infrastructure across the company so we could move more quickly to deliver the kind of quality content and experiences our users and advertisers deserve.
Since then, we've been working hard to create a stronger, more disciplined and focused company. This also includes making our organization more efficient, more lean and more nimble. One by-product of any change is all with movement of people. Some people leave, some get promoted and some good new people arrive. The most important thing is making sure the right person is in the right job at the right time. So with that said, what have we done to reengineer Yahoo!?
First, we partnered with Microsoft on Search and are executing a massive transition of our algo [algorithmic] and paid platforms beginning in the U.S. and Canada, all on schedule. Second, we continued to enhance our apps platform to make buying and selling Display advertising easier. We've been working hard, beginning to move off our old systems. The result of that will be higher yields through better targeting, inventory management and serving systems. Ultimately, we'll be able to combine our class one and class two inventory on apps into a unified marketplace.
Third, we've divested parts of the business that did not fit with our vision or our plans for profitability and growth, and we acquired companies that did. Fourth, we're increasing efficiencies bringing down our operating costs by more than $1.1 billion over the past two years. Fifth, we've been working hard to revamp our engineering processes so we can innovate and get new products out as fast as the market demands. Sixth, we're pulling on data out of silos, so we can optimize and in conjunction with the technology we use for our content grid in the cloud. The result will be a more personalized experience for users and advertisers that continues to get better and better.
Seventh, we have completely revamped Mail and Messenger to deliver better, modern functionality and speed. And lastly, we've been working hard to roll out new infrastructure like our just opened data center in New York, that is one of the most advanced environmental friendly in the world. A new platform that allows to better deliver content and experiences with a focus on local, mobile, social and video.
This last part is especially important because content is a huge driver of engagement for us. Our legacy platforms just weren't able to scale. It was complex, time-consuming and expensive to get a feature or product to market. So we began rebuilding and modernizing our platforms across the entire company to allow us to innovate and rollout new sites, features and functionality much more quickly. We talked about this with you several times, about the need to improve our underlying infrastructure. This work is ongoing and we expect it to have huge payoffs.
For example, just yesterday, we rolled out our first global platform, News. Our previous News platform was made up of nine different code bases. It maxed out at 24 countries and 12 languages. The cost of adding additional countries and languages were prohibitive. We could hardly change anything even here in the U.S. 
The new platform by contrast is light-years ahead, it's on one single code base. It's not limited by the number of countries and languages we can support. In fact,, we can bring up new countries in a fraction of the time it used take. We can do multiple experiments with content and ad placements in a single day. We can create a new page in less than five minutes as opposed to weeks. And it's infused with an incredible amount of science and personalization. It's search optimized, it runs our content optimization engine and much more.
I met with the teams that worked on this just last week and the engineers and editors are very excited. They can do things they used to only be able to dream of. It will dramatically change the way we innovate. It will improve both our user and advertiser experiences worldwide. 
That's just one example, yet it illustrates the point I want to drive home here. To grow revenue and improve profitability, we have to move forward in a disciplined sequential way. First you walk, then you run, finally you fly. Once we get the right things in place, like the new global News platform or the completion of the Search transition in Microsoft, we can really fly.
We told you earlier this year on our Q1 call that we expect the majority of our product platform work to be completed by next summer. This includes our efforts to implement the next phase of functionality for our Display Advertising platform app, and our Exchange platform, RMX. So we're going to be relentlessly pounding away at these and other initiatives we have planned for our users and advertisers in the months to come, and we're well on our way.
As I just told you, we have two main goals: Increase profitability, reinvigorate revenue growth. Let's take a look at how these played out during the quarter.
For profitability, we continue to deliver increasing margins and operating income. Operating margins more than doubled for the second quarter in a row to 12% compared with 6% in the third quarter of '09. Excluding restructuring charges from Q3 this year and last year, income from operations grew 80% in the quarter. So we are seeing very good progress with profitability. 
This past quarter, we delivered revenue near the midpoint of our guidance, which amounted to a 2% increase over last year, driven by 17% growth in O&O display. Advertisers are clearly impressed by the science, art and scale we can bring to their campaign. It's a big reason why CBS chose Yahoo! for the online promotion of its fall lineup. The program spanned more than a week and included two Home page and three Login page placements, in addition to buying out 90% of our Entertainment properties. And it's why companies like State Farm and Dodge recently launched sponsored video entertainment to connect with the consumers they want to reach.
Our team in Asia continues to knock the ball out of the park with the highest year-over-year Display growth of our three regions, well ahead of the market. We're also seeing strong advertiser response to our innovative targeting products like Smart adds, and new ad units like OPA formats in the Login page. 
So we have solid results this quarter. Our revenue growth would've been even better if not for two items related to the Search transition. First, Search campaigns slowed as advertisers waited to move to Microsoft adCenter rather than entering their campaigns twice. And second, as Tim will explain later, when we transitioned to our algo search, the new results were so much better that users clicked on the top organic results more and clicked on paid ads less. Despite these transitional items, RPS was up roughly 1% over last year and last quarter. The last time RPS was up year-over-year was eight quarters ago in Q3 of '08.
We are also intently focused on growing Search volume and we feel very good about the steps we're taking. Case in point, the first in a series of enhancements to the Search experience that we just launched are showing promising results with increases in click throughs and engagement. 
The very good news as I'll talk about later in the call, is that we expect the paid Search transition in the U.S. and Canada to be completed this month, which will improve the quality of our paid results over time. In the background of all of this, we also continued to effectively manage our balance sheet. We recognize the value of our assets and believe our stock is undervalued. That's why this year alone, we bought back more than 7% of the company stock.
I have more like I'd to share with you about our progress this quarter and some topics I know are on your mind, but first, let's turn the call over to Tim to talk about our Q3 financials in more detail. Tim?"

Today we'll address third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook and also a cosmetic accounting change impacting revenue presentation that's required as we transition to Microsoft's paid search platform. Highlights of our t",1976,"Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Today we'll address third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook and also a cosmetic accounting change impacting revenue presentation that's required as we transition to Microsoft's paid search platform. Highlights of our third quarter performance include 17% O&O Display growth, 107% operating income growth and meaningful progress transforming our Search business.
Let's begin with an overview of headline revenue, core profitability and EPS metrics. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $1,601,000,000 in the third quarter. The difference versus midpoint of our guidance was driven by the divestitures of HotJobs, which was completed in late August, in our algo search transition to Microsoft, which I'll touch on more in a moment. 
Operating income was $189 million, more than doubling prior year for the second straight quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding restructuring charges from both years, operating income improved 80% versus third quarter 2009. GAAP operating margins were 12% for third quarter, again, more than double last year's rate on a reported basis and up more than 500 basis points, excluding restructuring. 
Finally, EPS grew 126% year-over-year to $0.29 per diluted share. The current quarter included a $0.13 gain from the divestiture of HotJobs and third quarter 2009 included a $0.04 gain from the sale of our direct stake in AliBaba.com. Excluding both of those nonrecurring gains, EPS grew 86% year-over-year.
Diving into the top line narrative, let's begin with another good quarter for Owned and Operated Display. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $465 million, led by guaranteed revenue growth of 20%. Both Americas and Asia-Pac Display grew strong double digits, while EMEA grew strong single digits. From a big picture perspective, quarter-end customer dynamics were stronger in September than June.
With respect to category performance in Display, revenue in seven of 10 industry segments rose versus last year, with particular strength in retail and technology, telecom was notably weak. Turning to Search, third quarter O&O Search revenue was $331 million, a decline of 7% versus the prior year, but notably flat sequentially. Excluding our paid inclusion ad product, which is discontinued as of January 1, 2010, our Search revenue was up 1% year-over-year. This quarter, we saw half of our Search categories rise and half decline, with particular strength in auto and retail, largely offset by softer results in Entertainment and Finance.
Operationally, search query volume was flat both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and RPS was up roughly 1% versus both comparisons. That's the first year-over-year RPS growth we've seen since third quarter 2008, an encouraging sign of stabilization. While the RPS trend is improving, it did fall roughly $10 million shy of expectations this quarter for reasons related to our transition to Microsoft's algo platform. Specifically, as users experienced fresher and more relevant results on Yahoo!'s Search pages powered by Microsoft, they clicked more on the organic result and less on the paid results, lowering RPS. This accounted for the majority of the revenue difference relative to our expectations.
We also noted a Search page view decline as users found what a needed faster and therefore, clicked through to the next page of Search results less often, lowering volume. Despite the unfavorable revenue impact in the third quarter, the user experience is clearly better and we're confident that will lead to longer-term volume and market share improvements. Likewise, our initial test on Microsoft's paid search platform are increasing our confidence that once the combined marketplace is fully tuned, the RPS uplift will be even greater than originally anticipated.
Moving to our Affiliate business. Revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $557 million. Affiliate tax rates were in line with what we expected, the traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of total GAAP revenue exceeded our guidance range principally driven by the mixed impact related to lower RPS and the HotJobs divestiture. 
Finally, with respect to our Listing, Leads and Fees businesses, as expected, revenue declined year-over-year by 16% to $248 million. On our last call, we had guided second half revenue for these segments to decline 15% to 20% versus prior year, so we landed at the low end of the range for 3Q despite divesting HotJobs.
That rounds out my comment on revenue for third quarter. So let's move down the income statement and discuss costs. For the quarter, total expenses less TAC were down 10% versus the prior year to $935 million. The midpoint of our guidance was $955 million or essentially flat to the second quarter, so we're pleased to have generated roughly $20 million of cost efficiencies versus both prior quarter and guidance. We're making great progress on becoming more efficient and that focus will continue in the upcoming quarters.
Before moving on, two cost related housekeeping rules. Operating reimbursements from Microsoft landed at $81 million for the quarter, in line with our guidance. Transition cost reimbursements of $18 million from Microsoft, once again, were equivalent to the incurred transition cost themselves and consequently, the impact to our P&L this quarter was neutral as expected. Continuing down the income statement, other income this quarter included a pre-tax gain of $186 million related to our disposition of HotJobs. Farther down, earnings and equity interest grew 52% compared to last year, driven by solid results from both Yahoo! Japan and AliBaba group.
Finally, our effective tax rate was 23% for third quarter. We had guided a range of 35% to 40%, but noted that outstanding discussions with the IRS could reduce our rate to the low 20% range. The lower rate this quarter stemmed not from the IRS dialogue, but from our ability to offset most of the HotJobs divestiture gain with capital losses we generated in prior years. The IRS dialogue is ongoing and expected now to be resolved in the fourth quarter.
Now let's take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at just under $3.5 billion. During the quarter, we stepped up our repurchases, buying roughly 62 million shares for $868 million in average price of $13.89 per share. For the year, we've repurchased nearly 120 million shares for roughly $1,750,000,000, an average price of $14.68 per share. That means we have repurchased 7% of the company's shares since January 1.
Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly $347 million for third quarter and $837 million year-to-date. CapEx was $164 million for third quarter and $467 million year-to-date. We continue to focus on modernizing our data center infrastructure to drive operational and cost efficiencies in the coming years.
Finally, as of September 30, the pre-tax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in AliBaba.com was roughly $10 billion or approximately $7.74 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of AliBaba groups privately held businesses.
Before moving to fourth quarter outlook, I'd like to take a little time to walk you through how our GAAP revenue will change as we transition our paid Search business to Microsoft's platform. Transition will include two components. The first is an accounting change that will not have any economic impact on our results. The second, of course, is the 12% revenue share with Microsoft that you already know about. 
Today, we present our revenue on what's known as a growth's basis. That is we record 100% of the advertising revenue for our O&O properties and 100% of the advertising revenue generated on our Affiliate sites. As you know, our Affiliate business carries with it a substantial traffic acquisition costs or TAC, and for GAAP purposes, that TAC is recorded as a cost of revenue on our income statement. As a result, TAC offsets the vast majority of Affiliate GAAP revenue so that the net effect is much smaller.
As the Yahoo! and Yahoo! affiliates Search transactions begin running through Microsoft's paid search system in each market, accounting guidelines require a change in our GAAP-revenue presentation for that market to net basis. That simply means that we will no longer recognize 100% of the advertising revenue generated on Affiliate sites. We will only recognize the net revenue after traffic acquisition costs.
Since the newly required accounting will take effect literally market by market as we move to Microsoft's platforms, this transition will take until early 2012. Once we have fully transitioned paid Search Microsoft, our GAAP revenue at that point will look very similar to how our revenue x TAC looks today. In the meantime, we believe it is most helpful and consistent to guide and report our top line on the basis of revenue x TAC going forward. Doing so, will much more accurately reflect the underlying dynamics of the business and facilitate comparisons to prior periods.
For a simple example of the impact of both our TAC related accounting change and the 12% revenue share, please see Slide #14 in the quarterly earnings presentation on our IR website.
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter outlook itself. Revenue x TAC is expected to be in the range of $100,125,000,000 to $1,225,000,000. This outlook assumes that the paid search transition to Microsoft's adCenter platform in the U.S. and Canada is complete by the end of October, and it incorporates our expectation that some of the algo related RPS and volume shifts we saw in September continue into 4Q. Given the transition timing, we anticipate revenue share to Microsoft to be in the range of $30 million.
It's important to find out that given the magnitude of the Search platform transition we're undertaking this quarter, variability is inherent in our projections, as literally thousands of search advertisers migrate budgets to adCenter and adjust to a larger, more liquid marketplace, some of the operational implications and related financial impact are difficult to predict, including those related to our RPS guarantee. While we believe in the adverse volume in RPS dynamics will be transient in nature, caution is warranted nonetheless.
We're committed to transparency throughout the transition of Microsoft search platforms. We recognize that this quarter is particularly challenging to model. So we are additionally providing guidance for x TAC Display revenue to grow 18% to 22% compared to the September quarter. The top half of that range is in line with the seasonal average over the last four years. As a reminder, when comparing revenue to prior year, the Search Alliance transition and HotJobs divestitures and discontinuance of paid inclusion, together represent roughly an eight-point impact on growth.
Shifting to 4Q costs. Our total expenses less TAC are expected to be in the range of $925 million to $945 million, with a midpoint flat to third quarter despite the upward pressures associated with the higher volume quarter. The operating reimbursements from Microsoft will decline slightly this quarter and the underlying expenses will be removed from our cost structure. As a final cost-related note, this outlook yields a full year midpoint for total expenses less TAC of $3,765,000,000. That's a 12% reduction from 2009 and a 23% reduction from 2008. And we're not done yet.
Returning to fourth quarter, at the midpoint of our revenue and expense ranges, operating income is expected to be $240 million, once again double that of the comparable period in 2009. Concluding 4Q guidance, we're forecasting a 15% to 20% effective tax rate as we expect a number of discrete initiatives to be favorably resolved. To summarize where we stand financially, we're pleased with our third quarter results. Display growth remained healthy, the Search transformation is progressing well and profitability has improved significantly, even as we invest to reposition Yahoo! for both greater efficiency and innovation in the coming years.
We also continue to generate significant cash flow and to redeploy funds to benefit shareholders by nearly $1.8 billion of share repurchases year-to-date. With that, I'll turn the call back to Carol."

I'd now like to address two areas I know are on top of mind for you, a little bit more about the Search Alliance and our relationship with AliBaba. First, the Search Alliance.

I'd now like to address two areas I know are on top of mind for you, a little bit more about the Search Alliance and our relationship with AliBaba. First, the Search Alliance. We're making extraordinary progress. As we told you many times, this is an enormously complex undertaking with tens of thousands of advertisers involved. The fact that this transition continues on schedule says a lot about the talent, skill and determination of the teams here at Yahoo! and Microsoft.
Last month, we completed step one of the transition, completing the algo search move to Microsoft for the U.S. and Canada, our biggest marketplace. It happened on the exact date we planned. And after the algo switch, we were really pleased to see a big improvement in the freshness and relevance of the search results. 
Step two was a transition of paid search in the U.S. and Canada. Over the last two months, we've been working closely with our advertisers and their agencies to move their campaigns from Yahoo! to Microsoft's adCenter. As a result, 86% of billing transactions are completed, 97% of our premium accounts have transitioned to adCenter, and we're now more than halfway through shifting our Yahoo! search queries to use adCenter. We expect the full shift to be completed on schedule this month.
Step three is running a fully transitioned unified market place with Microsoft, enabling our advertisers and publishers to recap the benefits and efficiencies of the larger marketplace. Recall that Yahoo! is exclusively managing the premier search sales and related relationships for the largest advertisers. This puts us in an important strategic position to advise our advertisers and agencies regarding optimizing their online spend across our large combined search marketplace, as well as our Display offerings. Advertisers will in one buy, get a full online advertising solution based on Yahoo!'s superior relationship and user insights. We've undertaken a immense amount of training for our sales team so they can best anticipate and meet advertiser and publisher needs.
Of course, it's going to take time to get the marketplace to the state we wanted. We need time to  fine tune and get the gears to mesh perfectly. It's a big transition and advertisers will also need to adjust. There's a lot for our advertisers to get used to. For example, Microsoft editorial and trademark policies are different. Some shopping aggregators will have to alter their campaign significantly to generate the same results. And as advertisers adjust to the new bigger marketplace, we're expecting to see days when advertisers will literally submit tens of millions of updates, causing some temporary swings in marketplace performance. Together with Microsoft, we plan in advance for these and many other situations. Our teams are ready to work alongside our advertisers while we aim to deliver a stable marketplace by the holiday season. By Q2 next year, we expect the U.S. marketplace to be fully tuned.
Next up, AliBaba. Yahoo! made the investment in AliBaba five years ago and it was great foresight by Jerry and the team to invest in a strong, local player in the Chinese market. To this day, no other Internet company outside of China has done as well with their investment in the country as we have, no one. Our tremendous respect for Jack Ma, the AliBaba team and what they have accomplished. We know there's tremendous value in the businesses they're growing. It's an important investment and we're committed to a good, productive business relationship.
Beyond that I'm not going to speculate today or in the future on our investment with them. Just know that as with any investment we're focused on maximizing value for shareholders.
Before we close, I'd like to briefly discuss some of our accomplishments last quarter. The main focus is on our content strategy and how we use mobile, local, social and video to drive user engagement. On the Search side, we unveiled the first in a series of new, more visually compelling search results for information rich topics like music, movies and news. We also improved our local search relevance. With content, our recently launched Ask America program is creating a social experience around the News, combining interactive polling with content, enabling users to read about important issues and vote. This kind of unique content experience is something only Yahoo! can do. It's also leading to impressive engagements. We've had more than 7 million votes in the short time the program has been up.
For Mobile, we launched a raft of new apps. On Android, we released eight new apps including the Yahoo! Mobile Home page, Finance, OMG, Movies, Fantasy Football, Sportacular and more. On the Apple side we upgraded the Yahoo! Mobile Home page, released Sportacular to the iPad and iPhone, as well as Fantasy Football, and an updated Yahoo! Messenger, with video chat for the iPhone. Users can now make voice and video calls over 3G and Wi-Fi networks and connect with the PC.
And lastly, we introduced fantastic new mobile experiences for Yahoo! Mail on both the iPhone and Android. Speaking of Mail, as you know, it's a big driver of user engagement. Very soon, we'll launch our new Mail beta. It has great new communications, social and photo features, and a lot more. It's also incredibly fast, which is important everywhere but especially in emerging markets where load times are so important to successful adoption. 
And lastly, our social integration with Twitter will go live with the Mail beta. Similar to our integration with Facebook, people who use Yahoo! and Twitter will be able to link their accounts to view and share updates across both networks. It's one thing to talk about the power of your Yahoo! Mail combined with your Facebook wall and your Twitter feeds, it's another to see it in action. We get lots of wows every time we show people their Yahoo! Mail at high speed, fully integrated with their favorite social services. It's just awesome.
All of these items are part of our plan to grow our revenue and increase profitability. And as I shared earlier, we're solidly executing on that plan. Margins are expanding, revenue growth is stabilizing after a long period of decelerating trends. Display advertising continues to grow and it's up 18% year-to-date. Product rollouts are accelerating as we modernize our infrastructure. Our Search Alliance with Microsoft continues on schedule and more.
At the end of the day, Yahoo! is a company with tremendous potential. Our 600 million users and hundreds of thousands of advertisers are a testament to that. We have a lot more work to do in the months ahead, but we're clearly making progress. And the payoff, I believe, in return to our shareholders will be substantial. So with that, let's open it up to your questions. Operator?"

Your Display Ad business comped easier at six points in Q3 versus Q2, on a year-on-year basis revenues decelerated 17% growth, and I guess following up on what even Mark said, just the sequential growth of the year-on-year growth seems to be by 11% to 12%. Are you seeing just less improvement in pricing or is it that you need to build up your video ad capability since that is an important and rapidly growing piece of the business? How do you get back into the growth rate range that we've been seeing in Display, which is about 15% in that business as you look ahead over the next year to two years? And then second, I know that, obviously, the model is changing a bit with the Microsoft deal, but you talked about 7% to 10% revenue growth from 11% to 13%. Something like 18% to 24% operating margins, that implies about $1.6 billion in operating profits. I guess can you talk about how you're progressing thus far against that metric in 2013?"

That's the highest of any of the last four or five years that we've seen. I think there was a tremendous kind of upward pressure in the economy at that point. So it's a little bit unusual. Up against that tougher comp, we think we're still performing well. As you observe, we'll be in the double digits. That's a nice growth even if at that puts us in the 15%, 15%-plus range for the entire year, so well within that longer-term 13% to 16% range we want for Display. We're going to continue, as Carol said, to work on the local aspect, video, mobile, social, they're all going to be a big piece of the volume, part of the equation, and then the app side of things, the combined marketplaces for C1 and C2, very big in terms of the pricing and visibility there, that capability. So we feel good about the yield side too, especially as we continue to leverage, as we've said our science, art and scale and work with the really big customers on the big-branded campaign. So we feel good about where we're positioned on Display. As for progress, in terms of getting to the operating income goals by 2013, I feel good. I feel that this year, we're getting our cost structure in line. As I said, we're down 12% versus last year, 23% versus 2008. We're not done yet. We're going to keep going. We've got, as you heard at Investor Day, an awful lot of things in the hopper that we're actively working, where many of them, again, streamline us, make us go faster. Carol gave you a number of examples of platforms that we've improved. She talked about the Buffalo data center that's much more economical, in addition to be more envisioned to be more eco-friendly. So really, across the board, we've got a lot of initiatives underway that will help us become a much more higher margin business. You look at this year and you see last year, 6% operating margin rate go into 12%, doubling the operating margin. That's terrific progress in one year on not too much obviously, revenue uplift. So there's not a whole lot of volume leverage in that number. We are going to obviously, as I said, in 2011, I talked about this at Investor Day also, many of the headwinds over the three-year period are much heavier in 2011, but we still are executing on our growth plans. And over the period, we feel great about our ability to leverage off of the investments that we're making this year, last year and this year, to get to where we need to go for 2013."

As you guys know, we made several very deliberate decisions. Whether that was Zimbra, Personals, HotJobs, paid inclusion, revenue we didn't like on the Mail pages and so forth, to clean up our marketplace and to make some definitive decisions about what kind of company we wanted to be. We also -- Listings, leads listings of small business as we've been telling you, and you can see it has been following in that 15% to 20% range. So let me comment on that one first. That will change and start going in the upside by Q2. By the end of this next year, all of that compare that you're suffering with and we're suffering with, will get clean. So all of the stuff I talked about will be off as part of a drag. But the most important things other than turning leads and listings around, which we have when we told you the timeframe, the main drag on our growth has been Search revenue. I mean, it's very hard to outgrow, I mean, outperform something that's dropping in the mid- to high-single-digit every quarter. So once we get Search stabilized, which we honestly believe we can, that's why we did this Search deal with Microsoft, we get Search stabilized from a revenue standpoint and start going positive, lifting leads positive and Display in these areas we're talking about in that 15% to 20%, we got an entirely different company here. But you can't basically, if you look at the data from 2004, these growth rates have been falling every year. This is the first year we're going to start seeing an upside relative to the date of the last six years. So 2011 is still going to be kind of messy because of all these compares I just talked about, but once we get to the end of 2011, 2012, you're going to have the correct TAC compared to Microsoft, as we talked earlier. Perhaps hopefully, it's not the full 12%. And all of these other things and us inherently growing our business either with great content or technology acquisition and, of course, with our own inherent growth and of course, Tim just talked about profits. I mean, that -- what we're not trying to do is take so much profit out of here, we can't grow. So we're going to be very, as we told you repeatedly, very careful about that because revenue growth is number one."

I actually think there's two big areas of engagement and one is better content, more content, more interesting content. And we think of content, I think of it as sort of a content stack that is the top is our own original content, our original voice, which we have some of the best editorial talent in the online space and of course, licensed content, you know our deals with the various AP lawyers, et cetera. Pro-blogging, we put our first News blog, Pro-News blog up six months ago, called the Upshot, and in six months, we've gotten 80 million page views and 7 million minutes -- from 7 million minutes to 270 million minutes. So basically, 80 million page views, 270 million minutes because we put professional blogging on News, and I want to comment more on that in a minute. And then of course, the bottom of the funnel, if you will, is crowd sourced, and that's what social content is all about. So better content and then interactivity. I mean one of the problems we've had with our site the last year and a half is, we couldn't get as much interactivity because of our platform problem. So to do a blogging advance was a extremely hard engineering feat. Six, eight weeks of recoding and you just can't have that if you're trying to move with the marketplace. So blogging, comments, video, all the ways that one does interaction. If you look at our Yahoo! original videos, year-over-year, UNIX have grown 52%; minutes are up 35%; streams are up 92%. In Europe, the page views on our media properties year-over-year, on average, are up 18%. So the way we're talking about page views and minutes of engagement is great, better content, more interesting, more modern, more interactive."

And there's a whole lot more of shifting cost out of places we're investing today and into places that will generate better returns for us tomorrow. So look, we're expanding margins, we're -- absent a lot of the headwinds we've talked about, we're beginning to see a lot of thing going the right direction on revenue, Display revenue, being up again at the midpoint, right around 15%-plus for the year is a good indication on that. So the best way for those metrics is, as I call them, derivative metrics, that you just referenced to get better is to us to just keep executing on our plan of getting into growth mode on revenue, letting that work through the bad comparisons. Things will get better, and dividing by headcount doesn't do a whole lot for me, but as we see the margins expand, and especially expand to this 18% to 24% range, I will feel terrific about it."

So that's why we talk about science, art and scale. Because it is not only scale, which clearly, the two competitors you have mentioned, have.
