We are pleased to report full year operating and financial results in what has been and continues to be a challenging environment. In a year",1252,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter and year end 2009 earnings call. We are pleased to report full year operating and financial results in what has been and continues to be a challenging environment. In a year of significant industry change, we are pleased to have approximately $1.3 million net subscriber additions in the year, a 24% growth in our subscriber base from 2008, and which represents the fourth year in which we have reported over $1 million net additions.We grew our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA by 27% and 22%, respectively, year over year. Our core markets' adjusted EBITDA has well over $1 billion for the first time ever. With our concurrent launches of the New York and Boston metropolitan areas in early 2009, and the company launched the year expenses, our year end consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $956 million, another record for the company. Earlier in 2009, we made our already strong balance sheet stronger by issuing additional senior notes, as a result of our year-end balance sheet and cash position is very strong.During the year, we also have increased our coverage in existing metropolitan areas including significant expansions in Dallas, Detroit and Northern Florida among others. Importantly, we have also expanded our strategic agreements with other wireless providers last year, enabling our subscribers to roam on their networks, covering a population of over $210 million, providing nationwide coverage for our subscribers.Looking briefly at our market segments, our core markets continue to grow for the full year 2009. Our recently launched Northeast markets performed well. And we are pleased with the network quality and the performance of our extensive DAS [distributed antenna system] networks throughout these metropolitan areas. Importantly, we have done all this while continuing to manage one of the lowest cost networks of any U.S. carrier. Our industry low CPU and CPGA are cornerstones of our business, and we're proud of the ability to manage these metrics effectively.It is  because of this low-cost network that we believe we are well-positioned as a wireless service provider to address the competitive challenges from wireless resellers or bolt-on offerings from national wireless carriers in the marketplace today. According to a third-party study done in 2009, MetroPCS had more gross additions than any other service provider in the 17 MetroPCS markets surveyed. This was achieved while still maintaining one of the strongest adjusted EBITDA margins in the industry.During the year, we responded to an environment that continues to experience ongoing U.S. macro economic weakness, particularly within some of the metropolitan areas that has become increasingly competitive. We introduced a number of initiatives and made strategic and operational decisions, which I will discuss further in a moment. In addition to increased coverage area, we introduced a consumer-friendly, affordable, unlimited international calling product, which has been well received.Furthermore, recognizing the growing demand for feature-rich phones, we introduced new and compelling smartphones with touch screens and QWERTY keyboards. Providing a broad line of handsets together with our superior cost structure enables us, we believe, to compete effectively and price our service plans at a point that drives door swings and also delivers an attractive adjusted EBITDA margin.With our successes in 2009, we have also encountered challenges. Last year, many of our operational and strategic accomplishments were overshadowed by increased competition in our market segment. We believe these offerings have done two things: They have expanded the market segment and created greater awareness for our served markets. And they have also fundamentally changed the service payment paradigm on probably for a tax and regulatory fee model to a tax and regulatory fee inclusive model. As pioneers in offering no contract, unlimited, flexible wireless service, we helped to redefine the wireless experience for the consumer and helped to usher in significant changes within the wireless industry. In early January of 2010, we substantially changed our go-to-market strategy and began offering Wireless for All, plans that include the applicable tax and regulatory fees. With these simplified offerings, consumers have increased ease when comparing plans and pricing.We intend to focus on retaining our market and category leadership. Leveraging our best-of-class cost structure, winning mindshare with the simplicity of the offerings and providing a superior value per dollar to our customers. We have redefined predictability with all-in pricing and we have positioned the company to capitalize on this dominant emerging paradigm of tax-inclusive pricing. Although still early, we believe our new tax-inclusive rate plans offer tremendous value in our segment. While competitors have introduced unlimited plans at various price points, we believe we offer the most value for talk, text and web service at the lowest price. It is because we concentrate on managing a very cost-effective network that we're able to offer a superior value at the lowest prices to our subscribers on a profitable basis.With over 6.6 million subscribers and nationwide coverage, we have grown tremendously in the past few years. While this growth has been outstanding, we have also continued to innovate and enhance our service plans, pricing, handsets and introduced new a la carte features intended to offer a post-pay experience on a no-contract, pay-in-advance basis. Looking towards the future, we are currently in preparation for our anticipated initial launch of our 4G network during the second half of 2010 in certain metropolitan areas. The world is moving towards broadband data services, and we believe there could be a renaissance in the No-contract Wireless Service segment, as 4G becomes readily available. In September of 2009, we announced that Ericsson is our infrastructure provider for the initial launch of 4G LTE. We also announced Samsung will provide a dual-mode LTE CDMA smartphone offering to launch our service.For the first time, subscribers will have an ability to fully utilize smartphones and other wireless-enabled devices on a next-generation broadband network. As the web continues to evolve and is increasingly going mobile, we're seeing opportunity for subscribers to have multiple wireless devices. MetroPCS in the 4G environment can leverage the power of our network, can manage multiple devices for the subscriber, including smartphones, M2M devices and being able to evolve the smartphone into a wireless communicator. That application alone has endless possibilities for capture, storage and playback to interface with other devices such as TVs and PCs.The growth in our subscriber base has enabled us to self shape the future growth and direction of the wireless industry. We continue to believe that the opportunity within a No-contract Service segment will drive much of the growth in the wireless service industry going forward. Industry analysis continues to project the growth opportunity within the wireless space is primarily within the Unlimited segment, growing at 24% CAGR 2009 to 2013. In fact, by 2013, the Unlimited segment is forecasted to grow to $15 billion. As wireless subscribers continue to be attracted to the unlimited value proposition, our new rate plans make available Wireless for All.We are committed to executing our strategic operational and financial plans. Our focus on managing our low-cost network enabled us to meet challenges in 2009, both economic and competitive. And our new tax-inclusive rate plans provide subscribers with what we believe to be the greatest value in the Unlimited No-contract segment. Looking forward, we will continue to innovate and manage the business for a long-term profitable growth. As we approach our initial 4G LTE launch later this year, we believe 4G could provide an opportunity to accelerate value creation for our shareholders. Now I'd like to hand it over to Tom."

Today, I'd like to address three issues: Recent operational results, challenges that impact our operations in 2010, and lastly opportunities for brand improvement in 2010.As we look at 2009 and specifically the fourth quarter, we delivered solid financial results while we made progress operationally in a challenging environment. Our fourth quarter focus was directed at maintaining our share of decision while we retooled and planned for the roll out of our 2010 initiatives that I'll speak to later.In Q4 2009, we generated over 317,000 net subscriber additions. Our promotional family plans, $30 service plans and targeted handset mail and rebates helped fuel our growth throughout the quarter and provided needed momentum heading into 2010. For the year 2009, we generated net subscriber additions of nearly 1.3 million units resulting in over $6.6 million total subscribers at year end. Churn in the fourth quarter was 5.3% and is a focus for the company. As mentioned on previous calls, we believe increasing customer satisfaction creating programs that promote positive distribution and customer behaviors are critical to our continued improvement efforts. In closing out 2009 operational highlights, I'm excited to mention that for the full year 2009, MetroPCS was ranked number one in overall share of decision, when compared to all of our competitors in the same markets by a highly-respected, independent, national mobile performance measurement organization. In 2009, our distribution channels continue to execute and remained a valuable part of our overall strategy.As we enter 2010, we are mindful of the challenges ahead and the work that goes into meeting these challenges and turning them into opportunities. We believe the most prominent challenges to our operations this year will come from the economy, our ability to decrease churn and meet competitive threats.We believe consumer spending will be tighter, that households will continue to budget and consumers will seek out value while demanding quality. We have taken steps to reach out to our consumers and survey them regarding their future purchasing decision criteria. What we have seen is that consumers want choices, specifically, handset choices, new, cool form factors with price points and rate plans that are affordable and feature-rich.We continue to recognize the need to serve our customers better at every touch point in an effort to reduce churn and improve our already strong Net Promoter Scores among our embedded base. Our foundational belief is that we must be seen as the best deal in town.As other competitors' offers come to market and distribution channels become cluttered with new MVNO entrants as well as new offers from incumbent carriers, we plan to showcase our brand, swing doors and maintain our high per-market share position numbers, while changing behavior that increases customer value with predictability and choice. Lastly, as it relates to our immediate challenges, we intend to be ready to react swiftly and decisively when faced with issues that impact a particular market or region that we serve, whether it's a local competitive threat or an economic situation that impacted a particular region, having the flexibility to react quickly as we leverage our local market distribution model will benefit us going forward.  Understanding our challenges for 2010 and developing strategies and tactics that address these needs are essential for our company. Continuing to increase market share in a very competitive and uncertain economic climate is our goal.In early 2010, we introduced our Wireless for All tax-inclusive service plan structure. These new rate plans fundamentally changed the way we conduct business and have been received with open arms and renewed enthusiasm by our customers and distribution partners. Consumers now have redefined predictability for their monthly service bill. What you see is what you pay, and applicable taxes and regulatory fees are included in your monthly service fee. Additionally, we eliminated our long-standing policy of providing a free first month of service, while reducing the retail handset price correspondingly for the consumer.Consumers now have greater choices for affordable handsets while fully appreciating the value of their service plan. I'd like to remind everyone that these changes were the results of consumer surveys that overwhelmingly support our decision to make these important structural changes. We believe that the new sales process involved in our new tax-inclusive offering will lead to greater customer satisfaction and help us in our efforts to reduce churn.In conjunction with our decision to allow customers to vote with their wallet, we introduced a new advertising campaign that surrounds our Wireless for All offer with the educational message that you can purchase an unlimited, talk, text and web service plan for $40, period. This campaign includes a heavy-up component that will accentuate our messaging with Q1 2010, as well as develop the storylines that surround our new tech and talk campaign.Continuing to develop the value and quality behind our brand is essential for us in 2010. Providing consumers with more choice, larger coverage footprints, trained sales and service professionals that communicate our value proposition to our customers is our priority. We will be mindful of how the first quarter develops for us. We plan to increase product and service offerings as the year continues. Our team is highly focused and engaged at all levels. I have personally been involved in multiple distribution meetings across the country, with dealer partners and local leadership who have overwhelmingly embraced our change and responded with great focus and attention to detail. Our no-contract, pay-in-advance offerings now provide consumers with a set of experiences they would normally expect from traditional contracted postpaid plans. MetroPCS continues to make it easy for contracted, wireless consumers to step into a new way of managing their wireless needs: More choices, greater predictability and a simpler way to obtain Wireless for All. With that, I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

We reported soft fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results in large part due to our focus on profitable growth enabled by our superior cost structure. As you can see from our results, our company's ability to continually generate positive cash flow is a significant differentiator. Generating increasing amounts of adjusted EBITDA and cash flow are keys to building long-term shareholder value.We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with approximately $1.2 billion in cash in short-term investments. We believe our strong financial position and liquidity is also a significant differentiator in today's environment.Our total leverage was under 4x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our 9.25% senior notes at the end of December, and our net leverage was 2.64x. With debt maturities in late '13 and '14, our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter are below 8.25%. Substantially all of our debt fixed by its nature worked through interest rate swaps and with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, we believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective. I would now like to touch on a few subscriber metrics. Churn was down 50 basis points on a sequential quarterly basis. However, it was up year over year by 20 basis points. The increase in churn on a year-over-year basis related to incremental growth additions of approximately 1.3 million customers during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008. Our fourth quarter 2009 ARPU was $40.70, down $0.38 when compared with $41.08 in the third quarter of 2009 and up $0.18 when compared to the same quarter a year ago. The decrease in ARPU from the third quarter 2009 was primarily due to our promotional service plans and family plans sold during the fourth quarter. Our CPGA continues to be one of the lowest of any facilities-based wireless carrier in the United States. For the fourth quarter, our CPGA was up $138, up from approximately $120 in the prior year's fourth quarter and down sequentially from approximately $154. The year-over-year increase in CPGA is due primarily to the continued ramp of our Northeast markets, as well as the effects of increased spending on our promotional activities in all of our markets.Our business continues to scale, and our CPU continues to be among the lowest in the wireless industry. Our CPU for the quarter was $18.6 as compared to $17.55 in the prior year's fourth quarter. This increase was due primarily to cost associated with our International Long Distance program, as well as expenses related to the continued ramp up of operations in the Northeast markets and was partially offset by continued cost reduction efforts in the increasing scale of our business.The Northeast markets impacted consolidated CPU by $2.09, making our core market CPU $15.97 for the fourth quarter of 2009. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $251 million. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 30.5%, compared to 29.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008. These results were after an adjusted EBITDA burn of $32 million for the fourth quarter in our Northeast markets.Year to date, our Northeast markets have burned $205 million in adjusted EBITDA. Our core markets adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.6%, compared to 36.7% in the fourth quarter of 2008. I would like to point out that within our core markets for the full year 2009, we have reported adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.2 billion, representing adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 29% when compared to the same period of 2008.I'd like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the quarter, on a consolidated basis, our service revenue and cost of service grew approximately 24% and 26%, respectively, to approximately $825 million and $307 million, respectively. The increases are primarily due to growth of our subscriber base. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were $150 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, representing an increase of $37 million when compared to the year-ago quarter. This increase is primarily related to increased promotional activities in all of our markets and the ramp up of operations in the Northeast markets.We generated approximately $120 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter, where as we used the $80 million in cash from operating activities in the prior year's fourth quarter. Offsetting this operating cash flow, we incurred capital expenditures of $195 million during the quarter. We also generated $33 million in consolidated net income during the fourth quarter or $0.09 per share, as compared to $15 million and $0.04 per share in the prior-year quarter.For the full year 2009, we generated approximately $899 million in cash from operating activities, and incurred $832 million in capital expenditures, resulting in positive unlevered free cash flow of approximately $125 million. For the full year 2009, we recorded an 18% increase in net income to $177 million or $0.49 per share.I would now like to take a moment and discuss reporting changes we will make beginning with the first quarter of 2010, which regards to our segment reporting.Starting in the first quarter of 2010, we will consolidate all of our operating markets into one segment and will no longer breakout core and Northeast market results. We are past the launch points and the initial ramp up of our Northeast markets, and therefore, we believe conforming to wireless industry practice of consolidated results is appropriate moving forward.As we previously mentioned on our third quarter 2009 earnings call, for the year ending December 31, 2010, MetroPCS does not intend to provide guidance given the uncertainty in the economic and competitive environment impending the development of MetroPCSs' current and planned marketing and sales initiatives.

If you could talk to whether you would expect, one should expect to see the typical first quarter seasonalities leading to typically stronger first quarter results for the industry still holding, that would be helpful. And then the second question if I could, in October '08, Sprint gave the world a heads-up that its plan was to launch an unlimited Boost plan in early '09, which it did. And it ended up having forcing a lot of changes that I think a lot of people today may be wished they had done quicker. At their most recent result, Sprint announced that they plan to introduce new segmented prepaid plans sometime in the second quarter.

I think there's always tax season as you've seen in our business over time. And it's always times when there are contracts that expire from postpaid customers.

But I don't think there's any major difference in 2010 versus any other season that we would see. There's nothing indicates any real difference. The other thing I could address, and maybe Braxton will take the second part of this as well, but with regard to the introduction of any other competitive plan, as Roger mentioned and I think I highlighted, we had a fairly significant result of our share of decision in 2009 and all of our markets combined that irregardless of our competitive front that we face every day, we were able to put up some numbers that came out pretty good in the third-party study with regards to share of decision. As we mentioned, we're always going to be mindful about how the first quarter goes and then we just have to see what happens on the competitive front."

Remember, we have disclosed that we're doing the LTE rollouts in the second half and actually launching in the second half of the year. We've already started incurring LTE CapEx. And directionally, for the range that we just talked about that will be in our 10-K, you should estimate that roughly half of that is related to the LTE spend. And the other half of it relates to ongoing expansion and increase in capacity to serve our customers as we continue to grow. And if you look at it, without the LTE, that would've been a substantial reduction in CapEx. But remember that we've just got off a doubling of our company over the last two years with launching the Northeast markets and other markets. And we're thrilled out of that. We're certainly continuing to rationalize and build in the Northeast. We never stopped building in the L.A. area and really have gotten very close to reaching critical mass there but we're continuing to invest there. And there's normal footprint expansion that you always do to remain relevant in other markets. But that is certainly less than what we have done in the last couple of years. And I think the directional discussion are kind of frame set for you. And I think it also reflects that there has been a shift given the overall environment.

And then secondly, maybe for Roger, I think a lot of these prepaid guys are benefiting, or at least a couple are benefiting from the SafeLink program, and it sounds like the early read from Washington as part of this national broadband plan that, that could be scaled back or even discontinued altogether. Do you think that could help you guys? I'd imagine that the pool of potential customers is so much smaller because you guys don't necessarily participate in that plan and maybe these are customers you guys could get. Just some commentary on that issue would be great to."

And it's up to us to capitalize on it because as we close the gap as I mentioned before, what we intend to do is to offer the postpaid experience, and I'm talking about services, I'm talking about handsets, as well as the other à la cartes that are available in the app store.

And good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today with the discussion of our first quarter operational results.

I'd like to begin today with the discussion of our first quarter operational results. After launching our Wireless for All campaign in January, MetroPCS is proud to report record net subscriber additions and significantly lower churn. These operational achievements were driven by the success of our Wireless for All campaign. In the first quarter of 2010, we recorded nearly $1.5 million gross additions, 692,000 net subscriber additions and reduced year-over-year churn by 130 basis points to 3.7%.
As you may your recall, the main premises behind our Wireless for All go-to-market strategy included no contract segment leadership, simplicity and predictability for consumers, Wireless for All traction and service plans stability. While we are always mindful of economic realities and the competitive pressures that exist in our markets, we are pleased with our plan mix in the first quarter, and believe that our current price points provide outstanding value to the consumer. Maintaining consistent and predictable market pricing is important to the continuation of the success we have seen with the implementation of our Wireless for All campaign.
With regards to our no contract unlimited segment leadership, in our markets we believe we had more retail net additions than any other retail facilities-based wireless provider during the quarter. This was a great customer response and a vote of confidence for our new plans. We leveraged our best-of-class cost structure to absorb the taxes and regulatory fees into our new plans, and at the same time effectively managed our customer acquisition costs. 
Gross additions in the quarter were driven by sales of the Samsung Freeform. This QWERTY handset was fastest to achieve 1 million unit sales in our history. The Freeform features a QWERTY keyboard and an affordable retail price point of $79. Smartphones and QWERTY handsets resonate well with our subscribers. Going forward, we plan to continue to introduce additional smartphones and QWERTY handsets.
For the quarter, MetroPCS was ranked number one in overall share position when compared to all of our competitors in the same markets by an independent third party. Additionally, for the entire quarter our internal porting data shows that for each month of the quarter ports in exceeded ports out to MetroPCS verse every contract wireless provider. The shift to UNC, unlimited no contract service, is in full gear. Our belief is that this space is growing and that the market has room for multiple players that offer value and deliver quality to the consumer.
Our new advertising campaign, Tech and Talk, that surrounds our Wireless for All offer with the educational message that you can purchase an unlimited, talk, text and web service plan for $40 period has been well received. In the first quarter, we spent an incremental $26 million in promotional activities, and we believe this messaging helped to educate the public on our new marketing platform and we believe generated door swings. Going forward, we plan to continue to develop Ranjit and Chat and their Tech and Talks campaign, as we highlight the elements of our Wireless for All service platform. Evidenced by this quarter's operational results, we believe it's clear that the simplicity and predictability of our new tax-inclusive service plans resonated well with the consumer. Now that the customer is paying for the first month of service at the time of the handset purchase and paying less for that handset, we have reduced first month bill shock for our subscribers. With Wireless for All, we recaptured our market leadership position. The customer perception of lower-cost phones is a key factor in attracting new subscribers.
One of the benefits of this approach is that the customer is generally out-of-pocket the same amount of cash when they leave the store. Our indirect-distribution channel dealers are now compensated on the service plans they sell for selling handsets. This transition has enabled our salespeople to engage with the customer and better match their needs with a specific service plan. Now the true value of our $40, $45, $50 and $60 rate plans will be more apparent. This skill set will be even more important to MetroPCS as you move into the 4G era.  As we get into the seasonally slower summer months, we would expect to see lower net subscriber additions and a seasonal increase in churn. However, we believe the triple play inside Wireless for All, tax-inclusive rate plans, lower cost handsets and payment for the first month of service should continue to have a positive impact going into the summer months.
Churn in the first quarter, which came in at 3.7% represents a significant reduction from the first quarter of 2009. On previous calls I've discussed the idea that managing churn is an ongoing focus for the company. With our Wireless for All campaign, I believe we increased overall customer satisfaction, created programs to promote positive distribution and improved customer behaviors that helped to lower churn for the quarter. We believe that the majority of the reduction in churn leads to a decline in false churn as we no longer offer the first month of service for free.
Wireless for All as a campaign and a pricing platform is still in its infancy. Our goal is to continue to gain traction with our marketing platform while we stabilize pricing at current levels. Distribution as well as consumers really found the elements of this unlimited, no contract tax-inclusive offering satisfying and easy-to-understand. The success of Wireless for All is evidenced by the results of our recent survey work on new customer acquisition. Our internal survey data showed us that roughly 1/3 of those surveyed transitioned from contracted service. Over one quarter came from prepaid plans, about 1/5 were previous MetroPCS customers that came back and purchased a new headset and the balance for new to wireless.
With the rollout of Wireless for All, we grew by nearly 700,000 net subscriber additions in the quarter and have a total of over 7.3 million subscribers. As we look forward, we believe that the more $45 and higher rate plans we sell, the more stable our ARPU will remain. In fact, during the month of March, four out of five gross additions were in the $45 or higher plan. We have heard and read everyone's comments as they relate to competition and potential pricing pressures. The industry continues to be a competitive one, but we believe we are well positioned with Wireless for All now and in the future. While it's difficult to predict the future, we believe we see signs of pricing stability in the industry. The simplicity of our tax-inclusive offerings makes it easy for customers to know exactly what they are purchasing. We have redefined predictability by making the plans easier to budget for. 
The tagline we use is, what you see is what you pay. The tax-inclusive, unlimited no-contract plans are the new emerging paradigm, and while still early, second quarter results continue to exceed our expectations. We believe the economic situation in many of our urban markets has begun to show modest improvement. Over the past six months, our level of hotline activity has trended down, meaning more customers are paying their bills on time than the previous four quarters. We are pleased with our execution and excited about our progress as we expand the Unlimited, No Contract Service segment and prepare for our transition to LTE. Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

We reported solid first quarter 2010 operational and financial results this quarter. We have record net additions in the first quarter of approximately 692,000 and ended the quarter with over 7.3 million subscribers, up 21% f",935,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We reported solid first quarter 2010 operational and financial results this quarter. We have record net additions in the first quarter of approximately 692,000 and ended the quarter with over 7.3 million subscribers, up 21% from the first quarter of 2009.
Our first quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $224 million was also a record for the company and was up approximately 13% year-over-year. Our strong results this quarter are largely due to two things: our successful introduction of the Wireless for All service plans, coupled with our effective management of our superior cost structure.
We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our strong cash position enables us to look at opportunities for general corporate purposes, which could include opportunistic spectrum acquisitions, corporate development opportunities, future technology initiatives or the retirement of outstanding debt.
Our total leverage was under 4x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our 9.25% senior notes at the end of March, and our net leverage was approximately 2.5x. With debt maturities in late 2013 and 2014, the weighted average cost of debt for the quarter of below 7.5% substantially all of our debt fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps and with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, we believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
We're proud of the record net subscriber additions this quarter. I'd like to again remind those on the call that we operate in a seasonal business. Now that we are past our major market launches, the first quarter could be an even larger percentage of full-year net subscriber additions. Churn for the quarter was 3.7%, down 130 basis points year-over-year and down 160 basis points on a sequential basis. The dramatic decrease in churn was related to the acceptance of the triple play benefits of our Wireless for All offerings, as Tom has discussed.
Touching on ARPU. Our first quarter 2010 ARPU was $39.83, down $0.57 on a year-over-year basis and down $0.87 on a sequential basis. The decrease in ARPU was primarily due to the introduction of our new Wireless for All service plans in January of 2010, which included all applicable taxes and regulatory fees. The burden on ARPU for our tax-inclusive plans is in the $4 range.  We were able to mitigate the majority of this dilution with the sale of our full range of service plans, including our $60 world unlimited offering.
Our CPGA continues to be one of the lowest of any facilities-based wireless carriers in the U.S. For the first quarter, our CPGA was $146, up $8 sequentially and up approximately $12 year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in CPGA was primarily driven by increased promotional activities in all of our metropolitan areas. Our business continues to scale, and our CPU continues to be among the lowest in the wireless industry. Our CPU for the quarter was $18.79 as compared to $16.69 in the prior year's first quarter. This increase was due primarily to an increase in retention expense due to handset subsidies on existing customers. The inclusion of the regulatory fees and the tax-inclusive service pricing on our Wireless for All customers, as well as costs associated with our unlimited international call plan.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was approximately to $224 million, an increase of approximately 13% year-over-year. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 26% compared to 27% in the first quarter of 2009. Over the trailing 12 months, we have generated record consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $981 million.
I'd like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the quarter, on a consolidated basis our service revenue and cost of service grew approximately 17% and 16% to approximately $853 million and $285 million respectively. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $160 million for the first quarter of 2010, representing an increase of approximately $23 million when compared to the year-ago quarter. This increase is primarily related to increased promotional activities in launching Wireless for All.
We generated $225 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter, a decrease of approximately $82 million from the prior year's first quarter. Offsetting this operating cash flow we incurred capital expenditures of $139 million during the quarter. Our results demonstrate our focus and ability to grow the business while generating positive cash flow. We also generated approximately $23 million in consolidated net income for the first quarter or $0.06 per share compared to $44 million and $0.12 per share for the prior year first quarter. The prior year quarter does include a one-time gain of approximately $25 million on disposal of assets. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the one-time gain, EPS for the first quarter of 2009 would have been $0.05 per share.
To help the Street with forecasts going forward, based on the amount of tax NOLs we have outstanding at just under $1 billion and including the ongoing amortization of our spectrum licenses for tax purposes, we do not anticipate at this time paying meaningful cash taxes until 2014.
MetroPCS recently made significant changes to the pricing structure of its service plans and has enhanced its market position. Thus far the company has been pleased with the customer interest and results, but in what continues to be a competitive and price-sensitive market, MetroPCS does not anticipate providing financial guidance for fiscal year 2010. Thank you. Roger?"

We are very pleased to report strong quarterly results highlighted by record net addition growth in the quarter and significantly lower churn. Our strategy has and continues to be, to provide predictable, affordable and flexible unlimited service on a no-contract basis. With a robust handset lineup, national coverage, international offerings and our 4G LTE network under construction, we intend to provide subscribers with a post-pay experience in a pre-pay environment. This is truly an exciting time.
After taking an extensive review of our competitive position in the marketplace in early January 2010, we introduced our Wireless for All rate plans. These rate plans significantly re-positioned our business. By moving to tax and regulatory fee-inclusive rate plans, we addressed a desire from the subscriber with simplicity and predictable pricing. We believe these new rate plans and their respective price points solidify our position as offering the best deal in town. 
We believe the change in rate plans, including the elimination of the first month free, lowering handset prices by a corresponding amount and our new marketing campaign have resonated with our customers and have positioned us well for the future. We are approaching a point in time in which the wireless experience will dramatically improve. In our markets, we have been actively building our 4G LTE network, and in early 2010, we have completed our first test calls in both our Dallas, Fort Worth and Las Vegas markets.  The introduction of commercially available 4G LTE is an exciting prospect and illustrates an enhanced technology that promises major improvements to the broadband wireless experience. The world is moving towards 4G LTE service, and here in the U.S., we are the clear leader in the No-Contract segment. The Internet is going mobile, and when we launch 4G LTE, we will be well positioned to enable subscribers to utilize the next-generation network on advanced smartphones and QWERTY handsets. It will be a premium service at an affordable price.
4G LTE will enable exciting new services, including many video applications, but importantly from our perspective, moving towards 4G greater capacity and significantly reducing cost per bit. We believe that one of the significant advantages of LTE is that the cost of adding capacity is substantially less than adding the same amount of capacity on CDMA and has a game-changing consequence. As industry-wide prices for data per bit are declining, LTE enables MetroPCS to further improve its world-class cost structure for broadband data access. 
Part of our long-term strategy is to manage one of the lowest-cost networks of any U.S.-based broadband wireless carrier. The combination of our CPU and CPGA metrics are among the lowest in the industry, and help us compete effectively while delivering healthy, adjusted EBITDA margins. In building our 4G network, we're able to manage our costs while advancing the technology and providing the subscriber with a superior experience. 
Our initial 4G launch will be an IP data overlay over our voice CDMA 1x RTT network. Over time, we will move to an all-IP network. This migration is expected to provide tremendous leverage in CapEx and OpEx, and drives our low-cost operating network strategy in the broadband data era.
Since we began this business we have been judicious in the use of our spectrum, and we have been pioneers in developing technologies to get the most from our spectrum holdings. For example, we have helped to pioneer six sector cell technology and extensive use of DAZ systems that enable our subscribers to enjoy tremendous service coverage and handle exceptionally high traffic on our systems. As we build our 4G network, we will continue to develop and utilize technologies that enable our subscribers to enjoy the benefits of a next-generation network. Additionally with a focus on handsets, we believe we will help to usher in wireless mobility for the way consumers access the Internet using smartphones and QWERTY handsets.
While still in early 2010, we intend to continue our focus on retaining our market and segment leadership. Our Wireless for All campaign has redefined predictability with true, all-in pricing, and we believe we have positioned the company to capitalize on this dominant, emerging paradigm. With over 7.3 million subscribers and nationwide coverage of approximately 220 million POPS, we have grown tremendously in the past few years. We have also evolved the business to deliver our subscribers a post-pay experience on a no-contract pay-in-advance basis. The rapid growth in our subscriber base provides us an opportunity to redefine the wireless experience for the entire industry. Industry analysts projects that the No-Contract Service segment will drive much of the growth in the wireless service industry going forward. Within the Unlimited segment of wireless, total revenue is forecasted to grow at roughly a 25% CAGR through 2013.
From an investment standpoint, we are focused on creating long-term shareholder value. We believe investors should focus on four items when looking at MetroPCS, including: our company's ability to innovate and offer services and products customers truly want; our continued differentiation in the marketplace; our strong balance sheet and the ability to generate free cash flow; and finally, our ability to grow profitably. We've had a record first quarter, and we're pleased so far with our momentum going into the summer months. We're focused on growing the business profitably and launching our 4G service with a focus on maintaining our cost leadership position. Thank you. We'll now move to the Q&A. Operator?"

Sticker shock is tremendously important but the simplicity that there's no other taxes and fees, you can budget that, and it's very simple to come up with two 20s and a five. That's been really important as we've gone forward with the campaign Wireless for All. I think the second piece that we looked at is as we re-trained our whole base, we actually educated every one of our salespeople on the benefits of the rate plans. So as we sell the rate plan, now consumers truly understand what's inside of every rate plan, and we find that they're using more of the elements of the rate plan than they probably did before when the service was given away for free."

We think it's a harbinger of future positive benefits from a churn standpoint, and I think it's really driven by two things: it's driven by alignment of the dealer behavior to capture the upgrades; but it's also I think importantly to note that our handset prices have been reduced and we have a very robust line of very desirable handsets and consumers are coming in and re-investing in the MetroPCS proposition because it's more affordable to do so now."

But we saw the Sprint pricing plans come up this morning, and the good news on the face of things is it looks like unlimited pricing is stable, which is certainly better than we thought it would be a few weeks ago. The plans that looked really interesting were the limited MOU plans for a 300 minutes or 1,200 minutes at $25 or $40. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about to what extent your customer base values the truly unlimited nature of the plans? To what extent are they even aware of how many minutes they're using? And if you have an idea of what the distribution is of users across the minute spectrum, how many for customers use less than 1,200 minutes and could possibly be susceptible to these new virgin plans? That would really be helpful. And then one other thing, the $35 million in advertising spend seems like it didn't show up in the quarter. Is that spend getting pushed out to later quarters? Or did the Ranjit and Chad ads come in substantially lower than expected in terms of expense? What's going on with that component?"

There are certain segments, we believe, in this marketplace, where the new Sprint plans might address. We think that we're less susceptible to that because we have a fairly substantial user use now that we've got to an all-inclusive talk, text and web service. So we see heavy use in all those categories. The question really is if there are -- is a segment that really just uses their phone for texting and web service, and that's what they'll be probing. But from our standpoint, we have heavy use across all those three service plans, so we're just going to have to see.

With regards to the advertising dollars for Ranjit and Chad, I want to let everybody know that we didn't take the full $26 million and spend it on on media. We have a variety of advertising and marketing campaigns that we do over the course of all of our markets. That was just a component in terms of how we went to market. We did a lot of things that were in the Street, that were in the community, but we think as we go forward, we wouldn't need those same levels of spend going forward into the second and third quarters because they're seasonally a little slower.

Remember we did a forced migration and then we've had voluntary migration. The voluntary migrations have slowed significantly going into the second quarter. So we think that we're reaching close to equilibrium on people who are comfortable with where they were versus where they're going. You will see as we continue just to add tax-inclusive customers in the future and old customers churn off, some additional movement there, but I think most of it has been accomplished as of this point or the dramatic change. And you've heard both Tom and Roger talk about the view that our focus is on stabilizing, doing it through product innovation and operational execution."

We've just seen some of the notes early this morning on what the Sprint repricing is going to be on Virgin Mobile and others. Last year, if I would reflect back, I think we had many more changes, which to me was the major paradigm shift between the before-and-after tax world. So now that we've gone and addressed the price points that we think our customers really want, we are on an after-tax basis to regain the predictability side of the equation. I think we've made the significant transition, and I'm sure there will be others going forward that we'll look at in terms of changes and tinkering. But for us, this tax inclusion and regulatory fees was a very significant change in our business, so we don't see it in the same proportion as we did going into, shall we say, second and third quarters of last year."

There will be an increase in OpEx obviously to get the backhaul necessary for 4G, but there will be a more gradual change for us because we will not see the kind of dramatic impact as it really relates this year, primarily because the launches will, as we indicated, take place market-by-market throughout the second half of this year. So there will be a more gradual buildup, but there will be a build up. One thing I might add, though, is that as you go to the backhaul world, it's really a cottage industry and there's very fragmented market. There's not just one player to negotiate with. There are many players. There are some more major ones, agreed, but some of the advantages that we're seeing is in going to an Ethernet foundation, and the value we have in having the kind of traffic that we already incur is that the Ethernet backhaul and the move to that will be, in some cases even be a cost-savings because we have so much traffic now. And we have not taken full advantage of the stat much is that each base station that we will have under our 4G scenario. So it's mostly a cost increase, but there are some savings and as the backhaul increases, the pricing is quite dramatic in terms of price per bit at higher backhaul rates and lower backhaul rates. So it's kind of a mixed picture, but it will be gradual this year."

The format for today's call is as follows. First, Tom will provide an update on a number of operational results and initiatives, then Braxton will review the financial highlights of the first quarter 2010 and finally Roger will provide an overview of our business followed by a question-and-answer session.
During today's call we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have reconciled these historical non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures in our earnings release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.metropcs.com under the Investor Relations tab. Also this quarter, supplemental slides are available for download and printing on our Investor Relations Web site. Please note, however, management will not refer to these slides in their prepared comments.
We prepared these slides as a means to show quarterly highlights, graph historical trends in many of our metrics, as well as compare our industry leading, low-cost structure to other major wireless providers. These slides may contain forward-looking statements and may refer to publicly-available information.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to remind you that certain information that we will discuss in this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Words such as believes, anticipates, expects, intends, plans, should, good, would, view, estimates, projects and other similar expressions typically identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding our future plans, our prospects for success in the highly competitive wireless environment, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, the seasonality of our growth, the improvement in the economy, forecast when our NOLs will be used, what our acquisition of C9 Wireless interest in Royal Street Commission will close, the dynamics of the wireless marketplace, the value customers ascribe to our service, the rollout and launch of our 4G network and services, the future costs of LTE and future cost advantages of LTE and the impact of Wireless for All and its acceptance by consumers, our objectives, strategies, goals, future events, revenues and performance or other information that is not historical. 
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or the timing of events to differ materially from those made in the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, competitive responses, change in competitive dynamics, the success of our marketing and cost control initiatives, our ability to launch our LTE network, our ability to efficiently manage our spectrum use, changes in tax and regulatory fees or the continued success of our indirect channels to distribution. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements discussed on this conference call will be attained. Our forward-looking statements also are subject to general economic conditions, financial, competitive, business, political, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including but not limited to, the risk factors described in our earnings release, which is available on our Web site and our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and periodic reports on Form 8-K, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed for the quarter, March 31, 2010, to be filed by Monday, May 10 with the SEC and other filings with the SEC, all of which can be obtained free of charge from the SEC at www.SEC.gov or from our Web site or directly from the company by contacting the Investor Relations department. We encourage you to review them.
We would also like to remind you that the results for the first quarter may not be reflective of results for any subsequent period. Also I'd like to remind everyone effective January 1, 2010, we now aggregate our 13 operating segments into one reportable segment. For anyone listening to a taped or webcast replay or reviewing a written transcript of today's call, please note that all information presented is current only as of May 6, 2010, and should be considered valid only as of May 6, 2010, regardless of the date reviewed, read or replayed.

I hope by now you've had a chance to review our earnings release issued this morning with the financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2010. Again, I encourage everyone to read our earnings release in conjunction with the information discussed in this call, along with our previous SEC filings.

And good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today with the discussion of our first quarter operational results.

I'd like to begin today with the discussion of our first quarter operational results. After launching our Wireless for All campaign in January, MetroPCS is proud to report record net subscriber additions and significantly lower churn. These operational achievements were driven by the success of our Wireless for All campaign. In the first quarter of 2010, we recorded nearly $1.5 million gross additions, 692,000 net subscriber additions and reduced year-over-year churn by 130 basis points to 3.7%.
As you may your recall, the main premises behind our Wireless for All go-to-market strategy included no contract segment leadership, simplicity and predictability for consumers, Wireless for All traction and service plans stability. While we are always mindful of economic realities and the competitive pressures that exist in our markets, we are pleased with our plan mix in the first quarter, and believe that our current price points provide outstanding value to the consumer. Maintaining consistent and predictable market pricing is important to the continuation of the success we have seen with the implementation of our Wireless for All campaign.
With regards to our no contract unlimited segment leadership, in our markets we believe we had more retail net additions than any other retail facilities-based wireless provider during the quarter. This was a great customer response and a vote of confidence for our new plans. We leveraged our best-of-class cost structure to absorb the taxes and regulatory fees into our new plans, and at the same time effectively managed our customer acquisition costs. 
Gross additions in the quarter were driven by sales of the Samsung Freeform. This QWERTY handset was fastest to achieve 1 million unit sales in our history. The Freeform features a QWERTY keyboard and an affordable retail price point of $79. Smartphones and QWERTY handsets resonate well with our subscribers. Going forward, we plan to continue to introduce additional smartphones and QWERTY handsets.
For the quarter, MetroPCS was ranked number one in overall share position when compared to all of our competitors in the same markets by an independent third party. Additionally, for the entire quarter our internal porting data shows that for each month of the quarter ports in exceeded ports out to MetroPCS verse every contract wireless provider. The shift to UNC, unlimited no contract service, is in full gear. Our belief is that this space is growing and that the market has room for multiple players that offer value and deliver quality to the consumer.
Our new advertising campaign, Tech and Talk, that surrounds our Wireless for All offer with the educational message that you can purchase an unlimited, talk, text and web service plan for $40 period has been well received. In the first quarter, we spent an incremental $26 million in promotional activities, and we believe this messaging helped to educate the public on our new marketing platform and we believe generated door swings. Going forward, we plan to continue to develop Ranjit and Chad and their Tech and Talks campaign, as we highlight the elements of our Wireless for All service platform. Evidenced by this quarter's operational results, we believe it's clear that the simplicity and predictability of our new tax-inclusive service plans resonated well with the consumer. Now that the customer is paying for the first month of service at the time of the handset purchase and paying less for that handset, we have reduced first month bill shock for our subscribers. With Wireless for All, we have recaptured our market leadership position. The customer perception of lower-cost phones is a key factor in attracting new subscribers.
One of the benefits of this approach is that the customer is generally out of pocket the same amount of cash when they leave the store. Our indirect distribution channel dealers are now compensated on the service plans they sell versus selling handsets. This transition has enabled our sales people to engage with the customer and better match their needs with a specific service plan. Now the true value of our $40, $45, $50 and $60 rate plans will be more apparent. This skill set will be even more important to MetroPCS as you move into the 4G era.  As we get into the seasonally slower summer months, we would expect to see lower net subscriber additions and a seasonal increase in churn. However, we believe the triple play inside Wireless for All, tax-inclusive rate plans, lower cost handsets and payment for the first month of service should continue to have a positive impact going into the summer months.
Churn in the first quarter, which came in at 3.7% represents a significant reduction from the first quarter of 2009. On previous calls I've discussed the idea that managing churn is an ongoing focus for the company. With our Wireless for All campaign, I believe we increased overall customer satisfaction, created programs that promote positive distribution and improved customer behaviors that helped to lower churn for the quarter. We believe that the majority of the reduction in churn leads to a decline in false churn as we no longer offer the first month of service for free.
Wireless for All as a campaign and a pricing platform is still in its infancy. Our goal is to continue to gain traction with our marketing platform while we stabilize pricing at current levels. Distribution as well as consumers really found the elements of this unlimited, no contract tax-inclusive offering satisfying and easy to understand. The success of Wireless for All is evidenced by the results of our recent survey work on new customer acquisition. Our internal survey data showed us that roughly 1/3 of those surveyed transitioned from contracted service. Over one quarter came from prepaid plans, about 1/5 were previous MetroPCS customers that came back and purchased a new handset and the balance for new to wireless.
With the rollout of Wireless for All, we grew by nearly 700,000 net subscriber additions in the quarter and have a total of over 7.3 million subscribers. As we look forward, we believe that the more $45 and higher rate plans we sell, the more stable our ARPU will remain. In fact, during the month of March, four out of five gross additions were in the $45 or higher plan. We have heard and read everyone's comments as they relate to competition and potential pricing pressures. The industry continues to be a competitive one, but we believe we are well positioned with Wireless for All now and in the future. While it's difficult to predict the future, we believe we see signs of pricing stability in the industry. The simplicity of our tax-inclusive offerings makes it easy for customers to know exactly what they are purchasing. We have redefined predictability by making the plans easier to budget for. 
The tagline we use is, what you see is what you pay. The tax-inclusive, unlimited no-contract plans are the new emerging paradigm, and while still early, second quarter results continue to exceed our expectations. We believe the economic situation in many of our urban markets has begun to show modest improvement. Over the past six months, our level of hotline activity has trended down, meaning more customers are paying their bills on time than the previous four quarters. We are pleased with our execution and excited about our progress as we expand the Unlimited, No Contract Service segment and prepare for our transition to LTE. Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

We reported solid first quarter 2010 operational and financial results this quarter. We have record net additions in the first quarter of approximately 692,000 and ended the quarter with over 7.3 million subscribers, up 21% f",935,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We reported solid first quarter 2010 operational and financial results this quarter. We have record net additions in the first quarter of approximately 692,000 and ended the quarter with over 7.3 million subscribers, up 21% from the first quarter of 2009.
Our first quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $224 million was also a record for the company and was up approximately 13% year-over-year. Our strong results this quarter are largely due to two things: our successful introduction of the Wireless for All service plans, coupled with our effective management of our superior cost structure.
We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our strong cash position enables us to look at opportunities for general corporate purposes, which could include opportunistic spectrum acquisitions, corporate development opportunities, future technology initiatives or the retirement of outstanding debt.
Our total leverage was under 4x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our 9.25% senior notes at the end of March, and our net leverage was approximately 2.5x. With debt maturities in late 2013 and 2014, the weighted average cost of debt for the quarter of below 7.5% substantially all of our debt fixed by its nature or through interest rate swaps and with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, we believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
We're proud of the record net subscriber additions this quarter. I'd like to again remind those on the call that we operate in a seasonal business. Now that we are past our major market launches, the first quarter could be an even larger percentage of full-year net subscriber additions. Churn for the quarter was 3.7%, down 130 basis points year-over-year and down 160 basis points on a sequential basis. The dramatic decrease in churn was related to the acceptance of the triple play benefits of our Wireless for All offerings, as Tom has discussed.
Touching on ARPU. Our first quarter 2010 ARPU was $39.83, down $0.57 on a year-over-year basis and down $0.87 on a sequential basis. The decrease in ARPU was primarily due to the introduction of our new Wireless for All service plans in January of 2010, which included all applicable taxes and regulatory fees. The burden on ARPU for our tax-inclusive plans is in the $4 range.  We were able to mitigate the majority of this dilution with the sale of our full range of service plans, including our $60 world unlimited offering.
Our CPGA continues to be one of the lowest of any facilities-based wireless carriers in the U.S. For the first quarter, our CPGA was $146, up $8 sequentially and up approximately $12 year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in CPGA was primarily driven by increased promotional activities in all of our metropolitan areas. Our business continues to scale, and our CPU continues to be among the lowest in the wireless industry. Our CPU for the quarter was $18.79 as compared to $16.69 in the prior year's first quarter. This increase was due primarily to an increase in retention expense due to handset subsidies on existing customers. The inclusion of the regulatory fees and the tax-inclusive service pricing on our Wireless for All customers, as well as costs associated with our unlimited international call plan.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was approximately to $224 million, an increase of approximately 13% year-over-year. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 26% compared to 27% in the first quarter of 2009. Over the trailing 12 months, we have generated record consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $981 million.
I'd like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the quarter, on a consolidated basis our service revenue and cost of service grew approximately 17% and 16% to approximately $853 million and $285 million respectively. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $160 million for the first quarter of 2010, representing an increase of approximately $23 million when compared to the year-ago quarter. This increase is primarily related to increased promotional activities in launching Wireless for All.
We generated $225 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter, a decrease of approximately $82 million from the prior year's first quarter. Offsetting this operating cash flow we incurred capital expenditures of $139 million during the quarter. Our results demonstrate our focus and ability to grow the business while generating positive cash flow. We also generated approximately $23 million in consolidated net income for the first quarter or $0.06 per share compared to $44 million and $0.12 per share for the prior year first quarter. The prior year quarter does include a one-time gain of approximately $25 million on disposal of assets. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the one-time gain, EPS for the first quarter of 2009 would have been $0.05 per share.
To help the Street with forecasts going forward, based on the amount of tax NOLs we have outstanding at just under $1 billion and including the ongoing amortization of our spectrum licenses for tax purposes, we do not anticipate at this time paying meaningful cash taxes until 2014.
MetroPCS recently made significant changes to the pricing structure of its service plans and has enhanced its market position. Thus far the company has been pleased with the customer interest and results, but in what continues to be a competitive and price-sensitive market, MetroPCS does not anticipate providing financial guidance for fiscal year 2010. Thank you. Roger?"

We are very pleased to report strong quarterly results highlighted by record net addition growth in the quarter and significantly lower churn. Our strategy has and continues to be, to provide predictable, affordable and flexible unlimited service on a no-contract basis. With a robust handset lineup, national coverage, international offerings and our 4G LTE network under construction, we intend to provide subscribers with a post-pay experience in a pre-pay environment. This is truly an exciting time.
After taking an extensive review of our competitive position in the marketplace in early January 2010, we introduced our Wireless for All rate plans. These rate plans significantly re-positioned our business. By moving to tax and regulatory fee-inclusive rate plans, we addressed a desire from the subscriber with simplicity and predictable pricing. We believe these new rate plans and their respective price points solidify our position as offering the best deal in town. 
We believe the change in rate plans, including the elimination of the first month free, lowering handset prices by a corresponding amount and our new marketing campaign have resonated with our customers and have positioned us well for the future. We are approaching a point in time in which the wireless experience will dramatically improve. In our markets, we have been actively building our 4G LTE network, and in early 2010, we have completed our first test calls in both our Dallas, Fort Worth and Las Vegas markets.  The introduction of commercially available 4G LTE is an exciting prospect and illustrates an enhanced technology that promises major improvements to the broadband wireless experience. The world is moving towards 4G LTE service, and here in the U.S., we are the clear leader in the No-Contract segment. The Internet is going mobile, and when we launch 4G LTE, we will be well positioned to enable subscribers to utilize the next-generation network on advanced smartphones and QWERTY handsets. It will be a premium service at an affordable price.
4G LTE will enable exciting new services, including many video applications, but importantly from our perspective, moving towards 4G greater capacity and significantly reducing cost per bit. We believe that one of the significant advantages of LTE is that the cost of adding capacity is substantially less than adding the same amount of capacity on CDMA and has a game-changing consequence. As industry-wide prices for data per bit are declining, LTE enables MetroPCS to further improve its world-class cost structure for broadband data access. 
Part of our long-term strategy is to manage one of the lowest-cost networks of any U.S.-based broadband wireless carrier. The combination of our CPU and CPGA metrics are among the lowest in the industry, and help us compete effectively while delivering healthy, adjusted EBITDA margins. In building our 4G network, we're able to manage our costs while advancing the technology and providing the subscriber with a superior experience. 
Our initial 4G launch will be an IP data overlay over our voice CDMA 1x RTT network. Over time, we will move to an all-IP network. This migration is expected to provide tremendous leverage in CapEx and OpEx, and drives our low-cost operating network strategy in the broadband data era.
Since we began this business we have been judicious in the use of our spectrum, and we have been pioneers in developing technologies to get the most from our spectrum holdings. For example, we have helped to pioneer six sector cell technology and extensive use of DAZ systems that enable our subscribers to enjoy tremendous service coverage and handle exceptionally high traffic on our systems. As we build our 4G network, we will continue to develop and utilize technologies that enable our subscribers to enjoy the benefits of a next-generation network. Additionally with a focus on handsets, we believe we will help to usher in wireless mobility for the way consumers access the Internet using smartphones and QWERTY handsets.
While still in early 2010, we intend to continue our focus on retaining our market and segment leadership. Our Wireless for All campaign has redefined predictability with true, all-in pricing, and we believe we have positioned the company to capitalize on this dominant, emerging paradigm. With over 7.3 million subscribers and nationwide coverage of approximately 220 million POPS, we have grown tremendously in the past few years. We have also evolved the business to deliver our subscribers a post-pay experience on a no-contract pay-in-advance basis. The rapid growth in our subscriber base provides us an opportunity to redefine the wireless experience for the entire industry. Industry analysts projects that the No-Contract Service segment will drive much of the growth in the wireless service industry going forward. Within the Unlimited segment of wireless, total revenue is forecasted to grow at roughly a 25% CAGR through 2013.
From an investment standpoint, we are focused on creating long-term shareholder value. We believe investors should focus on four items when looking at MetroPCS, including: our company's ability to innovate and offer services and products customers truly want; our continued differentiation in the marketplace; our strong balance sheet and the ability to generate free cash flow; and finally, our ability to grow profitably. We've had a record first quarter, and we're pleased so far with our momentum going into the summer months. We're focused on growing the business profitably and launching our 4G service with a focus on maintaining our cost leadership position. Thank you. We'll now move to the Q&A. Operator?"

That's been really important as we've gone forward with the campaign Wireless for All. I think the second piece that we looked at is as we re-trained our whole base, we actually educated every one of our salespeople on the benefits of the rate plans. So as we sell the rate plan, now consumers truly understand what's inside of every rate plan, and we find that they're using more of the elements of the rate plan than they probably did before when the service was given away for free."

Whether we're significantly better than that or about the same, I think we're going to be looking at it as we go into second and third quarters."

We have a robust set of handsets. We introduced nine handsets last year. We found a really good sweet spot with our QWERTY handsets, and we also mentioned in our survey data that we're seeing a tremendous amount of people who want to leave a contract and get the benefits, as Roger mentioned, of contracted service in a no-contract environment, and that's really important in the economy. We think it's modestly improving, but people don't want the connection to a contract when they can get a lower-priced handset and get all the benefits of the contracted service."

You had trade downs, you had repricing, you had a lot of new ads coming in at higher ARPU levels, and then there's some of the old base that may or may not have changed. So could you kind of help us get a sense as to whether we should be anticipating ARPU growth now? Because four out of five gross ads are coming in at higher plans?

So in paying for the first month of service, that is a major factor in the shift that we've seen. We think that's probably the key inside of everything.

So and at the same time, we've been able to, as I had mentioned, that we've been able to, shall we say, transform where the value goes. So now we've reduced our handset prices by a corresponding amount that we used to, shall we say, look towards the first month of free service. Now the customer pays that. So I think this has been a total transformation to a new paradigm, to the all-tax-inclusive paradigm that we think is so critical for this, and I believe that we're looking at stabilizing ARPU as opposed to shifting it in any particular direction.

So there will be a more gradual buildup, but there will be a build up. One thing I might add, though, is that as you go to the backhaul world, it's really a cottage industry and there's very fragmented market. There's not just one player to negotiate with. There are many players. There are some more major ones, agreed, but some of the advantages that we're seeing is in going to an Ethernet foundation, and the value we have in having the kind of traffic that we already incur is that the Ethernet backhaul and the move to that will be, in some cases even be a cost-savings because we have so much traffic now. And we have not taken full advantage of the [ph] staff at each pay (55:22) station that we will have under our 4G scenario. So it's mostly a cost increase, but there are some savings and as the backhaul increases, the pricing is quite dramatic in terms of price per bit at higher backhaul rates and lower backhaul rates.

Good morning, everyone. The transformation of our company with Wireless for All continued in the second quarter, where we delivered record subscriber net additions of 303,000. I'm also very pleased to report record low churn of 3.3%, dow",751,"Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. The transformation of our company with Wireless for All continued in the second quarter, where we delivered record subscriber net additions of 303,000. I'm also very pleased to report record low churn of 3.3%, down 250 basis points from the second quarter of 2009 and down approximately 40 basis points sequentially. The strong subscriber growth and record low churn this quarter, combined with our low-cost operating structure, drove record-adjusted EBITDA of $322 million, representing growth of approximately 38% in the quarter. 
We are focused on executing on our Wireless for All initiatives. Our record low churn in the quarter was primarily driven by the acceptance of our Wireless for All offerings, including a significant increase in year-over-year reactivations. Clearly, subscribers are reconfirming their choice in MetroPCS. 
We believe our Wireless for All go-to-market strategy reasserted our no-contract segment leadership. Importantly, Wireless for All was not just a rate-plan change. It was a multi-faceted transformation of our business system, which took extensive planning and execution. The no-contract wireless industry continues to evolve, and we are optimizing our business for sustained execution.
Our second quarter results are truly a continuation of the positive impact we saw from Wireless for All in the first quarter of the year. Six months into the year, customer response has exceeded our expectations, and we are pleased with our execution as we believe our current price points provide outstanding value to the consumer. 
We have demonstrated that there remains significant growth opportunity within the no-contract segment. As of June 2010, in the aggregate of all of our operating markets, MetroPCS has approximately 1/3 of all no-contract subscribers, according to a third-party study. The no-contract segment is growing quickly. And for the last several quarters, a third party estimates that over 50% of total wireless decisions are choosing no-contract wireless service plans. 
Other wireless companies recognize the growth opportunities within the no-contract space, and we have seen increasing segmentation and differentiation over the past 12 months. Our Wireless for All initiatives, low-cost operating structure and unlimited service plans are specifically tailored and engineered to capture the growth within this segment.
Churn this quarter declined both year-over-year and sequentially. The decline in churn is primarily due to the continued benefit of the move to Wireless for All tax-inclusive plans. Approximately 2/3 of our customers are now on tax-inclusive plans at the end of the second quarter. Our customers now pay for the first month of service, with all taxes and fees included, and this has reduced first-month bill shock. 
We have also lowered handset prices by a corresponding amount. So the net-net of customer spending is the same amount of cash in the initial transaction. Without a free month of service, subscribers now upgrade their handset and leave their current number in service.
Our Wireless for All transformation and our focus on our distribution channel enables us to optimize our rate-plan mix, thus stabilizing ARPU and maximizing customer satisfaction. As we move forward, we believe the launch of premium 4G service offerings could have a positive impact on ARPU.
A key component in our record second quarter net subscriber additions is delivering to consumers handsets that they really want. Subscribers increasingly use their handsets to access the Internet, as broadband has truly gone mobile.
Smartphones and QWERTY handsets are popular among our subscribers, and we will continue to introduce compelling handsets to our lineup from OEMs, including Samsung, LG, Kyocera, Huawei, ZTE and Motorola. We were very pleased with our recent introduction of our next-generation BlackBerry Curve to the northeast markets. Users of our BlackBerry service save approximately half of what they would spend with one of the national wireless contract providers. 
We are very pleased with our execution six months into the year. We believe we will see our typical third quarter seasonality and would expect lower net subscriber additions and higher churn for the third quarter consistent with historical norms.
In our operating markets, competitive pressures, increased competition from big-box retailers and the need for carriers to meet and exceed expectations are realities. While we acknowledge these pressures, we have modeled our annual expectations accordingly to maintain profitable growth as we encounter competition, support our distribution partners and provide no-contract unlimited wireless services to over 95 million potential customers. We believe national carriers will have great difficulty in conducting an isolated price war in the no-contract segment without directly impacting the contract subscriber base. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."
31463,108415371,72501,"MetroPCS Communications Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2010",2010-08-05,"Earnings Calls","MetroPCS Communications, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning. We reported strong second quarter 2010 operational and financial results. We had record second quarter net additions of 303,000 and ended the quarter with over 7.6 million subscribers, up 22% from the second quarter of 2009. Our",949,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning. We reported strong second quarter 2010 operational and financial results. We had record second quarter net additions of 303,000 and ended the quarter with over 7.6 million subscribers, up 22% from the second quarter of 2009. Our second quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $322 million was a record for the company, and it was up approximately 38% year-over-year. 
Our strong results this quarter are largely due to two factors: Our successful launch and execution of our Wireless for All service plans, coupled with our focused management on our superior cost structure. We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Our strong cash position enables us to look at opportunities for general corporate purposes, which could include opportunistic spectrum acquisitions, corporate development opportunities, future technology initiatives or the retirement of outstanding debt.
We took a key step in terming out the maturity schedule of our capital structure by recently completing an amendment and extension of our existing term B credit facility. We were pleased with the reception of this transaction in the marketplace, whereby we extended $1 billion of our $1.54 billion in secured debt by three years to 2016. We felt that increasing the LIBOR spread for the amount extended by 125 basis points for this three-year extension is a prudent trade-off.
Our total leverage was under 3.5x, computed in accordance with the indebtedness governing 9 1/4% senior notes at the end of June, and our net average is now below 2.5x. With debt maturities in late 2013 and 2014 and now, 2016; the weighted average cost of debt for the quarter of below 7.5%; the majority of our debt fixed, by its nature or through interest rate swaps; and with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, we believe we are very well-positioned from a balance-sheet perspective.
We're proud of our record net subscriber additions for this quarter. I'd like to again remind those on the call that we operate in a seasonal business. Historically, the third quarter has generally seen lower net subscriber additions and a sequential increase in churn. This is our expectation for the third quarter of 2010.
Churn for the quarter was 3.3%, down 250 basis points year-over-year and down 40 basis points on a sequential basis. The decrease in churn was primarily driven by the acceptance of our Wireless for All offerings, including the decline in false churn, as a combination of our realigned dealer incentives and stronger value propositions took effect.
Our second quarter 2010 ARPU was $39.84, down $0.68 on a year-over-year basis and up $0.01 on a sequential basis. The decrease in ARPU year-over-year was primarily due to the introduction of our new Wireless for All service plans in January 2010, which included all applicable taxes and regulatory fees. The burden on ARPU for our tax-inclusive plans is in the $4 range. We were able to mitigate the majority of this dilution with the sale of our full range of service plans, including our $60-world unlimited offering. We are pleased with the stabilization of ARPU experienced in the second quarter. 
Our CPGA continues to be one of the lowest of any facilities-based carriers in the United States. For the second quarter, our CPGA was $164, up approximately $4 over the prior year's second quarter. As you can see in our supplemental slides, our current cost of churn is approximately $5, which is truly best-of-class. 
Our business continues to scale, and our CPU continues to be among the lowest in the wireless industry. Our CPU for the quarter was $17.90 as compared to $16.82 in the prior year's second quarter. This increase was due primarily to an increase from retention expenses related to handset subsidies on existing customers, the inclusion of regulatory fees in our Wireless for All customers, as well as the costs associated with our unlimited international calling plan. The increase in CPU would have been much higher without the continued scaling of our business.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $322 million, an increase of approximately 38% year-over-year. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 35% compared to 30% in the second quarter of 2009. Over the trailing 12 months, we have generated record consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion.
I'd like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the quarter, on a consolidated basis, our service revenue and cost of service grew 20% and approximately 15% to $922 million and $308 million, respectively. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. 
Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $159 million for the second quarter of 2010, representing an increase of $16 million when compared to a year-ago quarter. We generated $112 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter, a decrease of $47 million from the prior year's second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in cash used for working capital. 
We incurred capital expenditures of approximately $176 million during the second quarter of 2010. During the quarter, our unlevered free cash flow was approximately $146 million. Our results demonstrate our focus and ability to grow the business while generating cash flow over the long term. We believe free cash flows will increase significantly, as we complete our LTE deployment in 2010 and early 2011.
We generated approximately $80 million in consolidated net income during the second quarter, representing year-over-year growth of over 200% or $0.22 per share, compared to $26 million or $0.07 per share in the prior-year quarter. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Roger."

Today, we reported outstanding quarterly results driven by a strong net subscriber additions, lower churn and a continued focus on expense management. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA was the highest in company history, at $322 million for the second quarter and $1.1 billion in the last 12 months.
In the first six months of 2010, we have added approximately 1 million subscribers to our base. At the end of the second quarter, we served over 7.6 million subscribers. This represents total subscriber growth of over 22% from the second quarter of last year. 
The no-contract market is the core of our business model, and we have focused on the unlimited segment to drive our cost leadership. We believe that the no-contract segment will continue to expand in the U.S. and, ultimately, approach levels of adoption seen in some European countries.
Wireless for All introduced in early 2010 reposition MetroPCS to capitalize on the opportunity within the fastest growing area of wireless to no-contract segment. We provide a postpaid experience in the no-contract environment. We intend to continue to execute on our strategy of providing the subscribers predictable, affordable and flexible wireless service. By offering a number of compelling services in our rate plan, we believe we provide real value to wireless consumers. 
So wireless industry is dynamic, and our move to Wireless for All highlights our ability to innovate. It requires significant systems development and changes at every level of the organization. But more importantly, in a highly competitive marketplace, it also highlights our ability to be a nimble competitor. 
I'd like to highlight some of the new services we anticipate offering in the future. We are in the process of creating a proprietary MetroPCS studio. When introduced, we expect this application will provide streaming video, full-track downloads and television channels, all powered by our 4G LTE network. As we move towards the start of launching 4G LTE service in the second half of this year, we believe our subscribers will increasingly use their web-based handset to fully access a multimedia environment recognizing the phone's transition to an entertainment device.
LTE leadership will further improve our service features and ability to gain market share, while maintaining cost and price differentials. This affords MetroPCS the opportunity to potentially be the only carrier offering a range of service rate plans, payment options and handsets to the growing no-contract market segment.
We are excited with the upcoming launch of 4G LTE services in our metropolitan areas. 4G LTE services are about creating a multimedia data experience for our subscribers. In the no-contract segment, we are clearly the leader in 4G LTE network deployment for smartphone devices. We anticipate our first two market launches will be in Dallas-Fort Worth and Las Vegas, with the Samsung Craft, the first LTE smartphone approved by the FCC [Federal Communications Commission].
In the future, we also look forward to migrating our CDMA voice customers to 4G LTE VoIP. We believe this will provide a significant cost advantage and makes full use of our spectrum resources, while providing a substantial additional capacity. We believe the investment we are making now will provide our wireless subscribers the first 4G LTE smartphone in the no-contract wireless segment. 
And even more exciting, it's possible that in the future, subscribers will have multiple devices connected to the network, providing an opportunity to significantly exceed penetration rates of 100%. Initially, the smartphone will be the primary device we will offer to access our 4G LTE network. But in the future, the evolution will undoubtedly incorporate additional devices like netbooks and tablets. 
It's exciting to look out over the next several years and envision the 4G LTE environment, with opportunity to drive incremental revenue and value for the business. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter and first half of 2010 results. 
The wireless industry is very competitive. But the no-contract space is where the growth opportunity exists, and we are the leaders in this space. We are executing well, and effectively balancing financial performance with subscriber growth. Our Wireless for All strategy enable us to expand on our leadership position in the no-contract space. We are committed to the next evolution of our business: 4G, LTE, broadband services.

There's some concern about the fact that the so-called pay-in-advance, prepaid market is not getting the growth that everybody expects. I think there's several things operating here. As you know, we are in a very difficult economic environment. And we have said all along, for the last, really, year and a half, that this has been an overhang on the marketplace. But there's one thing that I'd like to point out that I try to cover in my comments and that is, that our objective in expanding this no-contract segment is to step up our ability to provide not only handsets but services that people would expect in a post-pay environment. We don't have parity now. I mean, let's be very blunt about it. The no-contract segment, in most cases, is not at parity with what you can receive in services and in handset selection from the contract side of the business. So we think we have a great opportunity, and 4G is really a transformation of our network. And it gives us the opportunity to get at, shall we say, at parity, obviously, with the exception of exclusive handset deals that have permeated the carrier business in the last few years. But nevertheless, I think you're seeing there's a tremendous increase in smartphones. I think you're going to see the emergence, as we already have, of the Android and competing with the Apple operating system in handset. So I think what we'll see is that the No-contract segment is going to have a much stronger parity, and that causes a real issue for contract providers because of the concerns for, shall we say, shifting sales, if not cannibalization into the no-contract space. That is our space. It is a cost-based strength that we have. We intend to use it. And now we're approaching, we think, an opportunity to be at greater parity with the postpaid side of the business."

So a customer walks out of the store understanding what's in a $45 or $50 rate plan, or $60 with ILD. Where before, they spent more time picking out a handset since that was the primary driver, and they went to the counter, and the rate plan probably wasn't as important. They got the first month bill with the $50-rate plan, taxes and fees on top of that, they get sticker shock and then they run away from us at a much easier rate. So what we've done now is we've forced the training at the counter, so when you realize that you're getting a $50-rate plan, you know everything that's in it.

One of the things that we believe, as you heard me talk today, is we need to have multiple OEMs with us. We need to work hard with them to continue to develop handsets, not to get a stale lineup. And I think today, you'll find us in most of our distribution partners for anywhere between 15 to 18 SKUs.

And next year will be a very strong offering of units that I think everybody would classify as either QWERTY or smartphones with a pretty heavy mix of smartphones. I think this is a critical transformation for us in the pay-in-advance, or for that matter, the prepaid industry as usually described. Because the services offered is really not from looking back up to the same standard as you would expect to get in the post-pay environment. And so I think this will be terribly important, and prices of smartphones are coming down. I think we said a year and a half ago that we would expect to get below $100 in the next few years for an LTE smartphone.

Is that about the magnitude of churn increase we should be looking for this time around? And then on ARPU, Braxton, it sounds like you're doing really well at selling the higher-rate plans, but that's offset by family-plan dilution. Does that keep ARPU from expanding from these levels? Do you think it bounces around this $39 to $40 range? Or is there some level of saturation of family plans where the impact of selling higher-rate plans actually drives ARPU up from these levels? And then finally, I apologize for the laundry list, but on CCU [cash cost per user], it actually came in lower than we expected given the cost pressures from the new rate plans. Does CCU decline from here as the business scales? Or there's some one-time impacts that we should think about?"

Let me take a couple and I'd like to ask Roger to talk about our view on ARPU and the dynamics associated with that, especially as we enter the LTE realm. But let's first talk about CPU, and I think you bring up a very important point that our business continues to scale. But one of the foundational tenets of our company has always been a laser focus on cost control. And it wasn't kind of does your early [ph] thing that which has started doing a year ago because we're really back to the foundation and forming of our company, and it's something that we are always focused on. And I think you'd see those in all of our metrics and the results, but the power of scale is significant. You're looking at a world-class CPU of a company that is a little less than 7 million subs versus what you have with very, very large industry players that are many multiples the size of us. So yes, we do see that there are some real benefits coming from scale. I came up earlier in the call that there will be some expenses associated with LTE. And some of those expenses will be a step function as we build and rollout the markets, and that will cause some short-term pressure. But as Roger very clearly indicated, we believe that we'll more than adequately cover that with the scale of our business over time. On the churn equation, we're not really going to give specific guidance as to what churn is going to be for the third quarter. But we wanted to make it clear that the expectation is that it would increase, and I think very astutely. You look at the trends that we've seen year-over-year and last year was certainly an anomaly. But there has been historically a 30 basis point, plus or minus, five, 10 basis point increase in churn going from the second to third quarter. The dynamics this year on is we have Wireless for All not in place for all of the first quarter. So you did see some residual benefit of having a full quarter of that in the second quarter. So you need to take that into account when you're trying to model this. And I think the final thing I can say about churn, as Tom mentioned in his part of the prepared presentation, that we expected that churn will increase generally consistent with historic norms. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Roger to talk a little bit about your question on ARPU."

The other side is the pressure from competitive standpoint that we don't get too far out of our skin in terms of the overall ARPU for all our services. We are adding applications, but I think that that's on the margin relatively small. So depending on the build up of LTE, and I think I would think about it more in this light, that it will be more gradual. We will not be offering services in all our markets until the end of the year or very early next year, depending upon the build program. And we would expect that to be an impact at that point. So I wouldn't see great jumps, I would see more gradualism. We'll continue to be competitive. But that's the one area that I identify that we would have some opportunity for upward movement."

The disadvantage is on video streaming. And we have worked on the, shall we say, in the optimization area for our network to provide a good experience on our smartphones for streaming video over YouTube. There will be other sites that will be accessible. So we're working on the compression and the, shall we say, the network side to provide a better experience. But for just web browsing and the like, side-by-side comparisons do not show great differences. It's full-track downloads and streaming video where we have the differentials. And to the extent we can work on specific sites like YouTube, that, I think, we can get a reasonable parity until we have a much stronger offering in our 4G LTE network, which obviously does away with all those limitations."

As we said in the last quarter call that we currently expect to have adequate NOL to keep us from paying any meaningful federal taxes through early 2014. There'll be some minor state taxes that we pay prior to 2014, but we don't really become a significant cash taxpayer until 2014. The second question, I think it's helpful to look at the previous guidance that we included in our 10-Q on CapEx, which for 2010, is $600 million to $800 million, of which, we commented that roughly half of it relates to LTE. When you really look at the dynamics of what's going on in 2010, we're certainly expanding networks and making our markets more relevant as we will continue to do in the future. But once you really get pass in the LTE spend and rationalization, probably more steady course without major market builds, is really roughly what we're spending in 2010, minus the LTE. Now I do want to say, there will be some LTE spend in 2011 as we continue to fully deploy LTE in all of our networks. So you shouldn't expect a 50% drop off next year. But the neat thing about LTE is it has tremendous scaling aspects unlike our CDMA CapEx. And that's not only from a CapEx standpoint, it's from an OpEx standpoint. The LTE overlay that we're deploying on our CDMA network, basically has the ability to scale without adding additional carriers like you do in the CDMA world, which means you really have more of a step-function increase in your CapEx and then you get tremendous CapEx scale after the initial deployment. And the same is true with the way that we're deploying backhaul. Roger, would you like to touch base on that a little because this is such an important point."

Well, there's two major elements, obviously. One is that we've now are deep into the exploration and gaining contracts with specific entities and as, I think, most of you are well aware, the cost per megabit as you increase the speeds are pretty significantly reduced. So there's a tremendous difference in going from say 10 bits to 20, as it is from zero to five. And so there's a tremendous scaling opportunity in that sense. Obviously, there are many, many providers and this is becoming a very competitive front, a very important one, and that's one dimension of it. The other dimension of it is that with stack boxes [ph] in all our base stations that we have, LTE and CDMA, and by the way, the build is in place. So we're using all the facilities of our existing infrastructure, while we're adding these, let's call it, innovees [ph], to give us the LTE capability, is the fact that we're going to be overlaying our traffic on CDMA in the LTE network. So as we scale up in terms of users and capacity, that we get the benefit of both CDMA traffic and LTE. So I think combining it gives us scale out-of-the-box and as we get more scale, the price elasticity, or if you will, the cost to us elasticity, is very, very high. So higher volumes of data rate are at on a per bit basis much lower."

I'm pleased to report third quarter results that have significantly improved from the third quarter 2009. Net subscriber additions of 223,000, churn of 3.8% and gross additions of over one million drove record third quarter adjusted EBITDA of over $315 million, up 16% to year-over-year. Our Wireless for All initiatives continue to be our area of focus. Our year-over-year improvements in operations and financial results have exceeded our expectations and are attributable to the success we have had experienced with our wireless role rollouts. Our existing subscribers have responded positively to the elimination of our first month free and our corresponding reduction in handset price. As a result, false churn has declined as our subscribers continue to upgrade their handsets at higher levels than last year. This increase in upgrade activity has substantially reduced false churn. And going forward, we believe we could manage churn in a 3% to 4% range on a sustainable basis.
The no-contract wireless industry continues to be dynamic and over the past nine months, we have optimized our business and continue our leadership position. Existing subscribers are reconfirming their choice in MetroPCS as evidenced by the increase in upgrade activity. Wireless customers are gravitating towards no-contract wireless offerings and we are providing new subscribers with a greater predictability, flexibility and affordability. Since the introduction of Wireless for All in early January, we have added over 1.2 million net subscriber additions and upgraded approximately 35% of our existing subscriber base, including approximately 12% in the third quarter.
We continue to see wireless subscribers looking for alternatives to contracted wireless service. Recently, internal survey data indicates that approximately 1/3 of our new gross additions were previously contracted wireless subscribers. Our no-contract service offering is continuing to attract users looking for alternatives to long-term commitments. At the end of the Third Quarter 2010, MetroPCS has achieved a total market penetration of 8.1%, based on approximately 97 million covered POPs, of which we added four million covered POPs during the year. Additionally, nearly one quarter of our total covered POPs are under two years old.
At the end of the third quarter, approximately 80% of our subscribers were on tax inclusive plans. One of our goals in moving towards Wireless for All was to improve the overall customer experience. Our Committed network of indirect exclusive dealers are a key component of the success of Wireless for All. Well-trained, helpful, enthusiastic brand ambassadors ensure that our value quality and technology messages are being heard and understood. As the sales network engages on a monthly basis with our customers, answering questions, describing handset capabilities and offering the latest selection of services, our brand value is reinforced and promoted. This customer touch point philosophy is a key differentiator and sets us apart from a traditional, non-assisted big-box transaction.
Late in the quarter, we were very proud to be the first U.S. wireless provider to commercially launch 4G LTE services in Las Vegas and Dallas/Ft. Worth. We launched service with the Samsung Craft, the first 4G LTE handset in the world. Since our initial launches, we have expanded 4G LTE services to Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia and we'll continue to introduce 4G LTE service into our markets throughout the remainder of 2010 and into early 2011.
Our launched 4G LTE networks are performing well. While still early, subscribers are responding positively to the enhancements afforded by the 4G LTE network. Interest in MetroSTUDIO, our 18 channel video library powered by RealNetworks and utilizing content from NBC, Univision, DET and others is growing. Through Wireless for All, and as we launch additional 4G LTE markets, our subscribers have demonstrated a willingness and a desire for newer handsets. Increasingly, our subscribers are looking for handsets that offer a wide range of functionality that allows for access to the latest content sources. We believe that this desire will continue and we plan to provide our customers with the rich assortment of device options.
In Q4, we anticipate launching multiple Android devices. Additionally, in early 2011, we expect to introduce our first 4G LTE Android smartphone. Today, we introduced Metro USA, which allows MetroPCS subscribers to use their service in a footprint that now covers over 280 million POPs. This increased coverage provide subscribers with incredible value and brings parity when compared to the larger national carriers as we continue to provide a postpaid experience in a pay-in-advance no-contract model. This is the future of wireless. 
We have the best-in-class cost structure and we are constantly working to leverage this cost structure to increase our market share. Building on our no-contract legacy, we have continued to evolve our offerings and design products that are accretive to our existing portfolio. Recently, we introduced a by-the-minute trial, exclusively in Wal-Mart that exemplifies this goal. This card's product feature includes unlimited text, web access and metered minutes in either $20 or $30 cards. This by-the-minute product could expand our addressable market opportunity, has been introduced a new segment of customers to the MetroPCS value proposition.
Launching our 4G LTE services, offering a national footprint with our new Metro USA coverage platform and expanding our serviceable market with by-the-minute cards are examples of our desire and our ability to innovate and grow. At the beginning of the year, we announced the transformation of our business. Now, nine months into the year, we are pleased with the results and we have demonstrated sustainable improvements in key operating metrics, highlighted by lower churn and continued subscriber growth.
Operationally, we continue to focus on execution at every level and we are focused on continuing our profitable growth into the future. It is a very competitive environment but for the nine months of 2010, I'm very pleased with our ability to plan, execute and deliver outstanding results.

We reported strong third quarter 2010 operational and financial results. Third quarter net additions totaled 223,000. We ended the quarter with approximately 7.9 million subscribers, up 24% from third quarter 2009 and up 18% fro",1024,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning. We reported strong third quarter 2010 operational and financial results. Third quarter net additions totaled 223,000. We ended the quarter with approximately 7.9 million subscribers, up 24% from third quarter 2009 and up 18% from the beginning of 2010. We recorded our highest third quarter adjusted EBITDA in company history of $315 million, up approximately 16% year-over-year. This is the eighth quarter in a row in which we have reported year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of well over 10% and over the past three years we have grown quarterly adjusted EBITDA at over a 20% CAGR.
Our strong results this quarter are largely due to two factors. Our successful launch and execution of Wireless for All service plans, coupled with our focused management on our superior cost structure. We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. This includes $687 million of cash we are holding that has been used to return outstanding 9 1/4% senior notes at the call date of November 1, 2010. We continue to look at attractive and accretive ways to deploy our cash, including organic growth, general corporate purposes, opportunistic spectrum acquisitions, corporate development opportunities, future technology initiatives or the retirement of outstanding debt. 
In September, we continue to extend and stagger our debt maturity profile on our balance sheet, with the issuance of one billion and new 7 7/8% senior notes due 2018, of which 313 million was used to retire 9 1/4% senior notes in the third quarter. This refinancing coupled with the one billion amend and extend of our senior credit facility completed earlier this summer where key steps in turning out maturity schedule of our capital structure. These are key milestones in our capital structure formation for the next decade. Our total leverage pro forma the redemption on November 1 was 3.3x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our 9 1/4% senior notes at the end of September, and our net leverage at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.2x. Based on a very manageable maturity schedule, our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter are below 7.5%, the majority of our debt fixed by its nature of interest rate swaps and our significant cash and short-term investments. We believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
During the month of October, we successfully executed the forward interest rate swap on $950 million of our senior secured credit facility for an average rate of 4.6% all-in for the period February 2012 to February 2014. 
Churn for the quarter was 3.8%, down 200 basis points year-over-year. This decrease in churn was primarily driven by the acceptance of our Wireless for All offerings, including a decline in false churns as a combination of our realigned dealer incentives and stronger value propositions took effect.
Our third quarter ARPU was $39.69, down $1.39 on a year-over-year bases and down $0.15 on a sequential basis. The decrease in ARPU year-over-year was primarily due to the introduction of our new Wireless for All service plans in January 2010, which include all applicable taxes and regulatory fees.
Deferred non-ARPU for our tax inclusive plans is in the $4 range per subscriber. We were able to mitigate the majority of this dilution with the sale of our full range of service plans, including a $60-world unlimited offering. We are pleased with the continued stability which we have experienced with ARPU.
Our CPGA continues to be one of the lowest of any facilities-based wireless carrier in the U.S. For third quarter, our CPGA was $161, up $7 over the prior year third quarter. The increase is primarily due to lower gross additions. As can be seen in our supplemental slides, our current cost churn is approximately $6, which is truly best-in-class.
Our business continues to scale, and our CPU continues to be among the lowest in the wireless industry. Our CPU for the quarter was $18.47 as compared to $17.27 in the prior year's third quarter. This increase was primarily due to an increase in retention expense related to handset upgrades by existing subscribers and the inclusion of regulatory fees in our Wireless for All service plans. 
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $316 million, an increase of approximately 16% year-over-year. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 33.4%, compared to 33.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Over the trailing 12 months, we've generated record consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. This is particularly impressive, given the potential margin dilution that could've occurred with the Wireless for All service plans and our 4G LTE's network rollout. 
I'd like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the quarter, on a consolidated basis, our service revenue and cost of service grew 16% and 5%, respectively, to $942 million and $314 million, respectively. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were $147 million for third quarter of 2010, representing an increase of $9 million when compared to a year ago. We generated $342 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter and the increase of $29 million from the prior year's third quarter. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in cash flow from working capital. We incurred capital expenditures of $233 million during the third quarter. During the quarter, our unlevered free cash flow was approximately $82 million. Our results demonstrate our focus and ability to grow the business while generating cash flow's over the long term. With our current outlook for future adjusted EBITDA and CapEx, we believe free cash flows will increase significantly as we complete our 4G LTE deployment in 2010 and 2011.
Our current estimate for total 2010 capital expenditures is $750 million to $850 million. We generated $77 million in consolidated net income during the third quarter, representing year-over-year of 5% or $0.22 per share compared to $74 million and $0.21 per share in the prior year quarter. 
I'd like to now turn it over to Roger."

This quarter's performance, as well as our year-to-date performance, is a result of the continued success with what we have launched in the beginning of 201",1024,"Thank you, Braxton. Our financial and operational performance during the third quarter was strong. This quarter's performance, as well as our year-to-date performance, is a result of the continued success with what we have launched in the beginning of 2010, the Wireless for All family of service plans. With our recent introduction of Metro USA, we now offer service which bring us to parity with postpaid offerings. This expanded set of service offerings provides in our view incredible value to our subscribers and also expands our addressable market. While Tom and Braxton focused their comments on third quarter operational and financial results, I would like to spend some time discussing our long-term strategy at MetroPCS.
MetroPCS has been on the leading edge of network technology since we launched our business in 2002. We were the first to launch an all 1xRTT CDMA network back in 2002. We were the first to pioneer widespread six sector cell technology. We were the first to launch an AWS network in the U.S., and we were the first company to use DAS as a primary network design component in major metro areas. All the technological innovations by MetroPCS were driven by the consideration for cost and spectral efficiences. Our commitment and our investment in 4G LTE was in large part predicated on the idea that we wanted to invest in the next evolution of wireless technology. Strategically, we made the decision to avoid an investment in the legacy technology with a limited life and instead pursued the global race to a worldwide standard, 4G LTE. To make our rollout of 4G LTE even more efficient, our approach was an incremental overlay to our existing network.
We have launched 4G LTE service in five metropolitan area so far this year, with more to be launch through the end of the year into next year. These were the first commercial launches of 4G LTE service in the United States. In addition, we were the first in the world to offer a dual mode, 4G CDMA LTE handset. We received this technological transformation as a game changer. We have previously mentioned that we decided to bypass 3G EVDO in favor of 4G LTE because LTE is far more efficient, both in terms of data rate and cost. We started working on the 4G LTE strategy three years ago, with an eye towards being one of the first carriers in the United States to launch for 4G LTE service with an LTE handset. We did this to provide leadership and drive the development of the ecosystem to address our unique business requirements with our 4G LTE launches we continue to innovate and evolve. As we introduce our markets with 4G LTE service, we are planning for the future and making way for migrating voice to VOLTE. While the ecosystem will evolve over time, once we move towards VOLTE, we expect important spectral efficiencies and cost savings will be achieved. With our adoption of 4G LTE and the movement to VOLTE, for the first time, we will be able to realize the benefits of a worldwide standard, which will include scale that comes from worldwide production being on a global standard. The GSM operators have enjoyed this advantage historically. So with LTE, MetroPCS will also benefit from a global standard. 
Further with combined voice and data, we'll have the ability to build capacity without regard to whether it will be used for voice or data. This was one of the key attributes of 1xRTT CDMA and this will once again be the case with the 4G LTE. In the first half of 2011, we intend to trial VOLTE and we look forward to transitioning our smartphone customers to LTE on voice and data. This holds the promise for significant leverage of both CapEx and OpEx cost savings. While still early, we expect 4G LTE to be the transformative technology to usher in a sea change in overall network efficiency to support the ever-increasing demand for data. 
Additionally, as handset ecosystems develop with an increasing emphasis on smartphones and QWERTY handsets, subscribers will have additional choices in finding the best wireless broadband device that meets their needs. Our focus has been and continues to be meeting customer needs as they relate to the small screen, smartphone or QWERTY handsets. We believe the small screen is where we have the greatest wireless broadband opportunity, and we are pursuing this opportunity aggressively. We are also committed to bringing smartphones to our subscribers that operate on the Android operating system. We have traditionally focused on voice, text and web service. However, with the development and inherent advantages of 4G LTE, we see an opportunity to transform our business. Increasingly, streaming video and audio are becoming a large and more important part of the wireless experience. We believe demands for video will grown significantly over the next few years. Our belief is that we are entering an environment in which subscribers will be viewing increasing amounts of video for purposes of news and entertainment. Our MetroSTUDIO service was deployed with entertainment in mind. With our MetroSTUDIO service, we believe our smartphones and services can become a true entertainment device, which allows subscribers to view and enjoy entertainment while on the go. Wireless broadband experience comes down to coverage and costs. We believe we are well positioned with our current service offerings, our 4G LTE network roadmap, as well as our future handset lineup to continue driving subscriber growth.
As the cost leader in the wireless industry with a state-of-the-art 4G broadband network and a strong network of exclusive distributors, we are in an excellent position to continue our leadership in the no-contract segment. We continue to scale the business and we intend to deliver accelerated free cash flow in the future. The efficiencies and economies to be gained through moving now to a 4G LTE network enable for the first time EBITDA and cash flow to move in the same direction. This change has the potential to enhance profitability throughout the industry and from our current view, enhance profitability conservatives and [ph] important to drive future wireless valuations."

I can't say specifically it's not totally in place, but it will be at least half a dozen handsets that we'll introduce in LTE next year. And it was critical for us, given the objectives that we have to use existing spectrum and due course to reform it to have both the narrow band as well as the wideband capability in the handset. So we needed that and we needed to focus on the PCS and AWS band.So we had to get in front of this, and this is an important development. The good news is that we have the handsets that we think we need for our smartphone lineup next year, pretty well in place, with just one or two shall we say products that need to be firmed up. But I think that this trial that we have this year is to see what we have in terms of usage, in terms of we have in customer preference. We're very pleased with the fact that people have opted for the more premium service that contains the MetroSTUDIO. And that gives them this entertainment dimension we talked about.

We have at this point, no plans to offer a lifeline or a government phone, if you will. I think the by-the-minute plan that Tom indicated gives us an opportunity for our customers to have the handset that they want and the service pricing that could very well fit into their budget. So I think over time, you'll see our approach to be really focused on people who want the handset experience in that group, but also very pressed for economics and what they can afford to spend month by month. So no, not directly, but I think we will have a broader opportunity to address at least a portion of that market. The other part and I'll aggregate this question speeds, I think we're seeing what I think Verizon has talked about. We see and it depends on the, let me predicate this, it depends on the SINR even more than the output power. So with a reasonable SINR environment, we're seeing typically around 8 Mbps  in the throughput. Now go into to a house, get into a low SINR, or Signal Interference Noise Ratio, if you go into such indoors, you'll probably be cut down to in the two megabit or two Mbps range and even below, but we have a pretty broad strong signal, we've driven -- drive test our markets and we're very pleased that we can get what we expect out of this in a reasonable, not real good signal, but a reasonable signal. We have tested on a 10 by 10, I'll give you another number that we have put out but we have tested 10 by 10 and we're north of 70 Mbps, which I think is certainly as good as others have done. I think others have tested a 20 by 20 at 120, and so we're very, very pleased we could do better than that on LTE, if we have that spectrum to test on. So I think that we're very satisfied. We see the data rates, we see also the opportunity, which is hidden in this cost of ownership and the equipment because what we'll put in place is literally a base station called e-mail B [ph] that's good for 20 by 20. And the incremental cost of adding to the spectrum as we do in CDMA is, I would say, orders at least an order of magnitude different, given the -- in other words to be able to expand the capacity of that individual base station. So that's why we're so bullish on the fact that going forward, as we make this conversion, which will take a few years, that we have an opportunity to really drive free cash flow."

What we're looking at is a global standard. There is no doubt in our mind that LTE, whether in a frequency division duplex or time division duplex form will be the world standard, and there will be no question that there'll be devices with both capabilities. And so for the first time, we have a true global standard. So we're not seeing and perhaps in the next year or two, drafting perhaps on some of the other major companies that need dual mode, but we're seeing going forward a huge opportunity to draft on worldwide production and consumption."

So we think it could have a good, long-term positive impact on our retention and churn numbers. It definitely has impact on CPU but we have two other even more significant issues going on with CPU. First is the inclusion of the regulatory fees, which we've talked about per calls is upwards to $0.75 per subscriber, and that is being absorbed now in 80% of the base. And we also have the impacts of rolling out our 4G LTE network and putting in the backhaul and the other OpEx items that are associated with that rollout.

But I think it's really important to note that what we're trying to do is, of course, this is efficiently as possible by combining voice and data traffic into ethernet, which does have a significant upfront cost that if you combine your current voice traffic it's fairly mitigated where the places where that's available. And what's really interesting is the scale that you get off of that because as you increase overall usage, the cost curve is very, very flat. Roger, would you like to add?"

The real benefit on OpEx as Braxton was indicating comes when we see the additional data traffic, which we will get and we believe we have some ARPU opportunities for is the price elasticity of the demand to go to a 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps in backhaul with an ethernet combining both CDMA and LTE traffic, is enormous. It's in the order of 10x cost reduction. So yes, we pay more but the price per bit goes down by nearly a factor of 10."

Competition, obviously, will always be a factor. I think what we're seeing is that at least for now, some bit of focus on segmentation as opposed to parties dropping their price structure and having some across-the-board dramatic impact. I think you see a more mature market now in prepaid and paying in advance. I'd like to group both of those in no-contract. So I think there's an element of stabilization, but in the segmentation, I think there's going to be a lot of creativity that occurs. We think that the importance of moving to the smartphones in the no-contract market is a critical step and also it's a very important step for us to provide the very best experience that customers could get based on data rates and handset capability. So next year, 2011, is an opportunity for us probably towards the second half of the year to be able to put up handsets and services that are truly at parity in the postpaid industry. Bringing this to the no-contract market we think has a very important initiative because our view is 2009, late 2010 was really the period of the QWERTY in the no-contract market and we think that's moving very strongly to the smartphone touchscreen going forward in 2011 and beyond. So we want to be well positioned with a variety of products based on handset prices and overall comprehensiveness of service packages that could deal with this. And we do think that as we go into the more, shall we say, extensive service packages, that there's an opportunity for some lift in ARPU, remember if we've got a base of roughly 8 million subscribers moving to ARPU for the whole company will be a challenge, but we do see an opportunity in LTE."

We think it's somewhat of a misplaced perception because postpaid is probably going to have as much volatility as any segment of the wireless market. But I think, nevertheless, we are seeing a degree of stabilization and I think that the opportunity going forward is that the small screen is going to turn into an entertainment device. We absolutely believe this. I think we're seeing every evidence of this. There is cost levels and we need to see the ecosystem develop particularly for LTE. But when it does, it will be I think a very substantial movement that will give rise to greater opportunities. So we're not going to be thinking about one handset per person, wherein we're thinking more about how many appliances a person has and who has the opportunity to support those appliances. So tablets, all items, we think, cameras, everything will turn to wireless. So we see the opportunity going forward. We think it's the question of who services these segments the best.

How are you thinking in terms of the sources of spectrum? The FCC has outlined that they want to have 100 megahertz in spectrum at some point and there's going to be a deficit of 275 megahertz by 2014. Where do you think that spectrum will come from? I mean there is only going to be like 40 to 60 from AWS-2 and AWS-3, and there's a little bit from WCS and NSS, and then the key block [ph] from 700.

I think it's fair to say that we're very interested in having a full 4G experience across our footprint. And while we will see a step down in '11, what will continue to fully built the footprint '11. Once we get passed that build, you've heard Roger talk a little bit about the CapEx efficiencies that are present with LTE, not having to -- have significantly for every carrier that you add into CDMA versus an LTE, either it be where you have essentially 20 megahertz of capacity with some small RTU fees as you grow the usage on the systems. So I think that it's a very significant point that you're making. We should see some very nice downward trajectory in our spend, barring any new market builds or other strategic items that we would do, so we're quite encouraged with that trend.

The fact is that there are tremendous economies just with having the -- which we do have roughly 10 megahertz set clear in all our markets say one that we are intend to launch LTE on. And our objective is really a reforming objective and that is to use the spectrum that we currently have, that's why it was so important to develop the ecosystem around the bands of our interest which is PCS and AWS. Others have a very strong interest in 700. And so I guess the answer to the question is we never saw a megahertz we didn't like at the right price. But on the other hand, we have a reforming plan now and we feel that, that plan is adequate for our needs because we are intending to support the small screen.

I'm pleased to report third quarter results that have significantly improved from the third quarter 2009. Net subscriber additions of 223,000, churn of 3.8% and gross additions of over one million drove record third quarter adjusted EBITDA of over $315 million, up 16% to year-over-year. Our Wireless for All initiatives continue to be our area of focus. Our year-over-year improvements in operations and financial results have exceeded our expectations and are attributable to the success we have had experienced with our wireless role rollouts. Our existing subscribers have responded positively to the elimination of our first month free and our corresponding reduction in handset price. As a result, false churn has declined as our subscribers continue to upgrade their handsets at higher levels than last year. This increase in upgrade activity has substantially reduced false churn. And going forward, we believe we could manage churn in a 3% to 4% range on a sustainable basis.
The no-contract wireless industry continues to be dynamic and over the past nine months, we have optimized our business and continue our leadership position. Existing subscribers are reconfirming their choice in MetroPCS as evidenced by the increase in upgrade activity. Wireless customers are gravitating towards no-contract wireless offerings and we are providing new subscribers with a greater predictability, flexibility and affordability. Since the introduction of Wireless for All in early January, we have added over 1.2 million net subscriber additions and upgraded approximately 35% of our existing subscriber base, including approximately 12% in the third quarter.
We continue to see wireless subscribers looking for alternatives to contracted wireless service. Recently, internal survey data indicates that approximately 1/3 of our new gross additions were previously contracted wireless subscribers. Our no-contract service offering is continuing to attract users looking for alternatives to long-term commitments. At the end of the Third Quarter 2010, MetroPCS has achieved a total market penetration of 8.1%, based on approximately 97 million covered POPs, of which we added four million covered POPs during the year. Additionally, nearly one quarter of our total covered POPs are under two years old.
At the end of the third quarter, approximately 80% of our subscribers were on tax inclusive plans. One of our goals in moving towards Wireless for All was to improve the overall customer experience. Our Committed network of indirect exclusive dealers are a key component of the success of Wireless for All. Well-trained, helpful, enthusiastic brand ambassadors ensure that our value quality and technology messages are being heard and understood. As the sales network engages on a monthly basis with our customers, answering questions, describing handset capabilities and offering the latest selection of services, our brand value is reinforced and promoted. This customer touch point philosophy is a key differentiator and sets us apart from a traditional, non-assisted big-box transaction.
Late in the quarter, we were very proud to be the first U.S. wireless provider to commercially launch 4G LTE services in Las Vegas and Dallas/Ft. Worth. We launched service with the Samsung Craft, the first 4G LTE handset in the world. Since our initial launches, we have expanded 4G LTE services to Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia and we'll continue to introduce 4G LTE service into our markets throughout the remainder of 2010 and into early 2011.
Our launched 4G LTE networks are performing well. While still early, subscribers are responding positively to the enhancements afforded by the 4G LTE network. Interest in MetroSTUDIO, our 18 channel video library powered by RealNetworks and utilizing content from NBC, Univision, DET and others is growing. Through Wireless for All, and as we launch additional 4G LTE markets, our subscribers have demonstrated a willingness and a desire for newer handsets. Increasingly, our subscribers are looking for handsets that offer a wide range of functionality that allows for access to the latest content sources. We believe that this desire will continue and we plan to provide our customers with the rich assortment of device options.
In Q4, we anticipate launching multiple Android devices. Additionally, in early 2011, we expect to introduce our first 4G LTE Android smartphone. Today, we introduced Metro USA, which allows MetroPCS subscribers to use their service in a footprint that now covers over 280 million POPs. This increased coverage provide subscribers with incredible value and brings parity when compared to the larger national carriers as we continue to provide a postpaid experience in a pay-in-advance no-contract model. This is the future of wireless. 
We have the best-in-class cost structure and we are constantly working to leverage this cost structure to increase our market share. Building on our no-contract legacy, we have continued to evolve our offerings and design products that are accretive to our existing portfolio. Recently, we introduced a by-the-minute trial, exclusively in Wal-Mart that exemplifies this goal. This card's product feature includes unlimited text, web access and metered minutes in either $20 or $30 cards. This by-the-minute product could expand our addressable market opportunity, has been introduced a new segment of customers to the MetroPCS value proposition.
Launching our 4G LTE services, offering a national footprint with our new Metro USA coverage platform and expanding our serviceable market with by-the-minute cards are examples of our desire and our ability to innovate and grow. At the beginning of the year, we announced the transformation of our business. Now, nine months into the year, we are pleased with the results and we have demonstrated sustainable improvements in key operating metrics, highlighted by lower churn and continued subscriber growth.
Operationally, we continue to focus on execution at every level and we are focused on continuing our profitable growth into the future. It is a very competitive environment but for the nine months of 2010, I'm very pleased with our ability to plan, execute and deliver outstanding results. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton.

We reported strong third quarter 2010 operational and financial results. Third quarter net additions totaled 223,000.

We reported strong third quarter 2010 operational and financial results. Third quarter net additions totaled 223,000. We ended the quarter with approximately 7.9 million subscribers, up 24% from third quarter 2009 and up 18% from the beginning of 2010. We recorded our highest third quarter adjusted EBITDA in company history of $315 million, up approximately 16% year-over-year. This is the eighth quarter in a row in which we have reported year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of well over 10% and over the past three years we have grown quarterly adjusted EBITDA at over a 20% CAGR.
Our strong results this quarter are largely due to two factors. Our successful launch and execution of Wireless for All service plans, coupled with our focused management on our superior cost structure. We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. This includes $687 million of cash we are holding that has been used to return outstanding 9 1/4% senior notes at the call date of November 1, 2010. We continue to look at attractive and accretive ways to deploy our cash, including organic growth, general corporate purposes, opportunistic spectrum acquisitions, corporate development opportunities, future technology initiatives or the retirement of outstanding debt. 
In September, we continue to extend and stagger our debt maturity profile on our balance sheet, with the issuance of one billion and new 7 7/8% senior notes due 2018, of which 313 million was used to retire 9 1/4% senior notes in the third quarter. This refinancing coupled with the one billion amend and extend of our senior credit facility completed earlier this summer where key steps in turning out maturity schedule of our capital structure. These are key milestones in our capital structure formation for the next decade. Our total leverage pro forma the redemption on November 1 was 3.3x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our 9 1/4% senior notes at the end of September, and our net leverage at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.2x. Based on a very manageable maturity schedule, our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter are below 7.5%, the majority of our debt fixed by its nature of interest rate swaps and our significant cash and short-term investments. We believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
During the month of October, we successfully executed the forward interest rate swap on $950 million of our senior secured credit facility for an average rate of 4.6% all-in for the period February 2012 to February 2014. 
Churn for the quarter was 3.8%, down 200 basis points year-over-year. This decrease in churn was primarily driven by the acceptance of our Wireless for All offerings, including a decline in false churns as a combination of our realigned dealer incentives and stronger value propositions took effect.
Our third quarter ARPU was $39.69, down $1.39 on a year-over-year bases and down $0.15 on a sequential basis. The decrease in ARPU year-over-year was primarily due to the introduction of our new Wireless for All service plans in January 2010, which include all applicable taxes and regulatory fees.
Deferred non-ARPU for our tax inclusive plans is in the $4 range per subscriber. We were able to mitigate the majority of this dilution with the sale of our full range of service plans, including a $60-world unlimited offering. We are pleased with the continued stability which we have experienced with ARPU.
Our CPGA continues to be one of the lowest of any facilities-based wireless carrier in the U.S. For third quarter, our CPGA was $161, up $7 over the prior year third quarter. The increase is primarily due to lower gross additions. As can be seen in our supplemental slides, our current cost churn is approximately $6, which is truly best-in-class.
Our business continues to scale, and our CPU continues to be among the lowest in the wireless industry. Our CPU for the quarter was $18.47 as compared to $17.27 in the prior year's third quarter. This increase was primarily due to an increase in retention expense related to handset upgrades by existing subscribers and the inclusion of regulatory fees in our Wireless for All service plans. 
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $316 million, an increase of approximately 16% year-over-year. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 33.4%, compared to 33.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Over the trailing 12 months, we've generated record consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. This is particularly impressive, given the potential margin dilution that could've occurred with the Wireless for All service plans and our 4G LTE's network rollout. 
I'd like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the quarter, on a consolidated basis, our service revenue and cost of service grew 16% and 5%, respectively, to $942 million and $314 million, respectively. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were $147 million for third quarter of 2010, representing an increase of $9 million when compared to a year ago. We generated $342 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter and the increase of $29 million from the prior year's third quarter. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in cash flow from working capital. We incurred capital expenditures of $233 million during the third quarter. During the quarter, our unlevered free cash flow was approximately $82 million. Our results demonstrate our focus and ability to grow the business while generating cash flow's over the long term. With our current outlook for future adjusted EBITDA and CapEx, we believe free cash flows will increase significantly as we complete our 4G LTE deployment in 2010 and 2011.
Our current estimate for total 2010 capital expenditures is $750 million to $850 million. We generated $77 million in consolidated net income during the third quarter, representing year-over-year of 5% or $0.22 per share compared to $74 million and $0.21 per share in the prior year quarter. 
I'd like to now turn it over to Roger.

Our financial and operational performance during the third quarter was strong. This quarter's performance, as well as our year-to-date performance, is a result of the continued success with what we have launched in the beginning of 2010, the Wireless for All family of service plans. With our recent introduction of Metro USA, we now offer service which bring us to parity with postpaid offerings. This expanded set of service offerings provides in our view incredible value to our subscribers and also expands our addressable market. While Tom and Braxton focused their comments on third quarter operational and financial results, I would like to spend some time discussing our long-term strategy at MetroPCS.
MetroPCS has been on the leading edge of network technology since we launched our business in 2002. We were the first to launch an all 1xRTT CDMA network back in 2002. We were the first to pioneer widespread six sector cell technology. We were the first to launch an AWS network in the U.S., and we were the first company to use DAS as a primary network design component in major metro areas. All the technological innovations by MetroPCS were driven by the consideration for cost and spectral efficiences. Our commitment and our investment in 4G LTE was in large part predicated on the idea that we wanted to invest in the next evolution of wireless technology. Strategically, we made the decision to avoid an investment in the legacy technology with a limited life and instead pursued the global race to a worldwide standard, 4G LTE. To make our rollout of 4G LTE even more efficient, our approach was an incremental overlay to our existing network.
We have launched 4G LTE service in five metropolitan area so far this year, with more to be launch through the end of the year into next year. These were the first commercial launches of 4G LTE service in the United States. In addition, we were the first in the world to offer a dual mode, 4G CDMA LTE handset. We received this technological transformation as a game changer. We have previously mentioned that we decided to bypass 3G EVDO in favor of 4G LTE because LTE is far more efficient, both in terms of data rate and cost. We started working on the 4G LTE strategy three years ago, with an eye towards being one of the first carriers in the United States to launch for 4G LTE service with an LTE handset. We did this to provide leadership and drive the development of the ecosystem to address our unique business requirements with our 4G LTE launches we continue to innovate and evolve. As we introduce our markets with 4G LTE service, we are planning for the future and making way for migrating voice to VOLTE. While the ecosystem will evolve over time, once we move towards VOLTE, we expect important spectral efficiencies and cost savings will be achieved. With our adoption of 4G LTE and the movement to VOLTE, for the first time, we will be able to realize the benefits of a worldwide standard, which will include scale that comes from worldwide production being on a global standard. The GSM operators have enjoyed this advantage historically. So with LTE, MetroPCS will also benefit from a global standard. 
Further with combined voice and data, we'll have the ability to build capacity without regard to whether it will be used for voice or data. This was one of the key attributes of 1xRTT CDMA and this will once again be the case with the 4G LTE. In the first half of 2011, we intend to trial VOLTE and we look forward to transitioning our smartphone customers to LTE on voice and data. This holds the promise for significant leverage of both CapEx and OpEx cost savings. While still early, we expect 4G LTE to be the transformative technology to usher in a sea change in overall network efficiency to support the ever-increasing demand for data. 
Additionally, as handset ecosystems develop with an increasing emphasis on smartphones and QWERTY handsets, subscribers will have additional choices in finding the best wireless broadband device that meets their needs. Our focus has been and continues to be meeting customer needs as they relate to the small screen, smartphone or QWERTY handsets. We believe the small screen is where we have the greatest wireless broadband opportunity, and we are pursuing this opportunity aggressively. We are also committed to bringing smartphones to our subscribers that operate on the Android operating system. We have traditionally focused on voice, text and web service. However, with the development and inherent advantages of 4G LTE, we see an opportunity to transform our business. Increasingly, streaming video and audio are becoming a large and more important part of the wireless experience. We believe demands for video will grown significantly over the next few years. Our belief is that we are entering an environment in which subscribers will be viewing increasing amounts of video for purposes of news and entertainment. Our MetroSTUDIO service was deployed with entertainment in mind. With our MetroSTUDIO service, we believe our smartphones and services can become a true entertainment device, which allows subscribers to view and enjoy entertainment while on the go. Wireless broadband experience comes down to coverage and costs. We believe we are well positioned with our current service offerings, our 4G LTE network roadmap, as well as our future handset lineup to continue driving subscriber growth.
As the cost leader in the wireless industry with a state-of-the-art 4G broadband network and a strong network of exclusive distributors, we are in an excellent position to continue our leadership in the no-contract segment. We continue to scale the business and we intend to deliver accelerated free cash flow in the future. The efficiencies and economies to be gained through moving now to a 4G LTE network enable for the first time EBITDA and cash flow to move in the same direction. This change has the potential to enhance profitability throughout the industry and from our current view, enhance profitability conservatives and [ph] important to drive future wireless valuations.

I can't say specifically it's not totally in place, but it will be at least half a dozen handsets that we'll introduce in LTE next year. And it was critical for us, given the objectives that we have to use existing spectrum and due course to reform it to have both the narrow band as well as the wideband capability in the handset. So we needed that and we needed to focus on the PCS and AWS band.So we had to get in front of this, and this is an important development. The good news is that we have the handsets that we think we need for our smartphone lineup next year, pretty well in place, with just one or two shall we say products that need to be firmed up. But I think that this trial that we have this year is to see what we have in terms of usage, in terms of we have in customer preference. We're very pleased with the fact that people have opted for the more premium service that contains the MetroSTUDIO. And that gives them this entertainment dimension we talked about.

We have at this point, no plans to offer a lifeline or a government phone, if you will. I think the by-the-minute plan that Tom indicated gives us an opportunity for our customers to have the handset that they want and the service pricing that could very well fit into their budget. So I think over time, you'll see our approach to be really focused on people who want the handset experience in that group, but also very pressed for economics and what they can afford to spend month by month. So no, not directly, but I think we will have a broader opportunity to address at least a portion of that market. The other part and I'll aggregate this question speeds, I think we're seeing what I think Verizon has talked about. We see and it depends on the, let me predicate this, it depends on the SINR even more than the output power. So with a reasonable SINR environment, we're seeing typically around 8 Mbps  in the throughput. Now go into to a house, get into a low SINR, or Signal Interference Noise Ratio, if you go into such indoors, you'll probably be cut down to in the two megabit or two Mbps range and even below, but we have a pretty broad strong signal, we've driven -- drive test our markets and we're very pleased that we can get what we expect out of this in a reasonable, not real good signal, but a reasonable signal. We have tested on a 10 by 10, I'll give you another number that we have put out but we have tested 10 by 10 and we're north of 70 Mbps, which I think is certainly as good as others have done. I think others have tested a 20 by 20 at 120, and so we're very, very pleased we could do better than that on LTE, if we have that spectrum to test on. So I think that we're very satisfied. We see the data rates, we see also the opportunity, which is hidden in this cost of ownership and the equipment because what we'll put in place is literally a base station called e-mail B [ph] that's good for 20 by 20. And the incremental cost of adding to the spectrum as we do in CDMA is, I would say, orders at least an order of magnitude different, given the -- in other words to be able to expand the capacity of that individual base station. So that's why we're so bullish on the fact that going forward, as we make this conversion, which will take a few years, that we have an opportunity to really drive free cash flow.

A on average. So we're very pleased and the key there is average throughput. So I think that yes, we'll draft on anybody, but this is no longer just Verizon. What we're looking at is a global standard. There is no doubt in our mind that LTE, whether in a frequency division duplex or time division duplex form will be the world standard, and there will be no question that there'll be devices with both capabilities. And so for the first time, we have a true global standard. So we're not seeing and perhaps in the next year or two, drafting perhaps on some of the other major companies that need dual mode, but we're seeing going forward a huge opportunity to draft on worldwide production and consumption.

As people reinvesting on the MetroPCS value proposition, and we've certainly seen an increase in that this year, given the more affordable handset pricing that we put in place by eliminating the first month free. And by reinvesting the value proposition, we're seeing a lot of gravitation towards higher and better quality phones. So we think it could have a good, long-term positive impact on our retention and churn numbers. It definitely has impact on CPU but we have two other even more significant issues going on with CPU. First is the inclusion of the regulatory fees, which we've talked about per calls is upwards to $0.75 per subscriber, and that is being absorbed now in 80% of the base. And we also have the impacts of rolling out our 4G LTE network and putting in the backhaul and the other OpEx items that are associated with that rollout. So there's multiple things going on with CPU but the important thing is we continue to scale and scale nicely. Tom, do you want to add anything?

We've mentioned on previous calls that phones are fashion, phones have utility. For a lot of our customers, it's a four for one utility. It is home voice, it's mobile voice, it's home broadband and now mobile broadband and as that's dependent on the device as scene, the average customer probably touches our keypad 3x to 4x more than a different service. So to that end, the desire to constantly upgrade, they will upgrade not always when they desire a phone but when they economically can. So our base might upgrade anywhere between 2x to 2.5 times a year depending upon what that user wants in the handset.

The real benefit on OpEx as Braxton was indicating comes when we see the additional data traffic, which we will get and we believe we have some ARPU opportunities for is the price elasticity of the demand to go to a 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps in backhaul with an ethernet combining both CDMA and LTE traffic, is enormous. It's in the order of 10x cost reduction. So yes, we pay more but the price per bit goes down by nearly a factor of 10.

Competition, obviously, will always be a factor. I think what we're seeing is that at least for now, some bit of focus on segmentation as opposed to parties dropping their price structure and having some across-the-board dramatic impact. I think you see a more mature market now in prepaid and paying in advance. I'd like to group both of those in no-contract. So I think there's an element of stabilization, but in the segmentation, I think there's going to be a lot of creativity that occurs. We think that the importance of moving to the smartphones in the no-contract market is a critical step and also it's a very important step for us to provide the very best experience that customers could get based on data rates and handset capability. So next year, 2011, is an opportunity for us probably towards the second half of the year to be able to put up handsets and services that are truly at parity in the postpaid industry. Bringing this to the no-contract market we think has a very important initiative because our view is 2009, late 2010 was really the period of the QWERTY in the no-contract market and we think that's moving very strongly to the smartphone touchscreen going forward in 2011 and beyond. So we want to be well positioned with a variety of products based on handset prices and overall comprehensiveness of service packages that could deal with this. And we do think that as we go into the more, shall we say, extensive service packages, that there's an opportunity for some lift in ARPU, remember if we've got a base of roughly 8 million subscribers moving to ARPU for the whole company will be a challenge, but we do see an opportunity in LTE.

Once we get passed that build, you've heard Roger talk a little bit about the CapEx efficiencies that are present with LTE, not having to -- have significantly for every carrier that you add into CDMA versus an LTE, either it be where you have essentially 20 megahertz of capacity with some small RTU fees as you grow the usage on the systems.

Others have a very strong interest in 700. And so I guess the answer to the question is we never saw a megahertz we didn't like at the right price.

I'm pleased to report third quarter results that are significantly improved from the third quarter 2009. Net subscriber additions of 223,000, churn of 3.8% and gross additions of over one million drove record third quarter adjusted EBITDA of over $315 million, up 16% to year-over-year. Our Wireless for All initiatives continue to be our area of focus. Our year-over-year improvements in operations and financial results have exceeded our expectations and are attributable to the success we have had experienced with our wireless role rollout. Our existing subscribers have responded positively to the elimination of our first month free and our corresponding reduction in handset price. As a result, false churn has declined as our subscribers continue to upgrade their handsets at higher levels than last year. This increase in upgrade activity has substantially reduced false churn. And going forward, we believe we could manage churn in a 3% to 4% range on a sustainable basis.
The no-contract wireless industry continues to be dynamic and over the past nine months, we have optimized our business and continue our leadership position. Existing subscribers are reconfirming their choice in MetroPCS as evidenced by the increase in upgrade activity. Wireless customers are gravitating towards no-contract wireless offerings and we are providing new subscribers with a greater predictability, flexibility and affordability. Since the introduction of Wireless for All in early January, we have added over 1.2 million net subscriber additions and upgraded approximately 35% of our existing subscriber base, including approximately 12% in the third quarter.
We continue to see wireless subscribers looking for alternatives to contracted wireless services. Recently, internal survey data indicates that approximately 1/3 of our new gross additions were previously contracted wireless subscribers. Our no-contract service offerings continuing to attract users looking for alternatives to long-term commitments. At the end of the Third Quarter 2010, MetroPCS has achieved a total market penetration of 8.1%, based on approximately 97 million covered POPs, of which we added four million covered POPs during the year. Additionally, nearly one quarter of our total covered POPs are under two years old.
At the end of the third quarter, approximately 80% of our subscribers were on tax inclusive plans. One of our goals in moving towards Wireless for All was to improve the overall customer experience. Our Committed network of indirect exclusive dealers are a key component of the success of Wireless for All. Well-trained, helpful, enthusiastic brand ambassadors ensure that our value, quality and technology messages are being heard and understood. As the sales network engages on a monthly basis with our customers, answering questions, describing handset capabilities and offering the latest selection of services, our brand value is reinforced and promoted. This customer touch point philosophy is a key differentiator and sets us apart from a traditional, non-assisted big-box transaction.
Late in the quarter, we were very proud to be the first U.S. wireless provider to commercially launch 4G LTE services in Las Vegas and Dallas/Ft. Worth. We launched service with the Samsung Craft, the first 4G LTE handset in the world. Since our initial launches, we have expanded 4G LTE services to Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia and we'll continue to introduce 4G LTE service into our markets throughout the remainder of 2010 and into early 2011.
Our launched 4G LTE networks are performing well. While still early, subscribers are responding positively to the enhancements afforded by the 4G LTE network. Interest in MetroSTUDIO, our 18 channel video library powered by RealNetworks and utilizing content from NBC, Univision, BET and others is growing. Through Wireless for All, and as we launch additional 4G LTE markets, our subscribers have demonstrated a willingness and a desire for newer handsets. Increasingly, our subscribers are looking for handsets that offer a wide range of functionality that allows for access to the latest content sources. We believe that this desire will continue and we plan to provide our customers with the rich assortment of device options.
In Q4, we anticipate launching multiple Android devices. Additionally, in early 2011, we expect to introduce our first 4G LTE Android smartphone. Today, we introduced Metro USA, which allows MetroPCS subscribers to use their service in a footprint that now covers over 280 million POPs. This increased coverage provides subscribers with incredible value and brings parity when compared to the larger national carriers as we continue to provide a postpaid experience in a pay-in-advance no-contract model. This is the future of wireless. 
We have the best-in-class cost structure and we are constantly working to leverage this cost structure to increase our market share. Building on our no-contract legacy, we have continued to evolve our offerings and design products that are accretive to our existing portfolio. Recently, we introduced a by-the-minute trial, exclusively in Wal-Mart that exemplifies this goal. This card's product feature includes unlimited text, web access and metered minutes in either $20 or $30 cards. This by-the-minute product could expand our addressable market opportunity, has been introducing a new segment of customers to the MetroPCS value proposition.
Launching our 4G LTE services, offering a national footprint with our new Metro USA coverage platform and expanding our serviceable market with by-the-minute cards are examples of our desire and our ability to innovate and grow. At the beginning of the year, we announced the transformation of our business. Now, nine months into the year, we are pleased with the results and we have demonstrated sustainable improvements in key operating metrics, highlighted by lower churn and continued subscriber growth.
Operationally, we continue to focus on execution at every level and we are focused on continuing our profitable growth into the future. It is a very competitive environment but for the nine months of 2010, I'm very pleased with our ability to plan, execute and deliver outstanding results. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton."

We reported strong third quarter 2010 operational and financial results. Third quarter net additions totaled 223,000.

We reported strong third quarter 2010 operational and financial results. Third quarter net additions totaled 223,000. We ended the quarter with approximately 7.9 million subscribers, up 24% from third quarter 2009 and up 18% from the beginning of 2010. We recorded our highest third quarter adjusted EBITDA in company history of $315 million, up approximately 16% year-over-year. This is the eighth quarter in a row in which we have reported year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of well over 10% and over the past three years we have grown quarterly adjusted EBITDA at over a 20% CAGR.
Our strong results this quarter are largely due to two factors. Our successful launch and execution of Wireless for All service plans, coupled with our focused management on our superior cost structure. We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. This includes $687 million of cash we are holding that has been used to retire outstanding 9 1/4% senior notes at a call date of November 1, 2010. We continue to look at attractive and accretive ways to deploy our cash, including organic growth, general corporate purposes, opportunistic spectrum acquisitions, corporate development opportunities, future technology initiatives or the retirement of outstanding debt. 
In September, we continue to extend and stagger our debt maturity profile on our balance sheet, with the issuance of one billion and new 7 7/8% senior notes due 2018, of which 313 million was used to retire 9 1/4% senior notes in the third quarter. This refinancing coupled with the one billion amend and extend of our senior credit facility completed earlier this summer were key steps in turning out maturity schedule of our capital structure. These are key milestones in our capital structure formation for the next decade. Our total leverage pro forma the redemption on November 1 was 3.3x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our 9 1/4% senior notes at the end of September, and our net leverage at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.2x. Based on a very manageable maturity schedule, our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter are below 7.5%, the majority of our debt fixed by its nature of interest rate swaps and our significant cash and short-term investments. We believe we are very well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
During the month of October, we successfully executed a forward interest rate swap on $950 million of our senior secured credit facility for an average rate of 4.6% all-in for the period February 2012 to February 2014. 
Churn for the quarter was 3.8%, down 200 basis points year-over-year. This decrease in churn was primarily driven by the acceptance of our Wireless for All offerings, including a decline in false churns as a combination of our realigned dealer incentives and stronger value propositions took effect.
Our third quarter ARPU was $39.69, down $1.39 on a year-over-year basis and down $0.15 on a sequential basis. The decrease in ARPU year-over-year was primarily due to the introduction of our new Wireless for All service plans in January 2010, which include all applicable taxes and regulatory fees.
Deferred non-ARPU for our tax inclusive plans is in the $4 range per subscriber. We were able to mitigate the majority of this dilution with the sale of our full range of service plans, including a $60-world unlimited offering. We are pleased with the continued stability which we have experienced with ARPU.
Our CPGA continues to be one of the lowest of any facilities-based wireless carrier in the U.S. For the third quarter, our CPGA was $161, up $7 over the prior year third quarter. The increase is primarily due to lower gross additions. As can be seen in our supplemental slides, our current cost of churn is approximately $6, which is truly best-in-class.
Our business continues to scale, and our CPU continues to be among the lowest in the wireless industry. Our CPU for the quarter was $18.47 as compared to $17.27 in the prior year's third quarter. This increase was primarily due to an increase in retention expense related to handset upgrades by existing subscribers and the inclusion of regulatory fees in our Wireless for All service plans. 
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $316 million, an increase of approximately 16% year-over-year. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 33.4%, compared to 33.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Over the trailing 12 months, we've generated record consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. This is particularly impressive, given the potential margin dilution that could've occurred with the Wireless for All service plans and our 4G LTE's network rollout. 
I'd like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the quarter, on a consolidated basis, our service revenue and cost of service grew 16% and 5%, respectively, to $942 million and $314 million, respectively. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were $147 million for third quarter of 2010, representing an increase of $9 million when compared to a year ago. We generated $342 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter and the increase of $29 million from the prior year's third quarter. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in cash flow from working capital. We incurred capital expenditures of $233 million during the third quarter. During the quarter, our unlevered free cash flow was approximately $82 million. Our results demonstrate our focus and ability to grow the business while generating cash flows over the long term. With our current outlook for future adjusted EBITDA and CapEx, we believe free cash flows will increase significantly as we complete our 4G LTE deployment in 2010 and 2011.
Our current estimate for total 2010 capital expenditures is $750 million to $850 million. We generated $77 million in consolidated net income during the third quarter, representing year-over-year of 5% or $0.22 per share compared to $74 million and $0.21 per share in the prior year quarter. 
I'd like to now turn it over to Roger."

Our financial and operational performance during the third quarter was strong. This quarter's performance, as well as our year-to-date performance, is a result of the continued success with what we have launched in the beginning of 2010, the Wireless for All family of service plans. With our recent introduction of Metro USA, we now offer service which bring us to parity with postpaid offerings. This expanded set of service offerings provides in our view incredible value to our subscribers and also expands our addressable market. While Tom and Braxton focused their comments on third quarter operational and financial results, I would like to spend some time discussing our long-term strategy at MetroPCS.
MetroPCS has been on the leading edge of network technology since we launched our business in 2002. We were the first to launch an all 1xRTT CDMA network back in 2002. We were the first to pioneer widespread six sector cell technology. We were the first to launch an AWS network in the U.S., and we were the first company to use DAS as a primary network design component in major metro areas. All the technological innovations by MetroPCS were driven by the consideration for cost and spectral efficiences. Our commitment in our investment in 4G LTE was in large part predicated on the idea that we wanted to invest in the next evolution of wireless technology. Strategically, we made the decision to avoid an investment in the legacy technology with a limited life and instead pursued the global race to a worldwide standard, 4G LTE. To make our rollout of 4G LTE even more efficient, our approach was an incremental overlay to our existing network.
We have launched 4G LTE service in five metropolitan areas so far this year, with more to be launch through the end of the year into next year. These were the first commercial launches of 4G LTE service in the United States. In addition, we were the first in the world to offer a dual mode, 4G CDMA LTE handset. We received this technological transformation as a game changer. We have previously mentioned that we decided to bypass 3G EVDO in favor of 4G LTE because LTE is far more efficient, both in terms of data rate and cost. We started working on the 4G LTE strategy three years ago, with an eye towards being one of the first carriers in the United States to launch for 4G LTE service with an LTE handset. We did this to provide leadership and drive the development of the ecosystem to address our unique business requirements. With our 4G LTE launches we continue to innovate and evolve. As we introduce our markets with 4G LTE service, we are planning for the future and making way for migrating voice to VOLTE. While the ecosystem will evolve over time, once we move towards VOLTE, we expect important spectral efficiency and cost savings will be achieved. With our adoption of 4G LTE and the movement to VOLTE, for the first time, we will be able to realize the benefits of a worldwide standard, which will include scale that comes from worldwide production being on a global standard. The GSM operators have enjoyed this advantage historically. So with LTE, MetroPCS will also benefit from a global standard. 
Further with combined voice and data, we'll have the ability to build capacity without regard to whether it will be used for voice or data. This was one of the key attributes of 1xRTT CDMA and this will once again be the case with the 4G LTE. In the first half of 2011, we intend to trial VOLTE and we look forward to transitioning our smartphone customers to LTE on voice and data. This holds the promise for significant leverage of both CapEx and OpEx cost savings. While still early, we expect 4G LTE to be the transformative technology to usher in a sea change in overall network efficiency to support the ever-increasing demand for data. 
Additionally, as handset ecosystems develop with an increasing emphasis on smartphones and QWERTY handsets, subscribers will have additional choices in finding the best wireless broadband device that meets their needs. Our focus has been and continues to be meeting customer needs as they relate to the small screen, smartphone or QWERTY handsets. We believe the small screen is where we have the greatest wireless broadband opportunity, and we are pursuing this opportunity aggressively. We are also committed to bringing smartphones to our subscribers that operate on the Android operating system. We have traditionally focused on voice, text and web service. However, with the development and inherent advantages of 4G LTE, we see an opportunity to transform our business. Increasingly, streaming video and audio are becoming a large and more important part of the wireless experience. We believe demands for video will grow significantly over the next few years. Our belief is that we are entering an environment in which subscribers will be viewing increasing amounts of video for purposes of news and entertainment. Our MetroSTUDIO service was deployed with entertainment in mind. With our MetroSTUDIO service, we believe our smartphones and services can become a true entertainment device, which allows subscribers to view and enjoy entertainment while on the go. Wireless broadband experience comes down to coverage and costs. We believe we are well positioned with our current service offerings, our 4G LTE network roadmap, as well as our future handset lineup to continue driving subscriber growth.
As the cost leader in the wireless industry with a state-of-the-art 4G broadband network and a strong network of exclusive distributors, we are in an excellent position to continue our leadership in the no-contract segment. We continue to scale the business and we intend to deliver accelerated free cash flow in the future. The efficiencies and economies to be gained through moving now to a 4G LTE network enable for the first time EBITDA and cash flow to move in the same direction. This change has the potential to enhance profitability throughout the industry and from our current view, enhanced profitability conservative is an important impetus to drive future wireless valuations."

I can't say specifically, it's not totally in place, but it will be at least half a dozen handsets that we'll introduce in LTE next year. And it was critical for us, given the objectives that we have to use existing spectrum and due course to reform it to have both the narrow band as well as the wideband capability in the handset. So we needed that and we needed to focus on the PCS and AWS band. So we had to get it in front of us, and this is an important development. The good news is that we have the handsets that we think we need for our smartphone lineup next year pretty well in place, with just one or two shall we say products that need to be firmed up. But I think that this trial that we have this year is to see what we have in terms of usage, in terms of we have in customer preference. We're very pleased with the fact that people have opted for the more premium service that contains the MetroSTUDIO. And that gives them this entertainment dimension we talked about.

One of the things that we're finding with our customers however, is that in terms of the touch phones as the phone is that we've introduced that people will pay up for the service and we're trying to find the right combination of both service pricing and as well as handphone prices that will move this. But people do demand ""a touch QWERTY plus”, shall we say, the app store/Android experience."

The mix of higher versus lower plans, if you could give us anything with a number in it, Roger, that would be great. And then second would be just this quarter, especially it seems that we've seen a real rise to prominence of the ultra low-end prepaid plans, TracFone kind of pioneered that and Sprint's Assurance brand has been following in their wake. And it seems like that has been a ripe opportunity for a lot of carriers. Are you guys at all contemplating about maybe dipping a toe downmarket into that area or is it really about focusing in your current sweet spot and up towards the smartphone data plans?"

We have at this point, no plans to offer a lifeline or a government phone, if you will. I think the by-the-minute plan that Tom indicated gives us an opportunity for our customers to have the handset that they want and the service pricing that could very well fit into their budget. So I think over time, you'll see our approach to be really focused on people who want the handset experience in that group, but also very pressed for economics and what they can afford to spend month by month. So no, not directly, but I think we will have a broader opportunity to address at least a portion of that market. The other part and I'll aggregate this question about speeds, I think we're seeing what I think Verizon has talked about. We see and it depends on the, let me predicate this, it depends on the SINR even more than the output power. So with a reasonable SINR environment, we're seeing typically around 8 Mbps in the throughput. Now go into to a house, get into a low SINR, or Signal Interference Noise Ratio, if you go into such indoors, you'll probably be cut down to in the two megabit or two Mbps range and even below, but we have a pretty broad strong signal, we've driven -- drive test our markets and we're very pleased that we can get what we expect out of this in a reasonable, not real good signal, but a reasonable signal. We have tested on a 10 by 10, I'll give you another number that we haven’t put out but we have tested 10 by 10 and we're north of 70 Mbps, which I think is certainly as good as others have done. I think others have tested a 20 by 20 at 120, and so we're very, very pleased we could do better than that on LTE, if we have that spectrum to test on. So I think that we're very satisfied. We see the data rates, we see also the opportunity, which is hidden in this cost of ownership and the equipment because what we'll put in place is literally a base station called e-mail B [ph] that's good for 20 by 20. And the incremental cost of adding to the spectrum as we do in CDMA is, I would say, orders at least an order of magnitude different, given the -- in other words to be able to expand the capacity of that individual base station. So that's why we're so bullish on the fact that going forward, as we make this conversion, which will take a few years, that we have an opportunity to really drive free cash flow."

What we're looking at is a global standard. There is no doubt in our mind that LTE, whether in a frequency division duplex or time division duplex form will be the world standard, and there will be no question that there'll be devices with both capabilities. And so for the first time, we have a true global standard. So we're not seeing and perhaps in the next year or two, drafting perhaps on some of the other major companies that need dual mode, but we're seeing going forward a huge opportunity to draft on worldwide production and consumption."

And by reinvesting the value proposition, we're seeing a lot of gravitation towards higher and better quality phones. So we think it could have a good, long-term positive impact on our retention and churn numbers. It definitely has impact on CPU but we have two other even more significant issues going on with CPU. First is the inclusion of the regulatory fees, which we've talked about in prior calls is upwards to $0.75 per subscriber, and that is being absorbed now in 80% of the base. And we also have the impacts of rolling out our 4G LTE network and putting in the backhaul and the other OpEx items that are associated with that rollout. So there's multiple things going on with CPU but the important thing is we continue to scale and scale nicely. Tom, do you want to add anything?"

It is home voice, it's mobile voice, it's home broadband and now mobile broadband and as that's dependence on the device is seen, the average customer probably touches our keypad 3x to 4x more than a different service. So to that end, the desire to constantly upgrade, they will upgrade not always when they desire a phone but when they economically can. So our base might upgrade anywhere between 2x to 2.5 times a year depending upon what that user wants in the handset."

The real benefit on OpEx as Braxton was indicating comes when we see the additional data traffic, which we will get and we believe we have some ARPU opportunities for is the price elasticity of the demand to go to a 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps in backhaul with an ethernet combining both CDMA and LTE traffic, is enormous.

Competition, obviously, will always be a factor. I think what we're seeing is that at least for now, some bit of focus on segmentation as opposed to parties dropping their price structure and having some across-the-board dramatic impact.

So I think there's an element of stabilization, but in the segmentation, I think there's going to be a lot of creativity that occurs. We think that the importance of moving to the smartphones in the no-contract market is a critical step and also it's a very important step for us to provide the very best experience that customers could get based on data rates and handset capability. So next year, 2011, is an opportunity for us probably towards the second half of the year to be able to put up handsets and services that are truly at parity in the postpaid industry. Bringing this to the no-contract market we think is a very important initiative because our view is 2009, late 2010 was really the period of the QWERTY in the no-contract market and we think that's moving very strongly to the smartphone touchscreen going forward in 2011 and beyond. So we want to be well positioned with a variety of products based on handset prices and overall comprehensiveness of service packages that could deal with this. And we do think that as we go into the more, shall we say, extensive service packages, that there's an opportunity for some lift in ARPU, remember if we've got a base of roughly 8 million subscribers moving ARPU for the whole company will be a challenge, but we do see an opportunity in LTE."

And we've made previous public comments with half about it is LTE. And you can see that are LTE build-outs really are the main, dense, highly populated parts of our footprint. We certainly expect CapEx next year will drop from current levels and we will be providing disclosures in our year end call and then the MD&A relating to the 2011 CapEx. I think it's fair to say that we're very interested in having a full 4G experience across our footprint. And while we will see a step down in '11, what will continue to fully built the footprint '11. Once we get passed that build, you've heard Roger talk a little bit about the CapEx efficiencies that are present with LTE, not having to -- have significantly for every carrier that you add into CDMA versus an LTE, it would be where you have essentially 20 megahertz of capacity with some small RTU fees as you grow the usage on the system. So I think that it's a very significant point that you're making. We should see some very nice downward trajectory in our spend, barring any new market builds or other strategic items that we would do, so we're quite encouraged with that trend. Roger, you want to talk about the spectrum?"

Yes, i think there is a bit of a misperception because of the holdings of the very largest carriers in the country between 80 and 100 megahertz and then you have Sprint with more than that at Clearwire. The fact is that there are tremendous economies just with having the -- which we do have roughly 10 megahertz set clear in all our markets say one that we are intend to launch LTE on. And our objective is really a reforming objective and that is to use the spectrum that we currently have, that's why it was so important to develop the ecosystem around the bands of our interest which is PCS and AWS. Others have a very strong interest in 700. And so I guess the answer to the question is we never saw a megahertz we didn't like at the right price. But on the other hand, we have a reforming plan now and we feel that, that plan is adequate for our needs because we are intending to support the small screen. Tablets are interesting, we'll see what that might develop, but at this point in time, we're looking at the small screen handsets."

I'm pleased to report third quarter results that have significantly improved from the third quarter 2009. Net subscriber additions of 223,000, churn of 3.8% and gross additions of over one million drove record third quarter adjusted EBITDA of over $315 million, up 16% to year-over-year. Our Wireless for All initiatives continue to be our area of focus. Our year-over-year improvements in operations and financial results have exceeded our expectations and are attributable to the success we have had experienced with our wireless role rollouts. Our existing subscribers have responded positively to the elimination of our first month free and our corresponding reduction in handset price. As a result, false churn has declined as our subscribers continue to upgrade their handsets at higher levels than last year. This increase in upgrade activity has substantially reduced false churn. And going forward, we believe we could manage churn in a 3% to 4% range on a sustainable basis.
 The no-contract wireless industry continues to be dynamic and over the past nine months, we have optimized our business and continue our leadership position. Existing subscribers are reconfirming their choice in MetroPCS as evidenced by the increase in upgrade activity. Wireless customers are gravitating towards no-contract wireless offerings and we are providing new subscribers with a greater predictability, flexibility and affordability. Since the introduction of Wireless for All in early January, we have added over 1.2 million net subscriber additions and upgraded approximately 35% of our existing subscriber base, including approximately 12% in the third quarter.
 We continue to see wireless subscribers looking for alternatives to contracted wireless service. Recently, internal survey data indicates that approximately 1/3 of our new gross additions were previously contracted wireless subscribers. Our no-contract service offering is continuing to attract users looking for alternatives to long-term commitments. At the end of the Third Quarter 2010, MetroPCS has achieved a total market penetration of 8.1%, based on approximately 97 million covered POPs, of which we added four million covered POPs during the year. Additionally, nearly one quarter of our total covered POPs are under two years old.
 At the end of the third quarter, approximately 80% of our subscribers were on tax inclusive plans. One of our goals in moving towards Wireless for All was to improve the overall customer experience. Our Committed network of indirect exclusive dealers are a key component of the success of Wireless for All. Well-trained, helpful, enthusiastic brand ambassadors ensure that our value quality and technology messages are being heard and understood. As the sales network engages on a monthly basis with our customers, answering questions, describing handset capabilities and offering the latest selection of services, our brand value is reinforced and promoted. This customer touch point philosophy is a key differentiator and sets us apart from a traditional, non-assisted big-box transaction.
 Late in the quarter, we were very proud to be the first U.S. wireless provider to commercially launch 4G LTE services in Las Vegas and Dallas/Ft. Worth. We launched service with the Samsung Craft, the first 4G LTE handset in the world. Since our initial launches, we have expanded 4G LTE services to Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia and we'll continue to introduce 4G LTE service into our markets throughout the remainder of 2010 and into early 2011.
 Our launched 4G LTE networks are performing well. While still early, subscribers are responding positively to the enhancements afforded by the 4G LTE network. Interest in MetroSTUDIO, our 18 channel video library powered by RealNetworks and utilizing content from NBC, Univision, DET and others is growing. Through Wireless for All, and as we launch additional 4G LTE markets, our subscribers have demonstrated a willingness and a desire for newer handsets. Increasingly, our subscribers are looking for handsets that offer a wide range of functionality that allows for access to the latest content sources. We believe that this desire will continue and we plan to provide our customers with the rich assortment of device options.
 In Q4, we anticipate launching multiple Android devices. Additionally, in early 2011, we expect to introduce our first 4G LTE Android smartphone. Today, we introduced Metro USA, which allows MetroPCS subscribers to use their service in a footprint that now covers over 280 million POPs. This increased coverage provide subscribers with incredible value and brings parity when compared to the larger national carriers as we continue to provide a postpaid experience in a pay-in-advance no-contract model. This is the future of wireless.
 We have the best-in-class cost structure and we are constantly working to leverage this cost structure to increase our market share. Building on our no-contract legacy, we have continued to evolve our offerings and design products that are accretive to our existing portfolio. Recently, we introduced a by-the-minute trial, exclusively in Wal-Mart that exemplifies this goal. This card's product feature includes unlimited text, web access and metered minutes in either $20 or $30 cards. This by-the-minute product could expand our addressable market opportunity, has been introduced a new segment of customers to the MetroPCS value proposition.
 Launching our 4G LTE services, offering a national footprint with our new Metro USA coverage platform and expanding our serviceable market with by-the-minute cards are examples of our desire and our ability to innovate and grow. At the beginning of the year, we announced the transformation of our business. Now, nine months into the year, we are pleased with the results and we have demonstrated sustainable improvements in key operating metrics, highlighted by lower churn and continued subscriber growth.
 Operationally, we continue to focus on execution at every level and we are focused on continuing our profitable growth into the future. It is a very competitive environment but for the nine months of 2010, I'm very pleased with our ability to plan, execute and deliver outstanding results.
 Now I'll turn the call over to Braxton.

We reported strong third quarter 2010 operational and financial results. Third quarter net additions totaled 223,000.

We reported strong third quarter 2010 operational and financial results. Third quarter net additions totaled 223,000. We ended the quarter with approximately 7.9 million subscribers, up 24% from third quarter 2009 and up 18% from the beginning of 2010. We recorded our highest third quarter adjusted EBITDA in company history of $315 million, up approximately 16% year-over-year. This is the eighth quarter in a row in which we have reported year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of well over 10% and over the past three years we have grown quarterly adjusted EBITDA at over a 20% CAGR.
 Our strong results this quarter are largely due to two factors. Our successful launch and execution of Wireless for All service plans, coupled with our focused management on our superior cost structure. We have a very strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. This includes $687 million of cash we are holding that has been used to return outstanding 9 1/4% senior notes at the call date of November 1, 2010. We continue to look at attractive and accretive ways to deploy our cash, including organic growth, general corporate purposes, opportunistic spectrum acquisitions, corporate development opportunities, future technology initiatives or the retirement of outstanding debt.
 In September, we continue to extend and stagger our debt maturity profile on our balance sheet, with the issuance of one billion and new 7 7/8% senior notes due 2018, of which 313 million was used to retire 9 1/4% senior notes in the third quarter. This refinancing coupled with the one billion amend and extend of our senior credit facility completed earlier this summer where key steps in turning out maturity schedule of our capital structure. These are key milestones in our capital structure formation for the next decade. Our total leverage pro forma the redemption on November 1 was 3.3x computed in accordance with the indentures governing our 9 1/4% senior notes at the end of September, and our net leverage at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.2x. Based on a very manageable maturity schedule, our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter are below 7.5%, the majority of our debt fixed by its nature of interest rate swaps and our significant cash and short-term investments. We believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective.
 During the month of October, we successfully executed the forward interest rate swap on $950 million of our senior secured credit facility for an average rate of 4.6% all-in for the period February 2012 to February 2014.
 Churn for the quarter was 3.8%, down 200 basis points year-over-year. This decrease in churn was primarily driven by the acceptance of our Wireless for All offerings, including a decline in false churns as a combination of our realigned dealer incentives and stronger value propositions took effect.
 Our third quarter ARPU was $39.69, down $1.39 on a year-over-year bases and down $0.15 on a sequential basis. The decrease in ARPU year-over-year was primarily due to the introduction of our new Wireless for All service plans in January 2010, which include all applicable taxes and regulatory fees.
 Deferred non-ARPU for our tax inclusive plans is in the $4 range per subscriber. We were able to mitigate the majority of this dilution with the sale of our full range of service plans, including a $60-world unlimited offering. We are pleased with the continued stability which we have experienced with ARPU.
 Our CPGA continues to be one of the lowest of any facilities-based wireless carrier in the U.S. For third quarter, our CPGA was $161, up $7 over the prior year third quarter. The increase is primarily due to lower gross additions. As can be seen in our supplemental slides, our current cost churn is approximately $6, which is truly best-in-class.
 Our business continues to scale, and our CPU continues to be among the lowest in the wireless industry. Our CPU for the quarter was $18.47 as compared to $17.27 in the prior year's third quarter. This increase was primarily due to an increase in retention expense related to handset upgrades by existing subscribers and the inclusion of regulatory fees in our Wireless for All service plans.
 Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $316 million, an increase of approximately 16% year-over-year. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 33.4%, compared to 33.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Over the trailing 12 months, we've generated record consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. This is particularly impressive, given the potential margin dilution that could've occurred with the Wireless for All service plans and our 4G LTE's network rollout.
 I'd like to highlight a few items from the income statement and cash flow statement. In the quarter, on a consolidated basis, our service revenue and cost of service grew 16% and 5%, respectively, to $942 million and $314 million, respectively. The increases are primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses were $147 million for third quarter of 2010, representing an increase of $9 million when compared to a year ago. We generated $342 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter and the increase of $29 million from the prior year's third quarter. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in cash flow from working capital. We incurred capital expenditures of $233 million during the third quarter. During the quarter, our unlevered free cash flow was approximately $82 million. Our results demonstrate our focus and ability to grow the business while generating cash flow's over the long term. With our current outlook for future adjusted EBITDA and CapEx, we believe free cash flows will increase significantly as we complete our 4G LTE deployment in 2010 and 2011.
 Our current estimate for total 2010 capital expenditures is $750 million to $850 million. We generated $77 million in consolidated net income during the third quarter, representing year-over-year of 5% or $0.22 per share compared to $74 million and $0.21 per share in the prior year quarter.
 I'd like to now turn it over to Roger.

Our financial and operational performance during the third quarter was strong. This quarter's performance, as well as our year-to-date performance, is a result of the continued success with what we have launched in the beginning of 20",1024," Thank you, Braxton. Our financial and operational performance during the third quarter was strong. This quarter's performance, as well as our year-to-date performance, is a result of the continued success with what we have launched in the beginning of 2010, the Wireless for All family of service plans. With our recent introduction of Metro USA, we now offer service which bring us to parity with postpaid offerings. This expanded set of service offerings provides in our view incredible value to our subscribers and also expands our addressable market. While Tom and Braxton focused their comments on third quarter operational and financial results, I would like to spend some time discussing our long-term strategy at MetroPCS.
 MetroPCS has been on the leading edge of network technology since we launched our business in 2002. We were the first to launch an all 1xRTT CDMA network back in 2002. We were the first to pioneer widespread six sector cell technology. We were the first to launch an AWS network in the U.S., and we were the first company to use DAS as a primary network design component in major metro areas. All the technological innovations by MetroPCS were driven by the consideration for cost and spectral efficiences. Our commitment and our investment in 4G LTE was in large part predicated on the idea that we wanted to invest in the next evolution of wireless technology. Strategically, we made the decision to avoid an investment in the legacy technology with a limited life and instead pursued the global race to a worldwide standard, 4G LTE. To make our rollout of 4G LTE even more efficient, our approach was an incremental overlay to our existing network.
 We have launched 4G LTE service in five metropolitan area so far this year, with more to be launch through the end of the year into next year. These were the first commercial launches of 4G LTE service in the United States. In addition, we were the first in the world to offer a dual mode, 4G CDMA LTE handset. We received this technological transformation as a game changer. We have previously mentioned that we decided to bypass 3G EVDO in favor of 4G LTE because LTE is far more efficient, both in terms of data rate and cost. We started working on the 4G LTE strategy three years ago, with an eye towards being one of the first carriers in the United States to launch for 4G LTE service with an LTE handset. We did this to provide leadership and drive the development of the ecosystem to address our unique business requirements with our 4G LTE launches we continue to innovate and evolve. As we introduce our markets with 4G LTE service, we are planning for the future and making way for migrating voice to VOLTE. While the ecosystem will evolve over time, once we move towards VOLTE, we expect important spectral efficiencies and cost savings will be achieved. With our adoption of 4G LTE and the movement to VOLTE, for the first time, we will be able to realize the benefits of a worldwide standard, which will include scale that comes from worldwide production being on a global standard. The GSM operators have enjoyed this advantage historically. So with LTE, MetroPCS will also benefit from a global standard.
 Further with combined voice and data, we'll have the ability to build capacity without regard to whether it will be used for voice or data. This was one of the key attributes of 1xRTT CDMA and this will once again be the case with the 4G LTE. In the first half of 2011, we intend to trial VOLTE and we look forward to transitioning our smartphone customers to LTE on voice and data. This holds the promise for significant leverage of both CapEx and OpEx cost savings. While still early, we expect 4G LTE to be the transformative technology to usher in a sea change in overall network efficiency to support the ever-increasing demand for data.
 Additionally, as handset ecosystems develop with an increasing emphasis on smartphones and QWERTY handsets, subscribers will have additional choices in finding the best wireless broadband device that meets their needs. Our focus has been and continues to be meeting customer needs as they relate to the small screen, smartphone or QWERTY handsets. We believe the small screen is where we have the greatest wireless broadband opportunity, and we are pursuing this opportunity aggressively. We are also committed to bringing smartphones to our subscribers that operate on the Android operating system. We have traditionally focused on voice, text and web service. However, with the development and inherent advantages of 4G LTE, we see an opportunity to transform our business. Increasingly, streaming video and audio are becoming a large and more important part of the wireless experience. We believe demands for video will grown significantly over the next few years. Our belief is that we are entering an environment in which subscribers will be viewing increasing amounts of video for purposes of news and entertainment. Our MetroSTUDIO service was deployed with entertainment in mind. With our MetroSTUDIO service, we believe our smartphones and services can become a true entertainment device, which allows subscribers to view and enjoy entertainment while on the go. Wireless broadband experience comes down to coverage and costs. We believe we are well positioned with our current service offerings, our 4G LTE network roadmap, as well as our future handset lineup to continue driving subscriber growth.
 As the cost leader in the wireless industry with a state-of-the-art 4G broadband network and a strong network of exclusive distributors, we are in an excellent position to continue our leadership in the no-contract segment. We continue to scale the business and we intend to deliver accelerated free cash flow in the future. The efficiencies and economies to be gained through moving now to a 4G LTE network enable for the first time EBITDA and cash flow to move in the same direction. This change has the potential to enhance profitability throughout the industry and from our current view, enhance profitability conservatives and [ph] important to drive future wireless valuations.

I can't say specifically it's not totally in place, but it will be at least half a dozen handsets that we'll introduce in LTE next year. And it was critical for us, given the objectives that we have to use existing spectrum and due course to reform it to have both the narrow band as well as the wideband capability in the handset. So we needed that and we needed to focus on the PCS and AWS band.So we had to get in front of this, and this is an important development. The good news is that we have the handsets that we think we need for our smartphone lineup next year, pretty well in place, with just one or two shall we say products that need to be firmed up. But I think that this trial that we have this year is to see what we have in terms of usage, in terms of we have in customer preference. We're very pleased with the fact that people have opted for the more premium service that contains the MetroSTUDIO. And that gives them this entertainment dimension we talked about. As far as changing pricing in the future, I think right now, we're into a test phase so that will be determined by the outcome of this.

We have at this point, no plans to offer a lifeline or a government phone, if you will. I think the by-the-minute plan that Tom indicated gives us an opportunity for our customers to have the handset that they want and the service pricing that could very well fit into their budget. So I think over time, you'll see our approach to be really focused on people who want the handset experience in that group, but also very pressed for economics and what they can afford to spend month by month. So no, not directly, but I think we will have a broader opportunity to address at least a portion of that market. The other part and I'll aggregate this question speeds, I think we're seeing what I think Verizon has talked about. We see and it depends on the, let me predicate this, it depends on the SINR even more than the output power. So with a reasonable SINR environment, we're seeing typically around 8 Mbps  in the throughput. Now go into to a house, get into a low SINR, or Signal Interference Noise Ratio, if you go into such indoors, you'll probably be cut down to in the two megabit or two Mbps range and even below, but we have a pretty broad strong signal, we've driven -- drive test our markets and we're very pleased that we can get what we expect out of this in a reasonable, not real good signal, but a reasonable signal. We have tested on a 10 by 10, I'll give you another number that we have put out but we have tested 10 by 10 and we're north of 70 Mbps, which I think is certainly as good as others have done. I think others have tested a 20 by 20 at 120, and so we're very, very pleased we could do better than that on LTE, if we have that spectrum to test on. So I think that we're very satisfied. We see the data rates, we see also the opportunity, which is hidden in this cost of ownership and the equipment because what we'll put in place is literally a base station called e-mail B [ph] that's good for 20 by 20. And the incremental cost of adding to the spectrum as we do in CDMA is, I would say, orders at least an order of magnitude different, given the -- in other words to be able to expand the capacity of that individual base station. So that's why we're so bullish on the fact that going forward, as we make this conversion, which will take a few years, that we have an opportunity to really drive free cash flow.

What we're looking at is a global standard. There is no doubt in our mind that LTE, whether in a frequency division duplex or time division duplex form will be the world standard, and there will be no question that there'll be devices with both capabilities. And so for the first time, we have a true global standard. So we're not seeing and perhaps in the next year or two, drafting perhaps on some of the other major companies that need dual mode, but we're seeing going forward a huge opportunity to draft on worldwide production and consumption.

As people reinvesting on the MetroPCS value proposition, and we've certainly seen an increase in that this year, given the more affordable handset pricing that we put in place by eliminating the first month free. And by reinvesting the value proposition, we're seeing a lot of gravitation towards higher and better quality phones. So we think it could have a good, long-term positive impact on our retention and churn numbers. It definitely has impact on CPU but we have two other even more significant issues going on with CPU. First is the inclusion of the regulatory fees, which we've talked about per calls is upwards to $0.75 per subscriber, and that is being absorbed now in 80% of the base. And we also have the impacts of rolling out our 4G LTE network and putting in the backhaul and the other OpEx items that are associated with that rollout. So there's multiple things going on with CPU but the important thing is we continue to scale and scale nicely. Tom, do you want to add anything?

We've mentioned on previous calls that phones are fashion, phones have utility. For a lot of our customers, it's a four for one utility. It is home voice, it's mobile voice, it's home broadband and now mobile broadband and as that's dependent on the device as scene, the average customer probably touches our keypad 3x to 4x more than a different service. So to that end, the desire to constantly upgrade, they will upgrade not always when they desire a phone but when they economically can. So our base might upgrade anywhere between 2x to 2.5 times a year depending upon what that user wants in the handset.

It's in the order of 10x cost reduction. So yes, we pay more but the price per bit goes down by nearly a factor of 10.

Competition, obviously, will always be a factor. I think what we're seeing is that at least for now, some bit of focus on segmentation as opposed to parties dropping their price structure and having some across-the-board dramatic impact. I think you see a more mature market now in prepaid and paying in advance. I'd like to group both of those in no-contract. So I think there's an element of stabilization, but in the segmentation, I think there's going to be a lot of creativity that occurs. We think that the importance of moving to the smartphones in the no-contract market is a critical step and also it's a very important step for us to provide the very best experience that customers could get based on data rates and handset capability. So next year, 2011, is an opportunity for us probably towards the second half of the year to be able to put up handsets and services that are truly at parity in the postpaid industry. Bringing this to the no-contract market we think has a very important initiative because our view is 2009, late 2010 was really the period of the QWERTY in the no-contract market and we think that's moving very strongly to the smartphone touchscreen going forward in 2011 and beyond. So we want to be well positioned with a variety of products based on handset prices and overall comprehensiveness of service packages that could deal with this. And we do think that as we go into the more, shall we say, extensive service packages, that there's an opportunity for some lift in ARPU, remember if we've got a base of roughly 8 million subscribers moving to ARPU for the whole company will be a challenge, but we do see an opportunity in LTE.

It's not something that we create. I think we had a major change as we recognized with Wireless for All early this year and this was really from the major carrier, Sprint, that introduced I think a very strong program to capture the predictability as well as affordability in the no-contract segment. We move to that, that's a major changes in our billing system, took us a half a year to get it all done. But we think that we are now planted our feet on solid ground, so volatility now has gone back to the perception I guess in the marketplace. We think it's somewhat of a misplaced perception because postpaid is probably going to have as much volatility as any segment of the wireless market. But I think, nevertheless, we are seeing a degree of stabilization and I think that the opportunity going forward is that the small screen is going to turn into an entertainment device. We absolutely believe this. I think we're seeing every evidence of this. There is cost levels and we need to see the ecosystem develop particularly for LTE. But when it does, it will be I think a very substantial movement that will give rise to greater opportunities. So we're not going to be thinking about one handset per person, wherein we're thinking more about how many appliances a person has and who has the opportunity to support those appliances. So tablets, all items, we think, cameras, everything will turn to wireless. So we see the opportunity going forward. We think it's the question of who services these segments the best. And one thing for sure we know, if you are the cost leader that you have the greatest opportunity to select and choose what you'd  like to do. Braxton, you want to comment?

How are you thinking about normalized recurring facts and what I mean by that is exclusive of any sort of LTE overlays or exclusive of market builds in terms of either percentage of revenues or percentage of or over dollars per cover POP? How are you thinking about what the recurring CapEx for the business is? And then the second question for Roger and/or Tom, with respect to spectrum LTE, I guess, works best in I guess in a 20 by 20 and those are obviously very hard to come by. How are you thinking in terms of the sources of spectrum? The FCC has outlined that they want to have 100 megahertz in spectrum at some point and there's going to be a deficit of 275 megahertz by 2014. Where do you think that spectrum will come from? I mean there is only going to be like 40 to 60 from AWS-2 and AWS-3, and there's a little bit from WCS and NSS, and then the key block [ph] from 700. But it seems like some of those are going to be extraordinarily well built for by some of your larger competitors. So just trying to get sense as to where you think the source of spectrum is going to be for you?

And we've made previous public comments with half about it is LTE. And you can see that are LTE build-outs really are the main, dense, highly populated parts of our footprint. We certainly expect CapEx next year will drop from current levels and we will be providing disclosures in our year end call and then the MD&A relating to the 2011 CapEx. I think it's fair to say that we're very interested in having a full 4G experience across our footprint. And while we will see a step down in '11, what will continue to fully built the footprint '11. Once we get passed that build, you've heard Roger talk a little bit about the CapEx efficiencies that are present with LTE, not having to -- have significantly for every carrier that you add into CDMA versus an LTE, either it be where you have essentially 20 megahertz of capacity with some small RTU fees as you grow the usage on the systems. So I think that it's a very significant point that you're making. We should see some very nice downward trajectory in our spend, barring any new market builds or other strategic items that we would do, so we're quite encouraged with that trend. Roger, you want to talk about the spectrum [ph]?

Yes, i think there is a bit of a misperception because of the holdings of the very largest carriers in the country between 80 and 100 megahertz and then you have Sprint with more than that Clearwire. The fact is that there are tremendous economies just with having the -- which we do have roughly 10 megahertz set clear in all our markets say one that we are intend to launch LTE on. And our objective is really a reforming objective and that is to use the spectrum that we currently have, that's why it was so important to develop the ecosystem around the bands of our interest which is PCS and AWS. Others have a very strong interest in 700. And so I guess the answer to the question is we never saw a megahertz we didn't like at the right price. But on the other hand, we have a reforming plan now and we feel that, that plan is adequate for our needs because we are intending to support the small screen. Tablets are interesting, we'll see what that might develop, but at this point in time, we're looking at the small screen handsets.
