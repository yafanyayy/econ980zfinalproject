Now let me start the call with some reflections on 2009 and the fourth quarter, and then I’ll hand over to Ed who will provide a financial perspective. Jay Hooley, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will succeed me as CEO on March 1 of this year, will then provide some detail about our outlook for 2010. Then the three of us will be happy to take your questions.
Due to actions we took in 2009 we are now well positioned for the future. Let me briefly describe some of those actions. In 2009 we grew our core servicing fee and management fee revenues on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We reduced the run rate of expenses on a year-over-year basis. We consolidated the asset-backed commercial paper conduits we administered.
We were among the first to repay TARP and buyback the warrants. We strengthened our capital position and we announced two proposed acquisitions that of the security services business of Intesa Sanpaolo, a premier provider of investment services in Italy and Luxembourg, and Mourant International Finance Administration, a leading servicer of alternative investments.
New business continues to be strong. In 2009 we added $1.13 trillion in assets to be serviced and $248 billion in net new business in asset management. These wins support the momentum we have seen this year in our core business. Let’s take a look at revenue growth. In the fourth quarter alone in our investor services operations we added more than $500 billion in assets to be serviced, including a mandate to provide investment manager operations outsourcing for approximately $300 billion for Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
We continue to see growth in servicing for alternative asset management. This quarter we added 14 customers and 65 in total in 2009. In the fourth quarter our assets to be serviced in alternative investments have grown 5%, up from $421 billion as of September 30, 2009 to $443 billion. When we complete the acquisition of Mourant we expect State Street to be the largest servicer of alternative investments in the world.
In addition to Morgan Stanley Investment Management, some of our investment servicing wins in the fourth quarter included Intermountain Equity Group, which awarded us a mandate to support its new $400 million private equity real estate fund with a full range of administration services. Saskatchewan Teachers’ Federation selected State Street to provide custody, fund accounting, and securities lending services for CAD 2.2 billion in pension and group benefit fund assets.
Also in Canada, State Street was appointed by the McCain Foods, pension plan to provide custody, accounting, benefit payments, and investment analytics for more than CAD 300 million in assets and Caldwell Investment Management Limited appointed us, along with our joint venture partner IFDS Canada, to provide custody, fund accounting, fund administration, registered trustee services, foreign exchange, transfer agency, and unit holder recordkeeping services for its fund complex.
Again in Canada, State Street was appointed by M.D. Physician Services to provide a range of investment services for CAD 15.6 billion in assets including custody, fund accounting, and fund valuation services. State Street now provides full back office services for all of Calamos Investments collective fund structures, recently adding custody and fund administration services for its more than $21 billion in collective fund structures including open and closed end mutual funds, Dublin UCITS and private funds.
In the United States we won a mandate from Ford Motor Company for servicing and $8 billion defined contribution plan and issuing benefits payments. We also won a mandate to provide a range of servicing, including custody, accounting, performance and analytics, and securities lending, for Intel’s defined contribution plan of $7.5 billion.
State Street Global Advisors during the quarter added $142 billion, including a $1.5 billion mandate for implementing a passive strategy for Massachusetts pension reserves which builds on our existing relationship with this customer. SSgA successfully won a renewal by the Illinois State Board of Investment Chicago to run a $513 million MSCI all country Ex-US equity index fund.
Moving on to our other business lines, we like many others, face declines in trading services and securities finance revenues. As we said in the third quarter call, as spreads compressed further securities finance revenue declined in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. With respect to securities finance revenue, we believe we are at or near the trough.
In the fourth quarter we added several new customers in our securities finance business. As we said last quarter, our participation in the program has stabilized and now it’s beginning to grow again. Net interest revenue on a fully tax equivalent basis decreased 3% from the third quarter due primarily to lower conduit discount accretion as a result of the absence of onetime pay downs and a slowing in prepayments fees.
Ed will provide some more detail shortly. Spreads on fixed income securities have compressed significantly improving State Street’s unrealized securities losses in our investment portfolio. As liquidity began a return to the market, the after tax unrealized losses were cut by about 65% from the December 2008 level from $6.32 billion to $2.29 billion.
It’s also important to us as we operate in a lower growth environment to execute our core competency and expense control, which I think we have been demonstrating during this difficult period. You will notice that our salaries and benefits expenses declined from the third quarter by about $28 million due to lower cash incentive compensation accruals.
I’ll now turn the call over to Ed who will provide further detail about our financial performance in 2009 and provide several comments affecting our business in 2010.

This morning I’ll review three areas.

Good morning everyone. This morning I’ll review three areas. First the results of the fourth quarter and the year, second the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio, the overall performance of the portfolio, as well as our outlook for net interest margin in 2010, and third a review of our capital ratios and the execution of our tangible common equity improvement plan.
This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today’s press release. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2009 with the third quarter, servicing fee revenue increased 6% and management fee revenue was up 5%, primarily due to new business wins, as well as market increases. Both items were up compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to market improvement.
Clearly revenue from securities finance was weaker, when compared either with the very strong fourth quarter of 2008 or with the third quarter of 2009. In each case this weakness was primarily due to further compression in spreads. Foreign exchange revenue declined on a year-over-year basis due to lower volatility and lower volumes.
On a quarter-over-quarter basis, foreign exchange revenue declined due to lower volumes offset partially by slightly higher volatility. The mix of foreign exchange business between custody, foreign exchange and third-party foreign exchange remained fairly constant.
Brokerage and other revenue, which is reported as part of trading services was up 47% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and was up 8% compared to the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to strength in transition management and electronic trading. We had $405 billion of average securities on loan in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $440 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, and up from $399 billion for the third quarter. We saw significant compression in spreads in 2009.
The fed funds to three month LIBOR spread began the year at about 135 basis points and ended the end of the year at approximately 13 basis points. We believe that spread compression is near or at a trough and we are hopeful that securities finance revenue is at or near the bottom, assuming volumes remain relatively flat. While we believe that the securities finance market will continue to be an important source of revenue for State Street, it will take some time for this market to return to historical levels.
Average lendable assets for the fourth quarter of 2009 were about $2.3 trillion, up 10% from $2.1 trillion for the third quarter of 2009 and up about 21% from $1.9 trillion for the fourth quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 25 days.
Now for the remaining items in the income statement, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, processing and other fee revenue declined 28%, but were up 33% in the third quarter. The change in revenue were due to a number of factors, none of which was individually material.
Net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined about 10% from the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to the impact of the continuing low interest rate environment, compressed spreads and the decline in customer balances from the abnormally high levels in the fourth quarter of 2008, offset partially by the impact of discount accretion from the consolidated conduit assets.
Compared to the third quarter of 2009 net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined 3% due to a lower level of discount accretion as a result of the absence of onetime pay downs and slower prepayment rates, offset partially by the positive impact of the investment strategy, which we began to execute in the third quarter.
Net interest margin of 235 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009 was down 12 basis points from the third quarter of 2009 on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Excluding discount accretion of $230 million, net interest margin in the fourth quarter would have been 161 basis points. The net interest margin for the full year is 220 basis points including discount accretion of $621 million and its 169 basis points excluding discount accretion.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded about $108 million of net gains and separately about $51 million of credit related OTTI resulting in a $57 million net gain related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses in U.S. non-agency mortgage-backed securities.
In the fourth quarter, we also recorded a loan loss provision of $35 million primarily related to a commercial real estate exposure. Regarding operating basis expenses, fourth quarter expenses increased 1.8%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 5.7% from the third quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2008 we reduced our full year cash incentive compensation accrual by about 50%, given our tangible common equity improvement plan and the financial market disruption.
As previously disclosed, no performance based cash incentive compensation was accrued in the first half of 2009 in support of our TCE improvement plan. Following the repayment of TARP, conduit consolidation, our successful equity raise and the progress in achieving our TCE improvement plan, we began to accrue discretionary cash incentive compensation in the third quarter of this year.
Note that compared to the third quarter of 2009 salaries and benefits expenses declined 3% in the fourth quarter primarily due to a lower level of accrual of performance based cash incentive compensation. We accrued approximately $50 million for this item in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the $100 million we estimated we would accrue in the fourth quarter on the third quarter call.
Other expenses declined 17% in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, but increased 48% from the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to an adverse judgment of $60 million rendered by a Netherlands court in a matter related to the Lehman bankruptcy, as well as other securities processing costs. On a year-over-year basis, comparing 2009 with 2008 on an operating basis, other expenses declined 23%. We will continue to be vigilant in managing these expenses.
Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The average size of the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter has increased about $22 billion to $94 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is due primarily to the consolidation of the conduit assets with a fair value of approximately $16.6 billion, as well as the execution of our reinvestment strategy in the second half of 2009, offset partially by maturities and sales from the investment portfolio.
Excluding treasury bills, during the fourth quarter we invested about $4.4 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of $99.81 with an average yield of 2.37% and duration of approximately 2.08 years. Those $4.4 billion are primarily comprised of the following securities, 99.7% of which are rated AAA.
$1.3 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities, $2.4 billion in asset-backed securities including about $1 billion of foreign RMBS and about $0.5 billion of credit card receivables, $0.2 billion in non-agency mortgage-backed securities and $0.5 billion in corporate and municipal bonds.
The aggregate unrealized after tax losses in our available for sale and held to maturity portfolios as of December 31, 2009 were $2.3 billion, an improvement of about $700 million from September 30, 2009 and about $4.0 billion or about 65% from December 31, 2008, in each case after giving effect to conduit consolidation.
As of last Friday, January 15, 2010 the comparable unrealized after tax loss had improved from year end by nearly $500 million to about $1.8 billion. In our investment portfolio slide presentation we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of December 31, 2009, our portfolio is 80.2% AAA or AA rated, similar to September 30, 2009.
The amount of downgrades diminished significantly from the prior quarter as well. The former conduit assets, now included in the investment portfolio, continue to improve in price during the quarter as general capital market conditions improve. We continue to estimate that we will not accrete back into net interest revenue of about $850 million of the charge we took upon consolidation. This is expected to occur over the remaining lives of the conduit assets and is consistent with the level we estimated on our third quarter conference call.
The accretion into net interest revenue in the fourth quarter was $230 million for a total of $621 million in 2009. We continue to expect about $900 million of discount accretion in 2010 and about $700 million in 2011 to accrete back into net interest revenue, further bolstering our already very strong capital position.
We also continue to expect about two thirds of the total expected discount accretion to occur in the first five years after consolidation, assuming we continue to hold the securities. As you are undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions go into the estimate of future discount accretion including estimated prepayment speeds and expected future credit losses across the various asset classes.
I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in creating our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. First, we continue to execute on the portfolio reinvestment plan that we adopted in the second half of 2009. We intend to reinvest about 80% of the approximately $15 billion in assets due to mature or pay down in 2010.
We intend to continue to invest in highly rated agency mortgage-backed securities and highly rated asset backed securities. As we stated, when we announced the proposed acquisition of Intesa’s securities services business, we expect to invest approximately $16 billion of customer deposits in euro-denominated government bonds and bank placements.
We expect our net interest margin, including the impact of the Intesa acquisition, but excluding the conduit discount accretion, to be between 150 and 160 basis points on average for the year. Excluding discount accretion, we expect the net interest margin to be down from 169 basis points on average in 2009 due to an anticipated significantly tighter spread environment for all of 2010 as compared to the first half of 2009.
We expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 50 basis points for the rest of the year, we expect the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis points for the rest of the year, and we expect the fed to keep the overnight fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2010. We further expect earning assets to increase between 6% and 8% from the average in 2009, primarily due to the expected acquisition of Intesa’s securities services business.
We expect the S&P 500 to average about $11.25 in 2010, up about 19% from 948, which was its average in 2009. Lastly, I’ll briefly update our capital ratios and the successful execution of our TCE improvement plan that we announced last February.
In the fourth quarter, State Street Corporation’s capital ratios continued to improve such that as of December 31, 2009, compared to September 30, 2009, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 8.5%, up from 8.0%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 17.5%, up from 15.3%. In the fourth quarter, we improved our tangible common equity ratio from 5.6% at September 30, 2009, to 6.6% at December 31, 2009, ahead of our original target of 4.91% when we introduced the plan in February 2009.
The majority of this quarterly improvement came from price improvement in the investment portfolio and organic capital generation. The details behind the TCE ratio displayed on a quarterly basis are listed on our website on slide 15 in the investment portfolio presentation.
We expect all of our capital ratios to continue to be strong, including following the acquisition of Intesa’s securities services business expected to close in the second quarter of 2010. In conclusion, we strengthen the company through our actions in 2009 to prepare us for the future. We believe the economy is recovering, but that it will be slow and our approach will continue to be cautious.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Jay, who’ll provide our view of our financial goals and the operating environment.

I’m excited about leading State Street into the second decade of this century and believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of growth trends in the global financial markets. We have emerged as a stronger company after two very disruptive years 2008 and 2009, when financial markets nearly collapsed and our revenue soared in one year due to strength in market driven revenue, and then fell in the next as volume and volatility in market driven revenue fell below historical norms.
Continued weakness in market driven revenue is expected to be a headwind in 2010. In 2009, growth in our core businesses securities, servicing, and investment management were the two consistent bright lights and we are optimistic that this trend will continue into 2010. We continue to win new business and our pipeline is promising. We see growth opportunities across all geographies and in particular in investment manager operations outsourcing, quantitative asset management, and alternative investment servicing.
We expect to close two acquisitions in the first half of the year, as Ron mentioned, Intesa Sanpaolo’s securities servicing business and Mourant. Both acquisitions will provide additional capabilities for our customers in Europe and both are expected to be modestly accretive in 2010. First, Intesa Sanpaolo’s securities services business. This acquisition brings us about $500 billion in custody assets to be serviced, a significant majority of which is Intesa Sanpaolo’s own investment management affiliates.
In addition, we will provide accounting services for about $250 billion and depo bank services for about $200 billion, with 80% of the assets in Italy and the other 20% in Luxembourg as the business becomes integrated into our business model we see opportunities for additional crossover revenue, which was not included in the valuation models for the transaction.
As we said when announcing the transaction, we’ll assume about $16 billion in deposits which we intend to invest in euro-denominated government debt as well as bank placements. Then Mourant; this acquisition will solidify our position as the leader in servicing alternative investments, and as the number one servicer of private equity investments in the world.
We gained expertise in servicing private equity following the acquisition of Investors Financial in Palmeri in 2007 and Mourant adds to that capability. So our own organic growth plus the long term growth of these two acquisitions position us very well for the future. With this as an introduction, let me remind you that we believe that our long term financial goals remain in place.
Last spring, I led a strategic view of our company. Our senior most staff reviewed the markets, both geographic and product related for all of our businesses and compared the outlook of those to our long term financial goals. We assessed our market position and our existing solutions and services, as well as those in development. The result, those goals are still appropriate and I expect them to be achieved over economic and market cycles.
They are growth and operating basis revenue of between 8% and 12%; growth and operating basis earnings per share of between 10% and 15%; an achievement of operating basis return on equity of between 14% and 17%. Given our volatility of the past two years, we expect that 2010 is going to be a transition year. We expect our core businesses, servicing fees and management fees to continue to grow and become a larger percentage of the total revenue.
If we include discount accretion associated with the conduit consolidation into our calculations, we expect our operating basis earnings per share in 2010 to be approaching the lower end of the 10% to 15% range. However, to achieve greater transparency into the performance of our core business going forward we’ll report our operating basis financial results, excluding merger and integration cost, as well as the impact of discount accretion associated with the conduit assets.
So to level set, let me remind you that our operating basis revenue, excluding discount accretion in 2009, was $8.138 billion and our operating earnings per share would have been $3.32. We expect our 2010 operating earnings per share, excluding the merger and integration cost and discount accretion, to be only slightly above 2009, reflecting in part a higher average outstanding share count.
To achieve success going forward, I have several targets I intend to drive through the organization, let me give those to you. Number one: double our non-U.S. revenue over the next five years. Two: drive industry innovation by maintaining technology investment at 20% to 25% of operating expenses.
Three: accelerate global market share growth in core businesses organically and through acquisition. Four, refine our industry leading operating model so as to achieve positive operating leverage annually in more normal markets, finally, to enhance our risk management capabilities across the organization.
So 2010 is expected to be a year of transition, one in which our core businesses continue to grow, but sources of market driven revenue represent a headwind. We look forward to closing the two transactions we announced in the fourth quarter in integrating them into our business. I look forward to meeting with many of you in the future, especially at our Investor and Analyst Forum, which is scheduled for May 5 in New York.
Now I’ll turn it back to Ron.

I feel very confident about State Street’s future as I turn over CEO responsibilities to Jay. We’re completing the very successful management succession that will allow State Street, without interruption, to continue to execute its strategy. Jay has been critical to our past success and our present strategy, and with the board has laid out a plan to continue that success in the future.
As a company, we have persevered through what is arguably the most difficult financial period since the great depression and because of that we have forged a management team that’s expert in their respective disciplines, collaborative and customer sensitive, and shaped by successfully dealing with the difficulties of the last two years.
Jay and I have worked together for almost 20 years. We’ve marketed to and serviced our customers together, integrated our acquisitions together, and built our management team together. We sit here today with a strong capital position, a strong track record in acquiring and integrating global investor services businesses and a core competency of managing our expenses against our revenue.
Since the late 1970s, regardless of who was the CEO, we followed the principle of making sure we delivered value to the four constituencies we serve, our shareholders, our customers, our employees, and the communities in which we work. We may execute differently given the times and circumstances, but for what now begins a fifth decade we remain true to the values that emerged as a result of a different financial crisis in the 70s, focus on the constituencies you serve and serve them well.
Now Jay, Ed, and I are happy to take your questions.

We’ve applied additional resources to build technology and reporting. So from a standpoint of enhancing and building up the function, that’s well under way, but there’s always more to do. I guess maybe more broadly and perhaps more importantly, I think that we’re in a transition where risk management has become a broader part of the culture of how we view business opportunities going forward.
So I think across the company, whether it’s running a line business or a support staff group, there’s much more attention at my level, at Ron’s level, at Ed’s level to managing risk in a prudent way. That doesn’t mean not taking risk, but being aware of when you’re taking risk, what the risk return looks like.
So I would characterize it, Brian, as strengthening the functions and embedding risk management into the core fabric of State Street in a more meaningful way going forward so that hopefully we avoid some of the issues that we had in the past.

Jay Hooley, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will succeed me as CEO on March 1 of this year, will then provide some detail about our outlook for 2010. Then the three of us will be happy to take your questions.Due to actions we took in 2009, we are now well-positioned for the future. Let me briefly describe some of those actions. In 2009, we grew our core servicing fee and management fee revenues on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We reduced the run rate of expenses on a year-over-year basis. We consolidated the asset-backed commercial paper conduits we administered. We're among the first to repay TARP and buyback the warrants. We strengthened our capital position and we announced two proposed acquisitions, that of the Security Services business of Intesa Sanpaolo, a premier provider of investment services in Italy and Luxembourg and Mourant International Financial Administration, a leading servicer of alternative investments.New business continues to be strong. In 2009, we added $1.13 trillion in assets to be serviced and $248 billion in net new business in asset management. These wins support the momentum we have seen this year in our core business. Let's take a look at revenue growth. In the fourth quarter alone in our investor services operations, we added more than $500 billion in assets to be serviced, including a mandate to provide investment manager operations outsourcing for approximately $300 billion for Morgan Stanley Investment Management.We continue to see growth in servicing for alternative asset management. This quarter, we added 14 customers and 65 in total in 2009. In the fourth quarter, our assets to be serviced in alternative investments have grown 5%, up from $421 billion as of September 30, 2009, to $443 billion. When we complete the acquisition of Mourant, we expect State Street to be the largest servicer of alternative investments in the world.In addition to Morgan Stanley Investment Management, some of our investment servicing wins in the fourth quarter included Intermountain Equity Group, which awarded us the mandate to support its new $400 million private equity real estate fund with a full range of administration services. Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation selected State Street to provide custody, fund accounting and securities lending services for CAD $2.2 billion in pension and group benefit fund assets. Also in Canada, State Street was appointed by the McCain Foods Pension Plan to provide custody, accounting, benefit payments and investment analytics for more than CAD $300 million in assets. And Caldwell Investment Management Ltd., appointed us along with our joint venture partner, IFDS Canada to provide custody, fund accounting, fund administration, registered trustee services, foreign exchange, transfer agency and unit-holder recordkeeping services for its fund complex.Again in Canada, State Street was appointed by MD Physician Services to provide a range of investment services for CAD $15.6 billion in assets, including custody, fund accounting and fund valuation services. State Street now provides a full back office services for all of Calamos Investments collective fund structures, recently adding custody and fund administration services for its more than $21 billion in collective fund structures, including open and closed-end mutual funds, Dublin UCITS and private funds. In the United States, we won a mandate from Ford Motor Company for servicing an $8 billion defined contribution plan and issuing benefits payments. We also won a mandate to provide a range of servicing, including custody, accounting, performance and analytics and securities lending for Intel defined contribution plan of $7.5 billion.State Street Global Advisors during the quarter added $142 billion, including a $1.5 billion mandate for implementing a passive strategy for Massachusetts Pension Reserves, which builds on our existing relationship with this customer. SSgA successfully won a renewal by the Illinois State Board of Investment, Chicago to run a $513 million MSCI all country x U.S. Equity Index fund.Moving on to our other business lines. We, like many others, face declines in trading services and securities finance revenues. As we said in the third quarter call, as spreads compress further, securities finance revenue declined in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. With respect to securities finance revenue, we believe we are at or near the trough. In the fourth quarter, we added several new customers in our Securities Finance business. As we said last quarter, a participation in the program has stabilized and now it's beginning to grow again. Net interest revenue on a fully tax equivalent basis decreased 3% from the third quarter, due primarily to lower conduit discount accretion as a result of the absence of one-time pay-downs and a slowing prepayments fees. Ed will provide some more details shortly.Spreads on fixed income securities have compressed significantly, improving State Street's unrealized securities losses in our investment portfolio. As liquidity began to return to the market, the after-tax unrealized losses were cut by about 65% from the December 2008 level, from $6.32 billion to $2.29 billion.It's also important to us as we operate in a lower growth environment to execute our core competency and expense control, which I think we've been demonstrating during this difficult period. You will notice that our salaries and benefits expenses declined from the third quarter by about $28 million, due to lower cash incentive compensation accruals. I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will provide further detail about our financial performance in 2009 and provide several comments affecting our business in 2010."

This morning, I'll review three areas. First, the results of the fourth quarter and the year. Second, the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio, the overall performance of the portfolio, as well as our outlook for net interest margin in 2010. And third, a review of our capital ratios and the execution of our tangible common equity improvement plan.This morning, one of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's press release. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2009 with the third quarter, servicing fee revenue increased 6% and management fee revenue was up 5%, primarily due to new business wins as well as market increases. Both items were up compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to market improvement. Clearly, revenue from securities finance was weaker when compared either with the very strong fourth quarter of 2008 or with the third quarter of 2009. In each case, this weakness was primarily due to further compression in spreads. Foreign exchange revenue declined on a year-over-year basis due to lower volatility and lower volumes. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, foreign exchange revenue declined due to lower volumes, offset partially by slightly higher volatility. The mix of Foreign Exchange business between custody foreign exchange and third-party foreign exchange remained fairly constant.Brokerage and other revenue, which is reported as part of trading services was up 47% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, and was up 8% compared to the third quarter of 2009, due primarily to strength in transition management and electronic trading. We had $405 billion of average securities on loan in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $440 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 and up from $399 billion for the third quarter. We saw a significant compression in spreads in 2009. The Fed Funds, the three month LIBOR spread, began the year at about 135 basis points and ended the year at approximately 13 basis points. We believe that spread compression is near or at a trough and we are hopeful that securities finance revenue is at or near the bottom, assuming volumes remain relatively flat. While we believe that the securities finance market will continue to be an important source of revenue for State Street, it will take some time for this market to return to historical levels.Average lendable assets for the fourth quarter of 2009 were about $2.3 trillion, up 10% from $2.1 trillion for the third quarter of 2009, and up about 21% from $1.9 trillion for the fourth quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 25 days. Now for the remaining items in the income statement. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, processing and other fee revenue declined 28%, but was up 33% from the third quarter. The change in revenue were due to a number of factors, none of which was individually material. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined about 10% from the fourth quarter of 2008, due primarily to the impact of the continuing low interest rate environment, compressed spreads and a decline in customer balances from the abnormally high levels in the fourth quarter of 2008, offset partially by the impact of discount accretion from the consolidated conduit assets.Compared to the third quarter of 2009, net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined 3% due to a lower level of discount accretion, as a result of the absence of one-time pay-downs and slower prepayment rates, offset partially by the positive impact of the investment strategy which we began to execute in the third quarter. Net interest margin of 235 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009 was down 12 basis points from the third quarter of 2009 on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Excluding discount accretion of $230 million, net interest margin in the fourth quarter would have been 161 basis points. The net interest margin for the full year is 220 basis points including discount accretion of $621 million, and is 169 basis points excluding discount accretion.In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded about $108 million of net gains and separately, about $51 million of credit related OTTI, resulting in a $57 million net gain related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses in U.S. non-agency, mortgage-backed securities. In the fourth quarter, we also recorded a loan-loss provision of $35 million, primarily related to a commercial real estate exposure. Regarding operating basis expenses, fourth quarter expenses increased 1.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 5.7% from the third quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reduced our full-year cash incentive compensation accrual by about 50%, given our tangible common equity improvement plan and the financial market disruption.As previously disclosed, no performance-based cash incentive compensation was accrued in the first half of 2009 in support of our TCE improvement plan. Following the repayment of TARP, conduit consolidation, our successful equity raise and the progress in achieving our TCE improvement plan, we began to accrue discretionary cash incentive compensation in the third quarter of this year. Note that compared to the third quarter of 2009, salaries and benefits expenses declined 3% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to a lower level of accrual of performance-based cash incentive compensation. We accrued approximately $50 million for this item in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the $100 million we estimated we would accrue in the fourth quarter on the third quarter call.Other expenses declined 17% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, but increased 48% from the third quarter of 2009, due primarily to an adverse judgment of $60 million rendered by Netherlands court in a matter relating to the Lehman bankruptcy, as well as other securities processing costs. On a year-over-year basis comparing 2009 with 2008 on an operating basis, other expenses declined 23%. We will continue to be vigilant in managing these expenses. Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The average size of the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter has increased about $22 billion to $94 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is due primarily to the consolidation of the conduit assets with a fair value of approximately $16.6 billion, as well as the execution of our reinvestment strategy in the second half of 2009, offset partially by maturities and sales from the investment portfolio. Excluding treasury bills, during the fourth quarter we invested about $4.4 billion in highly-rated securities at an average price of $99.81, with an average yield of 2.37% and a duration of approximately 2.08 years.Those $4.4 billion are primarily comprised of the following securities, 99.7% of which are rated AAA, $1.3 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities, $2.4 billion of asset-backed securities including about $1 billion of foreign RMBS and about $0.5 billion of credit card receivables, $0.2 billion in non-agency, mortgage-backed securities, and $0.5 billion in corporate and municipal bonds. The aggregate unrealized after-tax losses in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of December 31, 2009, were $2.3 billion, an improvement of about $700 million from September 30, 2009 and about $4.0 billion or about 65% from December 31, 2008, in each case after giving effect to conduit consolidation. As of last Friday, January 15, 2010, the comparable unrealized after-tax loss had improved from year end by nearly $500 million to about $1.8 billion. In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter-end for you to review.As of December 31, 2009, our portfolio is 80.2% AAA or AA rated similar to September 30, 2009. The amount of downgrades diminished significantly from the prior quarter as well. The former conduit assets now included in the investment portfolio continued to improve in price during the quarter as general capital market conditions improved. We continue to estimate that we will not accrete back into net interest revenue about $850 million of the charge we took upon consolidation. This is expected to occur over the remaining lives of the conduit assets and is consistent with the level we estimated on our third quarter conference call.The accretion into net interest revenue in the fourth quarter was $230 million for a total of $621 million in 2009. We continue to expect about $900 million of discount accretion in 2010 and about $700 million in 2011 to accrete back into net interest revenue, further bolstering our already very strong capital position. We also have continued to expect about two-thirds of the total expected discount accretion to occur in the first five years after consolidation, assuming we continue to hold the securities. As you are undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions go into the estimate of future discount accretion, including estimated prepayment speeds and expected future credit losses across the various asset classes.I'll now provide some of the assumptions we used in creating our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. First, that we continue to execute on the portfolio reinvestment plan that we adopted in the second half of 2009. We intend to reinvest about 80% of the approximately $15 billion in assets due to mature or paydown in 2010. We intend to continue to invest in highly rated agency mortgage-backed securities and highly rated asset-backed securities. As we stated when we announced the proposed acquisition of Intesa Security Services business, we expect to invest approximately $16 billion of customer deposits in euro denominated government bonds and bank placements. We expect a net interest margin, including the impact of the Intesa acquisition, but excluding the conduit discount accretion to be between 150 and 160 basis points on average for the year. Excluding discount accretion, we expect the net interest margin to be down from 169 basis points on average in 2009, due to an anticipated significantly tighter spread environment for all of 2010 as compared to the first half of 2009.We expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 50 basis points for the rest of the year. We expect the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis for the rest of the year and we expect the Fed to keep the overnight Fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2010. We further expect earning assets to increase between 6% and 8% from the average in 2009, primarily due to the expected acquisition of Intesa's Security Services business. We expect the S&P 500 to average about 1125 in 2010, up about 19% from 948 which was its average in 2009.Lastly, I'll briefly update our capital ratios and the successful execution of our TCE improvement plan that we announced last February. In the fourth quarter, State Street Corporation's capital ratios continued to improve such that as of December 31, 2009, compared to September 30, 2009, our tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 8.5%, up from 8.0%. Our tier 1 capital ratios stood at 17.5%, up from 15.3%. In the fourth quarter, we improved our tangible common equity ratio from 5.6% at September 30, 2009, to 6.6% at December 31, 2009, ahead of our original target of 4.91% when we introduced the plan in February of 2009. The majority of this quarterly improvement came from price improvement in the investment portfolio and organic capital generation. The details behind the TCE ratio displayed on a quarterly basis are listed on our website on Slide 15 in the investment portfolio presentation. We expect all of our capital ratios to continue to be strong, including following the acquisition of Intesa's Security Services business expected to close in the second quarter of 2010. In conclusion, we strengthened the company through our actions in 2009 to prepare us for the future. We believe the economy is recovering but that it will be slow and our approach will continue to be cautious. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay, who will provide our view of our financial goals and the operating environment."

I'm excited about leading State Street into the second decade of this century and believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of growth trends in the global financial markets. We have emerged as a stronger company after two very disruptive years, 2008 and 2009, when financial markets nearly collapsed and our revenue soared in one year into strengthened market-driven revenue and then fell on the next as volume and volatility and market-driven revenue fell below historical norms.Continued weakness in market-driven revenue is expected to be a headwind in 2010. In 2009, growth in our core businesses, security servicing and investment management were the two consistent bright lights and we are optimistic that this trend will continue into 2010. We continue to win new business and our pipeline is promising. We see growth opportunities across all geographies and in particular, in investment manager operations outsourcing, quantitative asset management and alternative investment servicing. We expect to close two acquisitions in the first half of the year as Ron mentioned. Intesa Sanpaolo's Security Servicing business and Mourant. Both acquisitions will provide additional capabilities for our customers in Europe and both are expected to be modestly accretive in 2010.First, Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business. This acquisition brings us about $500 billion in custody assets to be serviced, a significant majority of which is Intesa Sanpaolo's own investment management affiliates. In addition, we will provide accounting services for about $250 billion and depo bank services for about $200 billion. With 80% of the assets in Italy and the other 20% in Luxembourg, as the business becomes integrated into our business model, we see opportunities for additional cross-sell revenue, which was not included in the valuation models for the transaction. As we said when announcing the transaction, we will assume about $16 billion in deposits, which we intend to invest in euro denominated government debt as well as bank placement. Then Mourant, this acquisition will solidify our position as the leader in servicing investment alternative investments and as the number one servicer of private equity investments in the world. We gained expertise in servicing private equity following the acquisition of Investors Financial and Palmeri in 2007 and Mourant add to that capability. So our own organic growth, plus the long-term growth of these two acquisitions position us very well for the future. With this as an introduction, let me remind you that we believe that our long-term financial goals remain in place. Last spring, I led a strategic view of our company. Our senior-most staff reviewed the markets, both geographic and product related, for all of our businesses and compared the outlook of those for our long-term financial goals. We assessed our market position and our existing solutions and services as well as those in development. The result, those goals are still appropriate and I expect them to be achieved over economic and market cycles. They are growth in operating basis revenue of between 8% and 12%. Growth in operating basis earnings per share of between 10% and 15%. An achievement of operating basis return on equity of between 14% and 17%. Given the volatility of the past two years, we expect that 2010 is going to be a transition year. We expect our core businesses, servicing fees and management fees to continue to grow and become a larger percentage of the total revenue. If we include discount accretion associated with the conduit consolidation into our calculations, we expect our operating basis earnings per share in 2010 to be approaching the lower end of the 10% to 15% range. However, to achieve greater transparency into the performance of our core business, going forward we will report our operating basis financial results, excluding merger and integration costs, as well as the impact of discount accretion associated with the conduit assets. So to level set, let me remind you that our operating basis revenue excluding discount accretion in 2009 was $8.138 billion and our operating earnings per share would have been $3.32. We expect our 2010 operating earnings per share, excluding the merger and integration costs and discount accretion to be only slightly above 2009, reflecting in part a higher average outstanding share count.To achieve success going forward, I have several targets I intend to drive through the organization and let me give those to you. Number one, double our non-U.S. revenue over the next five years. Two, drive industry innovation by maintaining technology investment at 20% to 25% of operating expenses. Three, accelerate global market share growth in core businesses organically and through acquisition. Four, refine our industry-leading operating model so as to achieve positive operating leverage annually in more normal markets. And finally, to enhance our risk management capabilities across the organization.So 2010 is expected to be a year of transition, one in which our core businesses continue to grow, but sources of market-driven revenue represent a headwind. We look forward to closing the two transactions we announced in the fourth quarter and integrating them into our business. And I look forward to meeting with many of you in the future especially at our Investor and Analyst Forum, which is scheduled for May 5 in New York. Now I'll turn it back to Ron."

Jay has been critical to our past success and our present strategy. And with the board, he laid out a plan to continue that success into the future. As a company, we have persevered through what is arguably the most difficult financial period since the Great Depression. And because of that, we have forged a management team that is expert in their respective disciplines, collaborative and customer sensitive and shaped by successfully dealing with the difficulties of the last two years. Jay and I have worked together for almost 20 years. We've marketed to and serviced our customers together, integrated our acquisitions together and built our management team together. We sit here today with a strong capital position, a strong track record in acquiring and integrating Global Investor Services businesses and a core competency of managing our expenses against our revenue. Since the late 1970s, regardless of who was the CEO, we follow the principle of making sure we delivered value to the four constituencies we serve: Our shareholders, our customers, our employees and the communities in which we work. We may execute differently, given the times and circumstances. But for now begins a fifth decade, we remain true to the values that emerged as a result of a different financial crisis in the '70s.

You're absolutely right, discount accretion does build capital if available for acquisitions, dividends and other capital management activities. But I think it's important to focus on the core as we think about the core and how it grows in the out years.

So from a standpoint of enhancing and building up the function, that's well underway but there's always more to do. I guess maybe more broadly and perhaps more importantly, I think that we're in a transition where risk management has become a broader part of the culture of how we view business opportunities going forward. I think across the company, whether it's running a line business or a support staff group, there's much more attention at my level, at Ron's level, at Ed's level to managing risks in a prudent way. That doesn't mean not taking risks, but being aware of when you're taking risks, what the risk return looks like. So I would characterize it, Brian, as strengthening the functions and embedding risk management into the core fabric of State Street in a more meaningful way going forward.

I don't know that it'll be any -- so it's really going to be a question of timing but we'll definitely look at restoring the dividend as a priority."

Jay Hooley, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will succeed me as CEO on March 1 of this year, will then provide some detail about our outlook for 2010. Then the three of us will be happy to take your questions.Due to actions we took in 2009, we are now well-positioned for the future. Let me briefly describe some of those actions. In 2009, we grew our core servicing fee and management fee revenues on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We reduced the run rate of expenses on a year-over-year basis. We consolidated the asset-backed commercial paper conduits we administered. We're among the first to repay TARP and buyback the warrants. We strengthened our capital position and we announced two proposed acquisitions, that of the Security Services business of Intesa Sanpaolo, a premier provider of investment services in Italy and Luxembourg and Mourant International Financial Administration, a leading servicer of alternative investments.New business continues to be strong. In 2009, we added $1.13 trillion in assets to be serviced and $248 billion in net new business in asset management. These wins support the momentum we have seen this year in our core business. Let's take a look at revenue growth. In the fourth quarter alone in our investor services operations, we added more than $500 billion in assets to be serviced, including a mandate to provide investment manager operations outsourcing for approximately $300 billion for Morgan Stanley Investment Management.We continue to see growth in servicing for alternative asset management. This quarter, we added 14 customers and 65 in total in 2009. In the fourth quarter, our assets to be serviced in alternative investments have grown 5%, up from $421 billion as of September 30, 2009, to $443 billion. When we complete the acquisition of Mourant, we expect State Street to be the largest servicer of alternative investments in the world.In addition to Morgan Stanley Investment Management, some of our investment servicing wins in the fourth quarter included Intermountain Equity Group, which awarded us the mandate to support its new $400 million private equity real estate fund with a full range of administration services. Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation selected State Street to provide custody, fund accounting and securities lending services for CAD $2.2 billion in pension and group benefit fund assets. Also in Canada, State Street was appointed by the McCain Foods Pension Plan to provide custody, accounting, benefit payments and investment analytics for more than CAD $300 million in assets. And Caldwell Investment Management Ltd., appointed us along with our joint venture partner, IFDS Canada to provide custody, fund accounting, fund administration, registered trustee services, foreign exchange, transfer agency and unit-holder record-keeping services for its fund complex.Again in Canada, State Street was appointed by MD Physician Services to provide a range of investment services for CAD $15.6 billion in assets, including custody, fund accounting and fund valuation services. State Street now provides a full back office services for all of Calamos Investments collective fund structures, recently adding custody and fund administration services for its more than $21 billion in collective fund structures, including open and closed-end mutual funds, Dublin UCITS and private funds. In the United States, we won a mandate from Ford Motor Company for servicing an $8 billion defined contribution plan and issuing benefits payments. We also won a mandate to provide a range of servicing, including custody, accounting, performance and analytics and securities lending for Intel defined contribution plan of $7.5 billion.State Street Global Advisors during the quarter added $142 billion, including a $1.5 billion mandate for implementing a passive strategy for Massachusetts Pension Reserves, which builds on our existing relationship with this customer. SSgA successfully won a renewal by the Illinois State Board of Investment, Chicago to run a $513 million MSCI all country x U.S. Equity Index fund.Moving on to our other business lines. We, like many others, face declines in trading services and securities finance revenues. As we said in the third quarter call, as spreads compress further, securities finance revenue declined in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. With respect to securities finance revenue, we believe we are at or near the trough. In the fourth quarter, we added several new customers in our Securities Finance business. As we said last quarter, a participation in the program has stabilized and now it's beginning to grow again. Net interest revenue on a fully tax equivalent basis decreased 3% from the third quarter, due primarily to lower conduit discount accretion as a result of the absence of one-time pay-downs and a slowing prepayments fees. Ed will provide some more details shortly.Spreads on fixed income securities have compressed significantly, improving State Street's unrealized securities losses in our investment portfolio. As liquidity began to return to the market, the after-tax unrealized losses were cut by about 65% from the December 2008 level, from $6.32 billion to $2.29 billion.It's also important to us as we operate in a lower growth environment to execute our core competency and expense control, which I think we've been demonstrating during this difficult period. You will notice that our salaries and benefits expenses declined from the third quarter by about $28 million, due to lower cash incentive compensation accruals. I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will provide further detail about our financial performance in 2009 and provide several comments affecting our business in 2010."
188785,84102672,46389,"State Street Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-20-2010",2010-01-20,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ron. Good morning, everyone.

This morning, I'll review three areas. First, the results of the fourth quarter and the year. Second, the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio, the overall performance of the portfolio, as well as our outlook for net interest margin in 2010. And third, a review of our capital ratios and the execution of our tangible common equity improvement plan.This morning, one of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's press release. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2009 with the third quarter, servicing fee revenue increased 6% and management fee revenue was up 5%, primarily due to new business wins as well as market increases. Both items were up compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to market improvement. Clearly, revenue from securities finance was weaker when compared either with the very strong fourth quarter of 2008 or with the third quarter of 2009. In each case, this weakness was primarily due to further compression in spreads. Foreign exchange revenue declined on a year-over-year basis due to lower volatility and lower volumes. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, foreign exchange revenue declined due to lower volumes, offset partially by slightly higher volatility. The mix of Foreign Exchange business between custody foreign exchange and third-party foreign exchange remained fairly constant.Brokerage and other revenue, which is reported as part of trading services was up 47% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, and was up 8% compared to the third quarter of 2009, due primarily to strength in transition management and electronic trading. We had $405 billion of average securities on loan in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $440 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 and up from $399 billion for the third quarter. We saw a significant compression in spreads in 2009. The Fed Funds, the three month LIBOR spread, began the year at about 135 basis points and ended the year at approximately 13 basis points. We believe that spread compression is near or at a trough and we are hopeful that securities finance revenue is at or near the bottom, assuming volumes remain relatively flat. While we believe that the securities finance market will continue to be an important source of revenue for State Street, it will take some time for this market to return to historical levels.Average lendable assets for the fourth quarter of 2009 were about $2.3 trillion, up 10% from $2.1 trillion for the third quarter of 2009, and up about 21% from $1.9 trillion for the fourth quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 25 days. Now for the remaining items in the income statement. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, processing and other fee revenue declined 28%, but was up 33% from the third quarter. The change in revenue were due to a number of factors, none of which was individually material. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined about 10% from the fourth quarter of 2008, due primarily to the impact of the continuing low interest rate environment, compressed spreads and a decline in customer balances from the abnormally high levels in the fourth quarter of 2008, offset partially by the impact of discount accretion from the consolidated conduit assets.Compared to the third quarter of 2009, net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined 3% due to a lower level of discount accretion, as a result of the absence of one-time pay-downs and slower prepayment rates, offset partially by the positive impact of the investment strategy which we began to execute in the third quarter. Net interest margin of 235 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009 was down 12 basis points from the third quarter of 2009 on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Excluding discount accretion of $230 million, net interest margin in the fourth quarter would have been 161 basis points. The net interest margin for the full year is 220 basis points including discount accretion of $621 million, and is 169 basis points excluding discount accretion.In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded about $108 million of net gains and separately, about $51 million of credit related OTTI, resulting in a $57 million net gain related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses in U.S. non-agency, mortgage-backed securities. In the fourth quarter, we also recorded a loan-loss provision of $35 million, primarily related to a commercial real estate exposure. Regarding operating basis expenses, fourth quarter expenses increased 1.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 5.7% from the third quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reduced our full-year cash incentive compensation accrual by about 50%, given our tangible common equity improvement plan and the financial market disruption.As previously disclosed, no performance-based cash incentive compensation was accrued in the first half of 2009 in support of our TCE improvement plan. Following the repayment of TARP, conduit consolidation, our successful equity raise and the progress in achieving our TCE improvement plan, we began to accrue discretionary cash incentive compensation in the third quarter of this year. Note that compared to the third quarter of 2009, salaries and benefits expenses declined 3% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to a lower level of accrual of performance-based cash incentive compensation. We accrued approximately $50 million for this item in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the $100 million we estimated we would accrue in the fourth quarter on the third quarter call.Other expenses declined 17% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, but increased 48% from the third quarter of 2009, due primarily to an adverse judgment of $60 million rendered by Netherlands court in a matter relating to the Lehman bankruptcy, as well as other securities processing costs. On a year-over-year basis comparing 2009 with 2008 on an operating basis, other expenses declined 23%. We will continue to be vigilant in managing these expenses. Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The average size of the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter has increased about $22 billion to $94 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This increase is due primarily to the consolidation of the conduit assets with a fair value of approximately $16.6 billion, as well as the execution of our reinvestment strategy in the second half of 2009, offset partially by maturities and sales from the investment portfolio. Excluding treasury bills, during the fourth quarter we invested about $4.4 billion in highly-rated securities at an average price of $99.81, with an average yield of 2.37% and a duration of approximately 2.08 years.Those $4.4 billion are primarily comprised of the following securities, 99.7% of which are rated AAA, $1.3 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities, $2.4 billion of asset-backed securities including about $1 billion of foreign RMBS and about $0.5 billion of credit card receivables, $0.2 billion in non-agency, mortgage-backed securities, and $0.5 billion in corporate and municipal bonds. The aggregate unrealized after-tax losses in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of December 31, 2009, were $2.3 billion, an improvement of about $700 million from September 30, 2009 and about $4.0 billion or about 65% from December 31, 2008, in each case after giving effect to conduit consolidation. As of last Friday, January 15, 2010, the comparable unrealized after-tax loss had improved from year end by nearly $500 million to about $1.8 billion. In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter-end for you to review.As of December 31, 2009, our portfolio is 80.2% AAA or AA rated similar to September 30, 2009. The amount of downgrades diminished significantly from the prior quarter as well. The former conduit assets now included in the investment portfolio continued to improve in price during the quarter as general capital market conditions improved. We continue to estimate that we will not accrete back into net interest revenue about $850 million of the charge we took upon consolidation. This is expected to occur over the remaining lives of the conduit assets and is consistent with the level we estimated on our third quarter conference call.The accretion into net interest revenue in the fourth quarter was $230 million for a total of $621 million in 2009. We continue to expect about $900 million of discount accretion in 2010 and about $700 million in 2011 to accrete back into net interest revenue, further bolstering our already very strong capital position. We also have continued to expect about two-thirds of the total expected discount accretion to occur in the first five years after consolidation, assuming we continue to hold the securities. As you are undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions go into the estimate of future discount accretion, including estimated prepayment speeds and expected future credit losses across the various asset classes.I'll now provide some of the assumptions we used in creating our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. First, that we continue to execute on the portfolio reinvestment plan that we adopted in the second half of 2009. We intend to reinvest about 80% of the approximately $15 billion in assets due to mature or pay down in 2010. We intend to continue to invest in highly rated agency mortgage-backed securities and highly rated asset-backed securities. As we stated when we announced the proposed acquisition of Intesa Security Services business, we expect to invest approximately $16 billion of customer deposits in euro-denominated government bonds and bank placements. We expect the net interest margin, including the impact of the Intesa acquisition, but excluding the conduit discount accretion to be between 150 and 160 basis points on average for the year. Excluding discount accretion, we expect the net interest margin to be down from 169 basis points on average in 2009, due to an anticipated significantly tighter spread environment for all of 2010 as compared to the first half of 2009.We expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 50 basis points for the rest of the year. We expect the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis points for the rest of the year and we expect the Fed to keep the overnight Fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2010. We further expect earning assets to increase between 6% and 8% from the average in 2009, primarily due to the expected acquisition of Intesa's Security Services business. We expect the S&P 500 to average about 1125 in 2010, up about 19% from 948 which was its average in 2009.Lastly, I'll briefly update our capital ratios and the successful execution of our TCE improvement plan that we announced last February. In the fourth quarter, State Street Corporation's capital ratios continued to improve such that as of December 31, 2009 compared to September 30, 2009, our tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 8.5%, up from 8.0%. Our tier 1 capital ratios stood at 17.5%, up from 15.3%. In the fourth quarter, we improved our tangible common equity ratio from 5.6% at September 30, 2009 to 6.6% at December 31, 2009, ahead of our original target of 4.91% when we introduced the plan in February of 2009. The majority of this quarterly improvement came from price improvement in the investment portfolio and organic capital generation. The details behind the TCE ratio, displayed on a quarterly basis, are listed on our website on Slide 15 in the investment portfolio presentation. We expect all of our capital ratios to continue to be strong, including following the acquisition of Intesa's Security Services business expected to close in the second quarter of 2010. In conclusion, we strengthened the company through our actions in 2009 to prepare us for the future. We believe the economy is recovering but that it will be slow and our approach will continue to be cautious. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay, who will provide our view of our financial goals and the operating environment."

We have emerged as a stronger compan",876,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I'm excited about leading State Street into the second decade of this century and believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of growth trends in the global financial markets. We have emerged as a stronger company after two very disruptive years, 2008 and 2009, when financial markets nearly collapsed and our revenue soared in one year into strengthened market-driven revenue and then fell on the next as volume and volatility and market-driven revenue fell below historical norms. Continued weakness in market-driven revenue is expected to be a headwind in 2010. In 2009, growth in our core businesses, security servicing and investment management were the two consistent bright lights and we are optimistic that this trend will continue into 2010. We continue to win new business and our pipeline is promising. We see growth opportunities across all geographies and in particular, in investment manager operations outsourcing, quantitative asset management and alternative investment servicing. We expect to close two acquisitions in the first half of the year, as Ron mentioned. Intesa Sanpaolo's Security Servicing business and Mourant. Both acquisitions will provide additional capabilities for our customers in Europe, and both are expected to be modestly accretive in 2010.First, Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business. This acquisition brings us about $500 billion in custody assets to be serviced, a significant majority of which is Intesa Sanpaolo's own investment management affiliates. In addition, we will provide accounting services for about $250 billion and depo bank services for about $200 billion. With 80% of the assets in Italy and the other 20% in Luxembourg, as the business becomes integrated into our business model, we see opportunities for additional cross-sell revenue which was not included in the valuation models for the transaction. As we said when announcing the transaction, we will assume about $16 billion in deposits, which we intend to invest in euro-denominated government debt as well as bank placement. Then Mourant, this acquisition will solidify our position as the leader in servicing investment, alternative investments, and as the number one servicer of private equity investments in the world. We gained expertise in servicing private equity following the acquisition of Investors Financial and Palmeri in 2007, and Mourant add to that capability. So our own organic growth, plus the long-term growth of these two acquisitions position us very well for the future. With this as an introduction, let me remind you that we believe that our long-term financial goals remain in place. Last spring, I led a strategic view of our company. Our senior-most staff reviewed the markets, both geographic and product related, for all of our businesses and compared the outlook of those to our long-term financial goals. We assessed our market position and our existing solutions and services as well as those in development. The result, those goals are still appropriate and I expect them to be achieved over economic and market cycles. They are growth in operating basis revenue of between 8% and 12%. Growth in operating basis earnings per share of between 10% and 15%. An achievement of operating basis return on equity of between 14% and 17%. Given the volatility of the past two years, we expect that 2010 is going to be a transition year. We expect our core businesses, servicing fees and management fees, to continue to grow and become a larger percentage of the total revenue. If we include discount accretion associated with the conduit consolidation into our calculations, we expect our operating basis earnings per share in 2010 to be approaching the lower end of the 10% to 15% range. However, to achieve greater transparency into the performance of our core business, going forward, we will report our operating basis financial results, excluding merger and integration costs, as well as the impact of discount accretion associated with the conduit assets. So to level set, let me remind you that our operating basis revenue, excluding discount accretion in 2009, was $8.138 billion and our operating earnings per share would have been $3.32. We expect our 2010 operating earnings per share, excluding the merger and integration costs and discount accretion to be only slightly above 2009, reflecting in part a higher average outstanding share count.To achieve success going forward, I have several targets I intend to drive through the organization, And let me give those to you. Number one, double our non-U.S. revenue over the next five years. Two, drive industry innovation by maintaining technology investment at 20% to 25% of operating expenses. Three, accelerate global market share growth in core businesses organically and through acquisition. Four, refine our industry-leading operating model so as to achieve positive operating leverage annually in more normal markets. And finally, to enhance our risk management capabilities across the organization.So 2010 is expected to be a year of transition, one in which our core businesses continue to grow, but sources of market-driven revenue represent a headwind. We look forward to closing the two transactions we announced in the fourth quarter and integrating them into our business. And I look forward to meeting with many of you in the future especially at our Investor and Analyst Forum, which is scheduled for May 5 in New York. Now I'll turn it back to Ron."

As we end 2009, I think you saw and we know particular strength in the investor services and investment management lines. We think those businesses continue to be positioned against good growth trends, whether it's past of asset management or continued outsourcing, both domestically and globally. So, we think those core revenue engines are set up well for a good growth in 2010. As mentioned, the market-driven revenues, beginning with the securities lending business, is still in a constrained environment. We think it's at a trough, but recovery will be slow. And the net interest revenue, as Ed mentioned, we see that as flattish throughout the year.  So I think the core drivers have always been the core drivers, which is the core investor services and investment management fees, which we're pretty optimistic about as we sit here today."

I guess maybe more broadly and perhaps more importantly, I think that we're in a transition where risk management has become a broader part of the culture of how we view business opportunities going forward. I think across the company, whether it's running a line business or a support staff group, there's much more attention at my level, at Ron's level, at Ed's level to managing risks in a prudent way. That doesn't mean not taking risks, but being aware of when you're taking risks, what the risk return looks like.

I’ll begin with some general comments about our financial results and the operating environment as we begin 2010. Then I’ll hand it over to Ed who will provide a more detailed financial perspective.

Then I’ll hand it over to Ed who will provide a more detailed financial perspective. I’ll make some concluding remarks and then both of us will be happy to take your questions.
The first quarter of 2010 represents a continuation of what we saw at the end of 2009 with the economy showing steady signs of recovery, the equity markets showing signs of life and a continuation of low levels of interest rates around the world.
This environment provides good opportunity for our core fee based businesses, but has continued to constrain our market driven revenues; most notably, net interest revenue, securities, finance and foreign exchange.
During the quarter, we continued to build on a very strong capital position as evidenced by the capital ratios at quarter end with tier one risk based capital at 18.1%, our leverage ratio at 9% and our tangible common equity at 7.5%.
Let me now walk through our results. I’ll describe our operating basis results, which exclude discount accretion resulting from the consolidation of the conduits in the second quarter of 2009 as well as merger and integration costs.
Our Service Fee and Asset Management Fee revenue, or core revenue, increased in double digits compared to a year ago and over fee revenue increased 8%. These results were driven by the impact of rising equity market valuations as well as business installations.
Comparing the first quarter of 2010 with the fourth quarter of 2009, Servicing Fee revenue was nearly flat due to a stronger U.S. dollar and lower volumes offset partially by new business and the impact of higher average equity valuations. Asset Management Fee revenue declined about 2% due primarily to lower performance fees in the first quarter of 2010. 
We’re still installing a backlog of business we won in the second half of 2009 as well as new business won to date in 2010. These conversions will take several quarters to install due to their size and complexity.
Our operating basis earnings per share increased from $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $0.75 in the first quarter of 2010. Revenue growth of about 1.6% was balanced with tight cost discipline, resulting in expense growth of about .6%, resulting in 100 basis points of positive operating leverage.
The credit markets continue to stabilize, contributing to the improvement in the unrealized after tax losses in our investment portfolio, now at about $1.4 billion, down from $5.4 billion a year ago. We closed the Mourant acquisition in early April, a transaction which will, we believe, make us number one in the world in servicing alternative investment assets. We expect this acquisition to be slightly accretive to earnings this year, excluding merger and integration costs. 
We expect to close the acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business later this quarter. Upon completion, this acquisition will firmly establish us as the leading servicer in Italy and enhances our already strong position in the offshore market of Luxembourg. We expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive to earnings this year excluding merger and integration costs.
As we expected, and noted on our fourth quarter call, we continue to experience weakness in market driven revenues. The Trading Service revenue continues to be constrained as foreign exchange volatility has not improved, nor have volumes compared with the fourth quarter. Cross border trading is weak; in particular, cross border equities have lagged the market recovery.
Our Securities Finance business experienced slightly increased volumes compared with the previous quarter with average loans outstanding of about $412 billion in the first quarter of 2010. However, we saw further compression in spread between Fed funds ad three month LIBOR from the end of the quarter from 14 basis points to about 12 basis points as of March 31, 2010, which put additional pressure on Securities Finance revenues.
The continued worldwide interest rate environment is also impacting our net interest revenue. On a fully tax equivalent basis and excluding discount accretion, net interest revenue in the first quarter declined 18% from the first quarter of 2009 and was down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2009.
These declines were primarily due to the effect of high yielding securities maturing, or paying down and being replaced with lower yielding assets.
Turning to new business, in the first quarter of 2010 we added $164 billion in assets to be serviced and in April this month to date, we won an additional $155 billion in assets, including a large investment manger operations outsourcing mandate from Pinebridge Investments as well as a very large win from a state pension fund.
Within Asset Management, net customer cash flows including customer wins and losses were modestly negative. This decline however, was more than offset by appreciation of assets under management with total assets under management remaining in excess of $1.9 trillion at March 31, 2010.
Taken together, these wins combined with the installation backlog from prior period sales, as well as continued pipeline strength, give us confidence in the ongoing growth of our core business in 2010. 
We continue to see growth in servicing for alternative asset management. This quarter, prior to our acquisition of Mourant, we added 12 new customers. As of March 31, 2010 our asset service and alternative investments have grown to $474 billion. With the only April acquisition of Mourant, they are now approximately $613 billion.
Some of our investment servicing wins in the first quarter included the State of Ohio, who had awarded State Street three mandates to provide services for $23 billion in international assets in the Ohio Public Employees Retirement system, the Ohio Police and Fire pension system and the State Teachers retirement system.
Charles Schwab, a customer of State Street since 2005 has appointed State Street to service its newly launched family of exchange-traded funds with custody fund accounting, fund administration and transfer agent services.
Wellington West Asset Management of Canada, appointed State Street to provide a range of investment services including fund accounting, fund administration, custody and trustee services, for a group of new funds being launched by Wellington West.
Legg Mason Global Asset Management expanded its relationship with State Street with the award of fund administration and custody services for its U.K. domiciled assets. In addition, State Street has been retained by British Airways Pension Trustee’s, a client since 1997 to continue to service its $14 billion pound U.K.  pension fund.
State Street Global Advisors during the quarter added new mandates including the Colorado Fire and Police Pension Association who has hired State Street Global Advisors to handle a $450 million global equity mandate.
An Australian State Government Pension Fund awarded us a $3.9 billion Aussie mandate across three index strategies manage a tax aware basis. And, State Street was reconfirmed as one of AP7’s passive managers, increasing assets managed from $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion.
Now turning to expenses, we continue to control head count only adding employees for new business and product development initiatives. In the current environment, we’re highly focused on keeping a tight control over expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits expense reflect a level of incentive compensation consistent with our outlook for the year.
In the first quarter of 2009, as part of our PCE improvement plan, we did not accrue for discretionary cash incentive compensation. As always, incentive compensation is subject to company performance.
Before I hand the call to Ed, let me make a few comments now on the broader economic environment. The U.S. economy does appear to be working its way through a slow, or as some have termed, saucer shaped recovery.
Consumer confidence appears to be returning to the market. Unemployment has declined slightly during the past two quarters. Housing prices are beginning to stabilize, but the headwinds are still there.
The absolute level of unemployment still remains at a high level and central banks around the world continue to maintain interest rates at low levels. The early indications of recovery, as evidenced by the rising markets, give us some confidence that the trend in market driven revenue will begin to improve to more normalized levels later this year or early next year.
Let me now turn the call over to Ed who will provide further detail about our financial performance in the first quarter and provide comments reflecting our outlook for the remainder of 2010.

This morning I’ll review three areas; first, the results of the first quarter, second, the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio and the overall performance of the portfolio as well as",2249,"Thank you Jay, and good morning everyone. This morning I’ll review three areas; first, the results of the first quarter, second, the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio and the overall performance of the portfolio as well as our outlook for net interest margin in 2010, and third, a review of our strong capital position.
This morning all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today’s earnings news release. Comparing the first quarter of 2010 with the first quarter of 2009, Servicing revenue increased 15% and Management Fee revenue was up 25% primarily due to an increase in average equity market valuations as well as new business wins.
Servicing Fees declined slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due to a stronger U.S. dollar and lower volumes, offset partially by new business and  higher daily average equity market valuations.
Management Fees declined compared to the fourth quarter due to lower performance fees in the first quarter of 2010. Market driven revenue continues to be weak. Foreign exchange revenue declined compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to lower volatility, offset partially by higher volumes. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, foreign exchange revenue declined due to both lower volumes and lower volatility.
Brokerage and other revenue which is reported as part of Trading Services doubled when compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to higher revenue from electronic trading. Also in the first quarter of 2009, a lower valuation on several securities held in the trading account impacted revenue in that quarter negatively. It was down about 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due primarily to lower revenue from transition management.
We had $412 billion of average securities on loan in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $398 billion of securities in this first quarter of 2009 and $409 billion of securities in the fourth quarter.
Securities finance revenue declined from the relatively strong first quarter of 2009 by 60%. We continue to experience compression in spreads in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009. The Fed funds to three month LIBOR spread at the end of the first quarter of 2009 was about 105 basis points, but it ended the first quarter of 2010 at approximately 12 basis points. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, we saw continued compression of about two basis points from the 14 basis points at the end of the fourth quarter.
Average lendable assets for the first quarter of 2010 were about $2.3 trillion flat with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up about 34% from $1.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2009. As of March 31, 2010, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 21 days, down from 25 days in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting continued conservatism in the lenders investment guidelines.
While the quarter’s results in foreign exchange and securities finance were not as strong as we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, our expectation is that volumes and volatilities in foreign exchange and spreads and securities lending will modestly improve through the remainder of 2010.
Now for the remaining items in the income statement. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, processing and other fee revenue of $120 million increased 145% and doubled from the fourth quarter of 2009, both increases due primarily to a gain from an early buy out of a legacy leasing transaction and improved revenue from structured products.
Operating basis net interest revenue declined about 18% from the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to the continuing impact of low interest rates worldwide and compressed spreads on our normalized balance sheet.
Due to the strain caused by the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, our balance sheet continues to have abnormally high levels of customer deposits at the end of the first quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, operating basis net interest revenue declined 4% due to lower yields on newly purchased securities that were replacing securities with higher yields that were maturing or paying down.
Operating basis net interest margin of 162 basis points, which excludes discount accretion, was up one basis point from the fourth quarter of 2009 on the same basis. Including discount accretion of $212 million, and $230 million respectively, net interest margin in the first quarter of 2010 was 234 basis points compared to 235 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009.
In the first quarter of 2010, we recorded about $192 million in net gains from sales of securities, and separately, about $97 million OTTI, resulting in $95 million of net gains related to investments and securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses in U.S. non-agency mortgage backed securities.
We sold securities during the quarter in order to take advantage of what we viewed as favorable valuations. The net gains from securities sold were approximately half from sales of about $2.9 billion in securities from the legacy investment portfolio. The other half of the gains were from sales of about $657 million from former conduit securities. The sales of the former conduit securities were executed due to both favorable valuations as well as to de-risk the balance sheet.
I’d like to recap where we are relative to future discount accretion. As of December 31, 2009, we expected about $4.6 billion to accrete in interest income over the remaining lives of the assets. We continue to believe that $850 million will not accrete into net interest revenue due to credit. There has been no change in our view relative to credit.
We earned $212 million of discount accretion in the first quarter. The discount accretion that we will forego from the sales of conduit securities in the first quarter on which we had a gain of approximately $100 million is $140 million.
And lastly, future discount accretion is expected to decline by approximately $100 million due to the dollar’s strength in the first quarter. So as of March 31, 2010, we now have about $4.1 billion left to accrete through the income statement over the remaining lives of the assets.
Also, we now expect about $800 million to accrete in 2010 and $600 million to accrete in 2011, down from our earlier expectations due to slower pre-payments which account for about 50% of the declines, and foregone accretion on sales which account for the other 50% of the decline.
As you are undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions go into the estimate of future discount accretion, including estimate pre-payments, expected future credit losses across various asset classes, sales and assumption that securities are held to maturity.
Regarding operating basis expenses, first quarter expenses increased 22% compared to the first quarter of 2009 and increased .6% from the fourth quarter of 2009. The primary reason for the increase compared to the first quarter of 2009 was the 21% increase in salaries and benefits expenses due to primarily to the accrual of incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2010 as well as increased benefit costs. Of course the accrual of incentive compensation is subject to company performance.
There was no discretionary cash incentive compensation accrued in the first quarter of 2009 in order to support our TCE improvement plan.
Salaries and benefits expense increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, the primary reason for the significant increase was the impact of prior year’s equity awards.
Another item affecting the increase in expenses in the first quarter comparison was the 71% increase in other expenses from a very low level in the first quarter of 2009. In that quarter, securities processing costs were abnormally low. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, other expenses declines 26% due to lower expenses following the cost of a legal settlement in the f fourth quarter of 2009. Also included in other expenses in the first quarter of 2010, was a $25 million benefit for insurance recovery that we received. 
Transaction processing increased $22 million or 17% compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to higher volumes in asset servicing. No other item in operating expenses increased or declined meaningfully either on a sequential quarter or year over year basis.
Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The size of the average investment portfolio in the first quarter increased about $25 billion to $94.8 billion compared to the first quarter of 2009. This increase is due primarily to the consolidation of the conduit assets in May 2009 with a fair value then of approximately $16.6 billion as well as the continuing execution of our reinvestment strategy, offset partially by maturities and the sales of selected securities.
During the first quarter we invested about $7.3 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of 101.05 and with an average yield of 2.72% and a duration of approximately 2.34 years. Those $7.3 billion are primarily comprised of the following securities, 93% of which are rated AAA; $3.4 billion in agency mortgage backed securities, $2.9 billion in asset backed securities including about $1.3 billion of foreign RNBS, and about $.5 billion backed by credit card receivables, $700 million in student loans and $300 million in auto, $100 million in commercial mortgage backed securities and $900 million in corporate and municipal bonds.
The aggregate unrealized after tax losses and our available for sale and held to maturity portfolios as of March 31, 2010 were $1.4 billion, an improvement of about $4.4 billion or 75% from March 31, 2009 and an improvement of about $851 million or about 37% from December 31, 2009. These unrealized losses after tax have further improved through last Friday to approximately $1.1 billion.
In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of March 31, 2010, our portfolio was 80.2% AAA or AA rated, similar to December 31, 2009. The duration of the investment portfolio is about 1.27 years, down slightly from the fourth quarter as well as from the first quarter of 2009.
The increase in the number of downgrades from the fourth quarter resulted primarily from a continuing trend for downgrades in non-U.S. RBS securities as well as further reductions in rating subsequently to those already noted in earlier quarters.
The amount of discount accretion included in net interest revenue in the first quarter was $212 million. Given the improved financial environment in the first quarter, we reduced our excess liquidity by about $3.9 billion. At period end, our excess liquidity totaled about $19 billion due principally to customer behaviour.
I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in confirming our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We continue to execute on the portfolio reinvestment plan that we adopted in the second half of 2009. We intend to reinvest about 80% to 85% of the approximately $15 billion in assets due to mature or pay down in 2010.
Of the $7.3 billion that we purchased, $2.3 billion was due to replacing securities that we sold and $5 billion was due to securities maturing or paying down. We intend to continue to invest in highly rated  agency mortgage backed securities and highly rated asset backed securities.
We expect to invest the acquired customer deposits from the proposed acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Securities Services business in Euro denominated sovereign government bonds and bank placements.
We expect our net interest margin, including the impact of the Intesa acquisition, but excluding conduit discount accretion to be between 150 and 160 basis points on average for the year. We continue to expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 50 basis points for the year and we continue to expect the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis points throughout the rest of the year, and we continue to expect the Fed to keep the overnight Fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2010.
We further expect earning assets to increase between 6% to 8% from the average in 2009, primarily due to the expected acquisition of Intesa’s Security Services business. We expect the S&P 500 to average about 1125 in 2010, up about 19% from 948 which was the average in 2009.
Lastly, I’ll review our capital ratios. In the first quarter, State Street Corporation’s capital ratios continued to improve such that as of March 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009, our tier one leverage ratio stood at 9.0%, up from 8.5% and our tier one capital ratio stood at 18.1% up from 17.7%.
In the first quarter we improved our TCE ratio from 6.6% at December 31, 2009, to 7.5% at March 31, 2010. The majority of this quarterly improvement came from price improvement in the investment portfolio and organic capital generation, and the resulting return on equity on an operating basis, was 10%.
We expect all of our capital ratios to continue to be strong, including following the anticipated acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Securities Services business expected to close later this quarter pending regulatory approval and other closing conditions.
So in conclusion, we believe we strengthened the company through our actions in 2009. This year we expect to derive benefits from those actions, and we remain highly focuses on executing our plan.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.

So while we remain committed to our long term financial goals, we continue to believe 2010 will be a transition year, a year in which we transition to a more normalized environment. We continue to expect our 2010 operating basis earnings per share to be slightly above the $3.32 operating basis earnings per share in 2009. 
As I outlined for you in the fourth quarter call in January, I have established a series of objectives that support the achievement of our long term financial goals of 8% to 12% growth in operating revenue, 10% to 15% growth in operating earnings per share, and the achievement of 14% to 17% operating return on equity.
Fueling the achievement of these objectives which include doubling our non-U.S. revenue over the next five years and expanding our market share is a number of macro trends such as globalization, outsourcing and consolidation.
We’re well positioned to take advantage of these trends and they are already driving our business today. The organic growth in our core business, combined with the impact of the two acquisitions, Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business and Mourant International Finance Administration, are expected to fuel our growth in 2010.
As you may remember from our December announcements of these two transactions, we expected about $100 million in annualized revenues from Mourant and about $425 million in annualized revenue from Intesa Sanpalo. 
In addition, we expect organic growth in the servicing side to continue from high growth areas such as alternative investments servicing and international markets. Our pipeline is strong with the larger mandates expected to convert over the second half of 2010.
As I outlined earlier, our core business growth is also supported by our large wins announced last year that are still in the process of conversion. In asset management, State Street Global Advisors continues to position itself to benefit from the increased demand from DC plans and ETF products.
So while we face some challenges in the short term, I believe we are calibrating the business within a slowly improving environment in order to address these challenges, while positioning State Street for continued growth in the future.
I look forward to meeting with many of you at our investor and analyst forum which is scheduled for May 5 in New York. 
And now, Ed and I are happy to take your questions.

In terms of the effect of rising rates, we’re still in the same position that we’ve been in for a long time which is that slowly rising rates benefit us, and by slowly rising again, we define that as 25 basis points a quarter on the Fed funds rate.
Obviously the pace with which the rates increase, the shape of the curve and the path to get from where we are to where we end up is a huge determinate of what the ultimate NIR and NIM performance is, but our expectation is that if in fact rates slowly rise, once the Fed stops increasing rates, we’d see a benefit to both NIR and NIM all else equal.

I would say on the customers risk profile, we haven’t see a lot of desire to go out and get more riskier in the collateral investments and I assume, just an assumption that over time as people get comfortable with some of the income generated from securities lending based on spreads widening out a bit that you’ll see over time some more risk taking.

So that’s still valid, and that’s a proxy obviously for the maturity or the expected maturities of those conduit securities.
The remaining one-third though will take a fair amount of time. I think you should be thinking about it in terms of seven, eight, nine years out depending on the ultimate performance of the securities.
How we think about the sales of conduit securities is really two-fold. One, it’s a question of market prices, and we’ve obviously had a pretty strong rally over the last couple of quarters in the fixed income markets and we’ve seen some securities that we think have been traded above what our view of fair value for them is, so they’re a potential candidate.
Secondly, we look at the securities in the conduit that are in that favorable position and decide whether or not the gain that we could generate is appropriate given the amount of foregone discount accretion that such a sale would generated. And in the first quarter in total as I said, we gave up undiscounted $140 million of future discount accretion, and we booked $100 million roughly of gains on those securities, and we thought that on a net present value basis, that made a lot of sense for us to do.
And lastly, we look at it from the standpoint of risk reduction. The conduit securities as you may recall in general were of lower credit quality than the investment portfolio - still pretty high quality but not up the level of the investment portfolio. Some of those securities on a risk reduction basis, we decided to sell in the first quarter.
So you put all three of those things together, and that’s how we think about it. Going forward, it’s hard to say. We don’t have any plan as I said in response to an earlier question, to necessarily sell any legacy portfolio securities or conduit securities. It’s episodic. It’s based on the market events and our view of those credits and those securities at that time.

We do in fact have securities issued, asset backed commercial paper issued which is a very attractive source of funding for us, and as long as it continues to be that, we’ll continue to do it. But that’s more of a just a legal mechanic where we are issuing through the conduit. So we don’t consider that as a business akin to what we had before we consolidated.
In terms of the capital, I would say a good way to think about it is probably to think about it in TCE and apply 5% against the consolidated assets, so round terms, probably $750 million to $800 million, but that’s more a function of just the capital supporting that element of the conduit securities that are now in the portfolio.
So I think the overall capital question is really a function of how our balance sheet grows and what we do on the asset side in terms of investing those customer deposits ultimately.

We said, and I continue to believe that a priority is to reinstate the dividend. Now we’re I think all in a place where we’re looking for a little more guidance from regulators. We would hope to get some further clarity on that by the end of the year, but that’s pending.
So that aside, I guess the use of capital, I’ve said before and I continue to believe that particularly in the asset servicing business that we’ll see further consolidation and you continue to see evidence of that, not just in our acquisitions but in other acquisitions made within the industry.
I think if you play out the capital story, particularly in places like Europe as capital levels are clarified with regard to the banking industry, I think you’re likely to see more non core custody businesses come up for sale. So I continue to believe that one good deployment of future capital will be acting on consolidation in the asset servicing industry.
We always look at that assuming post insight from regulators that we  have excess capital vis a vis share buy backs. So those are the three dimensions, and I think given as a priority, I think acquisition is still an active part of our strategy which I think will play out over the next several years and share buyback is obviously the other alternative.

The core business, servicing asset management, I think between the backlog of installation, the current period sales which I referenced $155 billion in assets that we have closed just this month, combined with prospective view of pipeline, gives us good confidence in the momentum of the core business.
Added to the that the acquisitions both Mourant which is closed and Intesa which we anticipate closing this quarter, give us good confidence and good sense that core revenues will run well through the course of the year.
So that’s really the anchor for confidence in the revenue line. We also - Ed pointed out, it’s worth mentioning again, that in the market driven revenues securities finance and foreign exchange, we would expect some improvement in those lines toward the back end of the year based on in the case of foreign exchange, I think you could look to segments like mutual funds.
As mutual fund investors move more towards equities and cross border equities, we would expect to see some positive reflection in foreign exchange. In securities lending, we’ve seen some recent improvements and spreads.
So it’s really anchored around the core with some anticipated improvement toward the back end of the year and market revenues, and good control on expenses.

One thing I can point to is that I think we continue to be well placed to look to outsourcing more middle office, more back office that we continue to see investment management firms in particular, consolidating with single providers, so given our position, I think we’ve evidence, we’ve talked about Legg Mason for instance moving their U.K. business to us.
So I think between consolidating positions with customers, a deeper level of outsourcing, combined with continued robust activity outside of the U.S., and alternatives, which the alternative story is one of growth, but it’s also one of I think some regulatory and client pressure pushing more alternative mangers to outsource to a third party, all give us pretty good confidence that we’re in a zone where there’s quite a bit of activity going on, and I think competitively we’re pretty well positioned and we do a good job when a piece of business is up for bid and succeeding with it.
So I can’t give you a number but I can give you a sense that I think that the trends that have brought us the $1.1 trillion last year and the $300 billion this year continue in place.

I will begin with some general comments about our financial results and the operating environment as we begin 2010, and then I'll hand it over to Ed, who will provide a more detailed financial perspective. I will make",1402,"Thank you, Kelley, and good morning. I will begin with some general comments about our financial results and the operating environment as we begin 2010, and then I'll hand it over to Ed, who will provide a more detailed financial perspective. I will make some concluding remarks and then both of us will be happy to take your questions.
The first quarter of 2010 represents a continuation of what we saw at the end of 2009, with the economy showing steady signs of recovery, the equity market showing signs of life, and a continuation of low levels of interest rates around the world. This environment provides good opportunity for our core fee-based businesses, but has continued to constrain our market-driven revenues, most notably net interest revenue, securities, finance and foreign exchange.
During the quarter, we continued to build on a very strong capital position as evidenced by the capital ratios at quarter end with Tier 1 risk-based capital at 18.1%, our leverage ratio at 9% and our tangible common equity ratio at 7.5%.
Let me now walk through our results. I'll describe our operating basis results, which exclude discount accretion resulting from the consolidation of the conduits in the second quarter of 2009, as well as merger and integration costs. Our service fee and asset management fee revenue, or core revenue, increased in double digits compared to a year ago, when overall fee revenue increased 8%. These results were driven by the impact of rising equity market valuations, as well as business installations.
Comparing the first quarter of 2010 with the fourth quarter of 2009, servicing fee revenue was nearly flat due to a stronger U.S. dollar and lower volumes, offset partially by new business and the impact of higher average equity valuations. Asset management fee revenue declined about 2%, due primarily to lower performance fees in the first quarter of 2010.
We're still installing a backlog of business we won in the second half of 2009 as well as new business one year to date in 2010. These conversions will take several quarters to install due to their size and complexity. Our operating basis earnings per share increased from $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $0.75 in the first quarter of 2010. Revenue growth of about 1.6% was balanced with tight cost discipline, resulting in expense growth of about 0.6%, resulting in 100 basis points of positive operating leverage. The credit markets continue to stabilize, contributing to the improvement in the unrealized after-tax losses in our investment portfolio, now at about $1.4 billion, down from $5.4 billion a year ago. We closed the Mourant acquisition in early April, a transaction which we believe makes us number one in the world in servicing alternative investment assets. We expect this acquisition to be slightly accretive to earnings this year, excluding merger and integration costs.
We expect to close the acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business later this quarter. Upon completion, this acquisition will firmly establish us as the leading servicer in Italy and enhances our already strong position in the offshore market of Luxembourg. We expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive to earnings this year, excluding merger and integration costs.
As we expected and noted on our fourth quarter call, we continue to experience weakness in market-driven revenues. Trading service revenue continues to be constrained as foreign exchange volatility has not improved nor have volumes compared with the fourth quarter. Cross-border trading is weak. In particular, cross-border equities have lagged the market recovery. Our securities finance business experienced slightly increased volumes compared with the previous quarter, with average loans outstanding of about $412 billion in the first quarter of 2010. However, we saw further compression in the spread between Fed funds and three month LIBOR from the end of the quarter, from 14 basis points to about 12 basis points as of March 31, 2010, which put additional pressure on securities finance revenues.
The continued low worldwide interest rate environment is also impacting our net interest revenue. On a fully tax equivalent basis, and excluding discount accretion, net interest revenue in the first quarter declined 18% from the first quarter of 2009 and was down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2009. These declines were primarily due to the effect of higher-yielding securities maturing, or paying down and being replaced with lower yielding assets.
Turning to new business. In the first quarter of 2010, we added $164 billion in assets to be serviced, and in April, this month to date, we won an additional $155 billion in assets, including a large investment manager operations outsourcing mandate from PineBridge Investments, as well as a very large win from the state pension fund. Within asset management, net customer cash flows, including customer wins and losses, were modestly negative. This decline, however, was more than offset by appreciation of assets under management with total assets under management remaining in excess of $1.9 trillion at March 31, 2010.
Taken together, these wins combined with the installation backlog from prior period sales, as well as continued pipeline strength, give us confidence in the ongoing growth of our core business in 2010. We continue to see growth in servicing for alternative asset management. This quarter, prior to our acquisition of Mourant, we added 12 new customers. As of March 31, 2010, our asset service in alternative investments have grown to $447 billion. With the early April acquisition of Mourant, they are now approximately $613 billion.
Some of our investment servicing wins in the first quarter included the state of Ohio, who has awarded State Street three mandates to provide services for $23 billion in international assets in the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, the Ohio Police and Fire Pension System and the State Teachers Retirement System. Charles Schwab, a customer of State Street since 2005, has appointed State Street to service its newly launched family of exchange traded funds, with custody fund accounting, fund administration and transfer agent services. Wellington West Asset Management of Canada appointed State Street to provide a range of investment services, including fund accounting, fund administration, custody and trustee services for a group of new funds being launched by Wellington West. Legg Mason Global Asset Management expanded its relationship with State Street with the award of fund administration and custody services for its U.K. domiciled assets. And State Street has been retained by British Airways Pension Trustees, a client since 1997, to continue to service its 14 billion-pound U.K. pension fund.
State Street Global Advisors during the quarter added new mandates, including the Colorado Fire and Police Pension Association has hired State Street Global Advisors to handle a $450 million global equity mandate. And Australian State Government Pension Fund awarded SSgA a $3.9 billion Aussie mandate across three index strategies managed on a tax-aware basis. And State Street was reconfirmed as one of AP7's passive managers, increasing assets managed from $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion.
Now turning to expenses. We continue to control headcount, only adding employees for new business and product development initiatives. In the current environment, we're highly focused on keeping a tight control over expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits expense reflect the level of incentive compensation consistent with our outlook for the year. In the first quarter of 2009, as part of our TCE improvement plan, we did not accrue for discretionary cash incentive compensation. As always, incentive compensation is subject to company performance.
Before I hand the call to Ed, let me make a few comments now on the broader economic environment. The U.S. economy does appear to be working its way through a slow or, some have termed, saucer-shaped recovery. Consumer confidence appears to be returning to the market. Unemployment has declined slightly during the past two quarters. Housing prices are beginning to stabilize. But the headwinds are still there. The absolute level of unemployment still remains at a high level and central banks around the world continue to maintain interest rates at low levels. The early indications of recovery, as evidenced by the rising markets, give us some confidence that the trend in market-driven revenue will begin to improve to more normalized levels later this year or early next year.
Let me now turn the call over to Ed who will provide further detail about our financial performance in the first quarter and provide comments reflecting our outlook for the remainder of 2010."

This morning, I will review three areas. First, the results of the first quarter. Second, the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio and the overall performance of the portfolio, as well as our outlook for net interest margin in 2010. And, third, a review of our strong capital position.
This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release. Comparing the first quarter of 2010 with the first quarter of 2009, servicing fee revenue increased 15% and management fee revenue was up 25%, primarily due to an increase in average equity market valuations as well as new business wins. Servicing fees declined slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due to a stronger U.S. dollar and lower volumes, offset partially by new business and higher daily average equity market valuations. Management fees declined compared to the fourth quarter due to lower performance fees in the first quarter of 2010. Market-driven revenue continues to be weak. Foreign exchange revenue declined compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to lower volatility, offset partially by higher volumes. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, foreign exchange revenue declined due to both lower volumes and lower volatility.
Brokerage and other revenue, which was reported as part of trading services, doubled when compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to higher revenue from electronic trading. Also in the first quarter of 2009, a lower valuation on several securities held in the trading account impacted revenue in that quarter negatively. It was down about 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, due primarily to lower revenue from transition management. We had $412 billion of average securities on loan in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $398 billion of securities in the first quarter of 2009 and $409 billion of securities in the fourth quarter.
Securities finance revenue declined from the relatively strong first quarter of 2009 by 60%. We continue to experience compression in spreads in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009.  The Fed funds to three months LIBOR spread at the end of the first quarter of 2009 was about 105 basis points, but it ended the first quarter of 2010 at approximately 12 basis points. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, we saw a continued compression, about two basis points from the 14 basis points at the end of the fourth quarter. Average lendable assets for the first quarter of 2010 were about $2.3 trillion, flat with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up about 34% from $1.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2009. As of March 31, 2010, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 21 days, down from 25 days in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting continued conservatism in the lenders investment guidelines.
While the quarter's results and foreign exchange and securities finance were not as strong as we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, our expectation is that volumes and volatilities in foreign exchange and spreads and securities lending will modestly improve through the remainder of 2010.
Now for the remaining items in the income statement. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, processing and other fee revenue of $120 million increased 145% and doubled from the fourth quarter of 2009, both increases due primarily to a gain from an early buyout of a legacy leasing transaction and improved revenue from structured products. Operating basis net interest revenue declined about 18% from the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to the continuing impact of low interest rates worldwide and compressed spreads on our normalized balance sheet. Due to the strain caused by the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, our balance sheet contained abnormally high levels of customer deposits at the end of the first quarter of 2009.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, operating basis net interest revenue declined 4% due to lower yields on newly purchased securities that were replacing securities with higher yields that were maturing or paying down. Operating basis net interest margin of 162 basis points, which excludes discount accretion, was up one basis point from the fourth quarter of 2009 on the same basis. Including discount accretion of $212 million and $230 million respectively, net interest margin in the first quarter of 2010 was 234 basis points compared to 235 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, we recorded about $192 million in net gains from sales of securities and, separately, about $97 million of OTTI, resulting in $95 million of net gains related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses in U.S. non-agency, mortgage-backed securities.  We sold securities during the quarter in order to take advantage of what we viewed as favorable valuations. The net gains from securities sold were approximately half from sales of about $2.9 billion in securities from the legacy investment portfolio. The other half of the gains were from sales of about $657 million from former conduit securities. The sales of the former conduit securities were executed due to both favorable valuations as well as to de-risk the balance sheet.
I'd like to recap where we are relative to future discount accretion. As of December 31, 2009, we expected about $4.6 billion through accretive to interest income all the remaining lives of the assets. We continue to believe that $850 million will not accrete into net interest revenue due to credit. There has been no change in our view relative to credit. We earned $212 million of discount accretion in the first quarter. The discount accretion that we will forego from the sales of conduit securities in the first quarter, on which we had a gain of approximately $100 million, is $140 million. And, lastly, future discount accretion is expected to decline by approximately $100 million due to the dollar strength in the first quarter. So as of March 31, 2010, we now have about $4.1 billion left to accrete through the income statement over the remaining lives of the assets. Also, we now expect about $800 million to accrete in 2010 and $600 million to accrete in 2011, down from our earlier expectations due to slower pre-payments, which account for about 50% of the declines, and foregone accretion on sales, which account for the other 50% of the decline.
As you are undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions go into the estimate of future discount accretion, including estimated prepayments, expected future credit losses across various asset classes, sales, and an assumption that the securities are held to maturity.
Regarding operating basis expenses, first quarter expenses increased 22% compared to the first quarter of 2009 and increased 0.6% from the fourth quarter of 2009. The primary reason for the increase compared to the first quarter of 2009 was the 21% increase in salaries and benefits expenses due primarily to the accrual for incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2010 as well as increased benefit costs. Of course, the accrual of incentive compensation is subject to company performance. There was no discretionary cash incentive compensation accrued in the first quarter of 2009 in order to support our TCE improvement plan.
Salaries and benefits expense increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, the primary reason for the significant increase was the impact of prior year's equity awards. Another item affecting the increase in expenses in the first quarter comparison was the 71% increase in other expenses from a very low level in the first quarter of 2009. In that quarter, securities processing costs were abnormally low. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, other expenses declined 26% due to lower expenses following the cost of a legal settlement in the fourth quarter of 2009. Also, including other expenses in the first quarter of 2010, was a $25 million benefit for insurance recovery that we received.
Transaction processing increased $22 million or 17% compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to higher volumes in asset servicing. No other item in operating expenses increased or declined meaningfully either on a sequential quarter or year-over-year basis.
Now let me turn that investment portfolio.
The size of the average investment portfolio in the first quarter increased about $25 billion to $94.8 billion compared to the first quarter of 2009. This increase is due primarily to the consolidation of the conduit assets in May 2009 with a fair value then of approximately $16.6 billion, as well as the continuing execution of our reinvestment strategy, offset partially by maturities and sales of selected securities.  During the first quarter, we invested about $7.3 billion in highly-rated securities at an average price of a 101.05 and with an average yield of 2.72% and a duration of approximately 2.34 years. Those $7.3 billion are primarily comprised of the following securities, 93% of which are rated AAA:  $3.4 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities; $2.9 billion in asset-backed securities, including about $1.3 billion of foreign RMBS, and about $500 million backed by credit card receivables; $700 million in student loans and $300 million in auto; $0.1 billion or $100 million in commercial mortgage-backed securities; and $900 million in corporate and municipal bonds.
The aggregate unrealized after-tax losses in our available-for-sale and held for maturity portfolios, as of March 31, 2010, were $1.4 billion, an improvement of about $4.4 billion or 75% from March 31, 2009, and an improvement of about $851 million or about 37% from December 31, 2009. These unrealized losses after tax have further improved through last Friday to approximately $1.1 billion. In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of March 31, 2010, our portfolio is 80.2% AAA or AA rated similar to December 31, 2009. The duration of the investment portfolio is about 1.27 years, down slightly from the fourth quarter as well as from the first quarter of 2009.
The increase in the number of downgrades from the fourth quarter resulted primarily from a continuing trend for downgrades in non-U.S. RMBS securities, as well as further reductions in rating subsequently to those already noted in earlier quarters. The amount of discount accretion included in net interest revenue in the first quarter was $212 million. Given the improved financial environment in the first quarter, we reduced our excess liquidity by about $3.9 billion. At period end, our excess liquidity totaled about $19 billion due principally to customer behavior.
I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in confirming our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We continue to execute on the portfolio reinvestment plan that we adopted in the second half of 2009. We intend to reinvest about 80% to 85% of the approximately $15 billion in assets due to mature or paydown in 2010. Of the $7.3 billion that we purchased, $2.3 billion was due to replacing securities that we sold and $5 billion was due to securities maturing or paying down. We intend to continue to invest in highly rated agency mortgage-backed securities and highly rated asset-backed securities. We expect to invest the acquired customer deposits from the proposed acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business in euro-denominated sovereign government bonds and bank placements. We expect our net interest margin, including the impact of the Intesa acquisition, but excluding the conduit discount accretion, to be between 150 to 160 basis points on average for the year. We continue to expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 50 basis points for the rest of the year, and we continue to expect the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis points throughout the rest of the year, and we continue to expect the Feds to keep the overnight Fed funds rate at 25 basis point for all of 2010.
We further expect earning assets to increase between 6% and 8% from the average in 2009, primarily due to the expected acquisition of Intesa's Security Services business. We expect the S&P 500 to average about 1125 in 2010, up about 90% from 948 which was the average in 2009.
Lastly, I'll review our capital ratios.  In the first quarter, State Street Corp.'s capital ratios continued to improve, such that as of March 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 9.0%, up from 8.5%, and our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 18.1%, up from 17.7%. In the first quarter, we improved our TCE ratio from 6.6% at December 31, 2009, to 7.5% at March 31, 2010. The majority of this quarterly improvement came from price improvement in the investment portfolio and organic capital generation, and the resulting return on equity on an operating basis was 10%. We expect all of our capital ratios to continue to be strong, including following the anticipated acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business, expected to close later this quarter, pending regulatory approval and other closing conditions.
So, in conclusion, we believe we strengthened the company through our actions in 2009. This year, we expect to derive benefits from those actions and we remain highly focused on executing our plan.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks."

Fueling the achievement of these objectives, which include doubling our non-U.S. revenue over the next five years and expanding our market share, is a number of macro trends such as globalization, outsourcing, and consolidation.
We're well-positioned to take advantage of these trends and they're already driving our business today. The organic growth in our core business, combined with the impact of the two acquisitions, Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business and Mourant International Finance Administration, are expected to fuel our growth in 2010. As you may remember from our December announcements of these two transactions, we expected about $100 million in annualized revenues from Mourant and about $425 million in annualized revenue from Intesa Sanpaolo. In addition, we expect organic growth in the servicing side to continue from high growth areas such as alternative investment servicing and international markets. Our pipeline is strong, with the larger mandates expected to convert over the second half of 2010.
As I outlined earlier, our core business growth is also supported by our large wins announced last year that are still in the process of conversion. The asset management State Street Global Advisors continues to position itself to benefit from the increased demand from DC plans and ETF products.
So while we face some challenges in the short term, I believe we are calibrating the business within a slowly-improving environment in order to address these challenges, while positioning State Street for continued growth in the future. I look forward to meeting with many of you at our Investor and Analyst Forum, which is scheduled for May 5 in New York.
And now Ed and I are happy to take your questions."

In terms of the effect of rising rates, we're still in the same position that we've been in for a long time, which is that slowly rising rates benefit us, and by slowly rising again, we define that as 25 basis points a quarter on the Fed funds rate. Obviously, the way in which we -- the pace in which the rates increase, the shape of the curve and the path to get from where we are to where we end up is a huge determinant of what the ultimate NIR and NIM performance is. But our expectation is that if, in fact, rates slowly rise once the Fed stops increasing rates, we'd see a benefit to both NIR and NIM, all else equal."

I think the factors in this securities lending, we've talked about before, but it's important to repeat them.  One is the loan balances. You've seen the customers continue to support securities lending as a means to increase yield for their portfolios. We saw some pick up quarter-to-quarter on that. Second factor is the Fed funds, the three-month LIBOR rate. And while in the fourth quarter, we thought we had a trough, we were down a little bit lower, although recently, that ratio has come up close to 30 basis points. So we're seeing improvement on that.  I would say on the customer's risk profile, we haven't seen a lot of desire to go out and get more risky in the collateral reinvestments. And I assume, just an assumption, that over time as people get comfortable with some of the income generated from securities lending based on spreads widening out a bit, that you'll see over time some more risk taking. But it's hard to know where that's going to get, to although it does feel like we're once again at a trough."

In terms of the conduit, we still are of the view that about 2/3 of the discount accretion will come back in in the first five years subsequent to consolidation, so we're almost a year post consolidation. So that's still valid. And that's a proxy obviously for the maturities or the expected maturities of those conduit securities. The remaindering 1/3 will take a fair amount of time. I think you should be thinking about it in terms of seven, eight, nine years out, depending on the ultimate performance of the securities.  How we think about the sales of conduit securities is really twofold, Betsy. One, it's a question of market prices, and we've obviously had a pretty strong rally over the last couple of quarters in the fixed-income markets and we've seen some securities that we think have traded above what our view of fair value for them is. So they're a potential candidate. Secondly, we look at the securities and the conduit that are in that favorable position and decide whether or not the gain that we could generate is appropriate given the amount of foregone discount accretion that such a sale would generate. And in the first quarter, in total, as I've said, we gave up on discount $140 million of future-discount accretion and we booked $100 million, roughly, of gains on those securities. And we thought that on a net present value basis, that that made a lot of sense for us to do.  And, lastly, we look at it from a standpoint of risk reduction. The conduit securities, as you may recall, in general were of lower credit quality than the investment portfolio, still pretty high quality, but not up to the level of the investment portfolio. Some of those securities on a risk-reduction basis, we've decided to sell in the first quarter. So you put all three of those things together and that's how we think about it.  Going forward, it's hard to say. I mean we don't have any plans, as I said in response to an earlier question, to necessarily sell any legacy portfolio securities or conduit securities. It's episodic. It's based on the market events and our view of those credits and those securities at that time."

And I think if you play out the capital story, particularly in places like Europe, as capital levels are clarified with regard to the banking industry, I think you're likely to see more non-core custody businesses come up for sale. So I continue to believe that one good deployment of future capital will be acting on consolidation in the asset-servicing industry. We'd always look at that, assuming post insight from regulators that we had excess capital vis-a-vis share buybacks. So really those are the three dimensions. And I think dividend is a priority. I think acquisition is still an active part of our strategy, which I think will play out over the next several years, and share buyback is obviously the other alternative."

I think the confidence largely is anchored around the core business story. The core business, largely asset servicing, asset management, I think between the backlog of installations, the current period sales, which I referenced, just the $155 billion in assets that we have closed just this month, combined with our perspective view of pipeline, gives us good confidence in the momentum of the core business. Added to that, the acquisition both Mourant, which has closed, and Intesa, which we anticipate closing this quarter, give us good confidence and good sense that core revenues will run well through the course of the year. So that's really the anchor for confidence in the revenue line.  We also, Ed pointed out,  it's worth mentioning again, in a market-driven revenue securities finance and foreign exchange, we would expect some improvement in those lines towards the back end of the year based on -- in the case of foreign exchange, I think you can look to segments like mutual funds. As mutual fund investors move more towards equities and cross-border equities, we would expect to see some positive reflection in foreign exchange. In securities lending, we've seen some recent improvements in spreads.

I will begin with some general comments about our financial results and the operating environment as we begin 2010, and then I'll hand it over to Ed, who will provide a more detailed financial perspective. I will make some concluding remarks and then both of us will be happy to take your questions. 
The first quarter of 2010 represents a continuation of what we saw at the end of 2009, with the economy showing steady signs of recovery, the equity market showing signs of life, and a continuation of low levels of interest rates around the world. This environment provides good opportunity for our core fee-based businesses, but has continued to constrain our market-driven revenues, most notably net interest revenue, securities, finance and foreign exchange. 
During the quarter, we continued to build on a very strong capital position as evidenced by the capital ratios at quarter end with Tier 1 risk-based capital at 18.1%, our leverage ratio at 9% and our tangible common equity ratio at 7.5%.
Let me now walk through our results. I'll describe our operating basis results, which exclude discount accretion resulting from the consolidation of the conduits in the second quarter of 2009, as well as merger and integration costs. Our service fee and asset management fee revenue, or core revenue, increased in double digits compared to a year ago, when overall fee revenue increased 8%. These results were driven by the impact of rising equity market valuations, as well as business installations. 
Comparing the first quarter of 2010 with the fourth quarter of 2009, servicing fee revenue was nearly flat due to a stronger U.S. dollar and lower volumes, offset partially by new business and the impact of higher average equity valuations. Asset management fee revenue declined about 2%, due primarily to lower performance fees in the first quarter of 2010.
We're still installing a backlog of business we won in the second half of 2009 as well as new business one year to date in 2010. These conversions will take several quarters to install due to their size and complexity. Our operating basis earnings per share increased from $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $0.75 in the first quarter of 2010. Revenue growth of about 1.6% was balanced with tight cost discipline, resulting in expense growth of about 0.6%, resulting in 100 basis points of positive operating leverage. The credit markets continue to stabilize, contributing to the improvement in the unrealized after-tax losses in our investment portfolio, now at about $1.4 billion, down from $5.4 billion a year ago. We closed the Mourant acquisition in early April, a transaction which we believe makes us number one in the world in servicing alternative investment assets. We expect this acquisition to be slightly accretive to earnings this year, excluding merger and integration costs.
We expect to close the acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business later this quarter. Upon completion, this acquisition will firmly establish us as the leading servicer in Italy and enhances our already strong position in the offshore market of Luxembourg. We expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive to earnings this year, excluding merger and integration costs.
As we expected and noted on our fourth quarter call, we continue to experience weakness in market-driven revenues. Trading service revenue continues to be constrained as foreign exchange volatility has not improved nor have volumes compared with the fourth quarter. Cross-border trading is weak. In particular, cross-border equities have lagged the market recovery. Our securities finance business experienced slightly increased volumes compared with the previous quarter, with average loans outstanding of about $412 billion in the first quarter of 2010. However, we saw further compression in the spread between Fed funds and three month LIBOR from the end of the quarter, from 14 basis points to about 12 basis points as of March 31, 2010, which put additional pressure on securities finance revenues.
The continued low worldwide interest rate environment is also impacting our net interest revenue. On a fully tax equivalent basis, and excluding discount accretion, net interest revenue in the first quarter declined 18% from the first quarter of 2009 and was down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2009. These declines were primarily due to the effect of higher-yielding securities maturing, or paying down and being replaced with lower yielding assets.
Turning to new business. In the first quarter of 2010, we added $164 billion in assets to be serviced, and in April, this month to date, we won an additional $155 billion in assets, including a large investment manager operations outsourcing mandate from PineBridge Investments, as well as a very large win from the state pension fund. Within asset management, net customer cash flows, including customer wins and losses, were modestly negative. This decline, however, was more than offset by appreciation of assets under management with total assets under management remaining in excess of $1.9 trillion at March 31, 2010.
Taken together, these wins combined with the installation backlog from prior period sales, as well as continued pipeline strength, give us confidence in the ongoing growth of our core business in 2010. We continue to see growth in servicing for alternative asset management. This quarter, prior to our acquisition of Mourant, we added 12 new customers. As of March 31, 2010, our asset service in alternative investments have grown to $447 billion. With the early April acquisition of Mourant, they are now approximately $613 billion. 
Some of our investment servicing wins in the first quarter included the state of Ohio, who has awarded State Street three mandates to provide services for $23 billion in international assets in the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, the Ohio Police and Fire Pension System and the State Teachers Retirement System. Charles Schwab, a customer of State Street since 2005, has appointed State Street to service its newly launched family of exchange traded funds, with custody fund accounting, fund administration and transfer agent services. Wellington West Asset Management of Canada appointed State Street to provide a range of investment services, including fund accounting, fund administration, custody and trustee services for a group of new funds being launched by Wellington West. Legg Mason Global Asset Management expanded its relationship with State Street with the award of fund administration and custody services for its U.K. domiciled assets. And State Street has been retained by British Airways Pension Trustees, a client since 1997, to continue to service its 14 billion-pound U.K. pension fund.
State Street Global Advisors during the quarter added new mandates, including the Colorado Fire & Police Pension Association [Fire & Police Pension Association of Colorado] has hired State Street Global Advisors to handle a $450 million global equity mandate. An Australian state government pension fund awarded SSgA a $3.9 billion Aussie mandate across three index strategies managed on a tax-aware basis. And State Street was reconfirmed as one of AP7's passive managers, increasing assets managed from $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion.
Now turning to expenses. We continue to control headcount, only adding employees for new business and product development initiatives. In the current environment, we're highly focused on keeping a tight control over expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits expense reflect the level of incentive compensation consistent with our outlook for the year. In the first quarter of 2009, as part of our TCE improvement plan, we did not accrue for discretionary cash incentive compensation. As always, incentive compensation is subject to company performance.
Before I hand the call to Ed, let me make a few comments now on the broader economic environment. The U.S. economy does appear to be working its way through a slow or, some have termed, saucer-shaped recovery. Consumer confidence appears to be returning to the market. Unemployment has declined slightly during the past two quarters. Housing prices are beginning to stabilize. But the headwinds are still there. The absolute level of unemployment still remains at a high level and central banks around the world continue to maintain interest rates at low levels. The early indications of recovery, as evidenced by the rising markets, give us some confidence that the trend in market-driven revenue will begin to improve to more normalized levels later this year or early next year.
Let me now turn the call over to Ed who will provide further detail about our financial performance in the first quarter and provide comments reflecting our outlook for the remainder of 2010."

This morning, I will review three areas: First, the results of the first quarter; second, the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio and the overall performance of the portfolio, as well as our outlook for net interest margin in 2010; and third, a review of our strong capital position.
This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release. Comparing the first quarter of 2010 with the first quarter of 2009, servicing fee revenue increased 15% and management fee revenue was up 25%, primarily due to an increase in average equity market valuations as well as new business wins. Servicing fees declined slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due to a stronger U.S. dollar and lower volumes, offset partially by new business and higher daily average equity market valuations. Management fees declined compared to the fourth quarter due to lower performance fees in the first quarter of 2010. Market-driven revenue continues to be weak. Foreign exchange revenue declined compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to lower volatility, offset partially by higher volumes. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, foreign exchange revenue declined due to both lower volumes and lower volatility.
Brokerage and other revenue, which was reported as part of trading services, doubled when compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to higher revenue from electronic trading. Also in the first quarter of 2009, a lower valuation on several securities held in the trading account impacted revenue in that quarter negatively. It was down about 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, due primarily to lower revenue from transition management. We had $412 billion of average securities on loan in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $398 billion of securities in the first quarter of 2009 and $409 billion of securities in the fourth quarter.
Securities finance revenue declined from the relatively strong first quarter of 2009 by 60%. We continue to experience compression in spreads in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009.  The Fed funds-to-three month LIBOR spread at the end of the first quarter of 2009 was about 105 basis points, but it ended the first quarter of 2010 at approximately 12 basis points. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, we saw a continued compression, about two basis points from the 14 basis points at the end of the fourth quarter. Average lendable assets for the first quarter of 2010 were about $2.3 trillion, flat with the fourth quarter of 2009 and up about 34% from $1.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2009. As of March 31, 2010, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 21 days, down from 25 days in the fourth quarter of 2009, reflecting continued conservatism in the lenders investment guidelines.
While the quarter's results in foreign exchange and securities finance were not as strong as we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, our expectation is that volumes and volatilities in foreign exchange and spreads in securities lending will modestly improve through the remainder of 2010. 
Now for the remaining items in the income statement. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, processing and other fee revenue of $120 million increased 145% and doubled from the fourth quarter of 2009, both increases due primarily to a gain from an early buyout of a legacy leasing transaction and improved revenue from structured products. Operating basis net interest revenue declined about 18% from the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to the continuing impact of low interest rates worldwide and compressed spreads on our normalized balance sheet. Due to the strain caused by the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, our balance sheet contained abnormally high levels of customer deposits at the end of the first quarter of 2009.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, operating basis net interest revenue declined 4% due to lower yields on newly purchased securities that were replacing securities with higher yields that were maturing or paying down. Operating basis net interest margin of 162 basis points, which excludes discount accretion, was up one basis point from the fourth quarter of 2009 on the same basis. Including discount accretion of $212 million and $230 million respectively, net interest margin in the first quarter of 2010 was 234 basis points compared to 235 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
In the first quarter of 2010, we recorded about $192 million in net gains from sales of securities and separately, about $97 million OTTI, resulting in $95 million of net gains related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses in U.S. non-agency, mortgage-backed securities.  We sold securities during the quarter in order to take advantage of what we viewed as favorable valuations. The net gains from securities sold were approximately half from sales of about $2.9 billion in securities from the legacy investment portfolio. The other half of the gains were from sales of about $657 million from former conduit securities. The sales of the former conduit securities were executed due to both favorable valuations as well as to de-risk the balance sheet.
I'd like to recap where we are relative to future discount accretion. As of December 31, 2009, we expected about $4.6 billion to accrete into interest income all the remaining lives of the assets. We continue to believe that $850 million will not accrete into net interest revenue due to credit. There has been no change in our view relative to credit. We earned $212 million of discount accretion in the first quarter. The discount accretion that we will forego from the sales of conduit securities in the first quarter, on which we had a gain of approximately $100 million, is $140 million. And, lastly, future discount accretion is expected to decline by approximately $100 million due to the dollar strength in the first quarter. So as of March 31, 2010, we now have about $4.1 billion left to accrete through the income statement over the remaining lives of the assets. Also, we now expect about $800 million to accrete in 2010 and $600 million to accrete in 2011, down from our earlier expectations due to slower pre-payments, which account for about 50% of the declines, and foregone accretion on sales, which account for the other 50% of the decline.
As you are undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions go into the estimate of future discount accretion, including estimated prepayments, expected future credit losses across various asset classes, sales and an assumption that the securities are held to maturity.
Regarding operating basis expenses, first quarter expenses increased 22% compared to the first quarter of 2009 and increased 0.6% from the fourth quarter of 2009. The primary reason for the increase compared to the first quarter of 2009 was the 21% increase in salaries and benefits expenses due primarily to the accrual for incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2010 as well as increased benefit costs. Of course, the accrual of incentive compensation is subject to company performance. There was no discretionary cash incentive compensation accrued in the first quarter of 2009 in order to support our TCE improvement plan.
Salaries and benefits expense increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, the primary reason for the significant increase was the impact of prior year's equity awards. Another item affecting the increase in expenses in the first quarter comparison was the 71% increase in other expenses from a very low level in the first quarter of 2009. In that quarter, securities processing costs were abnormally low. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, other expenses declined 26% due to lower expenses following the cost of a legal settlement in the fourth quarter of 2009. Also, including other expenses in the first quarter of 2010, was a $25 million benefit for insurance recovery that we received.
Transaction processing increased $22 million or 17% compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to higher volumes in asset servicing. No other item in operating expenses increased or declined meaningfully either on a sequential quarter or year-over-year basis. 
Now let me turn that investment portfolio.
The size of the average investment portfolio in the first quarter increased about $25 billion to $94.8 billion compared to the first quarter of 2009. This increase is due primarily to the consolidation of the conduit assets in May 2009 with a fair value then of approximately $16.6 billion, as well as the continuing execution of our reinvestment strategy, offset partially by maturities and sales of selected securities.  During the first quarter, we invested about $7.3 billion in highly-rated securities at an average price of a 101.05 and with an average yield of 2.72% and a duration of approximately 2.34 years. Those $7.3 billion are primarily comprised of the following securities, 93% of which are rated AAA:  $3.4 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities; $2.9 billion in asset-backed securities, including about $1.3 billion of foreign RMBS, and about $500 million backed by credit card receivables; $700 million in student loans and $300 million in auto; $0.1 billion or $100 million in commercial mortgage-backed securities; and $900 million in corporate and municipal bonds.
The aggregate unrealized after-tax losses in our available-for-sale and held for maturity portfolios, as of March 31, 2010, were $1.4 billion, an improvement of about $4.4 billion or 75% from March 31, 2009, and an improvement of about $851 million or about 37% from December 31, 2009. These unrealized losses after tax have further improved through last Friday to approximately $1.1 billion. In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of March 31, 2010, our portfolio is 80.2% AAA or AA rated similar to December 31, 2009. The duration of the investment portfolio is about 1.27 years, down slightly from the fourth quarter as well as from the first quarter of 2009.
The increase in the number of downgrades from the fourth quarter resulted primarily from a continuing trend for downgrades in non-U.S. RMBS securities, as well as further reductions in rating subsequently to those already noted in earlier quarters. The amount of discount accretion included in net interest revenue in the first quarter was $212 million. Given the improved financial environment in the first quarter, we reduced our excess liquidity by about $3.9 billion. At period end, our excess liquidity totaled about $19 billion due principally to customer behavior.
I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in confirming our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We continue to execute on the portfolio reinvestment plan that we adopted in the second half of 2009. We intend to reinvest about 80% to 85% of the approximately $15 billion in assets due to mature or paydown in 2010. Of the $7.3 billion that we purchased, $2.3 billion was due to replacing securities that we sold and $5 billion was due to securities maturing or paying down. We intend to continue to invest in highly rated agency mortgage-backed securities and highly rated asset-backed securities. We expect to invest the acquired customer deposits from the proposed acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business in euro-denominated sovereign government bonds and bank placements. We expect our net interest margin, including the impact of the Intesa acquisition, but excluding the conduit discount accretion, to be between 150 to 160 basis points on average for the year. We continue to expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 50 basis points for the rest of the year, and we continue to expect the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis points throughout the rest of the year, and we continue to expect the Feds to keep the overnight Fed funds rate at 25 basis point for all of 2010.
We further expect earning assets to increase between 6% and 8% from the average in 2009, primarily due to the expected acquisition of Intesa's Security Services business. We expect the S&P 500 to average about 1125 in 2010, up about 90% from 948 which was the average in 2009.
Lastly, I'll review our capital ratios.  In the first quarter, State Street Corp.'s capital ratios continued to improve, such that as of March 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 9.0%, up from 8.5%, and our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 18.1%, up from 17.7%. In the first quarter, we improved our TCE ratio from 6.6% at December 31, 2009, to 7.5% at March 31, 2010. The majority of this quarterly improvement came from price improvement in the investment portfolio and organic capital generation, and the resulting return on equity on an operating basis was 10%. We expect all of our capital ratios to continue to be strong, including following the anticipated acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business, expected to close later this quarter, pending regulatory approval and other closing conditions. 
So, in conclusion, we believe we strengthened the company through our actions in 2009. This year, we expect to derive benefits from those actions and we remain highly focused on executing our plan. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks."

So while we remain committed to our long-term financial goals, we continue to believe 2010 will be a transition year, a year in which we transition to a more normalized environment. We continue to expect our 2010 operating basis earnings per share to be slightly above the $3.32 operating basis earnings per share in 2009. 
As I outlined for you in the fourth quarter call in January, I have established a series of objectives that support the achievement of our long-term financial goals of 8% to 12% growth in operating revenue, 10% to 15 growth in operating earnings per share, and the achievement of 14% to 17% operating return on equity. Fueling the achievement of these objectives, which include doubling our non-U.S. revenue over the next five years and expanding our market share, is a number of macro trends such as globalization, outsourcing, and consolidation.
We're well-positioned to take advantage of these trends and they're already driving our business today. The organic growth in our core business, combined with the impact of the two acquisitions, Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business and Mourant International Finance Administration, are expected to fuel our growth in 2010. As you may remember from our December announcements of these two transactions, we expected about $100 million in annualized revenues from Mourant and about $425 million in annualized revenue from Intesa Sanpaolo. In addition, we expect organic growth in the servicing side to continue from high growth areas such as alternative investment servicing and international markets. Our pipeline is strong, with the larger mandates expected to convert over the second half of 2010. 
As I outlined earlier, our core business growth is also supported by our large wins announced last year that are still in the process of conversion. The asset management State Street Global Advisors continues to position itself to benefit from the increased demand from DC plans and ETF products.
So while we face some challenges in the short term, I believe we are calibrating the business within a slowly-improving environment in order to address these challenges, while positioning State Street for continued growth in the future. I look forward to meeting with many of you at our Investor and Analyst Forum, which is scheduled for May 5 in New York. 
And now Ed and I are happy to take your questions."

You've seen the customers continue to support securities lending as a means to increase yield for their portfolios. We saw some pick up quarter-to-quarter on that. Second factor is the Fed funds, the three-month LIBOR rate. And while in the fourth quarter, we thought we had a trough, we were down a little bit lower, although recently, that ratio has come up close to 30 basis points. So we're seeing improvement on that.  I would say on the customer's risk profile, we haven't seen a lot of desire to go out and get more risky in the collateral reinvestments. And I assume, just an assumption, that over time as people get comfortable with some of the income generated from securities lending based on spreads widening out a bit, that you'll see over time some more risk taking. But it's hard to know where that's going to get, to although it does feel like we're once again at a trough."

In terms of the conduit, we still are of the view that about 2/3 of the discount accretion will come back in in the first five years subsequent to consolidation, so we're almost a year post consolidation. So that's still valid. And that's a proxy obviously for the maturities or the expected maturities of those conduit securities. The remaining 1/3 though will take a fair amount of time. I think you should be thinking about it in terms of seven, eight, nine years out, depending on the ultimate performance of the securities.  How we think about the sales of conduit securities is really twofold, Betsy. One, it's a question of market prices, and we've obviously had a pretty strong rally over the last couple of quarters in the fixed income markets and we've seen some securities that we think have traded above what our view of fair value for them is. So they're a potential candidate. Secondly, we look at the securities in the conduit that are in that favorable position and decide whether or not the gain that we could generate is appropriate given the amount of foregone discount accretion that such a sale would generate. And in the first quarter, in total, as I've said, we gave up on discount $140 million of future discount accretion and we booked $100 million roughly of gains on those securities. And we thought that on a net present value basis, that that made a lot of sense for us to do.  And, lastly, we look at it from a standpoint of risk reduction. The conduit securities, as you may recall, in general were of lower credit quality than the investment portfolio, still pretty high quality, but not up to the level of the investment portfolio. Some of those securities on a risk-reduction basis, we decided to sell in the first quarter. So you put all three of those things together and that's how we think about it.  Going forward, it's hard to say. I mean we don't have any plans, as I said in response to an earlier question, to necessarily sell any legacy portfolio securities or conduit securities. It's episodic. It's based on the market events and our view of those credits and those securities at that time."

And you've seen -- continue to see evidence of that, not just in our acquisitions, but in other acquisitions made within the industry. And I think if you play out the capital story, particularly in places like Europe, as capital levels are clarified with regard to the banking industry, I think you're likely to see more non-core custody businesses come up for sale. So I continue to believe that one good deployment of future capital will be acting on consolidation in the asset-servicing industry. We'd always look at that, assuming post insight from regulators that we had excess capital vis-a-vis share buybacks. So really those are the three dimensions. And I think dividend is a priority. I think acquisition is still an active part of our strategy, which I think will play out over the next several years, and share buyback is obviously the other alternative."

So given our position, I think we've talked about Legg Mason, for instance, moving their U.K. business to us.  So I think with consolidating positions with customers, a deeper level of outsourcing combined with continued robust activity outside of the U.S. and alternatives, which the alternative story is one of growth, but it's also one of, I think, some regulatory and client pressure pushing more alternative managers to outsource to a third party, all give us pretty good confidence that we're in a zone where there's quite a bit of activity going on.

188785,108800249,67885,"State Street Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-20-2010",2010-07-20,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kelley, and good morning.

In the second quarter, we continued to experience momentum in our servicing fee revenue and also saw good growth in our trading services revenue. Additionally, the impact from the Intesa and Mourant acquisitions, which closed during the quarter, supported our strong results. I'll make a few comments about our performance, and then I'll ask Ed to provide a more detailed financial perspective. And after that, we'll open up the call to your questions.
Operating basis earnings per share were $0.93, up 4% from a year-ago quarter and up 24% from the first quarter. On an operating basis, comparing the results of the second quarter with the first quarter of 2010, total revenue increased 2.2% and total expenses declined 6.3%. As a result, we achieved 850 basis points of positive operating leverage.
Our service fee revenue increased 20% from the second quarter of last year and was up 9% from the first quarter of this year, reflecting the impact of the installations of last year's large wins, as well as new business in the first half of 2010. We just completed installing the large Morgan Stanley mandate, which will be fully in the run rate for the third quarter, and we're just now converting the state of New Jersey and we'll convert the state of Ohio near the end of the third quarter. We added $1.1 trillion of new servicing mandates in the second quarter, including the two acquisitions, and have active new business pipelines with a particular emphasis outside of the U.S. in our alternative servicing area.
The acquisitions of Intesa Sanpaolo's Securities Services business and Mourant International Finance Administration are on track to meet our expectations for the year and contributed modestly to the quarter, excluding the merger and integration costs. I remind you that Intesa was only part of State Street for the second half of this quarter. The Intesa integration is proceeding as planned. We've already met our top of most of the major clients and have held town hall meetings with our new staff. We are pleased to be working for an organization that's focused on and intending to continue to invest in the business. The performance of our Asset Management business is fully in line with the worldwide equity markets as measured by an average of the three month-end values.
Trading services revenue in the quarter performed very well, helped by increased volatility in foreign exchange markets, as well as continued growth in electronic trading and transition management. The sequential quarter increase in securities finance revenue was principally due to the impact of the dividend season in Europe. As we disclosed on July 7, we made a one-time cash contribution to the SSgA lending fund, which restored the market-based net asset values to $1 per unit in those funds as of June 30, 2010, enabling us to remove redemption restrictions from those clients in mid-August and also mitigating potential liabilities.
We also expect to address client access to liquidity in the agency lending program by year-end by separating the agency lending collateral pools into two parts: One with complete liquidity and no redemption restrictions; and the other, comprised of longer-dated assets with continued restrictions on redemptions. We believe both of these actions support our commitment to resolving the challenges that remain as the result of the market turmoil over the past several years. As mentioned, we closed two acquisitions this quarter and continued to maintain strong capital ratios as evidenced by our Tier 1 risk-based capital of 15.1%, our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.7% and our tangible common equity ratio of 6.3%.
Regarding the financial reform legislation recently passed by Congress, at the outset, I would say that we don't believe the focus of this legislation was aimed at the activities of the trust and custody banks. And our initial read of the 2,300-page piece of legislation is, that it will not have a material effect on our business model and may, in fact, provide additional servicing opportunities.
Turning to new business, in the second quarter of 2010, we had $1.1 trillion in assets to be serviced, including $686 billion from the two acquisitions. Among the many encouraging themes I see in the new business pipeline, the servicing for alternative asset management remains a highlight. This quarter, following the acquisition of Mourant on April 1, we added 10 new clients. As of June 30, 2010, including the Mourant acquisition, our asset service in alternative investments have grown to approximately $620 billion from the $440 billion at year-end 2010.
In the Broader Investment Servicing business, we continue to see strong growth. A few of the highlights are as follows. State Street was appointed to provide global custody, fund accounting, compliance reporting services, foreign exchange and portfolio research and trading solutions to the Guotai Nasdaq-100 Index Fund, the first fund in China to track the performance of an overseas index. We've been selected to provide a range of hedge fund administration services for approximately $8 billion in assets, managed by anchorage advisors. We were also appointed to provide investment services to hedge fund group Marshall Wace for its new equity-neutral exchange traded fund, which is listed in the London and Frankfurt Stock Exchanges.
State Street received a mandate to service investments managed by Norges Bank for up to 5% of the government pension fund investing in real estate, which is currently valued at around $20 billion. London-based strategic investments group has appointed State Street to provide custody fund administration and currency management services to its new UCITS III absolute return multi-manager fund. And the Contra Costa County Employees’ Retirement Association of California has appointed us as a transition manager for a $4.3 billion fund.
State Street Global Advisors during the quarter also added new mandates including the appointment by PreviAmbiente to manage 50 billion euro in pension fund assets, an Italian public employee fund which has 380 billion in assets under management. SSgA was selected as one of four investment managers for AllianceBernstein's newly launched Multimanager Retirement Strategies, a target-date solution fund. We were also awarded three large passive equity tax-aware mandates totaling AUS $10 billion by QSuper, one of Australia's largest superannuation funds. We won a passive core fixed income mandate for the Illinois State Universities Retirement System's fixed income portfolio. The System has informed us that the mandate could range from $400 million to $700 million.
We've also been selected by Pegaso pension fund of Italy, a public pension scheme from employees Italian gas and electric utilities, to manage more than EUR 60 million in active fixed-income assets. And lastly, SSgA was recently appointed as the beta management partner for San Diego County Employees Retirement System.
Now turning to expenses, in the current environment, we're very focused on keeping tight control over all categories of expenses. The decline in salaries and benefits expense compared to the first quarter is primarily due to the lower incentive compensation accrued in the quarter, a result of the charge related to securities lending. Let me now share our view of the current economic outlook and the outlook for our business.
Although we continue to believe the economy in the U.S. is improving, it is recovering at a slow protracted rate and is affected by uncertainty in Europe. The market is forecasting real annualized GDP growth in the United States of 2.5% to 3% for each of the remaining quarters of 2010. Economic growth is not enough, not strong enough to drive meaningful gains in employment, credit is tight and the housing sector appears to have bottomed at [indiscernible] levels, but is very mixed by region. Consumer spending has also been cautious.
The daily average of the S&P 500 as of June 30, 2010, is about 11.29% year-to-date. And as you recall, our outlook for this is based on 11.25% average for the year. We are participating on this gradual recovery, especially as seen in the continued momentum in servicing fees. We continue to expect to see growth in fee revenue and expect that with a gradual recovery, the market-driven revenue will improve slightly towards the end of the year.
I'll turn the call over to Ed who will provide further detail about our financial performance in the second quarter, and I'll return to provide several comments [ph], reflecting our outlook for the remainder of 2010. And then we'll open the call up for questions. Ed?"
188785,108800249,67885,"State Street Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-20-2010",2010-07-20,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review three areas: First, the results of the second quarter; second, the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio and the overall performance of the portfolio, as well",2188,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review three areas: First, the results of the second quarter; second, the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio and the overall performance of the portfolio, as well as our outlook for net interest margin in 2010; and third, a review of our strong capital position.
This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating-basis results as defined in today's earnings news release. Comparing the second quarter of 2010 with the second quarter of 2009, servicing fees were up 20% due to [ph] new business and increased average equity valuations and the impact of our two acquisitions. Management fee revenue was up 12% primarily due to increase in equity market valuations, as well as new business wins. Compared to the first quarter, our Servicing fee revenue increased by 9%, Trading Services revenue by 35%, Securities Finance revenue by 51%, and operating-basis net interest revenue was up 7%.
Providing further details on the Trading Services and Securities Finance revenue, Foreign Exchange revenue declined 3% compared to the second quarter of 2009 due to lower volatility, offset partially by higher volumes. Compared to the first quarter of 2010, Foreign Exchange revenue increased 38% due to both higher volatility and higher volumes. Brokerage and Other revenue, which is reported as part of Trading Services, increased 18% compared to the second quarter of 2009 and was up 31% compared to the first quarter of 2010, with both increases primarily due to higher revenue from electronic trading and transition management.
We averaged $421 billion of securities on loan in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $418 billion in the second quarter of 2009 and $412 billion for the first quarter of this year. The improvement in Securities Finance revenue compared to the first quarter was primarily due to the impact of the dividend season and also benefited from the increase in the average spread between fed funds and 3-month LIBOR. This average spread widened to 24 basis points in the second quarter of 2010 from an average of 12 basis points in the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2009, which also was favorably impacted by the dividend season, revenue declined due to compression in average spread from a year ago when the average spread between fed funds and 3-month LIBOR was approximately 67 basis points.
Average lendable assets for the second quarter of 2010 were about $2.2 trillion, down slightly from $2.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2010 and up about 16% from $1.9 trillion in the second quarter of 2009. As of June 30, 2010, the duration of the Securities Finance book was approximately 17 days, down from 21 days in the first quarter of 2010 and down from 25 days in the second quarter of 2009.
Now for the remaining items in the income statement. Compared to the first quarter of 2010, processing and other fee revenue of $87 million decreased 28% or about $33 million due primarily to the impact of the $30 million gain on the buyout of a legacy leasing transaction in the first quarter and was up significantly from the second quarter of 2009 due to the impact of higher fees from structured products, tax advantage investments and other fees in the second quarter of 2010. Operating-basis net interest revenue increased about 4% from the second quarter of 2009 due to the impact of adding the Intesa deposits and a modest decrease in our funding costs. Operating-basis net interest revenue was up 7% from the first quarter of 2010 primarily due to favorable yields on our investment portfolio, the steeper short end of the yield curve and the impact of the Intesa deposits.
Operating-basis net interest margin of 166 basis points, which excludes discount accretion, was up nine basis points from the second quarter of 2009 and was up four basis points from the first quarter of 2010. Including discount accretion of $172 million in the second quarter of 2010, $212 million in the first quarter of 2010 and $112 million in the second quarter of 2009, net interest margin was 221 basis points compared to 234 basis points and 193 basis points, respectively. In the second quarter of 2010, we recorded about $3 million in net gains from sales of available-for-sale securities and separately, about $53 million of OTTI [other-than-temporary impairment], resulting in $50 million net loss related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses on U.S. non-agency mortgage-backed securities.
To recap where we are relative to future discount accretion, as of March 31, 2010, we expected about $4.1 billion to accrete into interest income over the remaining lives of the assets. And so now, deducting the $172 million of discount accretion we recorded in the second quarter of 2010, we now expect about $3.9 billion. We continue to believe that $850 million will not accrete into net interest revenue due to credit. There has been no change in our view relative to credit. Based on the slowing in prepayment speeds, we now expect about $750 million to accrete into income in 2010, $550 million in 2011 compared to the $800 million and $600 million, respectively, that I mentioned on the first quarter conference call. 
As you are undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions go into the estimate of future discount accretion, including estimated prepayments, expected future credit losses across various asset classes, sales to date and an assumption that the securities are held to maturity.
Regarding operating-basis expenses, second quarter expenses increased 9% compared to the second quarter of 2009 due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits, offset partially by a decline in other expenses. The 19% increase in salaries and benefits expenses was due primarily to the accrual for incentive compensation in the second quarter of 2010, as well as the impact of our acquisitions. There was no discretionary cash incentive compensation accrued in the second quarter of 2009 in order to support our tangible common equity improvement plan. Of course, the accrual of incentive compensation is subject to company performance.
Other expenses declined 16% from the second quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower securities processing costs and an $11 million recovery associated with Lehman Brothers. Expenses in the second quarter of 2010 declined 6.3% from the first quarter of 2010 due to both a decline in salaries and benefits, as well as a decline in other expenses.
Salaries and benefits expense decreased 6% for the first quarter of 2010 primarily due to the impact on the incentive compensation accrual of the charge recorded in the second quarter related to the securities lending program, as well as the impact of first quarter equity awards made to retirement-eligible employees, offset partially by the increases due to the acquisitions, as well as merit and promotion awards. Other expenses declined 24% from the first quarter of 2010 due to lower securities processing costs and an $11 million recovery related to Lehman Brothers. Transaction processing expenses increased $18 million or 12% compared to the second quarter of 2009 and were up 7% from the first quarter of 2010, both increases due to higher volumes in asset servicing including the impact of two acquisitions. No other item in operating expenses increased or declined meaningfully, either on a sequential quarter or year-over-year basis.
Our negative GAAP tax rate of 23.1% in the second quarter was the result of a one-time tax benefit generated by a restructuring of non-U.S. former conduit assets. In addition to some regulatory benefits, the restructuring triggered a current tax deduction for losses that were recognized for accounting purposes at the time of the 2009 conduit consolidation. Our operating tax rate, which excludes this GAAP adjustment is 29.1% in line with the outlook from the first quarter call and down from 31.5% in the second quarter of 2009 due to a change in the geographic mix of our earnings.
Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The average balance in our investment portfolio in the second quarter increased about $19.8 billion from $5.3 billion [ph] compared to the second quarter of 2009. This increase is due primarily to the consolidation of the conduit assets [indiscernible] fair value, then approximately $15.6 billion [ph], as well as the continuing execution of our reinvestment strategy, offset partially by maturities and sales of selected securities. 
During the second quarter, we invested about $9.8 billion in highly-rated securities at an average price of about $1.25 [ph], with an average yield of 2.98% and a duration of approximately 2.5 years. Those $9.8 billion are primarily comprised of the following securities, 91% of which are AAA-rated: $5.4 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities; $0.2 billion in non-agency mortgage-backed securities; $2.8 billion in asset-backed securities, including $0.8 billion in foreign RMBS, mostly U.K. and Dutch issues, at about $1.2 billion in student loans, $0.6 billion by credit card receivables and about $0.1 billion each in auto and CLOs. Unfortunately [ph], we invested in $0.4 billion in the mortgage-backed securities and about $1.0 billion in corporate and municipal bonds. The aggregate net unrealized after-tax losses in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of June 30, 2010, were $994 million, a $441 million or 31% improvement from the first quarter of 2010, an improvement of about $3.8 billion or 79% from June 30, 2009 and an improvement of about $5.3 billion or 84% from December 31, 2008.
As of last Friday, the net unrealized loss of  $822 million, an improvement of about 17% from June 30, 2010. In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of June 30, 2010, our portfolio is 82.3% AAA or AA-rated. The duration of the investment portfolio is about 1.28 years, roughly flat with the first quarter, as well as from the second quarter of 2009. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet  as of June 30, 2010, is 0.34 years, up from 0.31 years at March 31, 2010. The number of downgrades increased from the first quarter primarily from a continuing trend for downgrades in the U.S. asset-backed securities.
I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in arriving at our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We intend to reinvest about 80% to 85% of the approximately $15 billion in total securities due to mature or pay down in 2010. We expect to continue to invest in highly-rated agency mortgage-backed securities and highly-rated asset-backed securities. Following the acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Securities Services business, we adjusted our investment strategy given the uncertainty in Europe. 
We decided to leave the acquired customer deposits, primarily in the ECB, as we continue to monitor market conditions in the eurozone. Additionally, to protect us against the possibility of sustained lower rates, we adjusted the composition of our U.S. Treasury portfolio this quarter, increasing our interest rate risk position modestly, which was offset by other factors. As a result of this decision, as well as reflecting the strength of the first half of 2010, we now expect a higher net interest margin including the impact of the Intesa acquisition, but excluding the conduit discount accretion. I'll [ph] expect the net interest margin to be between 155 and 165 basis points on average for the year, an increase of five basis points from our earlier guidance.
We have seen a steeper yield curve at the short end, which is zero to three months, than we had assumed in our initial outlook. Also, we expect to have a slightly smaller average balance sheet for the year than what we may have originally given [ph]. We now expect earning assets to increase between 2% and 3% from the average of 2009, down from our earlier outlook of 6% to 8% increase. We continue to expect the Bank of England rates to remain at 50 basis points for the rest of the year. We continue to expect the ECB to remain at 100 basis points throughout the rest of the year, and we continue to expect the Fed to keep the overnight fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2010. We expect the S&P 500 to average about 11.25 in 2010, up about 19% from 9.48%, the average in 2009. 
Lastly, I'll briefly review our capital ratios. In the second quarter, State Street Corp.'s capital ratios remain strong after getting a bunch of [ph] acquisitions. As of June 30, 2010, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 7.7%, our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 15.1%, and our tangible common equity ratio was 6.3% after taking into account the impact of the acquisitions. 
So in conclusion, we're pleased with our operating-basis results for the second quarter. While we expect our quarterly results to decline somewhat from the seasonally strong level of the second quarter, we continue to expect our operating-basis earnings per share for the year to be slightly above the $3.32 level of 2009. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jay to conclude our remarks."

The results for the second quarter confirm our confidence in our full year outlook, as well as our expectation that servicing revenues in the second half of the year will be stronger than the first half. This outlook is based on the contribution of the acquisitions, as well as the expected conversion of client wins from the first half of 2010 that will contribute to service fee revenue, as well as several value-added services. 
As I mentioned, the acquisitions are proceeding in line with expectations. The performance of Intesa in the second half of the quarter gives us confidence in our outlook for 2010. The acquisition of Mourant also has given us traction in adding clients through our Alternative Investment Servicing business.
In Asset Management, State Street Global Advisors continues to position itself to benefit from the increased demand from passive strategies in growth and defined contribution plans in ETF investments. 
Overall, I'm pleased with the performance in the second quarter and encouraged that in spite of challenging markets, our product and services continue to be in demand across the broad spectrum of institutions we serve. The growth of our core business and the momentum we have built in the first half of the year reinforce our confidence in achieving operating-basis earnings per share slightly above the operating basis level of $3.32 in 2009.

If you look at the $1.1 trillion in new commitments in this quarter and net out the two acquisitions, I think there's $415 billion or so of new commitments unrelated to acquisitions in the quarter. I think if you go back two or three quarters, I think in the fourth quarter of last year, we started to pick up some momentum that continued for the first and the second quarter. The tendency of these deals recently is they tend to be bigger. They tend to be, as a result, a little bit more lumpy from an implementation standpoint. The Morgan Stanley commitment took a couple of quarters to get implemented. So I think hard to dimension specifically, but if you looked at on an ongoing, there's probably a two or three-quarter lag. When we talk about the $415 billion that hit in the second quarter, I would guess 2/3 of that gets implemented in the second half of the year and then the first quarter of next year, it gets completed. So a two- or three-quarter lag is generally probably the best guidance I can give you on that."

I would say that a good deal of the wins, and you almost have a look at it by segment if you look at the alternatives as a segment or if you could look at the middle office as a segment. The wins are coming from in-house installations. So I think part of the answer is it represents an expansion of the market, so it's not coming from traditional competitors. In the alternative segment, it's driving a good deal of our growth. That's a factor. In some of the large outsourcing deals where middle office is a factor, that's also a factor. So I'd say some of the answer [indiscernible]. The pie is expanding. And on another part of the answer, I think is that, I think that the disproportionate share of new mandates is going to the bigger players. You look at some of the boutique providers in different aspects of the investor servicing world. I think there's greater comfort in the bigger, larger-scale players that have a global footprint. So I think if you put those things together, it could explain part of why the growth is occurring on multiple fronts. We do believe, having said that, that we're getting more than our share. If you look at the middle office, which a lot of these big deals, Morgan Stanley being one, I would just highlight, back at the Investor Day, I highlighted some industry data which had us in excess of 50% market share in the middle office, also by far the leading provider on alternatives. So I think head-to-head, we feel good about our performance but I'd also make the point that the pie is expanding."

One is in the pure trading space, we've seen for several quarters now steady growth in our electronic trading. So between Currenex and FX connect the electronic element of trading has, I think across the industry, continued to take share. We're participating on that. The other thing I would highlight is the point Ed made earlier which is transition management, which is a brokerage activity that's a byproduct of an institution that changes their asset allocation. As they change asset allocation, transition managers often invoke to help transition the portfolio from, say, a fixed income to equity or would in the equity asset classes. In 2009, I would say the movement of assets based on new allocation strategies was constrained, and we've seen in the past several quarters that seems to be loosening up. So transition management begets brokerage. And given our position with the institutional world, I think we're pretty well-positioned to continue to see transition management growth."

And just sort of very simple way, I have traditionally thought about servicing business as it -- servicing assets have grown relatively in line with servicing revenues. This quarter obviously challenges that view and congratulations on hitting kind of your guidance. But I guess as we look forward, and that middle office functionality seems to be far more profitable and that historical relationship of assets not necessarily growing the same amount of servicing revenue, how would you think that historical relationship over the coming quarters and years would progress, given the mix of business maybe towards more service-oriented outsourcing function that may provide a revenue growth outside just traditional asset growth? I was wondering if you could kind of at least frame that theme for me."

More recently, collateral management has been a big theme, derivatives processing. So as you know, from the past, most years 70% of our incremental revenue comes from our existing customers. Oftentimes, there's an anchor relationship around custody, but a lot of the servicing fee revenue emanates from those cross-sell products that can be middle office or other reporting or trading activities. So I don't think anything has changed. We continue to pursue custody-based books of business but we're also generating pretty good growth by cross-selling not only the products we have but continuing to develop a new series or products to meet today's needs."

The thesis was that if you look at the trust and custody space and you look at the European markets, there are still quite a few. I think we said eight to 10 or 12 custodians, I would argue sub-scale custodians, in Europe tied to bigger banks. The thesis was that as banks look to potentially raise capital or potentially look to shed non-core businesses that we would have an opportunity to take advantage of that. The Intesa acquisition, which we closed in the second quarter, is symptomatic of what you might see, which is a large bank that has a small footprint in the custody space, might look to exit that in the case of Intesa if we were fortunate enough to buy it. So I think our view back in May still stands. And in fact, there's probably an even stronger view when you consider what the European banks are going through, the stress test and the like and the greater likelihood that they would conclude that the sub-scale custody businesses is in a long-term business flow."

In the second quarter, we continued to experience momentum in our Servicing Fee revenue and also saw good growth in our Trading Services revenue. Additionally, the impact on the Intesa and Mourant acquisitions, which closed during the quarter, supported our strong results. I'll make a few comments about our performance, and then I'll ask Ed to provide a more detailed financial perspective. And after that, we'll open up the call to your questions.
Operating basis, earnings per share were $0.93, up 4% from a year-ago quarter and up 24% from the first quarter. On an operating basis, comparing the results of the second quarter with the first quarter of 2010, total revenue increased 2.2% and total expenses declined 6.3%. As a result, we achieved 850 basis points of positive operating leverage. 
Our Service Fee revenue increased 20% from the second quarter of last year, and it was up 9% from the first quarter of this year, reflecting the impact of the installations of last year's large wins, as well as new business in the first half of 2010. We just completed installing the large Morgan Stanley mandate, which will be fully in the run rate for the third quarter, and we're just now converting the state of New Jersey and we'll convert the state of Ohio near the end of the third quarter. We added 1.1 trillion of new servicing mandates in the second quarter, including the two acquisitions and have active new business pipelines, with a particular emphasis outside of the U.S. and in our alternative servicing area. 
The acquisitions of Intesa Sanpaolo security services business and Mourant International Finance Administration are on track to meet our expectations for the year and contributed modestly to the quarter, excluding the merger and integration costs. I remind you that Intesa was only part of the State Street for the second half of this quarter. 
The Intesa integration is proceeding as planned. We've already met or talked with most of the major clients in the town hall meetings with our new staff. We're pleased to be working for an organization that is focused on and intending to continue to invest in the business.
The performance of our asset management business is fully in line with the worldwide equity markets, as measured by an average of the three-month end values. Trading Services revenue on the quarter performed very well, helped by increased volatility in foreign exchange markets, as well as continued growth in electronic trading and transition management. 
The sequential quarter increase in Securities Finance revenue was principally due to the impact of the dividends season in Europe. As we disclosed on July 7, we made a one-time cash contribution to the SSgA lending fund, which restored the market-based net asset values to $1 per unit in those funds as of June 30, 2010, enabling us to remove redemption restrictions from those clients in mid-August and also mitigating potential liabilities. We also expect to address client access to liquidity in the agency lending program by year-end, by separating the agency lending collateral pools into two parts. One with complete liquidity and no redemption restrictions and the other comprised of longer-dated assets with continued restrictions on redemptions. We believe both of these actions support our commitment to resolving the challenges that remain as a result of the market turmoil over the past several years.
As mentioned, we closed two acquisitions this quarter and continue to maintain strong capital ratios, as evidenced by our Tier 1 risk-based capital of 15.1%, our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.7% and our tangible common equity ratio of 6.3%. Regarding the financial reform legislation recently passed by Congress, at the outset, I would say that we don't believe the focus of this legislation was aimed at the activities of the trust and custody banks. And our initial read of the 2,300-page piece of legislation is that it will not have a material effect on our business model and may, in fact, provide additional servicing opportunities.
Turning to new business. In the second quarter of 2010, we have $1.1 trillion in assets to be serviced, including $686 billion from the two acquisitions. Among the many encouraging themes I see on the new business pipeline, the servicing for alternative asset management remains a highlight. This quarter, following the acquisition of Mourant on April 1, we added 10 new clients. As of June 30, 2010, including the Mourant acquisition, our asset service and alternative investments have grown to approximately $620 billion from the $440 billion at year-end 2010.
In the broader Investment Servicing business, we continue to see strong growth. A few of the highlights are as follows: State Street was appointed to provide global custody, fund accounting, compliance reporting services, foreign exchange and portfolio research and trading solutions to Guotai Nasdaq-100 Index Fund, the first fund in China to track the performance of an overseas index. 
We've been selected to provide a range of hedge fund administration services for approximately $8 billion in assets, managed by Anchorage Advisors. We're also appointed to provide investment services to hedge fund group, Marshall Wace, for its new equity-neutral exchange traded fund, which is listed in the London and Frankford stock exchanges.
State Street received a mandate to service investments managed by Norges Bank for up to 5% of the government pension fund investing in real estate, which is currently valued at around $20 billion. London-based Strategic Investments Group has appointed State Street to provide custody fund administration and currency management services to its new UCITS III, absolute return multimanager fund. And the Contra Costa County Employees' Retirement Association of California has appointed us as a transition manager for a $4.3 billion fund. 
State Street Global Advisors during the quarter also added new mandates, including the appointment by PreviAmbiente to manage EUR 50 billion in pension fund assets, an Italian public employee fund, which has 380 billion in assets under management.
SSgA was selected as one of four managers for AllianceBernstein's newly launched Multimanager Retirement Strategies, a target-date solution fund. We were also awarded three large passes equity tax aware mandates totaling AUD 10 billion by QSuper, one of Austria's largest superannuation fund. We want to pass the core fixed income mandates for the Illinois State Universities Retirement System's fixed income portfolio. The System has informed us that the mandate could range from $400 million to $700 million.We've also been selected by Pegaso Pension Fund of Italy, a public pension scheme for employees of Italian gas and electric utilities, to manage more than EUR 60 million in active fixed income assets. And lastly, SSgA was recently appointed as the beta management partner for San Diego County Employees Retirement Systems.
Now turning to expenses. In the current environment, we're very focused on keeping tight control over all categories of expenses. The decline in salaries and benefits expense compared to the first quarter is primarily due to the lower incentive compensation accrued in the quarter, a result of the charge related to securities lending. 
Let me now share our view of the current economic outlook and the outlook for our business.  Although we continue to believe the economy in the U.S. is improving, it is recovering at a slow protracted rate and is affected by uncertainty in Europe. The market is forecasting real annualized GDP growth in the United States of 2.5% to 3% for each of the remaining quarters of 2010. Economic growth is not enough, not strong enough to drive meaningful gains in employment, credit is tight and the housing sector appears to have bottomed at the peak levels, but is very mixed by region. Consumer spending has also been cautious. The daily average of the S&P 500 as of June 30, 2010, is above 1129 year-to-date. And as you recall, our outlook for this is based on 1125 average for the year.
We are participating in this gradual recovery, especially as seen in the continued momentum in servicing fees. We continue to expect to see growth in Fee revenue and expect that with the gradual recovery, the market-driven revenue will improve slightly towards the end of the year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will provide further detail about our financial performance in the second quarter, and I'll return to provide several points reflecting our outlook for the remainder of 2010. And then we'll open the call up for questions. Ed?"

This morning, I'll review three areas: First, the results of the second quarter; second, the improvement in the unrealized losses in the investment portfolio and the overall performance of the portfolio, as well as our outlook for gross margin in 2010; and third, a review of our strong capital position.
This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results, as defined in today's earnings news release. 
Comparing the second quarter of 2010 with the second quarter of 2009, Servicing Fee revenue increased 20% and increased average equity valuations, as well as our two acquisitions. Management Fee revenue was up 12%, primarily due to increase in equity market valuations, as well as new customer wins. Compared to the first quarter, our Servicing Fee revenue increased by 9%, Trading Services revenue by 35%; Securities Finance revenue by 51%, and operating basis net interest revenue was up 7%.
Providing further details on the Trading Services and Securities Finance revenue. Foreign Exchange revenue declined 3% compared to the second quarter of 2009 due to lower volatility, offset partially by higher volumes. Compared to the first quarter of 2010, Foreign Exchange revenue increased 38% due to both higher volatility and higher volumes. Brokerage and other revenue, which is reported as part of Trading Services, increased 18% compared to the second quarter of 2009 and was up 31% compared to the first quarter of 2010, with both increases primarily due to higher revenue from electronic trading and transition management.
We average $421 billion of securities on loan in the second quarter of 2010, compared with $418 billion in the second quarter of 2009 and $412 billion for the first quarter of this year.  The improvement in Securities Finance revenue compared to the first quarter was primarily due to the impact of the dividend season and also benefited from the increase in the average spread between fed funds and three-month LIBOR. This average spread widened to 24 basis points in the second quarter of 2010, from an average of 12 basis points in the first quarter compared to the second quarter of 2009, which also was favorably impacted by the dividend season. Revenue declined due to the compression in average spreads from a year ago, when the average spread between fed funds and three-month LIBOR was approximately 67 basis points.
Average lendable assets for the second quarter of 2010 were about $2.2 trillion, down slightly from $2.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2010 and up about 16% from $1.9 trillion in the second quarter of 2009. As of June 30, 2010, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 17 days, down from 21 days in the first quarter of 2010 and down from 25 days in the second quarter of 2009.
Now for the remaining items in the income statement. Compared to the first quarter of 2010, Processing and Other Fee revenue of $87 million decreased 28% or about $33 million due primarily to the impact of the $30 million gain on the buyout of a legacy leasing transaction in the first quarter and was up significantly from the second quarter of 2009, due to the impact of higher fees from structured products, tax advantage investments and another fees in the second quarter of 2010. 
Operating basis net interest revenue increased about 4% from the second quarter of 2009, due to the impact of adding Intesa deposits and a modest decrease in our funding costs. Operating basis net interest revenue was up 7% from the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to favorable yields on our investment portfolio, the steeper short end of the yield curve and the impact of the Intesa deposits.
Operating basis net interest margin of 166 basis points, which excludes discount accretion, was up 9 basis points from the second quarter of 2009 and was up 4 basis points from the first quarter of 2010. Including discount accretion of $172 million in the second quarter of 2010, $212 million in the first quarter of 2010 and $112 million in the second quarter of 2009, net interest margin was 221 basis points compared to 234 basis points and 193 basis points, respectively.
In the second quarter of 2010, we recorded about $3 million in net gains from sales of available-for-sale securities. And separately, about $53 million of OTTI, resulting in a $50 million net loss related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses on U.S. non-agency, mortgage-backed securities.
To recap where we are relative to future discount accretion, as of March 31, 2010, we expected about $4.1 billion to accrete into interest income over the remaining lives of the assets. And so now, deducting the $172 million of discount accretion we recorded in the second quarter of 2010, we now expect about $3.9 billion. We continue to believe that $850 million will not accrete into net interest revenue due to credit. There has been no change in our view relative to credit. Based on the slowing in prepayment speeds, we next about $750 million to accrete into income in 2010, $550 million in 2011, compared to the $800 million and $600 million, respectively, that I mentioned on the first quarter conference call.
As you're undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions go into the estimate of future discount accretion, including estimated prepayments, expected future credit losses across various asset classes, sales to date and an assumption that the securities are held to maturity.
Regarding operating basis expenses. Second quarter expenses increased 9% compared to the second quarter of 2009 due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits offset partially by a decline in other expenses. The 19% increase in salaries and benefits expenses was due primarily to the accrual for incentive compensation in the second quarter of 2010, as well as the impact of our acquisitions. 
There was no discretionary cash incentive compensation accrued in the second quarter of 2009 in order to support our tangible common equity improvement plan. Of course, the accrual of incentive compensation is subject to company performance.
Other expenses declined 16% from the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to lower securities processing costs and an $11 million recovery associated with Lehman Brothers. Expenses in the second quarter of 2010 declined 6.3% from the first quarter of 2010, due to both a decline in salaries and benefits, as well as a decline in other expenses.
Salaries and benefits expense decreased 6% from the first quarter of 2010, primarily to the impact on the incentive compensation accrual of the charge recorded in the second quarter related to the securities lending program, as well as the impact of first quarter equity awards made to retirement-eligible employees, offset partially by the increases due to the acquisitions, as well as merit and promotion awards. Other expenses declined 24% up from the first quarter 2010 due to lower securities processing costs and an $11 million recovery related to the Lehman Brothers.
Transaction processing expenses increased $18 million or 12% compared to the second quarter of 2009 and were up 7% from the first quarter 2010, both increases due to higher volumes in asset servicing, including the impact of the two acquisitions. No other item in operating expenses increased or declined meaningfully, either on a sequential quarter or year-over-year basis.
Our negative GAAP tax rate of 23.1% in the second quarter was the result of a one-time tax benefit generated by a restructuring of non-U.S. former conduit assets. In addition to some regulatory benefits, the restructuring triggered a current tax deduction for losses that were recognized for accounting purposes at the time of the 2009 conduit consolidation. Our operating tax rate, which excludes this GAAP adjustment is 22%, in line with our outlook for the first quarter fall and down from 31.5% in the second quarter of 2009, due to a change in the geographic mix of our earnings.
Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. The average balance in our investment portfolio in the second quarter increased about $19.8 billion to $83.5 billion compared to the second quarter of 2009. This increase is due primarily to the consolidation of the conduit assets in May 2009, with a fair value then of approximately $16.6 billion, as well as the continuing execution of our reinvestment strategy, offset partially by maturities and sales of selected securities.
During the second quarter, we invested about $9.8 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of $1.25, with an average yield of 2.98% and a duration of approximately 2.5 years. Those $9.8 billion are primarily comprised of the following securities, 91% of which are AAA-rated: $5.5 billion agency mortgage-backed securities; $0.2 billion in non-agency mortgage-backed securities; $2.8 billion in asset-backed securities, including $0.8 billion foreign RMBS, mostly U.K. and Dutch issues and about $1.2 billion in student loans; $0.6 billion by credit card receivables; and about $0.1 billion each in Auto and CLOs. Transactionally, we invested in $0.4 billion in mortgage-backed securities and about $1.0 billion in corporate and municipal bonds.
The aggregate net unrealized after-tax losses in our available-for-sale and held-for-maturity portfolios as of June 30, 2010, were $994 million, a $441 billion or 31% improvement from the first quarter of 2010, an improvement of about $3.8 billion or 79% from June 30, 2009, an improvement of about $5.3 billion or 84% from December 31, 2008. As of last Friday, the net unrealized loss of $822 million, an improvement of about 17% from June 30, 2010. In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of June 30, 2010, our portfolio is 82.3% AAA or AA rating. The duration of the investment portfolio is about 1.28 years, roughly flat with the first quarter, as well as from the second quarter of 2009.
The duration gap of the entire balance sheet as of June 30, 2010, is 0.34 years, up from a 0.31 years at March 31, 2010. The number of downgrades increased from the first quarter, primarily from a continuing trend for downgrades in U.S. asset-backed securities. 
I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in arriving at our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We intend to reinvest about 80% to 85% of the approximately $15 billion in total securities due to mature pay-down in 2010. We expect to continue to invest in highly rated agency mortgage-backed securities and highly rated asset-backed securities. Following the acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business, we adjusted our investment strategy given the uncertainty in Europe. We decided to leave the acquired customer deposits, primarily in the ECB, as we continue to monitor market conditions in the Euro zone. Additionally, to protect us against the possibility of sustained lower rates, we adjusted the composition of our U.S. Treasury portfolio this quarter, increasing our interest rate risk position modestly, which was offset by other factors. As a result of this decision, as well as reflecting the strength of the first half of 2010, we now expect a higher net interest margin, including the impact of the Intesa acquisition but excluding the conduit discount accretion. We will expect the net interest margin to be between 155 and 165 basis points on average for this year, an increase of five basis points from our earlier guidance. We have seen a steeper yield curve at the short end, which is zero to three months, than we had assumed in our initial outlook. Also, we expect to have a slightly smaller average balance sheet for the year than we may have  originally anticipated. We now expect earning assets to increase between 2% and 3% from the average of 2009, down from our earlier outlook of 6% to 8% increase. 
We continue to expect the Bank of England rates to remain at 50 basis points for the rest of the year. We continue to expect the ECB to remain at 100 basis points throughout the rest of the year, and we continue to expect the Feds to keep the overnight fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2010. [Indiscernible] the S&P 500 to average about 1155 beginning May 10, up about 19% from 948, the average in 2009. 
Lastly, I'll briefly review our capital ratios. In the second quarter, State Street Corporation's capital ratios remained strong after giving [indiscernible] acquisitions. As of June 30, 2010, our Tier 1 leverage ratio said 7.1%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 15.1%, and our tangible common equity ratio was 6.3% after taking into account the impact of the acquisitions.
So in conclusion, we're pleased with our operating basis results for the second quarter. While we expect our quarterly results to decline somewhat from the seasonally strong level in the second quarter, we continue to expect our operating basis earnings for the year to be slightly above the $3.32 level of 2009. Now I'll turn the call back to Jay to conclude our remarks."

The results for the second quarter confirm our confidence in our full-year outlook, as well as our expectation that servicing revenues in the second half of the year will be stronger than the first half. This outlook is based on the contribution of the acquisitions, as well as the expected conversion of client wins from the first half of 2010 that will contribute to Service Fee revenue, as well as several value-added services. As I mentioned, the acquisitions are proceeding in line with expectations. The performance of Intesa in the second half of the quarter gives us confidence in our outlook for 2010. The acquisition of Mourant also has given us traction in adding clients to our alternative investment servicing business.
In Asset Management, State Street Global Advisors continue to position itself to benefit from the increased demand from passive strategies in growth and defined contribution plans in ETS investments. 
Overall, I'm pleased with the performance in the second quarter and encouraged that in spite of the challenging markets, our product and services continue to be in demand across the broad spectrum of institutions we serve. The growth of our core business and the momentum we have built in the first half of the year reinforce our confidence in achieving operating basis earnings per share slightly above the operating basis level of $3.32 in 2009.

So if you look at the $1.1 trillion in new commitments this quarter and net out the two acquisitions, I think there's $415 billion or so of new commitments unrelated to acquisitions in the quarter. I think that if you go back two or three quarters, I think in the fourth quarter of last year, we started to pick up some momentum that continued through the first and the second quarter. The tendency of these deals recently is they tend to be bigger. They tend to be, as a result, a little bit more lumped from an implementation standpoint. The Morgan Stanley commitment took a couple of quarters to get implemented. So I think, hard to dimension specifically, but if you looked at on an ongoing, there's probably a two or three quarters [indiscernible].  We talk about $415 billion that hit in the second quarter. I would guess 2/3 of that gets implemented in the second half of the year. And then the first quarter of next year, it gets completed.

I would say that a good deal of the wins, and you almost have to look at it by segment, if you look at the alternatives as a segment, or if you could look at the middle office as a segment, the wins are coming from in-house installation. So I think part of the answer is it represents expansion of the market. So it's not coming from traditional competitors. In the alternative segment, it's driving a good deal of the growth. That's a factor. In some of the large outsourcing deals where middle office is a factor, that's also a factor. So I'd say, some of the answer is [indiscernible] (0:57:31) The pie is expanding. And another part of the answer I think is that --  I think that the disproportionate share of new mandates is going to the bigger players. You look at some of the boutique providers in different aspects of the investor servicing world, I think there's greater comfort in the bigger, larger-scale players that have a global footprint. But if we put those things together, it could explain part of why the growth is occurring on multiple fronts. We do believe, having said that, that we're getting more than our share. If you look at the middle office, which a lot of these big deals, Morgan Stanley being one I would just highlight, back at the Investor Day I highlighted some industry data, which have us in excess of 50% market share in the middle office. Also by far, the leading provider in alternatives. So I think head-to-head we feel good about our performance, but I'd also make the point that the pie is expanding."

But almost by definition, the investment manager outsourcing is a product not for the pension world, but rather for the investment management world, and we've seen a pretty broad take up across traditional asset managers, as well as alternatives hedged in private equity. I'd also say that the demand is almost across the board from a geographic standpoint. So what we've tried to do with that is to position it against the largest and more sophisticated, because we have a product that we think is oriented best in that space. And as a result of that, we've enjoyed the market share that I referenced earlier. I would say as a general comment, the demand is quite strong, and I would expect and you would know this yourself, if you look at the pressures investment managers are under, not just to contain costs but to develop new compliance capabilities, new risk reporting to accommodate new asset types, at the same time accommodating the regulation, the last thing in the world that they generally want to invest in it infrastructure of the middle office. So I suspect that demand, and we've thought this for a long time, will be out there for quite some time."

One is in the fewer trading space, we've seen for several quarters now steady growth in our electronic trading. So between Currenex and FX Connect, the electronic element of trading I think across the industry continued to take share. We're participating in that. The other thing I would highlight is the point Ed made earlier which is transition management, which is a brokerage activity that's a byproduct of an institution that changes their asset allocation. As they change asset allocation, a transition manager is often involved to help transition the portfolio from, say, a fixed income to equity or within the equity asset classes. In 2009, I would say the movement of asset based on new allocation strategies was constrained, and we've seen in the past several quarters that it seems to be loosening up. So transition management begets brokerage. And given our positioning with the institutional world, I think we are pretty well-positioned to continue to see transition management growth."

This quarter obviously challenges that view and congratulations on hitting kind of your guidance. But I guess as we look forward, and that middle office functionality seems to be far more profitable and that historical relationship of assets not necessarily growing the same amount of servicing revenue, how would you think that historical relationship over the coming quarters and years would progress given the mix of business maybe towards more service-oriented outsourcing function that may provide a revenue growth outside just traditional asset growth?

Above and beyond middle office, our proposition, our thesis with our customers is that we begin doing business generally with a custody and an accounting relationship and are continuing to look to expand that into the trading space and into middle office and to compliance. More recently, collateral management has been a big theme, derivatives processing. So as you know, from the past, most years, 70% of our incremental revenue comes from our existing customers. Oftentimes, there's any anchor relationship around custody, but a lot of the Servicing Fee revenue emanates from those cross-sell products that can be middle office or other reporting or trading activities. So I don't think anything has changed. We continue to pursue custody-based books of business, but we're also generating pretty good growth by cross-selling not only the products we have but continuing to develop new series of products to meet today's needs."

The thesis was that as banks look to potentially raise capital or potentially look to shed non-core businesses that we would have an opportunity to take advantage of that. The Intesa acquisition, which we closed in the second quarter is symptomatic of what you might see, which is a large bank that has a small footprint in the custody space might look to exit that. In the case of Intesa, we were fortunate enough to buy it. So I think our view back in May still stands. And in fact, it's probably an even stronger view when you consider what the European banks are going through, the stress test and the like and the greater likelihood that they would conclude the subscale custody business isn't a long-term business for them."

From an operating basis, comparing the results of the third quarter with the third quarter of 2009, the total revenue increased 8.4% and total expenses increased 3.1%. As a result, we achieved 530 basis points of positive operating leverage. Total revenue in the quarter declined less than 1% from the second quarter of 2010, which I think is a good achievement given the cyclical strength of the second quarter results and the weakness in the worldwide trading markets. Our servicing fee revenue increased 19% from the third quarter of last year and was up 3% from the second quarter of this year, reflecting the impact of the acquisitions and the installations of last year's large wins, as well as new business won since January. 
As I said in the second quarter conference call, the large Morgan Stanley mandate is now fully included in the run rate for the third quarter. We converted the State of New Jersey in the third quarter and are just now converting the State of Ohio. 
Year-to-date as of September 3, 2010, we added $1.1 trillion of new servicing mandates. We've already installed about $286 billion of those and expect to install about $800 billion in the fourth quarter and into 2011. This pace of wins and installs gives us confidence in the strength of our servicing fee revenue. We've added new business pipelines. We have active new business pipelines with particular strength outside of the U.S. in our alternative investment servicing business. The acquisitions of Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business and Mourant International Finance Administration are on track to meet our expectations for the year and contributed modestly to our financial results for the quarter, excluding the merger and acquisition integration cost. We're optimistic that our market-leading position in Italy will lead to cross-sell opportunities and new mandates from Italian clients. The revenue from our asset management business declined slightly both from last year's third quarter and this year's second quarter. This decline was due primarily to a continuous movement out of active strategies and into passive and ETF strategies. Although net new business at SSgA was slightly negative in the quarter, down $3 billion, flows into passive and ETFs were positive, offset by negative flows from cash largely from our securities lending business. 
As expected, trading services revenue declined from a year ago quarter due to weak volumes in worldwide trading markets. The sequential quarterly decline in trading services revenue was principally due to the servicing strength in the second quarter. 
Demand has not returned to the securities finance markets. In addition, this quarter, the spread between fed fund and three-month LIBOR declined from both the year-ago third quarter and the second quarter of 2010, negatively affecting revenue. Given all the turmoil in the securities lending business over the past two years, we're especially pleased to have been named as the number one provider in Global Investor's 2010 Equity Lending Survey.  Our capital ratios continue to remain strong with our Tier 1 risk-based capital of 15.8%, our Tier 1 leverage ratio at 8.3% and our tangible common equity ratio at 6.9%. 
Regarding the recently released Basel III proposal, we're pleased that the G20 and the Basel committee are beginning to clarify requirements for capital adequacy for banks around the globe. We await the finalization of Basel III requirements and further clarification of how this capital standards will be applied within the United States. While there's still uncertainty about the amount of buffers we will need to have, we believe we are in compliance with Basel III as we know it today. 
Turning to new business. In the third quarter of 2010, we won $477 billion in assets to be serviced. Among the many encouraging themes I see in the new business pipeline, the demand for servicing alternative assets remains a highlight. This quarter, we added 29 new clients in our alternative investment services business, and assets under administration as of September 30, 2010, increased from $620 billion as of June 30, 2010, to $629 billion in the third quarter. In the broader investment servicing business, we also continue to see strong growth. A few of the highlights include State Street has been appointed to provide custody services for Banca Mediolanum's Italian assets. State Street will also serve as the sole global custodian for the Mediolanum Group. We expanded our relationship with Martin Currie, which chose State Street to provide custody and accounting for GBP 6.3 billion in assets. We also expanded our relationship with Sun Life and will provide custody and accounting services for about GBP 4 billion for Lincoln National in the U.K, making a total of GBP 6 billion in assets serviced. State Street has expanded its relationship with Lloyds Banking Group to provide custody fund accounting, financial reporting compliance and transfer agent services in 27 Luxembourg-based funds across sicavs. Pyramis Global Advisors, the Institutional Investors division of Fidelity Investments, selected State Street to provide custody fund accounting and fund administration services for the launch of its Irish funds during the fourth quarter. State Street has been selected by LaSalle Investment Management to provide fund administration services as well as transfer agency services for approximately $2 billion in assets on behalf of LaSalle Property Fund. And State Street has been appointed by Global Advisors LLC, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based investment manager to provide custody and fund administration services for Altrinsic's new Irish domestic usage funds. State Street Global Advisors also added new mandates during the quarter, including Stichting Pensioenfonds, the Dutch-defined benefit scheme, has hired State Street Global Advisors to manage its European equity brief with about EUR 600 million. State Street Global Advisors has been selected by Lincoln Financial Group to sub-advise variable insurance products, which include a range of its ETF products, as well as eight individual sub-advised Lincoln funds. SSgA has been named by Pegaso Pension Fund of Italy a public pension scheme for employees of Italian gas and electric utilities to manage more than EUR 60 million in active fixed-income assets. And finally, SSgA won a $3 billion global equity mandate from the Retiree Medical Benefits Trust for the United Auto Workers. 
Now turning to expenses, given the current environment, we have applied a keen focus on aggressively managing expenses in the short term while calibrating expenses against the expected business environment for the longer term. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, salaries and benefits expenses increased at a slower rate than the growth in operating basis revenue. And compared to the second quarter, salaries and benefits were essentially flat, excluding the $41 million reduction in incentive compensation related to securities finance charge recorded in the second quarter. 
Let me share our view on the current economic environment and the outlook for our business. Although we continue to believe the economy in the United States will improve, the recovery appears to be somewhat anemic and is affected by the uncertainty in Europe. Market economists are forecasting real annualized GDP growth in United States of about 2.3% for the fourth quarter of 2010, a slight decline from the earlier outlook. Economic growth is not strong enough to drive meaningful gains in employment. Credit is tight, and the housing sector appears to have bottomed out at depressed levels in most geographic areas but is mixed by region, and consumer spending has been cautious. The daily average of the S&P 500 as of September 30, 2010, is about 1,118 year-to-date. And as you recall, our outlook is based on an 1,125 average. Also, I'll remind you, one of our assumptions in providing an outlook for 2010 was the trading markets would strengthen a bit in the second half of 2010 compared to the first half, an improvement that has not yet occurred. Our net interest revenue, however, has strengthened somewhat above our outlook described in our second quarter call, an improvement that is supporting our outlook for 2010. I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will provide further detail about our financial performance in the third quarter, and I'll return to provide several comments affecting our outlook for the remainder of 2010. And then we'll open up the call for questions. Ed?"

Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review three areas: first, the results of the third quarter; second, the investment portfolio as well as our outlook for net interest margin in 2010; and third, a review of our strong capital position. 
This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release. Comparing the third quarter of 2010 with the third quarter of 2009, servicing fee revenue increased 19% primarily due to the impact of the two acquisitions, new business and increases in daily average equity market valuations. Management fee revenue declined 3% primarily due to the mix of business as investors increasingly chose passive or ETF investment strategies. Compared to the second quarter, our servicing fee revenue increased by 3%, and operating basis net interest revenue was up 10%. Asset management revenue declined slightly by 2% due to the continuing shift in business mix to favor passive investing strategies. Providing further details on the trading services and securities finance lines, foreign exchange revenue declined 30% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and 42% compared to the second quarter of 2010, with both declines due to lower volatilities and slightly lower volumes. Trading markets were significantly weaker than we expected. Brokerage and other revenue, which is reported as part of trading services revenue, increased about 3% compared to the third quarter of 2009, primarily due to increases in electronic trading and transition management, but was down 14% compared to the second quarter of 2010 due principally to lower revenue from both of these areas. Securities on loan averaged $382 billion for the third quarter of 2010, down $17 billion compared with $399 billion for the third quarter of 2009, and down $39 billion compared with $421 billion for the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter, securities finance revenue declined from $109 million to $68 million primarily due to seasonality in the second quarter, our lower level of demand and the compression in the average spread between fed funds and three-month LIBOR. This average spread declined to 19 basis points in the third quarter compared to 24 basis points in the second quarter of 2010. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, revenue also declined from $105 million due primarily to compression of six basis points in the average spread between fed funds and three-month LIBOR. Average lendable assets for the third quarter of 2010 were about $2.2 trillion, flat with the second quarter of 2010 and up about 5% from $2.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2009. As of September 30, 2010, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 24 days, up from the unusually low 17 days in the second quarter of 2010 and down from 29 days in the third quarter of 2009. Compared to the second quarter of 2010, processing and other fee revenue of $71 million decreased 18% due primarily to lower revenue from tax advantage investments and was up 58% from the third quarter of 2009 due to the impact of higher fees from structured products. Operating basis net interest revenue increased about 20% from the third quarter of 2009 due to higher yields in the investment portfolio following the adjustment of the composition of our U.S. Treasury securities position in the second quarter, as well as the full quarter impact of the Intesa acquisition. Compared to the second quarter, operating basis net interest revenue was up about 10% due to the full quarter impact of the securities purchased in the second quarter, the impact of the Intesa deposits and a modest improvement in funding costs. Operating basis net interest margin of 177 basis points, which excludes discount accretion, was up 21 basis points from the third quarter of 2009 and was up 11 basis points from the second quarter of 2010. Including discount accretion of $189 million in the third quarter of 2010, $172 million in the second quarter of 2010 and $279 million in the third quarter of 2009, net interest margin was 236 basis points compared with 221 basis points and 247 basis points, respectively. In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded about $91 million in net gains from sales of available-for-sale securities and separately, about $74 million of other-than-temporary impairments, resulting in $17 million of net gains related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses from U.S. non-agency mortgage-backed securities. 
To recap where we are relative to future discount accretion, we recorded $189 million of discount accretion in the third quarter of 2010, so we now expect about $3.6 billion in discount accretion to accrete into interest revenue over the remaining lives of the former conduit assets. There has been no change in our view relative to credit. We continue to expect a total of about $750 million to accrete into interest revenue in 2010 and $550 million in 2011. As you are undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions going to the estimate of future discount accretion over the remaining lives of the assets, including that we hold the securities to maturity, estimated prepayment speeds, the expected future credit losses across various asset classes and sales to date. Regarding operating basis expenses, third quarter 2010 expenses increased 3.1% compared to the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits as a result of the Intesa and Mourant acquisitions, offset partially by a decline in other expenses.
The 6% increase in salaries and benefits expense was due primarily to cost associated with the employees added in connection with the two acquisitions. Other expenses declined 15% from the third quarter of 2009 primarily due to the impact of a $15 million insurance recovery. Expenses in the third quarter of 2010 increased 3% from the second quarter of 2010 primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits. Salaries and benefits expense increased 5% compared to the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to the impact of the $41 million reduction in incentive compensation in the second quarter of 2010 related to the securities finance charge, as well as the full quarter impact of the cost associated with the Intesa employees. Of course, the accrual of incentive compensation is subject to company performance. 
Information systems and communications expense increased $16 million or 10% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and was up $7 million or 4% from the second quarter of 2010 both due to the full quarter impact of the Intesa acquisition. Transaction processing increased 11% from the third quarter of 2009 due to the impact of the two acquisitions and increased about 1% compared to the second quarter of 2010 due to higher transaction volumes. Other expenses increased 2% from the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to increases in securities processing costs offset partially by a higher level of recoveries. Our operating basis tax rate for the third quarter is 28.1%, in line with our previous outlook and down from 29.1% in the second quarter of 2010 due to changes in the geographic mix of our earnings. 
Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. Our average investment portfolio in the third quarter increased about 16% to $98.2 billion compared to the third quarter of 2009. This increase is due primarily to the continuing execution of our reinvestment strategy, offset partially by maturities and sales of selected securities. During the third quarter, we invested about $4.7 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of $99.73, with an average yield of 2.07% and a duration of approximately 1.28 years. Those $4.7 billion are primarily composed of the following securities, 89% of which are rated AAA: $1 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities; $200 million in non-agency mortgage-backed securities; $3 billion in asset-backed securities, including about $800 million of foreign RMBS, which are mostly U.K. and Dutch issues; and about $1.2 billion in student loans. Additionally, there's another $500 million in autos, $300 million backed by credit card receivables and $200 million in CLOs. Additionally, $100 million in commercial mortgage-backed securities and $400 million in corporate and municipal bonds. 
The aggregate net unrealized after-tax losses in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of September 30, 2010, were $281 million, a $713 million or 72% improvement from the second quarter of 2010, an improvement of about $2.7 billion or 91% from September 30, 2009, and an improvement of $6 billion or 96% from December 31, 2008. As of last Friday, the net unrealized loss was $122 million, an improvement of about 57% from September 30, 2010. In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter-end for you to review. As of September 30, 2010, our portfolio is 82% AAA- or AA-rated. The duration of the investment portfolio is about 1.32 years, up slightly from the second quarter of 1.28 years and up from the third quarter of 2009 of 1.07 years. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet as of September 30, 2010, is 0.32 years, down slightly from 0.34 years at June 30, 2010. The number of downgrades from major rating agencies slowed from the level experienced in the second quarter. The majority of the downgrades was in non-agency asset-backed and mortgage-backed asset classes. 
I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in determining our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We continue to believe we should invest through the cycle and to invest in highly rated agency mortgage-backed securities and highly rated asset-backed securities. Following the acquisition of the Intesa business, given the uncertainty in Europe, we decided to leave the majority of the acquired customer deposits primarily in the ECB as we continue to monitor market conditions in the eurozone. As a result of the decision to invest in certain U.S. treasuries during the second quarter as well as reflecting the strength of the first three quarters of 2010, we now expect our net interest margin in 2010 for the full year, excluding conduit-related discount accretion, to be slightly above the high end of the range of 155 to 165 basis points that we disclosed last quarter. We expect this outlook to be supported by the higher yields we earned on the recent treasury security purchases, slower prepayment speeds and a slightly smaller average balance sheet. We continue to expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 50 basis points for the rest of the year, the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis points for the rest of the year and the fed to keep the overnight fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2010. We expect the S&P 500 to average about 1,125 in 2010, up about 19% from 948, which was the average in 2009. 
Finally, I'll review our capital ratios. In the third quarter, State Street Corp.'s capital ratios remain strong. As of September 30, 2010, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 8.3%, our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 15.8% and our tangible common equity ratio was 6.9%. So in conclusion, we're pleased with our operating basis results for the third quarter. Despite continued weakness in our trading results but given the strength of our core business and the slight increase in net interest margin, we continue to expect our operating basis earnings per share for the year to be slightly above the adjusted operating basis $3.32 per share recorded in 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks."

In the face of weak trading markets, the achievement of revenue growth compared to last year's third quarter confirms the strength of our strategy. In addition, the performance of the third quarter compared to the second demonstrates our ability to calibrate expenses against revenue. Very importantly, our service fee momentum continues, reflecting client wins from the first three quarters of 2010. As I mentioned, the acquisitions are proceeding in line with expectations. Together, they're modestly accretive and equally important. Both are contributing new clients to State Street to whom we can sell additional services. 
In asset management, State Street Global Advisors continues to position itself to benefit from the increased demand from passive strategies, ETF investments and defined contribution plans. Looking to the future, if the economic recovery remains anemic and the trading markets continue to be weak, our industry will face continued challenges in market-sensitive businesses. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter, particularly given the weakness in trading markets. The growth of our core servicing business, the contribution of our two acquisitions, as well as improvement in the net interest revenue, re-enforced our confidence in achieving operating basis earnings per share slightly above the adjusted operating basis level of $3.32 in 2009. Now Ed and I are happy to take your questions."

As you know, the regulatory reform led by Dodd-Frank is far but finalized review as a framework, although it is pointing to a few things. I would say the most tangible thing that we're focused on right now that could result in an opportunity would be some of the movement to immobilize certain securities, most notably derivatives. So if you look at some of the derivative regulation and the expectation that some large percent of over-the-counter derivatives will be forced to be cleared through central counterparties, we view that as something that's interesting. We think somebody likes State Street. A processing-oriented bank might be able to play a role there. So I would say that's the narrowest thing that we're focused on right now, I would say. The other thing that we're paying attention to is -- I think some of this regulation, depending on how it gets ultimately netted out, could result in some meaningful shift in the non-trust bank sectors, and whether or not that provided opportunities for the trust and custody side of the business is yet to be determined."

We've actually experienced slower prepayments overall than what we had experienced, what we expected to experience when we put out that normalized picture of the NIM. And as I mentioned earlier, the balance sheet is slightly smaller than what we assumed was a normalized balance sheet. So the world is different. I mean, we feel pretty comfortable about the guidance for the year being slightly above the 165, but I really don't want to get too far out there and go into 2011 at this point other than to say that if rates continue to stay low, that will put downward pressure on NIM, which is maybe obvious. And our philosophy is not to reach for yield, not to try to figure out how in a low-rate environment, with a 10-year going below 250, for example, that we can maintain NIM. So at some point, there'll be more of a compressing effect on NIM as rates stay low for a longer period of time. But overall, we're looking at continuing.

188785,113855779,80230,"State Street Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thanks Kelly and good morning. Strength and servicing fee and good cost controls drove results of the third quarter. We achieved operating basis earnings per share of $0.86, which was an increase of 21% compared with $0.71 in the third quarter of last yea",1497,"Thanks Kelly and good morning. Strength and servicing fee and good cost controls drove results of the third quarter. We achieved operating basis earnings per share of $0.86, which was an increase of 21% compared with $0.71 in the third quarter of last year, and down modestly from the very strong second quarter of this year. Based on our new wins and strong pipeline, we expect the momentum in service fee revenue to continue.
In asset management, we continue to experience growth and passes in income oriented ETF products as investors continue to remain conservative. Additionally, the impact of the Intesa and Mourant acquisitions, which closed last quarter, supported our strong revenue growth. I’ll make a few comments about our performance and I’ll ask Ed to provide a more detailed financial perspective and after that we’ll open the call to your questions.
From an operating basis, comparing the results of the third quarter with the third quarter of 2009, total revenue increased 8.4% and total expenses increased 3.1%. As a result, we achieved 530 basis points of positive operating leverage. Total revenue in the quarter declined less than 1% from the second quarter of 2010, which I think is a good achievement given the cyclical strength of the second quarter results and the weakness in the worldwide trading markets. 
Our servicing fee revenue increased 19% from the third quarter of last year and was up 3% from the second quarter of this year, reflecting the impact of the acquisitions and the installations of last year’s large wins as well as new business wins of January.
As I said in the second quarter conference call, the large Morgan Stanley mandate is now fully included in the run rate for the third quarter. We converted the state of New Jersey in the third quarter and are just now converting the state of Ohio.
Year-to-date, as of September 3, 2010, we added 1.1 trillion of new servicing mandates. We’ve already installed about 286 billion of those and expect to install about 800 billion in the fourth quarter and into 2011. This pace of wins and installs gives us confidence in the strength of our servicing fee revenue. We’ve added new business pipelines. We have active business pipelines with particular strength outside of the US in our alternative investment servicing business. The acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo Securities Services business and Mourant International Finance Administration are on track to meet our expectations for the year and contributed modestly to our financial results for the quarter, excluding the merger and acquisition integration costs.
We’re optimistic that our market-leading position in Italy will lead to cross-sell opportunities and new mandates from Italian clients. The revenue from our asset management business declined slightly both from last year’s third quarter and this year’s second quarter. This decline was due primarily to a continuous movement out of active strategies and into passive and ETF strategies. Although net new business at SSgA was slightly negative in the quarter, down 3 billion, flows into passive and ETFs were positive, offset by negative flows from cash, largely from our securities lending business. As expected, trading services revenue declined from a year ago quarter due to weak volumes in worldwide trading markets. The sequential quarterly decline in trading services revenue was principally due to the servicing strength in the second quarter. Demand has not returned to the securities finance markets.
In addition this quarter, the spread between Fed fund and 3 month LIBOR declined from both a year ago third quarter and the second quarter of 2010, negatively affecting revenue. Given all the turmoil in the securities lending business over the past 2 years, we’re especially pleased to have been named as the number one provider in global investors’ 2010 equity lending survey.
Our capital ratios continue to remain strong with our Tier 1 risk base capital at 15.8%, our Tier 1 leverage ratio at 8.3% and our tangible common equity ratio at 6.9%. Regarding the recently released Basel III proposal, we’re pleased that the G20 the Basel committee are beginning to clarify requirements for capital adequacy for banks around the globe. We await the finalization of Basel III requirements and further clarification of how these capital standards will be applied within the United States.
While there’s still uncertainty about the amount of buffers we will need to have, we believe we are in compliance with Basel III as we know it today.
Turning to new business, in the third quarter of 2010, we won 477 billion in assets to be serviced. Among the many encouraging scenes I see in the new business pipeline, the demand for servicing alternative assets remains a highlight.
This quarter, we added 29 new clients in our alternative investment services business, in assets administration, as of September 30, 2010 increased from 620 billion as of June 30, 2010 to 629 billion in the third quarter.
In the broader investment servicing business, we also continue to see strong growth. A few of the highlights include State Street has been appointed to provide custody services for Banca Mediolanum's Italian assets. State Street will also service the sole global custodians for the Mediolanum Group. We expanded our relationship with Martin Currie, which chose State Street to provide custody and accounting for £6.3 billion in assets. We also expanded our relationship with SunLife and we’ll provide custody and accounting services for about £4 billion for [Indiscernible] National in the UK making a total of 6 billion in asset service.
State Street has extended its relationship with Lloyds Banking Group to provide custody fund accounting, financial reporting compliance with transfer agency and services for 27 Luxembourg-based funds across sea cabs. Pyramus Global Advisors, the institutional investors division of Fidelity Investment selected State Street to provide custody, fund accounting and fund administration services for the launch of its Irish funds during the fourth quarter.  State Street has been selected by LaSalle Investment Management to provide fund administration services as well as transfer agency services for approximately $2 billion dollars on assets on behalf of LaSalle Property Fund.
State Street had been appointed by Altrinsic global Advisors LLC, a Greenwich, Connecticut based investment manager to provide custody and fund administration services for Altrinsic’s new Irish domestic usage funds. State Street’s global advisors also added new mandates during the quarter including expecting pension fund  the Dutch define benefit scheme has hired State Street Global Advisors to manage its European equity brief with about €600 million. State Street Global advisor assistance selected by Lincoln Financial Group to sub-advise variable insurance products which include a range of TTF products as well eight individual sub-advise Lincoln funds. Associated by name by Pegaso Pension Fund of Italy, a public pension scheme for employees of Italian gas electric utilities to manage more than €60 million in active fixed income assets. And finally, associated with one of $3billion global equity mandate from the retiree medical benefits trust for United Arab Workers. 
Now turning to expenses, given the current environment, we have applied a keen focus on a aggressively managing expenses on a short term while calibrating expenses against the expected business environment for the longer term. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, salaries and benefits expenses increased at a slower rate than a growth of an operating basis revenue. And compared to the second quarter, salaries and benefits were essentially flat excluding the $41million dollar reduction in incentive compensation related to securities finance required in the second quarter.
Let me share our view on the current economic environment and the outlook for our business. Although we continue to believe the economy in the United States will improve, recovery appears to be somewhat anemic and is affected by the uncertainly in Europe. Market economists are forecasting real annual GDP growth in United States of about 2.3% for the fourth quarter of 2010, a slight decline from the earlier outlook. Economic growth is not strong enough to drive meaningful gains in employment. Creditor type in the housing sector appears to have brought them out at depressed levels and most geographic areas but is mixed by region, and consumer spending has been cautious.
The average of the SNP500 as of September 30, 2010 is about 1118 year to date. And as you recall, our outlook is based on an 1125 average. Also I remind you, one of our assumptions in providing an outlook for 2010 was a trading markets with strength in a bit in the second half of 2010 compared to the first half and improvement that is not yet occurring. Our net interest revenue, however, has strengthen somewhat above our outlook described on our second quarter call, an improvement that is supporting our outlook for 2010.
I’ll now turn the call over to Ed, who will provide further detail about our financial performances in the third quarter, and I’ll return to provide several comments affecting our outlook for the remainder of 2010. And then we’ll open up the call questions.

Good morning, everyone. This morning I’ll review three areas - first, the results of the third quarter, second the investment portfolio as well as our outlook for management’s margin in 2010, and third a review of a string capital position. This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today’s earnings news release.
Comparing the third quarter of 2010 with the third quarter of 2009, servicing free revenue increased 19% primarily due to impact of the two acquisitions, new business and increases in daily average equity market valuations. Management fee revenue declined 3% primarily due to the mixed of business as investors increasingly chose passive or ETF investment strategies. Compared to the second quarter, our servicing free revenue increased by 3% and operating basis management revenue was up to 10%. Asset management revenue declined slightly by 2% due to the continuing shift in business mix to favor passive investing strategies.
Providing further details on the trading services and securities finance lines, foreign exchange revenue declined 30% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and 42% compared to the second quarter of 2010 with both declines due to lower volatilities and slightly lower volumes. Trading markets were significantly weaker than we expected. Brokerage and other revenue, which was reported as part of trading services revenue, increased about 3% compared to the third quarter of 2009 primarily due to increases in electronic trading and transition management, but was down 14% compared to the second quarter of 2010 due principally to lower revenue from both of these areas.
Securities on loan average $382 billion for the third quarter of 2010 down $17 billion compared with $399 billion for the third quarter of 2009, and down $39 billion compared with $421 billion for the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter, securities finance revenue declined from $109 million to $68 million primarily due to seasonality on the second quarter, a lower low of demand and the compression in the average spread between Fed funds and three-month LIBOR. This average spread decline to 19 basis points in the third quarter compared to 24 basis points in the second quarter of 2010. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, revenue also declined from $105 million due primarily to compression of six basis points in the average spread between Fed fund and three-month LIBOR.
Average lendable assets to the third quarter of 2010 were about $2.2 trillion flat with the second quarter of 2010 and up about 5% from $2.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2009. As of September 30 of 2010, the duration of the securities finance block with approximately 24 days off from the unusually low 17 days on the second quarter of 2010 and down from 29 days in the third quarter of 2009. Compared to the second quarter 2010, processing and other fee revenue of 71 million dollars decreased 18% due to primarily to lower revenue from tax advantage investment and was up 58% in the third quarter of 2009 due to the impact of higher fees from structured products. Operating basis management revenues increased about 20% from the third quarter of 2009 to the higher yield investment portfolio following the adjustment of the composition of our US treasury securities position in the second quarter as well as the full quarter impact of the Intesa acquisition. Compared to the second quarter, operating basis management revenue was up about 10% due to the full quarter impact of securities purchase in the second quarter, the impact of the Intesa deposits and a modest improvement in funding cost.
Operating basis net interest margin of 177 basis points which excludes this kind of creation was up 21 basis point in the third quarter of 2009 and was up 11 basis points in the second quarter of 2010. Including this kind of creation of $189 million in the third quarter of 2010, $172 million in the second quarter in 2010 and $279 million in the third quarter of 2009, net interest margin was 236 basis points compared with 221 basis points and 247 basis points respectively. In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded about $91million in net gains from sales of available for sales securities and separately about $74 million of other then temporary impairments resulting in $17 million of net gains related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to the increase as expected future credit losses from US non agency mortgage back securities.
To recap where we are relative to future this kind of creation, we recorded $189 million of this kind of creation on the third quarter of 2010, so we now expect about $3.6 billion in this kind of creation to accrue into interest revenue although the remaining lines of the former conduit assets. There has been no change in our view relative to credit. We continue to expect a total of about $750 million to accrete into interest revenue in 2010 and $550 million in 2011.
As you undoubtedly aware of significant number of assumptions going to the estimate of future this kind of creation over the remaining lines of the assets including that we hold the securities to maturity, estimating pre-payment speeds, expected future credit loss as across various assets classes, and sales to date. Regarding operating base of expenses, third quarter 2010 expenses increased to 3.1% compared to the third quarter of 2009, due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits as a result of the Intesa and Mourant acquisitions all set partially via decline in other expenses.
The 6% increase in salaries and benefits expense was due primarily with the cost associated with the employees added in connection with the two acquisitions. Other expenses declined 15% from the third quarter of 2009 primarily due to the impact of a $50 million insurance recovery. Expenses in the third quarter of 2010 increased 35 from the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits. Salaries and benefits expense increased 55 compared to the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to the impact of the $41 million reduction in incentive compensation in the second quarter of 2010 related to the securities finance charge as well as the full quarter impact of the cost associated with the Intesa employees. Of course the accrual for compensation is subject to company performances.
Information systems and communication expense increased $16 million or 10% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and was up $7milion or 4% from the second quarter of 2010 both to the full quarter impact of the Intesa acquisition. Transaction processing increased 11% from the third quarter of 2009 due to the impact of the two acquisitions and increased about 1% compared to the second quarter of 2010 due to higher transaction volumes. Other expenses increased 2% from the second quarter of 2010 due to primarily to increases in securities processing cost, offset partially by a higher level of recoveries. Our operating basis tax rates for the third quarter is 28.1% in line with our previous outlook and down from 29.1% in the second quarter of 2010 due to changes in the geographic mix of our earnings.
Now, I’ll return to the investment portfolio. Our average investment portfolio in the third quarter increased about 16% to $98.2 billion dollars compared to the third quarter of 2009. This increase is due primarily to the continuing execution of our reinvestment strategy, offset partially by maturity and sales of selective securities. During the third quarter, we invested about $4.7 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of 99.73 with an average yield of 2.07% and a duration of approximately 1.28 years. Those $4.7 billion are primarily composed of the following securities - 89% of which are rated AAA, $1 billion on agency mortgage back securities, $200 million in non-agency mortgage back securities, $3 billion in assets back securities including about $800 million of foreign RMB which are mostly UK and Dutch issues, and about $1.2 billion in student loans. Additionally, there’s another $500 million in orals, $300 million back by credit card receivables and $200 million CLOs.
Additionally, $100 million in commercial mortgage back securities and $400 million in corporate and municipal bonds. The aggregate net on realized after tax losses that are available for sale and health maturity portfolios as of September 30 of 2010 were $281 million and $713 million or 72% improvement from the second quarter of 2010 \, and improvement of about $2.7 or 91% from September 30 of 2009, and an improvement of $6 billion or 96% from December 31st 2008. As of last Friday, the net unrealized lost was $122 million and improvement of about 52% from September 30 of 2010.
In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter end for you to review. As of September 30 of 2010, our portfolio is 82% triple or double A rated. The duration of the investment portfolio was about 1.32 years up slightly from the second quarter of 1.28 years enough from the third quarter of 2009of 1.07 years. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet as of September 30, 2010 is 0.32 years down slightly from 0.34 years at June 30 of 2010. The number of downgrades from major rating agencies slowed from the level experienced in the second quarter. The majority of the downgrades was in non agency asset back and mortgage aback asset classes.
I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in determining or turning an outlook for net interest revenue from net interest margin. We continue to believe we should invest through the cycle and to invest in highly rated agency, mortgage back securities and highly rated assets back securities. Following the acquisition of the Intesa business , given the uncertainly in Europe, we decided to leave the majority of the acquired customer deposits primarily in the ECB as we continue monitor market conditions in the Euro zone.
As a result of this investigation to invest in certain US treasuries during the second quarter as well as reflecting the strength of the first three quarters of 2010, we now expect a net interest margin in 2010 for the full year excluding conduit excluding discount accretion to be slightly above the higher end range of 155 to 165 basis points that we disclosed last quarter. We expect this outlook to be supported by the higher yields that we earn on the recent treasury security purchases, slower pre-payment speeds, and a slightly smaller average balance sheet.
We continue to expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 55 basis points for the rest of the year, the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis points for the rest of the year, and the Fed to keep your overnight Fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all 2010. We expect the SMP 500 to average about 1125 in 2010 up about 19% from 948 which was the average in 2009.
Finally, I’ll review our capital ratios. In the third quarter State Street Corporation’s capital ratios remain string. As of September 30 of 2010, our TIER 1 leverage ratio stood at 8.3%, our TIER 1 capital ratio stood at 15.8% and our tangible common equity ratio was 6.9%. 
So in conclusion, we’re pleased with our operating basis results for the third quarter. Despite continued weakness in our trading results, and given the strength of our core business and the slight increase in net average margin, continue to expect our operating basis earnings per share for the year to be slightly above with the adjusted operating basis, $3.32 per share recorded in 2009.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks.

In the face of weak trading markets, the achievement of revenue growth compared to last year’s third quarter confirmed to the strength of our strategy. In addition of performance of the third quarter compared to second demonstrates our ability to calibrate expenses against revenue. Very importantly, our service team momentum continue reflecting the client management of first three quarters of 2010.
As I mentioned the acquisitions are preceding in line with expectations, together they modestly created an equally important, both are contributing new clients to State Street to whom we can sell additional services. In asset management, State Street Global advisors continues to position itself to benefit from the increase to man from past strategies, ETF investment and defying contribution plans.
Looking to the future, if the economic recovery remains anemic and the trading markets continue to be weak, our industry will face continued challenges in market sensitive business. Overall, I’m pleased with our performances in the third quarter particularly given a week in this trading market. The growth of our core servicing business, the contribution of our two acquisitions as well as improvement in the net interest revenue, we enforced our confidence in achieving operating basis earnings per share slightly above the adjusted operating basis level of $3.32 in 2009.
Now, Ed and I are happy to take your question.

As you know, the regulatory reform led by Dodd-Frank is far by finalized review as a framework, although it is pointing to few things. I would say, the most tangible thing that we’re focused on right now that could result for an opportunity would be some of the movement to immobilize certain securities most notably their evidence. Do if you look at some of the derivative regulation and the expectation at some large percent of over the counter derivatives will be forced to be cleared to central count of parties. 
We view that as something that’s interesting. We think somebody like stage three that the processing oriented bank might be able to play a role there. So I would say that’s the narrowest thing that we’re focused on right now. I would say, the other thing that worth paying attention to is I think some of this regulation depending on how it gets ultimately needed out could result to become meaningful shift in non-trust bank sectors and whether or not that provided opportunities for the trust and custody side of the business, is yet to be determined.

So those are the once that we put for in our investor day.

And the purpose was to try to give you a sense of what we thought given a whole list of assumptions was a normalized member in company.
As I recall, we’re talking about our fund rates being around 3% in amore normalized environment. We gave you some spread relationships all for that. Today’s world is materially different from what we assume in that presentation. Just to give you a couple of facts relative to where we were in the third quarter versus investor day - for example, we did not assume any of the treasury repositioning that we’ve done in the second quarter. We’ve actually experienced slower prepayments overall and what we had experienced - what we expected experienced when we out up that normalized picture of them in.
As I mentioned earlier, the balance sheet is slightly smaller that we assumed was a normalized balance sheet. So, the world is different. We feel pretty comfortable about the guidance for the year being slightly being above the 165. But I really don’t want to get too far out there and go in 2011 at this point other than to say that if rates continue to stay low, that would put down more pressure on them. That’s maybe obvious. Our philosophy is not to reach for yield, not to try to figure out how in a lower environment with a 10 year going below 250 for example, that we could maintain them.
At some point, there’ll be more of compressing effects on them as rates stayed low for a longer period of time. But, overall we’re looking at continuing to overdoing within the context than not reaching for yield.

Strength in servicing fee and good cost control drove results in the third quarter. We achieved operating basis earnings per share of $0.86, which was an increase of 21% compared with $0.71 in the third quarter of last ye",1504,"Thanks, Kelley, and good morning. Strength in servicing fee and good cost control drove results in the third quarter. We achieved operating basis earnings per share of $0.86, which was an increase of 21% compared with $0.71 in the third quarter of last year and down modestly from the very strong second quarter of this year. Based on our new wins and strong pipeline, we expect the momentum in service fee revenue to continue. In asset management, we continue to experience growth in passive and income-oriented ETF products as investors continue to remain conservative. Additionally, the impact of the Intesa and Mourant acquisitions, which closed last quarter, supported our strong revenue growth. I'll make a few comments about our performance, and I'll ask Ed to provide a more detailed financial perspective, and after that, we'll open the call to your questions.
From an operating basis, comparing the results of the third quarter with the third quarter of 2009, the total revenue increased 8.4% and total expenses increased 3.1%. As a result, we achieved 530 basis points of positive operating leverage. Total revenue in the quarter declined less than 1% from the second quarter of 2010, which I think is a good achievement given the cyclical strength of the second quarter results and the weakness in the worldwide trading markets. Our servicing fee revenue increased 19% from the third quarter of last year and was up 3% from the second quarter of this year, reflecting the impact of the acquisitions and the installations of last year's large wins, as well as new business won since January. 
As I said in the second quarter conference call, the large Morgan Stanley mandate is now fully included in the run rate for the third quarter. We converted the State of New Jersey in the third quarter and are just now converting the State of Ohio. 
Year-to-date as of September 3, 2010, we added $1.1 trillion of new servicing mandates. We've already installed about $286 billion of those and expect to install about $800 billion in the fourth quarter and into 2011. This pace of wins and installs gives us confidence in the strength of our servicing fee revenue. We've added new business pipelines. We have active new business pipelines with particular strength outside of the U.S. in our alternative investment servicing business. The acquisitions of Intesa Sanpaolo Security Services business and Mourant International Finance Administration are on track to meet our expectations for the year and contributed modestly to our financial results for the quarter, excluding the merger and acquisition integration cost. We're optimistic that our market-leading position in Italy will lead to cross-sell opportunities and new mandates from Italian clients. The revenue from our asset management business declined slightly both from last year's third quarter and this year's second quarter. This decline was due primarily to a continuous movement out of active strategies and into passive and ETF strategies. Although net new business at SSgA was slightly negative in the quarter, down $3 billion, flows into passive and ETFs were positive, offset by negative flows from cash largely from our securities lending business. 
As expected, trading services revenue declined from a year ago quarter due to weak volumes in worldwide trading markets. The sequential quarterly decline in trading services revenue was principally due to the servicing strength in the second quarter. 
Demand has not returned to the securities finance markets. In addition, this quarter, the spread between fed fund and three-month LIBOR declined from both the year-ago third quarter and the second quarter of 2010, negatively affecting revenue. Given all the turmoil in the securities lending business over the past two years, we're especially pleased to have been named as the number one provider in Global Investor's 2010 Equity Lending Survey.  Our capital ratios continue to remain strong with our Tier 1 risk-based capital of 15.8%, our Tier 1 leverage ratio at 8.3% and our tangible common equity ratio at 6.9%. 
Regarding the recently released Basel III proposal, we're pleased that the G20 and the Basel committee are beginning to clarify requirements for capital adequacy for banks around the globe. We await the finalization of Basel III requirements and further clarification of how these capital standards will be applied within the United States. While there's still uncertainty about the amount of buffers we will need to have, we believe we are in compliance with Basel III as we know it today. 
Turning to new business. In the third quarter of 2010, we won $477 billion in assets to be serviced. Among the many encouraging themes I see in the new business pipeline, the demand for servicing alternative assets remains a highlight. This quarter, we added 29 new clients in our alternative investment services business, and assets under administration as of September 30, 2010, increased from $620 billion as of June 30, 2010, to $629 billion in the third quarter. In the broader investment servicing business, we also continue to see strong growth. A few of the highlights include State Street has been appointed to provide custody services for Banca Mediolanum's Italian assets. State Street will also service the sole global custodian for the Mediolanum Group. We expanded our relationship with Martin Currie, which chose State Street to provide custody and accounting for GBP 6.3 billion in assets. We also expanded our relationship with Sun Life and will provide custody and accounting services for about GBP 4 billion for Lincoln National in the U.K, making a total of GBP 6 billion in assets serviced. State Street has expanded its relationship with Lloyds Banking Group to provide custody fund accounting, financial reporting compliance and transfer agent services in 27 Luxembourg-based funds across sicavs. Pyramis Global Advisors, the Institutional Investors division of Fidelity Investments, selected State Street to provide custody fund accounting and fund administration services for the launch of its Irish funds during the fourth quarter. State Street has been selected by LaSalle Investment Management to provide fund administration services as well as transfer agency services for approximately $2 billion in assets on behalf of LaSalle Property Fund. And State Street has been appointed by Altrinsic Global Advisors LLC, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based investment manager to provide custody and fund administration services for Altrinsic's new Irish domestic usage funds. State Street Global Advisors also added new mandates during the quarter, including Stichting Pensioenfonds, the Dutch-defined benefit scheme, has hired State Street Global Advisors to manage its European equity brief with about EUR 600 million. State Street Global Advisors has been selected by Lincoln Financial Group to sub-advise variable insurance products, which include a range of its ETF products, as well as eight individual sub-advised Lincoln funds. SSgA has been named by Pegaso Pension Fund of Italy a public pension scheme for employees of Italian gas and electric utilities to manage more than EUR 60 million in active fixed-income assets. And finally, SSgA won a $3 billion global equity mandate from the Retiree Medical Benefits Trust for the United Auto Workers. 
Now turning to expenses, given the current environment, we have applied a keen focus on aggressively managing expenses in the short term while calibrating expenses against the expected business environment for the longer term. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, salaries and benefits expenses increased at a slower rate than the growth in operating basis revenue. And compared to the second quarter, salaries and benefits were essentially flat, excluding the $41 million reduction in incentive compensation related to securities finance charge recorded in the second quarter. 
Let me share our view on the current economic environment and the outlook for our business. Although we continue to believe the economy in the United States will improve, the recovery appears to be somewhat anemic and is affected by the uncertainty in Europe. Market economists are forecasting real annualized GDP growth in United States of about 2.3% for the fourth quarter of 2010, a slight decline from the earlier outlook. Economic growth is not strong enough to drive meaningful gains in employment. Credit is tight, and the housing sector appears to have bottomed out at depressed levels in most geographic areas but is mixed by region, and consumer spending has been cautious. The daily average of the S&P 500 as of September 30, 2010, is about 1,118 year-to-date. And as you recall, our outlook is based on an 1,125 average. Also, I'll remind you, one of our assumptions in providing an outlook for 2010 was the trading markets would strengthen a bit in the second half of 2010 compared to the first half, an improvement that has not yet occurred. Our net interest revenue, however, has strengthened somewhat above our outlook described in our second quarter call, an improvement that is supporting our outlook for 2010. I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will provide further detail about our financial performance in the third quarter, and I'll return to provide several comments affecting our outlook for the remainder of 2010. And then we'll open up the call for questions. Ed?"

Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review three areas: first, the results of the third quarter; second, the investment portfolio as well as our outlook for net interest margin in 2010; and third, a review of our strong capital position. 
This morning, all of my comments will be based on our operating basis results as defined in today's earnings news release. Comparing the third quarter of 2010 with the third quarter of 2009, servicing fee revenue increased 19% primarily due to the impact of the two acquisitions, new business and increases in daily average equity market valuations. Management fee revenue declined 3% primarily due to the mix of business as investors increasingly chose passive or ETF investment strategies. Compared to the second quarter, our servicing fee revenue increased by 3%, and operating basis net interest revenue was up 10%. Asset management revenue declined slightly by 2% due to the continuing shift in business mix to favor passive investing strategies. Providing further details on the trading services and securities finance lines, foreign exchange revenue declined 30% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and 42% compared to the second quarter of 2010, with both declines due to lower volatilities and slightly lower volumes. Trading markets were significantly weaker than we expected. Brokerage and other revenue, which is reported as part of trading services revenue, increased about 3% compared to the third quarter of 2009, primarily due to increases in electronic trading and transition management, but was down 14% compared to the second quarter of 2010 due principally to lower revenue from both of these areas. Securities on loan averaged $382 billion for the third quarter of 2010, down $17 billion compared with $399 billion for the third quarter of 2009, and down $39 billion compared with $421 billion for the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter, securities finance revenue declined from $109 million to $68 million primarily due to seasonality in the second quarter, a lower level of demand and the compression in the average spread between fed funds and three-month LIBOR. This average spread declined to 19 basis points in the third quarter compared to 24 basis points in the second quarter of 2010. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, revenue also declined from $105 million due primarily to compression of six basis points in the average spread between fed funds and three-month LIBOR. Average lendable assets for the third quarter of 2010 were about $2.2 trillion, flat with the second quarter of 2010 and up about 5% from $2.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2009. As of September 30, 2010, the duration of the securities finance book was approximately 24 days, up from the unusually low 17 days in the second quarter of 2010 and down from 29 days in the third quarter of 2009. Compared to the second quarter of 2010, processing and other fee revenue of $71 million decreased 18% due primarily to lower revenue from tax advantage investments and was up 58% from the third quarter of 2009 due to the impact of higher fees from structured products. Operating basis net interest revenue increased about 20% from the third quarter of 2009 due to higher yields in the investment portfolio following the adjustment of the composition of our U.S. Treasury securities position in the second quarter, as well as the full quarter impact of the Intesa acquisition. Compared to the second quarter, operating basis net interest revenue was up about 10% due to the full quarter impact of securities purchased in the second quarter, the impact of the Intesa deposits and a modest improvement in funding costs. Operating basis net interest margin of 177 basis points, which excludes discount accretion, was up 21 basis points from the third quarter of 2009 and was up 11 basis points from the second quarter of 2010. Including discount accretion of $189 million in the third quarter of 2010, $172 million in the second quarter of 2010 and $279 million in the third quarter of 2009, net interest margin was 236 basis points compared with 221 basis points and 247 basis points, respectively. In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded about $91 million in net gains from sales of available-for-sale securities and separately, about $74 million of other-than-temporary impairments, resulting in $17 million of net gains related to investment securities. The OTTI was primarily due to increases in expected future credit losses from U.S. non-agency mortgage-backed securities. 
To recap where we are relative to future discount accretion, we recorded $189 million of discount accretion in the third quarter of 2010, so we now expect about $3.6 billion in discount accretion to accrete into interest revenue over the remaining lives of the former conduit assets. There has been no change in our view relative to credit. We continue to expect a total of about $750 million to accrete into interest revenue in 2010 and $550 million in 2011. As you are undoubtedly aware, a significant number of assumptions going to the estimate of future discount accretion over the remaining lives of the assets, including that we hold the securities to maturity, estimated prepayment speeds, the expected future credit losses across various asset classes and sales to date. Regarding these expenses, third quarter 2010 expenses increased 3.1% compared to the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits as a result of the Intesa and Mourant acquisitions, offset partially by a decline in other expenses.
The 6% increase in salaries and benefits expense was due primarily to cost associated with the employees added in connection with the two acquisitions. Other expenses declined 15% from the third quarter of 2009 primarily due to the impact of a $50 million insurance recovery. Expenses in the third quarter of 2010 increased 3% from the second quarter of 2010 primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits. Salaries and benefits expense increased 5% compared to the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to the impact of the $41 million reduction in incentive compensation in the second quarter of 2010 related to the securities finance charge, as well as the full quarter impact of the cost associated with the Intesa employees. Of course, the accrual for incentive compensation is subject to company performance. 
Information systems and communications expense increased $16 million or 10% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and was up $7 million or 4% from the second quarter of 2010 both due to the full quarter impact of the Intesa acquisition. Transaction processing increased 11% from the third quarter of 2009 due to the impact of the two acquisitions and increased about 1% compared to the second quarter of 2010 due to higher transaction volumes. Other expenses increased 2% from the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to increases in securities processing costs offset partially by a higher level of recoveries. Our operating basis tax rate for the third quarter is 28.1%, in line with our previous outlook and down from 29.1% in the second quarter of 2010 due to changes in the geographic mix of our earnings. 
Now let me turn to the investment portfolio. Our average investment portfolio in the third quarter increased about 16% to $98.2 billion compared to the third quarter of 2009. This increase is due primarily to the continuing execution of our reinvestment strategy, offset partially by maturities and sales of selected securities. During the third quarter, we invested about $4.7 billion in highly rated securities at an average price of $99.73, with an average yield of 2.07% and a duration of approximately 1.28 years. Those $4.7 billion are primarily composed of the following securities, 89% of which are rated AAA: $1 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities; $200 million in non-agency mortgage-backed securities; $3 billion in asset-backed securities, including about $800 million of foreign RMBS, which are mostly U.K. and Dutch issues; and about $1.2 billion in student loans. Additionally, there's another $500 million in autos, $300 million backed by credit card receivables and $200 million in CLOs. Additionally, $100 million in commercial mortgage-backed securities and $400 million in corporate and municipal bonds. 
The aggregate net unrealized after-tax losses in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios as of September 30, 2010, were $281 million, a $713 million or 72% improvement from the second quarter of 2010, an improvement of about $2.7 billion or 91% from September 30, 2009, and an improvement of $6 billion or 96% from December 31, 2008. As of last Friday, the net unrealized loss was $122 million, an improvement of about 57% from September 30, 2010. In our investment portfolio slide presentation, we have updated the data through quarter-end for you to review. As of September 30, 2010, our portfolio is 82% AAA or AA rated. The duration of the investment portfolio is about 1.32 years, up slightly from the second quarter of 1.28 years and up from the third quarter of 2009 of 1.07 years. The duration gap of the entire balance sheet as of September 30, 2010, is 0.32 years, down slightly from 0.34 years at June 30, 2010. The number of downgrades from major rating agencies slowed from the level experienced in the second quarter. The majority of the downgrades was in non-agency asset-backed and mortgage-backed asset classes. 
I will now provide some of the assumptions we used in determining our 2010 outlook for net interest revenue and net interest margin. We continue to believe we should invest through the cycle and to invest in highly rated agency mortgage-backed securities and highly rated asset-backed securities. Following the acquisition of the Intesa business, given the uncertainty in Europe, we decided to leave the majority of the acquired customer deposits primarily in the ECB as we continue to monitor market conditions in the Euro-zone. As a result of the decision to invest in certain U.S. treasuries during the second quarter as well as reflecting the strength of the first three quarters of 2010, we now expect our net interest margin in 2010 for the full year, excluding conduit-related discount accretion, to be slightly above the high end of the range of 155 to 165 basis points that we disclosed last quarter. We expect this outlook to be supported by the higher yields we earned on the recent treasury security purchases, slower prepayment speeds and a slightly smaller average balance sheet. We continue to expect the Bank of England rate to remain at 50 basis points for the rest of the year, the ECB rate to remain at 100 basis points for the rest of the year and the fed to keep the overnight fed funds rate at 25 basis points for all of 2010. We expect the S&P 500 to average about 1,125 in 2010, up about 19% from 948, which was the average in 2009. 
Finally, I'll review our capital ratios. In the third quarter, State Street Corp.'s capital ratios remain strong. As of September 30, 2010, our Tier 1 leverage ratio stood at 8.3%, our Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 15.8% and our tangible common equity ratio was 6.9%. So in conclusion, we're pleased with our operating basis results for the third quarter. Despite continued weakness in our trading results but given the strength of our core business and the slight increase in net interest margin, we continue to expect our operating basis earnings per share for the year to be slightly above the adjusted operating basis $3.32 per share recorded in 2009. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay to conclude our remarks."

In the face of weak trading markets, the achievement of revenue growth compared to last year's third quarter confirms the strength of our strategy. In addition, the performance of the third quarter compared to the second demonstrates our ability to calibrate expenses against revenue. Very importantly, our service fee momentum continues, reflecting client wins from the first three quarters of 2010. As I mentioned, the acquisitions are proceeding in line with expectations. Together, they're modestly accretive and equally important. Both are contributing new clients to State Street to whom we can sell additional services. 
In asset management, State Street Global Advisors continues to position itself to benefit from the increased demand from passive strategies, ETF investments and defined contribution plans. Looking to the future, if the economic recovery remains anemic and the trading markets continue to be weak, our industry will face continued challenges in market-sensitive businesses. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter, particularly given the weakness in trading markets. The growth of our core servicing business, the contribution of our two acquisitions, as well as improvement in the net interest revenue, re-enforced our confidence in achieving operating basis earnings per share slightly above the adjusted operating basis level of $3.32 in 2009. Now Ed and I are happy to take your questions."

As you know, the regulatory reform led by Dodd-Frank is far but finalized review as a framework, although it is pointing to a few things. I would say the most tangible thing that we're focused on right now that could result in an opportunity would be some of the movement to immobilize certain securities, most notably derivatives. So if you look at some of the derivative regulation and the expectation that some large percent of over-the-counter derivatives will be forced to be cleared through central counterparties, we view that as something that's interesting. We think somebody likes State Street. A processing-oriented bank might be able to play a role there. So I would say that's the narrowest thing that we're focused on right now, I would say. The other thing that we're paying attention to is -- I think some of this regulation, depending on how it gets ultimately kneaded out, could result in some meaningful shift in the non-trust bank sectors, and whether or not that provided opportunities for the trust and custody side of the business is yet to be determined."

Hedge funds determining that they would outsource previously in-sourced activities.

And just to give you a couple of facts relative to where we were in the third quarter versus Investor Day, for example, we did not assume any of the treasury repositioning that we've done in the second quarter. We've actually experienced slower prepayments overall than what we had experienced, what we expected to experience when we put out that normalized picture of the NIM. And as I mentioned earlier, the balance sheet is slightly smaller than what we assumed was a normalized balance sheet. So the world is different. I mean, we feel pretty comfortable about the guidance for the year being slightly above the 165, but I really don't want to get too far out there and go into 2011 at this point other than to say that if rates continue to stay low, that will put downward pressure on NIM, which is maybe obvious. And our philosophy is not to reach for yield, not to try to figure out how in a low-rate environment, with a 10-year going below 250, for example, that we can maintain NIM. So at some point, there'll be more of a compressing effect on NIM as rates stay low for a longer period of time.
