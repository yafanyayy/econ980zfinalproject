I'd like to give you a brief overview, after which, I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino for the financial review. Let me start off by saying that 2009 certainly was a year with it's fair share of challenges. Ducommun, along with the rest of the aerospace and defense industry, faced a number of headwinds with regard to our end markets, and the company reacted by increasing our focus on both cost controls and new business development. We've talked a lot about our benefits of lean manufacturing in the past but it's clearly worked to our advantage this year, as we've been able to generate solid cash flow and stabilize margins, even as our topline revenue was impacted by near-term economic conditions. Ducommun Aerostructures had some major challenges this year with maintaining our margin performance. But at the same time, we can now boost side on the new program development efforts undertaken by this business. This new business development efforts included the RUAG Bombardier fuselage assembly production program, the engineering and design and development of wing movels [ph] for the Embraer new 450 and 550 series aircraft, and the co-development of the exhaust system with Pratt & Whitney on the UCAV's program. Another solid example of our continuous improvement efforts lies within our technology unit, DTI [Diffusion Tensor Imaging]. Our operating margins rose to 9.4% from 5.9% year-over-year on a 6% decline in revenue. We believe Ducommun is well-positioned as our market begins to rebound. I'd like to review a few trends that we see impacting Ducommun in the market as a whole going forward. We expect our Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing businesses to remain strong in 2010. While the Apache production has come down to more normalized pre-war levels, we see continued strong demand for the Blackhawk and Chinook helicopter programs. This is a reflection of the Afghan war which is more suited to their mission profiles. In addition, I've said before, the C17 remains funded into the mid-2011. As we look forward on the C-17, we see additional demand driven by higher foreign sales and lower U.S. sales, which have the potential to fund the lower production rate for the program into 2012 and 2013. The F/A-18 also continues to be a strong program for Ducommun, and we see further room for additional growth. On the commercial side, we are cautiously optimistic about the consistent demand for large fixed wing aircraft. Commercial aircraft is expected to grow to be somewhere between 2% and 4% depending on the model you use. But both Boeing and Airbus has strong backlogs. We expect the major programs, such as the Boeing 737 and the A320, to continue their current projected production rates end to the end of 2010. However, with only 400 aircraft ordered worldwide in 2009, the airline recovery is important to the future build rates and we'll monitor these trends as the year progresses. We have witnessed the airlines reducing their cash expenditures, particularly in their purchase of an inventory per spares, which impacted some of our DTI order base and our backlog in 2009. As they continue to deplete their spares inventory, we expect that there will be a need to replenish supply during the second half of 2010. This should lead to a potential uptick in our Spares business, which typically represents approximately 5% to 7% of our revenue, but has been running at a lower than normal levels. We're cautiously optimistic about the recovery of the regional jet market, but not until later this year and possibly running into 2011. We do not expect it to recover in 2010, but with some pickup later in the years and companies such as us Gulfstream. These markets have historically represented about 10% to 15% of our business, and we're keeping an eye on the end-user demand. As the global economy continues to recover, we believe demand will further stabilize and likely see improvement as we head into the next year. Joe Bellino is going to give you the financial overview, but let me briefly talk about the fourth quarter and the year. We were extremely disappointed in the goodwill impairment charge we took in the fourth quarter. The pretax non-cash charge was taken in the amount of $12.9 million, which equates to $0.74 per diluted share after tax. This charge was taken in recognition of the changing defense market demands on our Ducommun Miltec business. We took the impairment charge as a result of our reassessment of the unit's multi-year sales and cash flow forecast given recent government trends in the RDT&E budgeting, lower plus up in the year-mark spending and trends towards government in-sourcing. We do have a solid strategy to keep the business in this challenging market and to grow this business. We're optimistic that the unit focus is on new customer initiatives, we'll be able to navigate the coming quarters and improve Miltec's margins and long-term potential. For the fourth quarter, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, Ducommun grew net income to $4.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share, from $3.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share a year ago. For the quarter, our cash flow from operations was nearly $40 million and the yearly number was $31 million, reflecting sound working capital management. Even given the top operating environment and the number of one-time events that impacted operating income in the quarter and in the year, Ducommun achieved solid operating margins while generating consistent cash flow. Now I'd like to turn the phone call over to Joe Bellino for the financial review. Joe?"

Our fourth quarter results, as Tony just discussed, where we reported results before our goodwill impairment charge during the quarter, posting net income of $0.44 per diluted share versus $0.36 per diluted share a year ago before our goodwill impairment charge in 2008. Typically, our business is seasonal with the fourth quarter having a reduced number of operating days due to the holidays, and this causes unabsorbed overhead allocations impacting our operating margins. That typical scenario did certainly incurred in our fourth quarter year in 2009.I'd like to give you some more color on the quarter, in terms of talking first about sales. Our overall sales for the quarter of $106 million were 4% year-over-year, increased. We experienced a significant increase in sales within our Ducommun Aerostructure segment, DAS, where revenues rose 17% year-over-year, due largely to a nearly $9 million in sales from the late 2008 acquisition of DAS New York and from increases in both commercial and military fixed wing products. Somewhat offsetting this growth was softer sales in business and regional jets and general aviation commercial products, along with lower deliveries for the Apache helicopter program. In the technology segment, DTI, we experienced the 15% decline in sales, a portion of which reflected our cautious efforts to exit certain unprofitable lines later in 2008 was carried over into 2009 and lower regional jet and aftermarket product sales. The remaining decline was primarily attributable to lower services revenue from the Miltec unit that Tony commented upon and as a result of the reduced government funding in certain military markets. If you'd see on our P&L statement, our service revenues were $11 million in the quarter versus about $16 million a year ago, you'll see that we started to feel the impact of that in the fourth quarter, and we expect that kind of run rate to carry over into a good part of 2010.If you look at operating income by business segment, Ducommun's operating income for the quarter, we exclude the goodwill charges, it rose to $7.2 million or 6.8% of revenues from 3.9% of revenues a year ago. Last year's operating income also excludes the goodwill impairment charge. In Ducommun Aerostructures operating business segment, its operating income improved to $7.7 million or 11% of revenues, compared to $5.4 million or 9% of revenues a year ago. This is a result of higher sales and continued productivity gains from our lean manufacturing efforts, which more than offset the impact from the decline in Apache helicopter blade sales and lower demands from business and regional jets in general aviation products. Ducommun Technology, DTI's operating income despite lower sales that I commented upon earlier and excluding the aforementioned impairment charge, the operating income increased to $4.2 million versus $2.9 million a year ago as a result of improved product mix. We were pleased that the operating margins were 11.7% of sales, up nearly 500 basis points from the 6.9% posted in the fourth quarter of 2008.Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter. As we look at SG&A, it's a combination of business segment SG&A, which is part of the operating income as it recorded and unallocated corporate expenses. These overall SG&A expenses decreased significantly this quarter and it primarily reflects the corporate wide cost controls that we have had in place since the first part of 2009, along with reductions in environmental reserves that has been established in previous years. Somewhat offsetting these reductions, were additional expenses we incurred with the DAS New York acquisition, primarily related to amortization of intangibles. I'd like to comment a little further on the goodwill impairment charges that Tony discussed previously that involves our recording in the fourth quarter of $12.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, which equates to $0.74 per diluted share. The effective tax rate for this charge was approximately 39%. You might recall in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a pretax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $13.1 million, which equated to about $0.76 per diluted share. Again, the effective tax rate was approximately 39%.As Tony noted, the 2009 impairment charge was related to external market factors and decreases in government funding related to the Miltec operation. This contrast, significantly from the 2008 impairment charge, which was driven by the weakness in the overall equity market. Having recorded these charges, going forward we are very confident in Miltec's future opportunities. If we turn to the full-year 2009 results, our net income, excluding goodwill, was $18 million or $1.71 per fully diluted share in fiscal 2009 and this compares to $21.1 million or $1.99 per share. Again, excluding the goodwill charge. Our full-year sales in 2009 increased 7% to $431 million from $404 million last year. The 2009 increase in revenue largely reflects sales tied to our acquisition of DAS New York. Ducommun Aerostructure sales increased to $286 million from $250 million, and DTI sales were down about 6% overall reflecting shortfalls in the regional jet and aftermarket sales and the elimination of the unprofitable lines this year, compared to a year ago.Looking at full-year operating income by business segment, Ducommun's operating income, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, was $29 million in 2009 compared to $31 million a year ago. Full-year 2009 results also included the impact of a $5.8 million expenses related to the Eclipse reserve, inventory valuations and sales tax reserves that we've commented upon in the press release as well as the 10-K. DAS' operating income was $29 million compared to $35 million a year ago. On a pro forma basis, if we backed out those inventory adjustments I just mentioned, the 2009 DAS operating income, as a percentage sales, would have been nearly 12% that does compare to nearly 14% of revenues in 2008. The reduction in Apache helicopter delivery business and regional jets and higher levels of unabsorbed operating costs were the primary factors impacting the decline in this adjusted DAS segment operating profitability.DTI's realized higher operating income in 2009, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, resulted in operating income rising to $13.5 million or 9.3% of revenues from $9 million or 5.9% of revenues. And this again, as the quarter was depicted earlier, was a result of improved product mix, elimination of unprofitable lines and improved operations. We are pleased to see the sustainability of higher operating margins in the DTI segment, reflecting a successful execution of our strategies in 2009. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses as I defined earlier, those for the full year, were slightly lower year over year as a result of the aforementioned cost controls, reduction in the environmental reserves, and these were partially offset by the year-over-year higher amortization expenses related to our acquisition. As a key measure that we monitor closely, SG&A as a percentage of sales, was 11.5% down 100 basis points from the 2008 numbers.Turning to our backlog in our business mix. In the current economic environment, we have seen our business mix continued to shift to a greater increase in military sales. And for the year, our business was comprised of 62% military, 36% commercial and 2% space. At year end 2009, our backlog stood at $367 million. We have had no major program losses, some delay but have experienced delays in follow-on orders for a number of programs, including the F-18, Apache, Blackhawk, 737 and regional jets. We expect that follow-on orders and new program wins that Tony spoke about will favorably impact our backlog levels going forward. Finally, in terms of liquidity and capital resources, we generated strong positive cash flow from operations improved for the full year, cash from operations was $31 million, which is about equal to or five-year average of $30 million per year since 2005. We finished the year with very effective working capital management, which along with our normalized earnings, was a large contributor to our strong cash generation. We are managing our working capital levels very aggressively in this softer markets. Along with the new credit facility that we put in place last June of 2009, we continue to maintain a low leverage position at year end, our net debt to capital ratio was just 4%. We feel that given the current economic environment and uncertainty in the credit markets, this is an excellent position for us to be in. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2010 to be in the $11 million range, that compares to slightly less than $8 million for 2009, and most of that increase in investment is into new business development programs. Before turning the call back over to Tony, I would just like to comment that as we enter 2010, we believe our strong financial position and credit profile will allow us to take advantage of several market opportunities positioning the company for future growth and improved operating performance. Now I'd like to ask Tony Reardon to make some additional remarks. Tony?"

We see 2010 as one of correction, with overall market improvement coming in the second half of the year. Most importantly, as we continue to generate strong cash flow and expand our margins, we are positioning the company for even stronger performance in 2011, which should benefit from some late improvement in the regional jet market, growth in after market demand and the success of such programs as the 787. We are very optimistic about the outlook of the Boeing 787, believing that another redesign it looks like less likely, and the timing of deliveries is becoming more certain. If the FAA gives certification in September, as anticipated, this program should be a solid contributor to our growth, going into 2011. That's why while we are currently facing some headwinds with the Apache and the C-17 in particular, we believe our aggressive effort to cut costs, improved productivity and win new contract awards will result in solid growth as the global economy moves forward.

When we look at the overall sales in the fourth quarter of the technology segment of a little over $35 million, that was comprised of $24 million of our Technologies Manufactured product segment and $11 million of the Service Revenue segment, which you can pull the service revenues off of our consolidated P&L. That compares to about $35 million a quarter before, but in the quarter before, certainly the service revenues were in the $16 million range. Broad stroke, we had $5 million worth of manufactured product sales and we had $5 million less of service revenues, which the service revenues, like most government businesses are lower operating margin part of the business. So that was a favorable mix. And I commented that we're running at the rate of $11 million to $12 million a quarter and the service revenues going forward here -- what we see the first half at least of 2010, but we still see sustainability with the manufactured products. And in addition to operating improvements that we've made and we've reposition the portfolio, our orders for products on the F-18 and other ones aftermarket products look very good here in the near term, and most of those are replacement for military products. So we do believe that, that number of -- the 11.8% is certainly a more realistic number than the mid-eights that we experienced in the first half of '09."

And so what happened to us in terms of the forecast going forward was that we had a pretty good adjustment for 2010. So the base actually dropped in 2010 from the 2009 original forecast and we executed a growth strategy that puts us at about somewhere between 5% and 8% per year, year-over-year going forward.

So as we look at that, we forecast together, based on our realistic projection of what 2010 would look like and then the forecasted growth rate has some particular targeted programs, a little shift in our engineering development technology base, and then we look at about 5% to 8% going forward."

I read something just last Friday were Senator Reid is working on the smaller jobs bill and they're going to address that first and get through that legislation and the next priority is the R&D. So I can't tell exactly when that will be approved. It goes back to the Reagan days as you know, so it could be the first quarter, it could be the second quarter. But in terms of our own accounting properly, we will record the 33% and not reflect the benefit of that until that legislation is passed and then,  but the full year will be 31%. Your question on the CapEx, a lot of it is driven by new program development. As you might know, our depreciation and amortization is probably about $11 million to $12 million so we've been very modest with our CapEx and we can grow our base without having to have substantial increases in investments and capacity but most of our CapEx of above a minimum level of maintenance within our whole operations, which is really relatively small is for growth-oriented programs and business development. Your question about in the future, well we don't see it going to a quantum leap if we stay in this general range of businesses, we do see it probably in this $10 million to $12 million range."

But on that in the quarter, it triggered a sales tax reserve of about $700,000 I believe so that's comes up to the $5.8 million. There are a couple of other things that we noted. When we flushed through the inventory from the DAS New York acquisition through the first half of the year, which I mentioned earlier, that amount was about $1.5 million. We had also -- the schedule, we had increases in amortization of expenses. On the other side, we had lower, I think you'll have to dig for, we had lower accrued compensation because of lower operating performance this year versus last year and we also had a change in our environmental reserves of $2.2 million from previous reserves in the quarter.

So your model, you'd play with that depending on what your expectations to where our sales are going and where our business is going. The other component has to do with primarily on our technology side, Michael, is when we receive we call milestone payments, customer deposits in advance of doing work and in '08, we received about $15 million of those in the fourth quarter and in '09, we received about $7 million of those in the fourth quarter. It just depends on our ability to obtain those and that's a function of backlogs in getting purchase orders to do that kind of work. It's primarily the replacement rate or a type of business.

I'd like to give you a brief overview, after which, I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino for the financial review. Let me start off by saying that 2009 certainly was a year with it's fair share of challenges. Ducommun, along with the rest of the aerospace and defense industry, faced a number of headwinds with regard to our end markets, and the company reacted by increasing our focus on both cost controls and new business development. We've talked a lot about our benefits of lean manufacturing in the past but it's clearly worked to our advantage this year, as we've been able to generate solid cash flow and stabilize margins, even as our topline revenue was impacted by near-term economic conditions. Ducommun Aerostructures had some major challenges this year with maintaining our margin performance. But at the same time, we can now boost side on the new program development efforts undertaken by this business. This new business development efforts included the RUAG Bombardier fuselage assembly production program, the engineering and design and development of wing movels [ph] for the Embraer new 450 and 550 series aircraft, and the co-development of the exhaust system with Pratt & Whitney on the UCAV's program. Another solid example of our continuous improvement efforts lies within our technology unit, DTI [Diffusion Tensor Imaging]. Our operating margins rose to 9.4% from 5.9% year-over-year on a 6% decline in revenue. We believe Ducommun is well-positioned as our market begins to rebound. I'd like to review a few trends that we see impacting Ducommun in the market as a whole going forward. We expect our Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing businesses to remain strong in 2010. While the Apache production has come down to more normalized pre-war levels, we see continued strong demand for the Blackhawk and Chinook helicopter programs. This is a reflection of the Afghan war which is more suited to their mission profiles. In addition, I've said before, the C17 remains funded into the mid-2011. As we look forward on the C-17, we see additional demand driven by higher foreign sales and lower U.S. sales, which have the potential to fund the lower production rate for the program into 2012 and 2013. The F/A-18 also continues to be a strong program for Ducommun, and we see further room for additional growth. On the commercial side, we are cautiously optimistic about the consistent demand for large fixed wing aircraft. Commercial aircraft is expected to grow to be somewhere between 2% and 4% depending on the model you use. But both Boeing and Airbus has strong backlogs. We expect the major programs, such as the Boeing 737 and the A320, to continue their current projected production rates end to the end of 2010. However, with only 400 aircraft ordered worldwide in 2009, the airline recovery is important to the future build rates and we'll monitor these trends as the year progresses. We have witnessed the airlines reducing their cash expenditures, particularly in their purchase of an inventory per spares, which impacted some of our DTI order base and our backlog in 2009. As they continue to deplete their spares inventory, we expect that there will be a need to replenish supply during the second half of 2010. This should lead to a potential uptick in our Spares business, which typically represents approximately 5% to 7% of our revenue, but has been running at a lower than normal levels. We're cautiously optimistic about the recovery of the regional jet market, but not until later this year and possibly running into 2011. We do not expect it to recover in 2010, but with some pickup later in the years and companies such as us Gulfstream. These markets have historically represented about 10% to 15% of our business, and we're keeping an eye on the end-user demand. As the global economy continues to recover, we believe demand will further stabilize and likely see improvement as we head into the next year. Joe Bellino is going to give you the financial overview, but let me briefly talk about the fourth quarter and the year. We were extremely disappointed in the goodwill impairment charge we took in the fourth quarter. The pretax non-cash charge was taken in the amount of $12.9 million, which equates to $0.74 per diluted share after tax. This charge was taken in recognition of the changing defense market demands on our Ducommun Miltec business. We took the impairment charge as a result of our reassessment of the unit's multi-year sales and cash flow forecast given recent government trends in the RDT&E budgeting, lower plus up in the year-mark spending and trends towards government in-sourcing. We do have a solid strategy to keep the business in this challenging market and to grow this business. We're optimistic that the unit focus is on new customer initiatives, we'll be able to navigate the coming quarters and improve Miltec's margins and long-term potential. For the fourth quarter, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, Ducommun grew net income to $4.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share, from $3.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share a year ago. For the quarter, our cash flow from operations was nearly $40 million and the yearly number was $31 million, reflecting sound working capital management. Even given the top operating environment and the number of one-time events that impacted operating income in the quarter and in the year, Ducommun achieved solid operating margins while generating consistent cash flow. Now I'd like to turn the phone call over to Joe Bellino for the financial review. Joe?"

Our fourth quarter results, as Tony just discussed, where we reported results before our goodwill impairment charge during the quarter, posting net income of $0.44 per diluted share versus $0.36 per diluted sha",1487,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results, as Tony just discussed, where we reported results before our goodwill impairment charge during the quarter, posting net income of $0.44 per diluted share versus $0.36 per diluted share a year ago before our goodwill impairment charge in 2008. Typically, our business is seasonal with the fourth quarter having a reduced number of operating days due to the holidays, and this causes unabsorbed overhead allocations impacting our operating margins. That typical scenario did certainly incurred in our fourth quarter year in 2009.I'd like to give you some more color on the quarter, in terms of talking first about sales. Our overall sales for the quarter of $106 million were 4% year-over-year, increased. We experienced a significant increase in sales within our Ducommun Aerostructure segment, DAS, where revenues rose 17% year-over-year, due largely to a nearly $9 million in sales from the late 2008 acquisition of DAS New York and from increases in both commercial and military fixed wing products. Somewhat offsetting this growth was softer sales in business and regional jets and general aviation commercial products, along with lower deliveries for the Apache helicopter program. In the technology segment, DTI, we experienced the 15% decline in sales, a portion of which reflected our cautious efforts to exit certain unprofitable lines later in 2008 was carried over into 2009 and lower regional jet and aftermarket product sales. The remaining decline was primarily attributable to lower services revenue from the Miltec unit that Tony commented upon and as a result of the reduced government funding in certain military markets. If you'd see on our P&L statement, our service revenues were $11 million in the quarter versus about $16 million a year ago, you'll see that we started to feel the impact of that in the fourth quarter, and we expect that kind of run rate to carry over into a good part of 2010.If you look at operating income by business segment, Ducommun's operating income for the quarter, we exclude the goodwill charges, it rose to $7.2 million or 6.8% of revenues from 3.9% of revenues a year ago. Last year's operating income also excludes the goodwill impairment charge. In Ducommun Aerostructures operating business segment, its operating income improved to $7.7 million or 11% of revenues, compared to $5.4 million or 9% of revenues a year ago. This is a result of higher sales and continued productivity gains from our lean manufacturing efforts, which more than offset the impact from the decline in Apache helicopter blade sales and lower demands from business and regional jets in general aviation products. Ducommun Technology, DTI's operating income despite lower sales that I commented upon earlier and excluding the aforementioned impairment charge, the operating income increased to $4.2 million versus $2.9 million a year ago as a result of improved product mix. We were pleased that the operating margins were 11.7% of sales, up nearly 500 basis points from the 6.9% posted in the fourth quarter of 2008.Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter. As we look at SG&A, it's a combination of business segment SG&A, which is part of the operating income as it recorded and unallocated corporate expenses. These overall SG&A expenses decreased significantly this quarter and it primarily reflects the corporate wide cost controls that we have had in place since the first part of 2009, along with reductions in environmental reserves that has been established in previous years. Somewhat offsetting these reductions, were additional expenses we incurred with the DAS New York acquisition, primarily related to amortization of intangibles. I'd like to comment a little further on the goodwill impairment charges that Tony discussed previously that involves our recording in the fourth quarter of $12.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, which equates to $0.74 per diluted share. The effective tax rate for this charge was approximately 39%. You might recall in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a pretax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $13.1 million, which equated to about $0.76 per diluted share. Again, the effective tax rate was approximately 39%.As Tony noted, the 2009 impairment charge was related to external market factors and decreases in government funding related to the Miltec operation. This contrast, significantly from the 2008 impairment charge, which was driven by the weakness in the overall equity market. Having recorded these charges, going forward we are very confident in Miltec's future opportunities. If we turn to the full-year 2009 results, our net income, excluding goodwill, was $18 million or $1.71 per fully diluted share in fiscal 2009 and this compares to $21.1 million or $1.99 per share. Again, excluding the goodwill charge. Our full-year sales in 2009 increased 7% to $431 million from $404 million last year. The 2009 increase in revenue largely reflects sales tied to our acquisition of DAS New York. Ducommun Aerostructure sales increased to $286 million from $250 million, and DTI sales were down about 6% overall reflecting shortfalls in the regional jet and aftermarket sales and the elimination of the unprofitable lines this year, compared to a year ago.Looking at full-year operating income by business segment, Ducommun's operating income, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, was $29 million in 2009 compared to $31 million a year ago. Full-year 2009 results also included the impact of a $5.8 million expenses related to the Eclipse reserve, inventory valuations and sales tax reserves that we've commented upon in the press release as well as the 10-K. DAS' operating income was $29 million compared to $35 million a year ago. On a pro forma basis, if we backed out those inventory adjustments I just mentioned, the 2009 DAS operating income, as a percentage sales, would have been nearly 12% that does compare to nearly 14% of revenues in 2008. The reduction in Apache helicopter delivery business and regional jets and higher levels of unabsorbed operating costs were the primary factors impacting the decline in this adjusted DAS segment operating profitability.DTI's realized higher operating income in 2009, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, resulted in operating income rising to $13.5 million or 9.3% of revenues from $9 million or 5.9% of revenues. And this again, as the quarter was depicted earlier, was a result of improved product mix, elimination of unprofitable lines and improved operations. We are pleased to see the sustainability of higher operating margins in the DTI segment, reflecting a successful execution of our strategies in 2009. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses as I defined earlier, those for the full year, were slightly lower year over year as a result of the aforementioned cost controls, reduction in the environmental reserves, and these were partially offset by the year-over-year higher amortization expenses related to our acquisition. As a key measure that we monitor closely, SG&A as a percentage of sales, was 11.5% down 100 basis points from the 2008 numbers.Turning to our backlog in our business mix. In the current economic environment, we have seen our business mix continued to shift to a greater increase in military sales. And for the year, our business was comprised of 62% military, 36% commercial and 2% space. At year end 2009, our backlog stood at $367 million. We have had no major program losses, some delay but have experienced delays in follow-on orders for a number of programs, including the F-18, Apache, Blackhawk, 737 and regional jets. We expect that follow-on orders and new program wins that Tony spoke about will favorably impact our backlog levels going forward. Finally, in terms of liquidity and capital resources, we generated strong positive cash flow from operations improved for the full year, cash from operations was $31 million, which is about equal to or five-year average of $30 million per year since 2005. We finished the year with very effective working capital management, which along with our normalized earnings, was a large contributor to our strong cash generation. We are managing our working capital levels very aggressively in this softer markets. Along with the new credit facility that we put in place last June of 2009, we continue to maintain a low leverage position at year end, our net debt to capital ratio was just 4%. We feel that given the current economic environment and uncertainty in the credit markets, this is an excellent position for us to be in. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2010 to be in the $11 million range, that compares to slightly less than $8 million for 2009, and most of that increase in investment is into new business development programs. Before turning the call back over to Tony, I would just like to comment that as we enter 2010, we believe our strong financial position and credit profile will allow us to take advantage of several market opportunities positioning the company for future growth and improved operating performance. Now I'd like to ask Tony Reardon to make some additional remarks. Tony?"

We see 2010 as one of correction, with overall market improvement coming in the second half of the year. Most importantly, as we continue to generate strong cash flow and expand our margins, we are positioning the company for even stronger performance in 2011, which should benefit from some late improvement in the regional jet market, growth in after market demand and the success of such programs as the 787. We are very optimistic about the outlook of the Boeing 787, believing that another redesign it looks like less likely, and the timing of deliveries is becoming more certain. If the FAA gives certification in September, as anticipated, this program should be a solid contributor to our growth, going into 2011. That's why while we are currently facing some headwinds with the Apache and the C-17 in particular, we believe our aggressive effort to cut costs, improved productivity and win new contract awards will result in solid growth as the global economy moves forward. Sally,  I think now we could turn it over for some questions, please?"

When we look at the overall sales in the fourth quarter of the technology segment of a little over $35 million, that was comprised of $24 million of our Technologies Manufactured product segment and $11 million of the Service Revenue segment, which you can pull the service revenues off of our consolidated P&L. That compares to about $35 million a quarter before, but in the quarter before, certainly the service revenues were in the $16 million range. Broad stroke, we had $5 million worth of manufactured product sales and we had $5 million less of service revenues, which the service revenues, like most government businesses are lower operating margin part of the business. So that was a favorable mix. And I commented that we're running at the rate of $11 million to $12 million a quarter and the service revenues going forward here -- what we see the first half at least of 2010, but we still see sustainability with the manufactured products. And in addition to operating improvements that we've made and we've reposition the portfolio, our orders for products on the F-18 and other ones aftermarket products look very good here in the near term, and most of those are replacement for military products. So we do believe that, that number of -- the 11.8% is certainly a more realistic number than the mid-eights that we experienced in the first half of '09."

So you'll see, as opposed to seeing a one-time large order that we've had in the past, unlike we did at the end of 2008, we're seeing quarterly releases to pick up the annual buys. So we'll get a release at the end of the first quarter to cover the second quarter of 2011. So those will be pushed out a little bit.

And so what happened to us in terms of the forecast going forward was that we had a pretty good adjustment for 2010. So the base actually dropped in 2010 from the 2009 original forecast and we executed a growth strategy that puts us at about somewhere between 5% and 8% per year, year-over-year going forward. But that was lower than the previous anticipated forecast in terms of the out year, the terminal year and that's what actually drives the goodwill analysis, not only the revenue forecast but of course the cash flow, the resulting cash flows from that. So the analysis has taken from the terminal year and in perpetuity. So as we look at that, we forecast together, based on our realistic projection of what 2010 would look like and then the forecasted growth rate has some particular targeted programs, a little shift in our engineering development technology base, and then we look at about 5% to 8% going forward."

I read something just last Friday were Senator Reid is working on the smaller jobs bill and they're going to address that first and get through that legislation and the next priority is the R&D.

Your question on the CapEx, a lot of it is driven by new program development. As you might know, our depreciation and amortization is probably about $11 million to $12 million so we've been very modest with our CapEx and we can grow our base without having to have substantial increases in investments and capacity but most of our CapEx of above a minimum level of maintenance within our whole operations, which is really relatively small is for growth-oriented programs and business development.

We did see a dip, what we're looking out in the regional jet side as you look at the programs, it's pretty steady state from the third and fourth quarter. I wouldn't back up to the last first two quarters of 2009 because they were at higher rates than we anticipate going forward so the market place and then we had a couple of major one-time sales like the UCAS program in 2009, which will not repeat itself and we anticipate that program to start again about late 2010 or mid-2011 depending on how the testing goes in that program.

Correct? And yes, we pay about the current rate of $0.075 a quarter, it's $3 million we said $11 million so you have $14 million you need to subtract from our net cash from operations. There's two factors in addition to net income that impair tax cash flow from operations. It's our effective working capital management and software cycles, we'll pair our inventories and we'll have lower levels of receivable and convert to previous year's to cash so, that's certainly good but when we expand our business as we saw in '06 and '07, those are working capital users. So your model, you'd play with that depending on what your expectations to where our sales are going and where our business is going. The other component has to do with primarily on our technology side, Michael, is when we receive we call milestone payments, customer deposits in advance of doing work and in '08, we received about $15 million of those in the fourth quarter and in '09, we received about $7 million of those in the fourth quarter. It just depends on our ability to obtain those and that's a function of backlogs in getting purchase orders to do that kind of work. It's primarily the replacement rate or a type of business. So that's really the big swing."

And thank you for joining us today. I'd like to give you a brief overview of this quarter. After which, I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to discuss our financial results in detail. Let me start off by sa",876,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning everybody. And thank you for joining us today. I'd like to give you a brief overview of this quarter. After which, I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to discuss our financial results in detail. Let me start off by saying that this quarter, the first quarter of 2010, included a fair amount of positive developments internally that underscored our commitment to the company's future through a continued investment in new programs. Ducommun, along with the rest of the aerospace and defense industry, faced a good deal of headwinds over the past year. But we're now seeing signs of stabilization.
In the Military market, our fixed and rotary wing business remain solid as we expect it to be throughout the year. And particularly, we see a continued strong demand for the Black Hawk and Chinook helicopter programs due to the U.S. activity in Afghanistan, which is clearly suited for their mission profiles. In the commercial market, we see the overall environment improving, with global pasture in traffic expected to rebound somewhere between 2% and 4% this year. Recent announcements by Boeing and Airbus have been favorable, and commercial end markets appear to be strengthening.
As the global economy improves and assuming fuel prices remain relatively stable, we expect to see a recovery in new order bookings for the aircraft manufacturers. That said, we conservatively plan for the major programs such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 to continue their current rate of production through the end of 2010. With increased rates on the Boeing 777 and 747 in 2011 and 2012 respectively.
For the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, recent developments makes us feel more comfortable that things are moving in the right direction. We believe that destocking of inventory for the Dreamliner is progressing, and we expect to begin shipping products once again late in the third or fourth quarter after nearly a two-year hiatus.
During the quarter, we experienced only modest recovery in demand for the aftermarket of spares, which impacted our DTI bookings, margin of sales, margins in backlog. However, we're seeing a slight uptick in margin and would expect that the aftermarket recovery will accelerate in the second half of 2010. We are also cautiously optimistic about the recovery of the regional jet market, but not until later of this year and possibly running into 2011.
With the exception of the large executive jet class market, we expect the general aviation market to remain soft at the foreseeable future. The regional jet and general aviation markets have historically represented between 10% and 15% of our business. However, we are lower than that this year.
Let me briefly give you some color to our revenue and margins this quarter versus last year. Our AeroStructures business was off nearly 3% in the first quarter of 2010 versus 2009 due to lower Apache and regional jet sales, partially offset by higher sales to RUAG on the Bombardier 700 and 900 series aircraft and on higher commercial fixed wings product. Our margins within this segment were impacted, as expected, by startup investment costs associated with several new products. This margin compression reflects the short-term impact of new applications and programs, which are considered to be key to drive future growth. We expect better operating performance as we ramp up production on new subassemblies while focusing on productivity improvements. Our main initiatives will help improve our operating leverages. Production volume increases in the second half of 2010.
In terms of specific new business development initiatives, I'm speaking of the RUAG Bombardier Fuselage Assembly program, the engineering, design and development of wing movables for the Embraer new 450 and 550 series aircraft and the V-22 contract with Bell Helicopter, as well as some other previously announced and unannounced new business development programs. While we continue to be driving operating performance improvements across the existing business, we recognize the importance of investing in these programs to position the company for future profitable growth. 
As you probably know, there is sometimes the lag between the time that Ducommun wins an award and when it is announced, following customer approval. For example, we do currently have several unannounced new program wins in-house. We continue to work diligently on new program growth as we execute our internal growth strategy and are optimistic about the new business opportunity. 
Moving to Ducommun Technology. We saw a sales slide of 13% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a decline in our Engineering Service businesses. This has been due to lower levels of funding on the RDT&E projects, delays in order releases of new projects and more government insourcing. Our manufactured technology product sales were up slightly as we fare better with increased deliveries of radar rack products, somewhat offset by the lower military and commercial spare sales for electronic components. 
While margins within DTI reflect overall lower sales on spares, they are also impacted by investments made during the quarter and product development, in particular, for a new radar assembly. As with the aerostructures unit, we are investing in new programs that will lead to the higher growth and improvement in the operating performance in the future. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe Bellino for our financial review."
267761,100806506,64283,"Ducommun Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-04-2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As Tony just discussed, we reported solid results for the quarter, posting net income of $4.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share versus $2.6 million $0.25 per diluted share a year ago. Now I'd like to provide some",1028,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As Tony just discussed, we reported solid results for the quarter, posting net income of $4.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share versus $2.6 million $0.25 per diluted share a year ago. Now I'd like to provide some more color. Sales in the quarter were $104 million or about 6% year-over-year. As Tony noted earlier, we experienced a 3% decrease in our aerostructures or DAS segment, primarily from softer sales in business and regional jets and lower delivery for the Apache helicopter program. While on the positive side, our large aircraft programs and our commercial helicopter products showed solid growth.
In the technology segment, DTI, we saw a 13% decline in sales. A large portion of which was primarily attributed to a 32% decrease in our engineering services revenue. We commented upon this in our fourth quarter earnings call, and was a result of the reduced funding in Military market. Our technology's manufacture products did show a slight increase and higher shipments in radar rack products, which more than offset the continuing softness that we've seen for the last several months in aftermarket products.
Turning to our operating income. Overall, it rose to $6.8 million or 6.6% of revenue from $4.5 million or 4% of revenue a year ago. We estimated that our startup costs associated with several new programs, which generated $3.1 million in revenues during the quarter, affected our operating income by $1.8 million or 240 basis points. To note, last year's operating income included a $4.4 million inventory reserve charge for the Eclipse Aviation bankruptcy filing in March of 2009. Otherwise, if we add that back in on an adjusted basis, operating income last year would have been 8.9% or 8% of our revenues. 
I'll address the decline in this year's first quarter to last year's adjusted operating income in my segment breakdown. Per segment breakdown is in the Ducommun AeroStructures. The operating income improved to $7.5 million or 10.6% of revenues, compared to $4 million or 5.5% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted operating income basis, excluding the inventory reserve that I just mentioned earlier, the income last year was $8.3 million or 11.5% of revenues. So this year's operating income was off 90 basis points from the adjusted results a year ago. These were primary results of the lower volumes and startup costs related to development of new business on several programs including the RUAG/Bombardier fuselage assembly, engineering work on the Embraer, the V-22 contract with the Bell Helicopter and a few other programs.
We expect these startup costs to continue to the balance of the year, although at a lower impact level going forward than we experienced and noted in the first quarter. Further, margin declines from lower sales in the other areas were somewhat offset by productivity gains that we continue to realize from our lean manufacturing initiatives.
Looking at the Ducommun Technologies operating income, that decreased to $2.4 million or 7.1% of sales versus last year's numbers of $3.3 million or 8.5% operating margins, a drop of 140 basis points. The drop was primarily a result of investments we made during the quarter in product development, related to a new radar rack assembly. Otherwise, we saw declining margins from the lower revenues at our Engineering Services business and reduced sales of aftermarket products. We offset a large portion of these items through increased shipments of radar rack products and continuing efficiency from lean manufacturing initiatives.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses were about 3% lower than last year, despite a $600,000 increase in expenses related to amortization of intangible assets. We continue to manage the cost environment very effectively.
Turning to our business mix and backlog in the current economic environment, we saw our business mix shift to a greater increase in commercial sales. And for the quarter, our business was comprised of 58% military, 40% commercial and 2% space, compared to where we were a year ago, which was 61% military, 37% commercial and 2% space in last year's first quarter. At quarter end, the company's backlog stood at 332 million.
We have had no major program losses, but we have experienced delays from our customers and follow-on orders for a variety of programs including the F-18, the Apache and C-17 programs. We expect follow-on orders for these programs now that it about to be booked in the second quarter and/or in the third quarter. We are optimistic with regards to additional new program wins. And with recent new programs ramping up in 2010, we expect increased backlog levels going forward.
During the quarter, as a normal reflection of our cash flow and business cycle, we used $21 million in cash from operations. It is $2 million improvement over last year, and this is a consistent pattern we have experienced over the last several years. Typically, we are cash users in the first six months of the year. And in the second half of the year, we are a significant cash generator. We continue to focus on effective working capital management by improving inventory turns and increasing our efforts and success in accounts receivable collection.
We continue to maintain a low leverage position regarding our debt, and at quarter end, our net debt to cap ratio was 12%. We feel that given the current economic environment, which still is improving but it is an environment that still has certain amount of uncertainty in the credit market, that we're in an excellent position to be in to weather this environment. We expect our CapEx for the year to be about $11 million, as compared to slightly less than $8 million a year ago. And the increase reflects primarily to new program growth.
Before turning the call back over to Tony, let me just say this, we entered the second quarter of 2010. We believe our strong financial position and our credit profile will allows us to take advantage of several market opportunities to position the company for future growth, improving operating performance and allowing us to make successful acquisition. 
With that, I'd like to ask Tony Reardon to make some additional remarks."

And so we feel very positive about it that at some point in time, especially when the commercial aircraft cycle begins to surge up and we start seeing more bookings for the 777 [Boeing 777] and the 787 [Boeing 787], that will be a key to seeing our backlogs improve appreciably."

In other words, you don't throw all the spares business, for example, and some of the other technology businesses. Our backlog is booked and shipped. So if you just take the Engineering Services business, for example, we'll experience bookings this year that will support the revenue base for this year, anything on the technology side. But with regard to the overall bookings, we're expecting in the second and third quarter some pretty significant bookings on the C-17. We've got a multi-year contract that we're working on that. We expect that Apache tail rotors and main rotors to be booked in the second, if possible, and then possibly the third quarter for a follow on. And then the F-18 program will we booked in the second quarter. So of the major programs that we have in the coming -- will be put into the backlog in the second and third quarter. With regards to the Blackhawk, when that program is being booked, this is primarily being booked by the 737 quarter-over-quarter, so we continue to see that growth. And we're under a long-term contract on that program through 2012 right now."

If we break it down by the bad side of it, because of the manufacturing cycle that the AeroStructure business is in, our strongest two quarters are the second and the third. The fourth quarter is typically our weakest quarter because of the holidays and our customers don't pool inventory at the end of the year, and that gets carried over into the following year. And then, our first quarter is about our third strongest quarter. We've had that same cycle through the ends of the year. So the implications are, we ought to get operating the leverage in the second and third quarter from expansion of our business. And then, in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, we have some margin compression. So we see a variation sequentially during the year. On the DTI side, because a big portion of our products are in the manufacturing products, the radar racks and these other products, we generally see a lot stronger growth in the third quarter and fourth quarter, with emphasis on the fourth quarter. So the DTI cycle builds through sequentially from the first quarter to the fourth quarter typically, and that's what we would expect this year. We have programs onboard like for the APG-79, for the F-18, and we also have 63-V program for the F-15, and the customer usually pulls those in the fourth quarter of the year at a greater rate than the three previous."

And thank you for joining us today. I'd like to give you a brief overview of this quarter. After which, I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to discuss our financial results in detail. Let me start off by sa",874,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning everybody. And thank you for joining us today. I'd like to give you a brief overview of this quarter. After which, I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to discuss our financial results in detail. Let me start off by saying that this quarter, the first quarter of 2010, included a fair amount of positive developments internally that underscored our commitment to the company's future through a continued investment in new programs. Ducommun, along with the rest of the aerospace and defense industry, faced a good deal of headwinds over the past year. But we're now seeing signs of stabilization.
In the Military market, our fixed and rotary wing business remain solid as we expect it to be throughout the year. And particularly, we see a continued strong demand for the Black Hawk and Chinook helicopter programs due to the U.S. activity in Afghanistan, which is clearly suited for their mission profiles. In the commercial market, we see the overall environment improving, with global pasture in traffic expected to rebound somewhere between 2% and 4% this year. Recent announcements by Boeing and Airbus have been favorable, and commercial end markets appear to be strengthening.
As the global economy improves and assuming fuel prices remain relatively stable, we expect to see a recovery in new order bookings for the aircraft manufacturers. That said, we conservatively plan for the major programs such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 to continue their current rate of production through the end of 2010. With increased rates on the Boeing 777 and 747 in 2011 and 2012 respectively.
For the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, recent developments makes us feel more comfortable that things are moving in the right direction. We believe that destocking of inventory for the Dreamliner is progressing, and we expect to begin shipping products once again late in the third or fourth quarter after nearly a two-year hiatus.
During the quarter, we experienced only modest recovery in demand for the aftermarket of spares, which impacted our DTI bookings, margin of sales, margins in backlog. However, we're seeing a slight uptick in margin and would expect that the aftermarket recovery will accelerate in the second half of 2010. We are also cautiously optimistic about the recovery of the regional jet market, but not until later of this year and possibly running into 2011.
With the exception of the large executive jet class market, we expect the general aviation market to remain soft at the foreseeable future. The regional jet and general aviation markets have historically represented between 10% and 15% of our business. However, we are lower than that this year.
Let me briefly give you some color to our revenue and margins this quarter versus last year. Our AeroStructures business was off nearly 3% in the first quarter of 2010 versus 2009 due to lower Apache and regional jet sales, partially offset by higher sales to RUAG on the Bombardier 700 and 900 series aircraft and on higher commercial fixed wings product. Our margins within this segment were impacted, as expected, by startup investment costs associated with several new products. This margin compression reflects the short-term impact of new applications and programs, which are considered to be key to drive future growth. We expect better operating performance as we ramp up production on new subassemblies while focusing on productivity improvements. Our main initiatives will help improve our operating leverages. Production volume increases in the second half of 2010.
In terms of specific new business development initiatives, I'm speaking of the RUAG Bombardier Fuselage Assembly program, the engineering, design and development of wing movables for the Embraer new 450 and 550 series aircraft and the V-22 contract with Bell Helicopter, as well as some other previously announced and unannounced new business development programs. While we continue to be driving operating performance improvements across the existing business, we recognize the importance of investing in these programs to position the company for future profitable growth. 
As you probably know, there is sometimes a lag between the time that Ducommun wins an award and when it is announced, following customer approval. For example, we do currently have several unannounced new program wins in-house. We continue to work diligently on new program growth as we execute our internal growth strategy and are optimistic about the new business opportunity. 
Moving to Ducommun Technology. We saw sales slide 13% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a decline in our Engineering Service businesses. This has been due to lower levels of funding on the RDT&E projects, delays in order releases of new projects and more government insourcing. Our manufactured technology product sales were up slightly as we fare better with increased deliveries of radar rack products, somewhat offset by the lower military and commercial spare sales for electronic components. 
While margins within DTI reflect overall lower sales on spares, they are also impacted by investments made during the quarter in product development, in particular, for a new radar assembly. As with the aerostructures unit, we are investing in new programs that will lead to the higher growth and improvement in the operating performance in the future. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe Bellino for our financial review."
267761,100806506,67223,"Ducommun Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-04-2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As Tony just discussed, we reported solid results for the quarter, posting net income of $4.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share versus $2.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share a year ago. Now I'd like to provide s",1030,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As Tony just discussed, we reported solid results for the quarter, posting net income of $4.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share versus $2.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share a year ago. Now I'd like to provide some more color. Sales in the quarter were $104 million. They were down 6% year-over-year. As Tony noted earlier, we experienced a 3% decrease in our aerostructures or DAS segment, primarily from softer sales in business and regional jets and lower delivery for the Apache helicopter program. While on the positive side, our large aircraft programs and our commercial helicopter products showed solid growth.
In the technology segment, DTI, we saw a 13% decline in sales, a large portion of which was primarily attributed to a 32% decrease in our engineering services revenue. We commented upon this on our fourth quarter earnings call and was a result of the reduced funding in Military market. Our technology's manufacture products did show a slight increase and higher shipments in radar rack products, which more than offset the continuing softness that we've seen for the last several months in aftermarket products.
Turning to our operating income. Overall, it rose to $6.8 million or 6.6% of revenue from $4.5 million or 4% of revenue a year ago. We estimated that our startup costs associated with several new programs, which generated $3.1 million in revenues during the quarter, affected our operating income by $1.8 million or 240 basis points. To note, last year's operating income included a $4.4 million inventory reserve charge for the Eclipse Aviation bankruptcy filing in March of 2009. Otherwise, if we add that back in on an adjusted basis, operating income last year would have been 8.9% or 8% of our revenues. 
I'll address the decline in this year's first quarter to last year's adjusted operating income in my segment breakdown. Per segment breakdown is in the Ducommun AeroStructures. The operating income improved to $7.5 million or 10.6% of revenues, compared to $4 million or 5.5% of revenues a year ago. On an adjusted operating income basis, excluding the inventory reserve that I just mentioned earlier, the income last year was $8.3 million or 11.5% of revenues. So this year's operating income was off 90 basis points from the adjusted results a year ago. These were primary results of the lower volumes and startup costs related to development of new business on several programs including the RUAG/Bombardier fuselage assembly, engineering work on the Embraer, the V-22 contract with the Bell Helicopter and a few other programs.
We expect these startup costs to continue to the balance of the year, although at a lower impact level going forward than we experienced and noted in the first quarter. Further, margin declines from lower sales in the other areas were somewhat offset by productivity gains that we continue to realize from our lean manufacturing initiatives.
Looking at the Ducommun Technologies operating income, that decreased to $2.4 million or 7.1% of sales versus last year's numbers of $3.3 million or 8.5% operating margins, a drop of 140 basis points. The drop was primarily a result of investments we made during the quarter in product development, related to a new radar rack assembly. Otherwise, we saw declining margins from the lower revenues at our Engineering Services business and reduced sales of aftermarket products. We offset a large portion of these items through increased shipments of radar rack products and continuing efficiency from lean manufacturing initiatives.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses were about 3% lower than last year, despite a $600,000 increase in expenses related to amortization of intangible assets. We continue to manage the cost environment very effectively.
Turning to our business mix and backlog in the current economic environment, we saw our business mix shift to a greater increase in commercial sales. And for the quarter, our business was comprised of 58% military, 40% commercial and 2% space, compared to where we were a year ago, which was 61% military, 37% commercial and 2% space in last year's first quarter. At quarter end, the company's backlog stood at 332 million.
We have had no major program losses, but we have experienced delays from our customers and follow-on orders for a variety of programs including the F-18, the Apache and C-17 programs. We expect follow-on orders for these programs now that it about to be booked in the second quarter and/or in the third quarter. We are optimistic with regards to additional new program wins. And with recent new programs ramping up in 2010, we expect increased backlog levels going forward.
During the quarter, as a normal reflection of our cash flow and business cycle, we used $21 million in cash from operations. It is $2 million improvement over last year, and this is a consistent pattern we have experienced over the last several years. Typically, we are cash users in the first six months of the year. And in the second half of the year, we are a significant cash generator. We continue to focus on effective working capital management by improving inventory turns and increasing our efforts and success in accounts receivable collection.
We continue to maintain a low leverage position regarding our debt, and at quarter end, our net debt to cap ratio was 12%. We feel that given the current economic environment, which still is improving but it is an environment that still has certain amount of uncertainty in the credit market, that we're in an excellent position to be in to weather this environment. We expect our CapEx for the year to be about $11 million, as compared to slightly less than $8 million a year ago. And the increase reflects primarily to new program growth.
Before turning the call back over to Tony, let me just say this, we entered the second quarter of 2010. We believe our strong financial position and our credit profile will allows us to take advantage of several market opportunities to position the company for future growth, improving operating performance and allowing us to make successful acquisition. 
With that, I'd like to ask Tony Reardon to make some additional remarks."

Before turning the call over to questions, let me summarize a few key points about the state of our business. As Joe mentioned, we ended the first quarter of 2010 with a backlog of $332 million, down slightly from year end. We have a number of follow-on contracts, which Joe discussed, which we anticipate booking in the second and third quarters of this year. In addition, we are currently bidding on a strong pipeline of opportunities on multiple high-profile platforms, which will enhance our future growth.
We're also actively pursuing appropriate acquisition candidates to complement our current product offering and in line with our strategic growth objectives. Going forward, we're very optimistic about the commercial aerospace outlook, including the Boeing 787. This program is likely to be a solid contributor to our internal growth heading into next year. We are becoming more positive about 2010 and 2011 as the overall market improvement gains traction.
The company will continue to focus on the fundamentals so that we are favorably positioned for possible growth as the market turns. We are winning new awards and expanding the breadth and depth of our applications while still managing costs and continuing to focus on operational lessons and effective working capital management. These steps are expected to lead to improvement in our operational performance, particularly as the commercial markets rebound. Management at Ducommun is very much aligned with the shareholders as we take all the steps necessary to strengthen the company as a leading aerospace supplier on key programs that stand to benefit from a stronger global economy. And now, Maria, I'd like to turn the call over for questions, please."

In addition, relative to the whole area of bookings, we talked specifically in our prepared remarks that's related to the radar rack business that we have secured for years, then we announced that back in October of '08 and it has helped buoy our sales during the quarter. So it's just been the customer there. Raytheon hasn't issued us the purchase orders and the way we book them on an accounting basis, they don't show up. As well as the C-17, Boeing is looking at, right now, they're looking at about three years out, with more of the awards on the foreign military sales as opposed to looking at it one year at a time, that and some other programs. We're very positive and very optimistic about it. We continue to ship and fulfill and improve our customer deliveries. Certainly that has the short-term effect of reducing our backlog.

We expect that Apache tail rotors and main rotors to be booked in the second, if possible, and then possibly the third quarter for a follow on. And then the F-18 program will we booked in the second quarter. So of the major programs that we have in the coming -- will be put into the backlog in the second and third quarter.

And then, our first quarter is about our third strongest quarter. We've had that same cycle through the ends of the year. So the implications are, we ought to get operating the leverage in the second and third quarter from expansion of our business. And then, in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, we have some margin compression. So we see a variation sequentially during the year. On the DTI side, because a big portion of our products are in the manufacturing products, the radar racks and these other products, we generally see a lot stronger growth in the third quarter and fourth quarter, with emphasis on the fourth quarter. So the DTI cycle builds through sequentially from the first quarter to the fourth quarter typically, and that's what we would expect this year.

I'd like to give you a brief overview of this quarter, after which, I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to discuss our financial results in detail. 
As expected, Ducommun is seeing signs of improvement within our commercial markets and continued stabilization in a large portion of our military markets heading into the second half of 2010. This is setting the stage for growth for next year. 
Our overall revenue fell slightly due primarily to lower sales of our Engineering Services division. We posted 4% growth in our manufactured products, and our margins improved across-the-board. 
More importantly, we were very pleased by the number of contract wins this quarter, particularly with regard to the new business development initiatives which is expected to drive revenue acceleration going forward. These awards show the depth of our partnerships with top-tier OEMs, as Ducommun is called upon to provide integrated next-generation solutions across the broad spectrum of aerospace applications. Many of these awards have not yet shown a surge in the company's backlog either because they are under development, or because the associated purchase orders will take place in installments. But we are winning long-term development and production contracts with an excellent array of key customers.
As an example, Ducommun Technologies received an award from Boeing for the retrofit of the Caution Light Panels on the F-18 cockpits, as the U.S. Navy warning system upgrade. DTI was also awarded a contact on the new engine starts which is on the next generation Boeing 737. These rotary switches will support all miles in production and aftermarket spares, including Boeing classic platforms,  and the production will begin in 2011. 
Likewise, at Ducommun AeroStructures, we were awarded several exciting contracts to illustrate our growth in a more complex sub-assembly. The Latecoere Group selected us for stretch-formed nose-fairing assembly panels in the Airbus A350 and also awarded us contract to supply fuselage and door skins on the Embraer or the ERJ-170 and 190 through 2015. 
In addition, we received a contract from TIGHITCO for the upturned exhaust system sub-assemblies and another components for the Sikorsky Blackhawk helicopter. This is a system that will help lower the helicopters' exhaust IR [infrared] signature. It will be used not only in the production, but will support a significant retrofit program.
We view these wins as a validation that we're doing what we set out to do: play a greater role in the critical aerospace programs and in doing so, make Ducommun a leading Tier 2 player, boosting the company's long-term organic growth. 
As the year progresses, we expect our backlog to grow due to these program wins and as well as follow-on orders from existing programs, including the F-18, F-15, Apache, C-17 and Carson helicopter programs. We also expect the commercial market's upward momentum will accelerate the second half of this year. And we'd see increased rates on the Boeing 737, 747 and 777 programs, as well as start-up on the 787 program and the Airbus A320. These programs will see higher rates in 2011 and 2012. At the same time, we do anticipate a modest rebound in demand of the aftermarket spares in the second half of 2010.
Now before turning the call over to Joe Bellino, let me briefly add some color to our revenue and margins for this quarter. 
Our AeroStructures business was off about 2% in the second quarter of 2010 versus 2009 due to lower military and commercial helicopter sales, partially offset by higher sales to RUAG on the Bombardier 700 and 900 series aircraft and on higher fixed wing and commercial programs. We were pleased to see our margins within this segment improve sequentially. 
Moving to Ducommun Technologies. We saw sales increase 2% year-over-year, despite a 29% decline in our Engineering Services business. A 25% increase occurred within manufactured technology products, boosted by deliveries of radar racks and other electronic components. We're pleased to see DTI operating margins expand, both year-over-year and sequentially from the first quarter, reflecting a more favorable revenue mix and continued productivity enhancements. As with our AeroStructures units, we are investing in new programs that will lead to higher growth and improved operating performance. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe Bellino. Joe?"
267761,109055393,77558,"Ducommun Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported solid results in the second quarter, posting net income of $5.7 million or $0.53 per fully diluted share compared to $4.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share a year ago. Now let me give",1445,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported solid results in the second quarter, posting net income of $5.7 million or $0.53 per fully diluted share compared to $4.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share a year ago. 
Now let me give some color. Some of the financial highlights I will touch upon are the following. Operating income and margins improved both sequentially and year-over-year. We generated $12 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, and we expect our backlogs to increase in the second half of 2010. 
In terms of sales, second quarter sales of $102 million were down 1% year-over-year. We experienced a 2% decline in sales within our Ducommun AeroStructures segment, DAS, primarily from softer sales in military and commercial helicopter products; while our large fixed wing commercial and fixed wing military aircraft programs showed solid growth. 
In the Technologies segment, we saw a 2% increase in revenues despite a 29% decrease in Engineering Services revenues as a result of reduced government funding. Our manufactured products posted a 25% increase, with higher shipments in replacement radar racks and electronic component.
Looking at our operating income by segment. Ducommun's operating income for the quarter rose 19% to $9 million or 8.8% of revenue from $7.6 million or 7.3% of revenue, as we experienced operating margin improvement in both segments. The 8.8% overall margin for the quarter marked an uptick not only year-over-year, but also sequentially from the first quarter's 6.6%. 
As noted in our release, we had a favorable adjustment during the period of approximately $1.1 million related to the reversal of certain accounts payables accruals recorded in prior periods. 
In addition, we absorbed a $1.1 million expense in start-up and development costs for several new programs which generated sales during the quarter of $2.8 million, and these program were started and we reported on them in the first quarter of 2010. The amount of these costs were down from the first quarter, and we expect them to be reduced sequentially to the balance of the year.
Operating income for the second quarter of 2009 was adversely impacted by an inventory valuation adjustment of $800,000. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2010 would have been $9 million or 9% of revenues compared to an adjusted $8.4 million or 8% of revenues in 2009. 
While gross margins improved, operating income was adversely impacted by an increase of $600,000 in amortization expenses and higher accrued compensation compared to last year's second quarter. 
DAS' operating income improved to $9.2 million and resulted in 13.5% of revenue compared to $7 million or 10.2% of revenue a year ago. This higher operating income reflects a more favorable product mix, driven by increases in the commercial aerospace sector and military fixed wing products and continued operating efficiencies.
DTI's operating income increased to $3.4 million or 9.7% of sales versus $2.9 million or 8.4% last year. This improvement of margin of 130 basis points year-over-year was primarily a result of increased shipments of radar rack products and increases in technology products and continuing efficiencies that we are benefiting from our lean manufacturing activity. 
In terms of looking at our business mix and backlog, in the current economic environment, we saw our business mix shift slightly to a greater percentage of commercial sales; such at the end of the second quarter, our mix of business was 58% military, 40% commercial and 2% space compared to last year's 58% military, 39% commercial and 3% space.
At quarter end, the backlog stood at $306 million. We have had no major program losses, but we have experienced some delays, as Tony reported on, and on follow-on orders for the F-18, F-15, the Apache, C-17 and the Carson helicopter programs. We expect the follow-on orders for these programs to be booked in the third or fourth quarters. We are also optimistic with regard to additional new program wins. And with the recent new programs ramping up in 2010, we expect increased backlog levels going forward.
Now if I may comment on the first half 2010 results. Ducommun's net income was $9.9 million or $0.94 a share, per fully diluted share, in fiscal 2010 versus $7.2 million or $0.69 per fully diluted share a year ago. Our first half sales decreased 4% to $207 million from $215 million in 2009, primarily as a result of a 31% decrease in Engineering Services revenues, while our manufacturing products revenues increased slightly for the first six months. 
DAS' sales decreased about 2.5% to $138 million from $142 million in the first six months, as solid growth in fixed wing products, both large commercial and military aircraft, were not enough to offset lower revenue from military helicopter products and regional and business jets. 
DTI's first half revenues were down about 6%, reflecting shortfalls in aftermarket sales and Engineering Services revenues despite significant growth in radar rack products. DTI posted 13% growth in manufactured technology products, and that more than offset the 31% drop in the Engineering Services revenues. 
Our first half operating income for Ducommun showed an increase by 31% to $15.9 million or 7.7% of revenues compared to $12 million or 5.6% of revenues a year ago. First half results included a favorable inventory adjustment of $1.1 million, which I mentioned earlier, offset by approximately $2.9 million in accumulative start-up and development costs which generated nearly $6 million in sales in the first half. About 90% of the 2010 start-up and development costs can be attributable to the DAS business segment. 
First half 2009 results were negatively impacted by $5.1 million or 2.4 percentage points due to an inventory reserve of $4.3 million related to the bankruptcy filing and an inventory valuation adjustment of $800,000 that I mentioned in the second quarter's report. On an adjusted basis, operating income for the first half would have been $17.7 million or 8.8% of revenues, contrasting that to $17.3 million or 8% of revenues in the prior six months.
DAS' first half 2010 reporting operating income was $16.6 million or 12% of revenues, compared to the reported results of $11 million or 7.8% of revenue a year ago. On a pro forma basis, if we back out the first half development costs in 2010, it's related sales of $5.9 million and the inventory adjustments in both 2010 and 2009, DAS' operating income would have been $18 million or 13.5% of revenue compared to $16.2 million or 11.4% of revenue in 2009. We were pleased to see that DAS' operating margin has improved over 200 basis points on an adjusted basis year-over-year.
For DTI, despite the favorable revenue shift in higher-margin technology products compared to Engineering Services revenues, first half 2010 operating income of $5.8 million, which was 8.4% of revenues, was lower as compared to the $6.3 million or 8.6% of revenues in 2009. 
You will note in my earlier comments that DTI's operating margins in the second quarter of 2010 was 9.7%, up sequentially both from this year's first quarter and higher than the comparable 2009 quarter. We have significant momentum going there, and we expect to continue this momentum in operating margin improvement throughout the balance of 2010.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first six months are running at 12.4% as compared to 11.6% for the first half of 2009, and they're largely as a result of expenses related to amortization of intangible expenses and slightly higher compensation accruals. Cost controls remain in effect. 
Commenting now on liquidity and capital resources. During the quarter, we generated nearly $12 million in cash flow from operations, bringing our year-to-date cash from operations to a negative $9 million, which is $6 million better than the comparable period last year. The improvements during the quarter were the result of increased amounts of operating income, depreciation and amortization as well as improved receivables management. 
Typically, we are a cash user in the first six months of the year, as we're seeing this year and in the past. And in the second half of the year, we are a cash generator. We continue to focus on effective working capital management by improving inventory turns and increasing accounts receivable management. 
We also continue to maintain a low-leverage position. At quarter end, our net-debt-to-capital ratio was 9%. We feel that given the current static economic environment and uncertainty in the credit markets, this is an excellent position for us to be in. We expect CapEx in 2010 to be approximately $9 million and compares to slightly less than $8 million a year ago. 
Now I would like to ask Tony Reardon to make some additional remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over to questions, let me just hit a few key points. 
First, our operating margins continue to improve, and we will take every measure necessary to ensure optimum asset utilization. In that vein, we're currently evaluating additional facility consolidations and capacity rationalization as part of our productivity enhancement initiatives. More specifically, we're reviewing the implementation of a plan to move certain operations and in doing so, improve facility utilization in support of our growth for many new programs. We see this starting in the second half of 2010, to be completed no later than the first quarter of 2011. While total expenses and payback scenarios are still being analyzed, we envision the cost to be around $1 million to $1.5 million, spreading over the next three quarters, with significant positive ROI beginning in 2011. 
Second, we're winning new business programs which will fuel growth for 2011. We will continue to invest in the development programs as a means to broaden our product offering and drive our internal growth objectives. As Joe mentioned, we have a number of follow-on contracts which we anticipate will be booked in the second half of 2010, increasing our backlog for this year. 
And third, we're optimistic that the commercial aerospace recovery is taking hold, and that the impact will position Ducommun for higher revenue in the quarters to come. 
In summary, 2010 is playing out as expected, and we're pleased that our business units are improving their operating performance and as demand trends begin to turn in our favor.

But having said that, they both announced higher rates, talked about higher rate production on their commercial aircraft program. The military side was more conversations around higher requirements for military sales. And that's where, I think, they see their market growth opportunities, which we encourage obviously and we'll support. And then, not much talk on the space side obviously and with the budget influx.

I think when we look at the modeling, we have to factor in the start-up and development costs, plus the spread of this $1 million to $1.5 million costs over the next three quarters for our capacity expansions and rationalizations and better asset utilization. So that being said -- and the environment still is somewhat stabilized in some sectors, as we talked about. I'm giving you a little backdrop on it. But what we do expect in the third quarter in terms of overall deliveries, we expect a good continued modest increase in the Large Aircraft segment and some nominal growth in the Regional and Business Aircraft segment; and also in the fixed wing military, which is C-17 is stable but F-15 and F-18. So we do see some nominal growth there. We still have the issue of where the Apache now did about $7 million this quarter. We're still looking at $6 million to $6.5 million. And without going through all the programs, we see a slight improvement in sales here in the third quarter, but not robust or a step change yet. So as we manage through our psychology, as we recognize the costs we're going to incur, we continue to work on improving our revenue mix and also continued focus on operating efficiencies to try to keep these margins normally where they are, but modestly expand them in this environment."

As expected, Ducommun is seeing signs",716,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'd like to give you a brief overview of this quarter, after which, I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to discuss our financial results in detail. 
As expected, Ducommun is seeing signs of improvement within our commercial markets and continued stabilization in a large portion of our military markets heading into the second half of 2010. This is setting the stage for growth for next year. 
Our overall revenue fell slightly due primarily to lower sales of our Engineering Services division. We posted 4% growth in our manufactured products, and our margins improved across-the-board. 
More importantly, we were very pleased by the number of contract wins this quarter, particularly with regard to the new business development initiatives which is expected to drive revenue acceleration going forward. These awards show the depth of our partnerships with top-tier OEMs, as Ducommun is called upon to provide integrated next-generation solutions across the broad spectrum of aerospace applications. Many of these awards have not yet shown a surge in the company's backlog either because they are under development, or because the associated purchase orders will take place in installments. But we are winning long-term development and production contracts with an excellent array of key customers.
As an example, Ducommun Technologies received an award from Boeing for the retrofit of the Caution Light Panels on the F-18 cockpits, as the U.S. Navy warning system upgrade. DTI was also awarded a contract on the new engine starts which is on the next-generation Boeing 737. These rotary switches will support all miles in production and aftermarket spares, including Boeing classic platforms, and the production will begin in 2011. 
Likewise, at Ducommun AeroStructures, we were awarded several exciting contracts to illustrate our growth in a more complex sub-assembly. The Latecoere Group selected us for stretch-formed nose-fairing assembly panels in the Airbus A350 and also awarded us contract to supply fuselage and door skins on the Embraer or the ERJ-170 and 190 through 2015. 
In addition, we received a contract from TIGHITCO for the upturned exhaust system sub-assemblies and other components for the Sikorsky Blackhawk helicopter. This is a system that will help lower the helicopters' exhaust IR [infrared] signature. It will be used not only in the production, but will support a significant retrofit program.
We view these wins as a validation that we're doing what we set out to do: play a greater role in the critical aerospace programs and in doing so, make Ducommun a leading Tier 2 player, boosting the company's long-term organic growth. 
As the year progresses, we expect our backlog to grow due to these program wins and as well as follow-on orders from existing programs, including the F-18, F-15, Apache, C-17 and Carson Helicopter programs. We also expect the commercial market's upward momentum will accelerate the second half of this year, and we see increased rates on the Boeing 737, 747 and 777 programs, as well as start-up on the 787 program and the Airbus A320. These programs will see higher rates in 2011 and 2012. At the same time, we do anticipate a modest rebound in demand of the aftermarket spares in the second half of 2010.
Now before turning the call over to Joe Bellino, let me briefly add some color to our revenue and margins for this quarter. 
Our AeroStructures business was off about 2% in the second quarter of 2010 versus 2009 due to lower military and commercial helicopter sales, partially offset by higher sales to RUAG on the Bombardier 700 and 900 series aircraft and on higher fixed wing and commercial programs. We were pleased to see our margins within this segment improve sequentially. 
Moving to Ducommun Technologies. We saw sales increase 2% year-over-year, despite a 29% decline in our Engineering Services business. A 25% increase occurred within manufactured technology products, boosted by deliveries of radar racks and other electronic components. We're pleased to see DTI operating margins expand, both year-over-year and sequentially from the first quarter, reflecting a more favorable revenue mix and continued productivity enhancements. As with our AeroStructures units, we are investing in new programs that will lead to higher growth and improved operating performance. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe Bellino. Joe?"
267761,109055393,77582,"Ducommun Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported solid results in the second quarter, posting net income of $5.7 million or $0.53 per fully diluted share compared to $4.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share a year ago. Now let me give",1445,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported solid results in the second quarter, posting net income of $5.7 million or $0.53 per fully diluted share compared to $4.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share a year ago. 
Now let me give some color. Some of the financial highlights I will touch upon are the following: Operating income and margins improved both sequentially and year-over-year. We generated $12 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, and we expect our backlogs to increase in the second half of 2010. 
In terms of sales, second quarter sales of $102 million were down 1% year-over-year. We experienced a 2% decline in sales within our Ducommun AeroStructures segment, DAS, primarily from softer sales in military and commercial helicopter products; while our large fixed wing commercial and fixed wing military aircraft programs showed solid growth. 
In the Technologies segment, we saw a 2% increase in revenues despite a 29% decrease in Engineering Services revenues as a result of reduced government funding. Our manufactured products posted a 25% increase, with higher shipments in replacement radar racks and electronic components.
Looking at our operating income by segment, Ducommun's operating income for the quarter rose 19% to $9 million or 8.8% of revenue from $7.6 million or 7.3% of revenue, as we experienced operating margin improvement in both segments. The 8.8% overall margin for the quarter marked an uptick not only year-over-year, but also sequentially from the first quarter's 6.6%. 
As noted in our release, we had a favorable adjustment during the period of approximately $1.1 million related to the reversal of certain accounts payables accruals recorded in prior periods. 
In addition, we absorbed a $1.1 million expense in start-up and development costs for several new programs which generated sales during the quarter of $2.8 million, and these programs were started and we reported on them in the first quarter of 2010. The amount of these costs were down from the first quarter, and we expect them to be reduced sequentially through the balance of the year.
Operating income for the second quarter of 2009 was adversely impacted by an inventory valuation adjustment of $800,000. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2010 would have been $9 million or 9% of revenues compared to an adjusted $8.4 million or 8% of revenues in 2009. 
While gross margins improved, operating income was adversely impacted by an increase of $600,000 in amortization expenses and higher accrued compensation compared to last year's second quarter. 
DAS' operating income improved to $9.2 million and resulted in 13.5% of revenue compared to $7 million or 10.2% of revenue a year ago. This higher operating income reflects a more favorable product mix, driven by increases in the commercial aerospace sector and military fixed wing products and continued operating efficiencies.
DTI's operating income increased to $3.4 million or 9.7% of sales versus $2.9 million or 8.4% last year. This improvement of margin of 130 basis points year-over-year was primarily a result of increased shipments of radar rack products and increases in technology products and continuing efficiencies that we are benefiting from our lean manufacturing activity. 
In terms of looking at our business mix and backlog, in the current economic environment, we saw our business mix shift slightly to a greater percentage of commercial sales; such at the end of the second quarter, our mix of business was 58% military, 40% commercial and 2% space compared to last year's 58% military, 39% commercial and 3% space.
At quarter end, the backlog stood at $306 million. We have had no major program losses, but we have experienced some delays, as Tony reported on, and on follow-on orders for the F-18, F-15, the Apache, C-17 and the Carson Helicopter programs. We expect the follow-on orders for these programs to be booked in the third or fourth quarters. We are also optimistic with regard to additional new program wins. And with the recent new programs ramping up in 2010, we expect increased backlog levels going forward.
Now if I may comment on the first half 2010 results. Ducommun's net income was $9.9 million or $0.94 a share, per fully diluted share, in fiscal 2010 versus $7.2 million or $0.69 per fully diluted share a year ago. Our first half sales decreased 4% to $207 million from $215 million in 2009, primarily as a result of a 31% decrease in Engineering Services revenues, while our manufacturing products revenues increased slightly for the first six months. 
DAS' sales decreased about 2.5% to $138 million from $142 million in the first six months, as solid growth in fixed wing products, both large commercial and military aircraft, were not enough to offset lower revenue from military helicopter products and regional and business jets. 
DTI's first half revenues were down about 6%, reflecting shortfalls in aftermarket sales and Engineering Services revenues despite significant growth in radar rack products. DTI posted 13% growth in manufactured technology products, and that more than offset the 31% drop in the Engineering Services revenue. 
Our first half operating income for Ducommun showed an increase by 31% to $15.9 million or 7.7% of revenues compared to $12 million or 5.6% of revenues a year ago. First half results included a favorable inventory adjustment of $1.1 million, which I mentioned earlier, offset by approximately $2.9 million in accumulative start-up and development costs which generated nearly $6 million in sales in the first half. About 90% of the 2010 start-up and development costs can be attributable to the DAS business segment. 
First half 2009 results were negatively impacted by $5.1 million or 2.4 percentage points due to an inventory reserve of $4.3 million related to the bankruptcy filing and an inventory valuation adjustment of $800,000 that I mentioned in the second quarter's report. On an adjusted basis, operating income for the first half would have been $17.7 million or 8.8% of revenues, contrasting that to $17.3 million or 8% of revenues in the prior six months.
DAS' first half 2010 reporting operating income was $16.6 million or 12% of revenues, compared to the reported results of $11 million or 7.8% of revenue a year ago. On a pro forma basis, if we back out the first half development costs in 2010, its related sales of $5.9 million and the inventory adjustments in both 2010 and 2009, DAS' operating income would have been $18 million or 13.5% of revenue compared to $16.2 million or 11.4% of revenue in 2009. We were pleased to see that DAS' operating margins had improved over 200 basis points on an adjusted basis year-over-year.
For DTI, despite the favorable revenue shift in higher-margin technology products compared to Engineering Services revenues, first half 2010 operating income of $5.8 million, which was 8.4% of revenues, was lower as compared to the $6.3 million or 8.6% of revenues in 2009. 
You will note in my earlier comments that DTI's operating margins in the second quarter of 2010 was 9.7%, up sequentially both from this year's first quarter and higher than the comparable 2009 quarter. We have significant momentum going there, and we expect to continue this momentum in operating margin improvement throughout the balance of 2010.
Selling, general and administrative expenses over the first six months are running at 12.4% as compared to 11.6% for the first half of 2009, and they're largely as a result of expenses related to amortization of intangible expenses and slightly higher compensation accruals. Cost controls remain in effect. 
Commenting now on liquidity and capital resources. During the quarter, we generated nearly $12 million in cash flow from operations, bringing our year-to-date cash from operations to a negative $9 million, which is $6 million better than the comparable period last year. The improvements during the quarter were the result of increased amounts of operating income, depreciation and amortization as well as improved receivables management. 
Typically, we are a cash user in the first six months of the year, as we're seeing this year and in the past. And in the second half of the year, we are a cash generator. We continue to focus on effective working capital management by improving inventory turns and increasing accounts receivable management. 
We also continue to maintain a low-leverage position. At quarter end, our net-debt-to-capital ratio was 9%. We feel that given the current static economic environment and uncertainty in the credit markets, this is an excellent position for us to be in. We expect CapEx in 2010 to be approximately $9 million and compares to slightly less than $8 million a year ago. 
Now I would like to ask Tony Reardon to make some additional remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over to questions, let me just hit a few key points. 
First, our operating margins continue to improve, and we will take every measure necessary to ensure optimum asset utilization. In that vein, we're currently evaluating additional facility consolidations and capacity rationalization as part of our productivity enhancement initiatives. More specifically, we're reviewing the implementation of a plan to move certain operations and in doing so, improve facility utilization in support of our growth for many new programs. We see this starting in the second half of 2010, to be completed no later than the first quarter of 2011. While total expenses and payback scenarios are still being analyzed, we envision the cost to be around $1 million to $1.5 million, spreading over the next three quarters, with significant positive ROI beginning in 2011. 
Second, we're winning new business programs which will fuel growth for 2011. We will continue to invest in the development programs as a means to broaden our product offering and drive our internal growth objectives. As Joe mentioned, we have a number of follow-on contracts which we anticipate will be booked in the second half of 2010, increasing our backlog for this year. 
And third, we're optimistic that the commercial aerospace recovery is taking hold, and that the impact will position Ducommun for higher revenue in the quarters to come. 
In summary, 2010 is playing out as expected, and we're pleased that our business units are improving their operating performance and as demand trends begin to turn in our favor. 
Now, Jeremy, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please."

I think when we look at the modeling, we have to factor in the start-up and development costs, plus the spread of this $1 million to $1.5 million costs over the next three quarters for our capacity expansions and rationalizations and better asset utilization. So that being said -- and the environment still is somewhat stabilized in some sectors, as we talked about. I'm giving you a little backdrop on it. But what we do expect in the third quarter in terms of overall deliveries, we expect a good continued modest increase in the Large Aircraft segment and some nominal growth in the Regional and Business Aircraft segment; and also in the fixed wing military, which is C-17 is stable but F-15 and F-18. So we do see some nominal growth there. We still have the issue of where the Apache now did about $7 million this quarter, we're still looking at $6 million to $6.5 million. And without going through all the programs, we see a slight improvement in sales here in the third quarter, but not robust or a step change yet. So as we manage through our psychology, as we recognize the costs we're going to incur, we continue to work on improving our revenue mix and also continued focus on operating efficiencies to try to keep these margins not only where they are, but modestly expand them in this environment."

I'd like to give you a brief overview of the quarter, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to discuss our financial results in some detail.
In the third quarter, a variety of market dynamics were in play that impacted our revenue. The global economic forces driving both the Military and Commercial aerospace markets have influenced the build rates and funding dynamics for all aspects of the industry. The DoD continues to face budget pressures, while trying to meet current requirements, and as a result, Ducommun has seen a drop in production of some Military programs, such as the C-17, defunding of NASA and the insourcing of government services. 
At the same time, we are participating in the growth of programs, such as the JSF, and providing the original equipment manufacturers with increased support for foreign military sales. Shipments for the C-17, Chinook helicopter and Apache Helicopter were delayed this quarter, with schedules pushed out into Q4 and possibly early into next year. Please note that I said scheduled slides, not cancellations. Ducommun does anticipate delivering these requirements in the next two quarters.
We also experienced a 32% decline in Engineering Services revenues, as a result of reduced government spending and order delays on a couple of current contracts. In addition, one item to note on a year-over-year revenue comparison is that the third quarter of 2009 included $5.4 million of revenue related to the UCAS development program, which was not anticipated to repeat this year. However, we do anticipate follow-on orders on this program in the future. 
Meanwhile, our Commercial business was stronger quarter-over-quarter, with higher Boeing 747, 777 and 787 sales as well as some signs of improvements in the regional jet market. The continued growth in the world air travel despite a moderating economy supports the increased build rate projections we're seeing in the large commercial transport market.  Ducommun has participation on the Boeing 737, 747, 777 and 787 Aircraft as well as the Airbus A330, A340 and A380 aircraft will help our growth in the quarters to come. However, the higher commercial sales were not enough offset the drop in the Military sales for this quarter and negatively impacted the operating margins. Contributing to the lower margins were slightly higher SG&A costs, as well as investments in R&D programs. 
We view the third quarter as marking the low point in terms of revenue for this economic cycle, with sequential gains going forward. Specifically, we see the Commercial market strengthening at a faster pace than before. And in 2011, we expect to benefit from increased shipments to support the higher build rates for the Boeing and Airbus programs. While business jet demand remains soft, the regional jet market has stabilized, and we forecast that this will lead to slightly higher revenues in the quarters to come. 
On the Military side, while the C-17 and the Apache rates are at lower levels, the rest of our programs remain solid. Specifically, we expect the JSF to continue to be funded. We see strong demands in the Blackhawk and the CH-47 helicopters, and we anticipate demands for the F-18 and F-15 spares to continue. In addition, we are analyzing the recently announced Saudi order to Boeing and Raytheon to see how it will impact the shipments going forward. The order includes 84 new F-15 Aircraft plus 70 upgrades to the F-15s, along with 72 Blackhawks and 70 Apache helicopters. 
Within our Engineering Services division, we see room for improvement in the quarters to come. We believe that our current growth strategy is taking hold, and we are refocused on several markets. Once the federal budget is released, we will be in a very solid position to support ongoing and future development programs. And we continue to bid on new opportunities, and we anticipate gradual increases in revenues going forward.
Our backlog grew to $320.9 million from $305.6 million last quarter, reflecting both new business and long-term follow-on contract awards. Due to our strengthening position as a Tier 2 supplier, we see further increases in backlog in the quarters to come, particularly given the higher Commercial build rates expected next year. Ducommun's investments are paying off in terms of our OEM relationships with increased value-added content, which is why we feel confident in saying that Ducommun is on the right path to improve operating results. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe Bellino to review the financial results. Joe?"
267761,114498395,84432,"Ducommun Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Yesterday, we reported results for the third quarter of $0.55 per fully diluted share compared to $0.59 per fully diluted share a year ago.

Yesterday, we reported results for the third quarter of $0.55 per fully diluted share compared to $0.59 per fully diluted share a year ago. The third quarter 2010 results reflect the benefit of a $0.19 per diluted share for a change in provisions for unrecognized tax benefits. 
Third quarter sales of $99 million were 9.5% below last year's. But as we look at the segment, we saw our Commercial business increase 16%, but it was not enough to offset the 21% decline in our Military business. In our Ducommun AeroStructures business or DAS, we experienced a 9% decrease in sales. It was primarily from softer sales in Military helicopter products and Military fixed-wing programs that were partially offset by the continued growth in large Commercial Aircraft programs.
Turning to the Technology segment or DTI. We saw a 10% decrease in revenues. This was primarily as a result of a 32% decrease in Engineering Services revenues as a result of reduced government funding. Our manufactured technology product posted a 5% increase in shipments, as a result of increases in replacement radar racks and electronic components.
Turning to operating income by the business segments. DAS's operating income for the quarter, margin was 6.3% compared to 9% a year ago. This was primarily driven by lower operating income in our DAS segment, while our DTI segment continued to show improvement year-over-year.
During the quarter, we absorbed about $800,000 or one percentage point in start-up and development costs for new programs, which we had begun earlier in the year. We expect these costs to be reduced sequentially in the fourth quarter and into 2011. We look at DAS's operating income, we had operating income margins of 9.9%, and that compares to 13.6% of revenue a year ago.  It only adds some further qualifications there though. The lower operating income reflects a more unfavorable product mix year-over-year, driven by decreases in the Military fixed-wing products and Military helicopter programs. The 
bulk of the development costs I mentioned earlier, the $800,000 charge was attributable to the DAS segment. And if we adjusted that, the operating margins for the quarter would have approximated 11.5%, which compares to the 13.6% operating margin from a year ago.
Ducommun Technology or DTI's operating income increased slightly, and the operating margin percentages were 9.8% compared to 8.5%. That's 130 basis points year-over-year, and as a results from increased shipments of radar rack products, increases in technology products and continuing efficiencies that were gained from the lean manufacturing process. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 13.8% of sales in the third quarter compared to 11.5% a year ago. The increases this year were the result of higher accrued compensation expenses and continuing increased investment in product development programs. 
Turning to our business mix and backlog, during the quarter, the growth in Commercial segment and the decline in Military revenues have shifted our mix a bit. At quarter end, our business comprised of 57% Military, 42% Commercial and 1% Space. That compares to a year ago's numbers where Military was 65%; Commercial, 33%; and Space was 2%. We were pleased to see the backlogs increase sequentially to $321 million from $306 million at the end of the second quarter. We have had no major program losses. And while we have picked up firm purchase orders during the quarter for the 737, Blackhawk helicopter, Apache Helicopter and F-18, we still have experienced delays in follow-on orders for the F-15, C-17 and the Carson Helicopter programs. We expect follow-on orders for those programs to be booked in the fourth quarter or delayed to the first quarter in 2011. We are also optimistic with regard to additional and new program wins, with recent new programs ramping up in 2010. We expect increased backlogs going forward. 
Turning to the nine-month 2010 results, we are earnings for the year, year-over-year, up 17%, as our fully diluted earnings per share are $1.47. It compares to $1.27 per fully diluted share a year ago. Our first nine-month sales of $307 million are a decrease of 6% from last year's nine-month results. And this is primarily attributable to a 32% decrease in Engineering Services and lower Military helicopter programs. All of this of which has been partially offset by continued growth in the large Commercial Aircraft sector. Year-over-year Commercial sales have increased 6%, and our sales to the Military segment have decreased 13%. 
We looked at some of the business segment sales in the DAS unit, although the sales year-over-year have decreased 5%, as the solid growth in the large Commercial Aircraft was not enough to offset the lower revenues from the Military helicopter programs.
On the DTI side, the first nine months' revenues were down about 7%. They reflect the shortfalls in our aftermarket sales and Engineering Services revenues, despite significant growth in radar rack products shipments.
Turning to operating income by business segment, our operating income overall, margin was 7.2%. It compares favorably to 6.8% from the previous year. For the first nine months, the results include a favorable inventory adjustment in prior periods of $1.2 million. And these have been offset by approximately a total of $3.6 million in start-up and development costs to the first nine months, which have generated $8 million in sales. 
Just noting from last year, the first nine months of 2009, the results were negatively impacted by $5.1 million or 1.6 percentage points due to an inventory reserve related to the Eclipse bankruptcy and an inventory valuation adjustment. 
On an adjusted basis, taking into consideration those points that I made, our operating income for the first nine months of 2010 would have been $24.5 million or 8.2% of revenues compared to $27 million or 8.3% of revenues in the prior year.
Selling, general and administration is running at about 12.9% year-to-date compared to 11.6% for the comparable period last year. This was primarily a result of a couple of factors: Higher expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets; slightly higher compensation accruals; and finally, the additional investment in product development programs. Cost controls remain in effect.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources, as the normal reflection of our cash flow and business cycle, we generated nearly $7 million in positive cash flow from operations during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date cash flow from operations to a negative $3 million, but that's $6 million improvement over the comparable period in 2009. In addressing those issues, we continue to focus on effective working capital management, primarily by working to improve inventory turns and increasing our accounts receivable collections efforts. We continue to maintain a low leverage position. At quarter end, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 7%. We expect CapEx for this year to be in the range of $9 million, and that compares to slightly less than $8 million last year. The increase primarily reflects new program growth.
Now with that, I would like to ask Tony Reardon to make some additional remarks. Tony?"

In terms of the Engineering Services business, about a year ago right now, we've brought in a new president into that business, and he has done an excellent job of streamlining the operations and refocusing the business around specific markets. And one of them, in particular, would be the nanosatellite market. And so, we're seeing some inroads there and some development programs that they're looking at to participate as well as be more focused on their capabilities with regards to the missile defense market. So we see some opportunities out there, and as the budget comes through. And of course, we'll have to wait and see on the elections and depending how fast that budget comes through, then we'll have a better understanding of how we can improve our capabilities in that area."

However, I think there are a number of customers out there on the foreign Military side which will stay with the existing blades, so we would see continued production on that. And then the tail rotors at this point in time have not been moved to composites, although I think that's in the wind. And we'll be supporting that going forward. So I would look at 2011 and '12 and probably see some slight reduction in build rates, as we go out. But at this time, I don't have those numbers.

I'd like to give you a brief overview of the quarter, after which I'll turn the call over to Joe Bellino to discuss our financial results in some detail.
In the third quarter, a variety of market dynamics were in play that impacted our revenue. The global economic forces driving both the Military and Commercial aerospace markets have influenced the build rates and funding dynamics for all aspects of the industry. The DoD continues to face budget pressures, while trying to meet current requirements, and as a result, Ducommun has seen a drop in production of some Military programs, such as the C-17, defunding of NASA and the insourcing of government services. 
At the same time, we are participating in the growth of programs, such as the JSF, and providing the original equipment manufacturers with increased support for foreign military sales. Shipments for the C-17, Chinook helicopter and Apache Helicopter were delayed this quarter, with schedules pushed out into Q4 and possibly early into next year. Please note that I said scheduled slides, not cancellations. Ducommun does anticipate delivering these requirements in the next two quarters.
We also experienced a 32% decline in Engineering Services revenues, as a result of reduced government spending and order delays on a couple of current contracts. In addition, one item to note on a year-over-year revenue comparison is that the third quarter of 2009 included $5.4 million of revenue related to the UCAS development program, which was not anticipated to repeat this year. However, we do anticipate follow-on orders on this program in the future. 
Meanwhile, our Commercial business was stronger quarter-over-quarter, with higher Boeing 747, 777 and 787 sales, as well as some signs of improvements in the regional jet market. The continued growth in the world air travel despite a moderating economy supports the increased build rate projections we're seeing in the large commercial transport market.  Ducommun’s participation on the Boeing 737, 747, 777 and 787 Aircraft as well as the Airbus A330, A340 and A380 aircraft will help our growth in the quarters to come. However, the higher commercial sales were not enough offset the drop in the Military sales for this quarter and negatively impacted the operating margins. Contributing to the lower margins were slightly higher SG&A costs, as well as investments in R&D programs. 
We view the third quarter as marking the low point in terms of revenue for this economic cycle, with sequential gains going forward. Specifically, we see the Commercial market strengthening at a faster pace than before. And in 2011, we expect to benefit from increased shipments to support the higher build rates for the Boeing and Airbus programs. While business jet demand remains soft, the regional jet market has stabilized, and we forecast that this will lead to slightly higher revenues in the quarters to come. 
On the Military side, while the C-17 and the Apache rates are at lower levels, the rest of our programs remain solid. Specifically, we expect the JSF to continue to be funded. We see strong demands in the Blackhawk and the CH-47 helicopters, and we anticipate demands for the F-18 and F-15 spares to continue. In addition, we are analyzing the recently announced Saudi order to Boeing and Raytheon to see how it will impact the shipments going forward. The order includes 84 new F-15 Aircraft plus 70 upgrades to the F-15s, along with 72 Blackhawks and 70 Apache helicopters. 
Within our Engineering Services division, we see room for improvement in the quarters to come. We believe that our current growth strategy is taking hold, and we are refocused on several markets. Once the federal budget is released, we will be in a very solid position to support ongoing and future development programs. And we continue to bid on new opportunities, and we anticipate gradual increases in revenues going forward.
Our backlog grew to $320.9 million from $305.6 million last quarter, reflecting both new business and long-term follow-on contract awards. Due to our strengthening position as a Tier 2 supplier, we see further increases in backlog in the quarters to come, particularly given the higher Commercial build rates expected next year. Ducommun's investments are paying off in terms of our OEM relationships with increased value-added content, which is why we feel confident in saying that Ducommun is on the right path to improve operating results. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joe Bellino to review the financial results. Joe?"

Yesterday, we reported results for the third quarter of $0.55 per fully diluted share compared to $0.59 per fully diluted share a year ago. The third quarter 2010 results reflect a benefit of a $0.19 per diluted share for a change in provisions for unrecognized tax benefits. 
Third quarter sales of $99 million were 9.5% below last year's. But as we look at the segment, we saw our Commercial business increase 16%, but it was not enough to offset the 21% decline in our Military business. In our Ducommun AeroStructures business or DAS, we experienced a 9% decrease in sales. It was primarily from softer sales in Military helicopter products and Military fixed-wing programs that were partially offset by the continued growth in large Commercial Aircraft programs.
Turning to the Technology segment or DTI. We saw a 10% decrease in revenues. This was primarily as a result of a 32% decrease in Engineering Services revenues as a result of reduced government funding. Our manufactured technology products posted a 5% increase in shipments, as a result of increases in replacement radar racks and electronic components.
Turning to operating income by the business segments. DAS's operating income for the quarter, margin was 6.3% compared to 9% a year ago. This was primarily driven by lower operating income in our DAS segment, while our DTI segment continued to show improvement year-over-year.
During the quarter, we absorbed about $800,000 or one percentage point in start-up and development costs for new programs, which we had begun earlier in the year. We expect these costs to be reduced sequentially in the fourth quarter and into 2011. We look at DAS's operating income, we had operating income margins of 9.9%, and that compares to 13.6% of revenue a year ago.  I want to add some further qualifications there though. The lower operating income reflects a more unfavorable product mix year-over-year, driven by decreases in the Military fixed-wing products and Military helicopter programs. The bulk of the development costs I mentioned earlier, the $800,000 charge was attributable to the DAS segment. And if we adjusted that, the operating margins for the quarter would have approximated 11.5%, which compares to the 13.6% operating margin from a year ago.
Ducommun Technology or DTI's operating income increased slightly, and the operating margin percentages were 9.8% compared to 8.5%. That's 130 basis points year-over-year, and is a result from increased shipments of radar rack products, increases in technology products and continuing efficiencies that were gained from the lean manufacturing process. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 13.8% of sales in the third quarter compared to 11.5% a year ago. The increases this year were the result of higher accrued compensation expenses and continuing increased investment in product development programs. 
Turning to our business mix and backlog, during the quarter, the growth in Commercial segment and the decline in Military revenues has shifted our mix a bit. At quarter end, our business comprised of 57% Military, 42% Commercial and 1% Space. That compares to a year ago's numbers where Military was 65%; Commercial, 33%; and Space was 2%. We were pleased to see the backlogs increase sequentially to $321 million from $306 million at the end of the second quarter. We have had no major program losses. And while we have picked up firm purchase orders during the quarter for the 737, Blackhawk helicopter, Apache Helicopter and F-18, we still have experienced delays in follow-on orders for the F-15, C-17 and the Carson Helicopter programs. We expect follow-on orders for those programs to be booked in the fourth quarter or delayed to the first quarter in 2011. We are also optimistic with regard to additional new program wins, with recent new programs ramping up in 2010. We expect increased backlogs going forward. 
Turning to the nine-month 2010 results, we -- our earnings for the year, year-over-year, up 17%, as our fully diluted earnings per share are $1.47. It compares to $1.27 per fully diluted share a year ago. Our first nine-month sales of $307 million are a decrease of 6% from last year's nine-month results. And this is primarily attributable to a 32% decrease in Engineering Services and lower Military helicopter programs. All of this of which has been partially offset by continued growth in the large Commercial Aircraft sector. Year-over-year Commercial sales have increased 6%, and our sales to the Military segment have decreased 13%. 
If we look at some of the business segment sales in the DAS unit, the sales year-over-year have decreased 5%, as the solid growth in the large Commercial Aircraft was not enough to offset the lower revenues from the Military helicopter programs.
On the DTI side, the first nine months' revenues were down about 7%. They reflect the shortfalls in our aftermarket sales and Engineering Services revenues, despite significant growth in radar rack product shipments.
Turning to our operating income by business segment, our operating income overall, margin was 7.2%. It compares favorably to 6.8% from the previous year. For the first nine months, the results include a favorable inventory adjustment in prior periods of $1.2 million. And these have been offset by approximately a total of $3.6 million in start-up and development costs to the first nine months, which have generated $8 million in sales. 
Just noting from last year, the first nine months of 2009, the results were negatively impacted by $5.1 million or 1.6 percentage points due to an inventory reserve related to the Eclipse bankruptcy and an inventory valuation adjustment. 
On an adjusted basis, taking into consideration those points that I made, our operating income for the first nine months of 2010 would have been $24.5 million or 8.2% of revenues compared to $27 million or 8.3% of revenues in the prior year.
Selling, general and administration is running at about 12.9% year-to-date compared to 11.6% for the comparable period last year. This was primarily a result of a couple of factors: higher expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets; slightly higher compensation accruals; and finally, the additional investment in product development programs. Cost controls remain in effect.
Turning to liquidity and capital resources, as a normal reflection of our cash flow and business cycle, we generated nearly $7 million in positive cash flow from operations during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date cash flow from operations to a negative $3 million, but that's $6 million improvement over the comparable period in 2009. In addressing those issues, we continue to focus on effective working capital management, primarily by working to improve inventory turns and increasing our accounts receivable collections efforts. We continue to maintain a low leverage position; at quarter end, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 7%. We expect CapEx for this year to be in the range of $9 million, and that compares to slightly less than $8 million last year. The increase primarily reflects new program growth.
Now with that, I would like to ask Tony Reardon to make some additional remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over to questions, let me just again state that while this quarter reflected delays in some Military shipments, we are actually more confident than last quarter regarding our outlook for Ducommun and believe the necessary growth drivers are in place to see improvement in our business going forward. While some Military headwinds remain, particularly with our sunset programs, we continue to take a disciplined approach to managing our operations. 
As stated earlier, we see a strong Commercial rebound, and the new product development program is fueling top line growth in 2011. We've always been conservative in assessing the market landscape, but we are experiencing greater traction with regard to the Commercial demand trends and believe the company's lean initiatives will result in improved bottom line results. 
We also continue to look for prudent acquisitions and have been actively engaged with several companies over this earlier part of this year. Our goal is to enhance and diversify our product offering and strengthen our role as a leading Tier 2 aerospace provider. With that, I would now like to open the call up for questions. So Lumira please?"

In terms of the Engineering Services business, about a year ago right now, we brought in a new president into that business, and he has done an excellent job of streamlining the operations and refocusing the business around specific markets. And one of them, in particular, would be the nanosatellite market. And so, we're seeing some inroads there and some development programs that they're looking at to participate as well as be more focused on their capabilities with regards to the missile defense market.
