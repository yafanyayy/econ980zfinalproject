Good morning to all of our shareholders and participants and welcome to the Ventas’ 2009 year-end earnings call. My colleagues and I are pleased to be joining you today from our Louisville office.Today, I'll provide a company overview,",873,"Thanks, David. Good morning to all of our shareholders and participants and welcome to the Ventas’ 2009 year-end earnings call. My colleagues and I are pleased to be joining you today from our Louisville office.
Today, I'll provide a company overview, Ray Lewis will discuss our portfolio performance and investment outlook, and Rick Schweinhart will address financial results in detail. After that, we will be happy to answer your questions.
Ventas had an excellent and highly productive 2009, overcoming the severely negative conditions that challenged our economy and capital markets during the year. I’d like to quickly recap some of the Ventas highlights of 2009.
Normalized FFO per share was $2.68, exceeding our guidance of $2.62-$2.65 per share.  Notably, 2009 normalized FFO per share compressed only 1% from 2008, despite 9% more shares outstanding, meaning that our entity level FFO grows considerably during the year. 
Our cash flow from operations was $422 million, an increase of over 11% from 2008, the passed the data to the S&P 500. We were also named the top financial stock of the decade, providing over 2000% total returns to shareholders during the period. In this regard we led all bank, insurance companies, REITs and diversified financials, total shareholder returns for 2009 alone was 39%.
We purchased or repaid during the year $560 million of bonds and mortgage debts. In 2009 we received an upgrade from Fitch to BBB-, one of only five total upgrades in the REIT sector from all three rating agencies during the year.
We extended our revolver to 2012 and our revolver has total current capacity of $1 billion. We raised $312 million of equity and $341 million of debt financing, we also sold 14 assets and recognized the net gain of over $66 million. 
We opened or acquired 6 high quality on-campus medical office buildings all affiliated with highly rated not-for-profit hospital systems. This expanded our MOB portfolio to $1.7 million square feet. We extended the lease term on 108 healthcare assets operated by Kindred, had escalated rent levels of $126 million per year, the lease term for those assets would have expired on April 30, 2010, but was extended until 2015.
 
We received a unanimous jury verdict in our favor of $102 million in our law suit against HCP for tortuous interference with our 2007 acquisition of Sunrise REIT.
And we ended the year with an excellent balance sheet and liquidity position. Net debt to EBIDTA was 4.1 time, at year end we held over $100 million in cash-on-hand and our revolver capacity approximated $1 billion.
In sum, we have managed the company in a prudent manner that protected the downside and preserved the upside for our stakeholders. We finished the year and the decade consistent with our objectives, as a cash flowing, productive enterprise delivering consistent, superior value for all our stakeholders. Well positioned to drive in a variety of economic capital markets and reimbursing environment and ready to execute our growth and diversification plans.
2010 has begun on a very positive trajectory as well, I’d like to highlight three items in particular. Credit ratings positive momentum, a 4.4% dividend increased and improved earnings guidance for 2010.
First ratings, because of our excellent credit statistic and our cash flowing assets Moody’s recently upgraded the rating on Ventas’s senior unsecured debt to investment grade, awarding us a Baa3 rating earlier this month. As most of you know we have worked long and hard to merit this improved rating, we appreciate Moody’s confidence in us and we now have an investment grade rating from all three major rating agencies. It is a significant accomplishment for any real-estate company to continue ratings improvement in today’s environment.
Second, our board of directors just approved a 4.4% increase in our past dividend to an annualized rate of $2.14 per share. We are pleased to share our stable growing cash-flows with our shareholders while we also retain significant cash flows for growth. This decision demonstrates our confidence in Ventas’ future. 
And last we have introduced 2010 normalized FFO guidance of $2.69 to $2.75 per share. In terms of total normalized FFO dollars we expect FFO to grow from $409 million in 2009 to a range of $422 million to $432 million in 2010. Our same store cash NOI growth should increase by 2%-3% for the whole portfolio in 2010.
While our 2010 guidance does not (inaudible) material acquisitions the healthcare real estate sector is large growing and highly fragmented, with REITs owning only about 6% of the total investable assets. The sector generally is not over-levered in contrast with many other real-estate sectors. This should permit private owners to sell assets and obtain a much desired liquidity. As a result we do expect to see increased transactional volume in 2010 compared to the last two years, only time will tell whether these trends will translate into significant investments for Ventas, and if so, the timing and size of those investments. But we do believe we will have the opportunity to reignite our growth and diversification efforts in 2010.
I’m going to turn the call over to Ray who is going to walk you through our portfolio performance and talk a little further about the current investment environment.

Our high quality cash flowing portfolio of healthcare and senior’s housing assets performed well in 2009. For the year same store cash NOI growth on our triple net leased portfolio increased by 3.4%. Cash NOI in our hospitals grew 2.6%,",1033,"Thanks, Debbie. Our high quality cash flowing portfolio of healthcare and senior’s housing assets performed well in 2009. For the year same store cash NOI growth on our triple net leased portfolio increased by 3.4%. Cash NOI in our hospitals grew 2.6%, senior’s housing grew 3.2% and skilled nursing delivered 4% growth. Our triple net lease assets continue to have excellent cash flow coverages across the spectrum of independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals.
75% of our NOI comes from our pool, multi-facility master leases with credit and structural support and contractual growth escalation. Cash flow coverage through the third quarter of 2009, the latest data available remains stable at 1.8 times, this strong metric has been consistent to 2007, occupancies in the triple net seniors housing portfolio increased 80 basis points in the third quarter versus the second as we saw evidence of occupancy beginning to rise in the third quarter.
The weighted average remaining lease term for our triple net lease assets is approximately seven years and only 1% of our total triple net portfolio is up for renewal before 2013. We expect same store cash growth in our triple net portfolio to exceed 2.5% in 2010. Overall, our pool, multi-facility master leases with credit tenants continue to provide strong and steady contractual cash flow growth to Ventas.
The company’s operating portfolio, which consists of 79 high-end mansion style, assisted living communities, managed by Sunrise Senior Living and 26 medical office buildings accounts for 23% of our NOI, this portion of our portfolio exhibited improving fundamentals during the quarter and ended the year on a strong note. First, let me address our need-driven operating portfolio of senior living communities managed by Sunrise. 
We derive 18% of our entity level NOI from this portfolio, there occupancy in our 78 stable communities continue the trend positively during the fourth quarter and increased 70 basis points sequentially to 88.8%. This continued the positive trend and occupancy that began in the third quarter, we are pleased with two consecutive quarterly increases in occupancy for the portfolio.
Notably fourth quarter occupancy and senior’s housing tends to be weaker than the third and industry statistics released by Nick(ph) earlier this week confirm that. Though our Sunrise portfolio distinguished itself by enjoying a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter occupancy and in our Sunrise lease of asset in Toronto known as, Stealth, we continue to gain momentum.
All metrics were positive sequentially in the fourth quarter and Stealth continues to gain occupancy and NOI as the community trends towards stabilization. As a result of these trends our total fourth quarter property NOI for our 79 Sunrise communities was $33.3 million fairly consistent with the $33.4 million we earned in the third quarter. This was slightly higher than what we had projected, driven by improved occupancy and slightly increased average daily rate, which rose to $173 per day in the fourth quarter, off-set by the anticipated higher expenses in the fourth quarter attributable to the spending of repair and maintenance budgets and labor cost. 
Finishing the year on such a positive note caused our full year Sunrise results to total $131 million dollars above the high-end of our 2009 expectations that range from $122-$129 million. 
Looking forward to 2010 guidance in our Sunrise portfolio, our total NOI projection is $128 - $138 million. The mid-point of this range $133 million represents an NOI increase of 1.5% over 2009. Our projections assume that occupancies will rise slightly ADR will increase about 1.5% and margin may experience some compression due to inflation and expense increases. 
So our mid-point NOI expectation assumes that positive rate and occupancy trends continue into 2010. This should result in positive NOI growth for the portfolio absents (inaudible) double every session or another shock to the financial system. Over time very favorable supply demand fundamentals should drive growth in our Sunrise portfolio. With the over-85 population being the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population and virtually no new assisted living supply coming online in 2010 or 2011 the conditions are right for excellent performance as the economy improves.
Our medical office building portfolio, which now totals over 1.7 million square feet and represents 5% of our NOI also performed well this quarter substantially all of our 26 MOBs are on the campus of major hospital systems. In our 21 stabilized assets occupancy was a strong 94.7% in the fourth quarter. Before occupancy and our same store stabilized portfolio of 18 MOBs increased sequentially by 50 basis points to 94.4% and generated NOI of $4.8 million and increased of 2% compared to Q3 2009.
We also continue to have strong results in our MOB lease-up portfolio.  We have added three development assets to this pool since the fourth quarter of 2008 all of which were on-time, on-budget substantially preleased and generating positive NOI to Ventas. NOI for the four lease-up assets we own in both the third and the fourth quarters of 2009 increased by 20%.
Leasing prospects for this portion of the portfolio are good, including 54,000 square feet of leases signed but not yet in occupancy and a strong forward pipeline of potential tenants. When tenants who have already signed leases have moved in, the occupancy on our five lease-up assets should rise from 74%-87%. 
In the fourth quarter we began investing again but purchasing four Class A, on-campus medical office buildings valued at $77.7 million. The MOB acquisitions should provide Ventas with unlevered yield succeeding 8%. 
In sum, our growing MOB portfolio provided stable and increasing NOI to Ventas in 2009. As you saw with our MOB acquisition activity in December we’re beginning to put capital to work to continue to grow and diversify the company. Moreover we are seeing an increase in flow of opportunities across all asset classes in the healthcare and senior housing spectrum. And although we are shifting to a more offensive stance on acquisition, we remained disciplined in our investment approach and continue our practice of targeting high quality, accreted investments with excellent operators that can create long-term value for shareholders. 
With that I’ll turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart to discuss our financial results.

The highlights to the fourth quarter are the operating income increased 1% from the third quarter, resulting in normalized FFO of $0.67 per delivered share, additionally we continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, doubling liquidity and increasing cash-flows from operations. As Debbie mentioned we are extremely pleased that Moody’s raised our rating to investment grade earlier this month. We now have investment grade ratings from all three rating agencies; we also have increased our revolver from the September capacity of $167 million to $1 billion.
The (inaudible) in April of 2012 has increased from $590 million to $800 million. At December 31, our cash balance was $107 million and we have only $8.5 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility, currently $992 million of undrawn availability and cash-on-hand of approximately $155 million. Our credit stands for being very good with net debt to pro forma EBIDTA at 4.1 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 3.2 times we closed 2009 with debt to enterprise value of 28%.
Early 2009 we repaid our purchase $411 million of our senior notes and reduced our mortgage balances by $148.7 million, which $25 million of normal periodic principal amortization. We have $175 million in total debt maturities in 2010, excluding normal periodic principal amortization payments, most of which is mortgaged debt. Our cash-flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased 11% to $422 million, from $380 million from last year. 
Turning to (inaudible) for the quarter, fourth quarter normalized FFO was $104.8 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Normalized FFO excludes merger related expenses and (inaudible) of approximately $1.6 million. Fourth quarter normalized FFO increased from third quarter to primarily NOI increases in our MOB portfolio due to acquisitions and lower D&A.
Interest expense increased to $44.6 million from $43.6 million in the third quarter, primarily as a result of additional interest expense from our GSE mortgage financing of $173 million at 6.3%, which closed in the second and third quarter. D&A was $8.2 million down $1.4 million from the $9.7million in the third quarter, primarily as a result of lower non-cash stock based compensation. 
Weighted average shares outstanding remained fairly plaid at $156.7 million in the fourth quarter, versus $156.5 million in the third. Fourth quarter FAD per diluted share was $0.62 compared to $0.63 in the third quarter as a result of higher routine capital expenditures in the fourth quarter, down when we compare the fourth quarter 2009 normalized FFO per diluted share to the fourth quarter of 2008.
Normalized FFO grew 11.5% to $104.8 million from  $94 million from last year and the fourth quarter FFO per diluted share was $0.67 compared to $0.66 last year. Triple-net leased revenues grew to $117 million from $114.4 million, primarily due to contractual escalations. It is important to note that (inaudible) NOI increased 3% to $33.3 million this quarter from $32.2 million from last year. Also year-over-year our medical office building NOI grew to $6.7 million from $5.3 million, primarily due to acquisitions.
Interest expense decreased to $44.6 million from $50.6 million last year. Principally due to debt repayments and senior note purchases. Our weighted average cost of debt is about 6.6%.
G&A was $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, down $2.9 million from the $11.2 million in 2008, primarily as a result of low professional fees. Weighted average shares outstanding increased 9.5% for the fourth quarter of 2009, versus the comparable 2008 period to $156.7 million from $143 million. The share count increased due to our April 2009 equity offer.
Finally, left to compare the year ended December 31, 2009 to 2008. Normalized FFO grew 8% to $409 million from $379.5 million last year and FFO per diluted share was $2.68 compared to $2.71 last year. Triple-net lease revenues grew 2.5% to $465.2 million from $453.7 million primarily due to contractual escalations.
Internalized NOI decreased to $131 million from $138.8 million last year, which was better than forecast due to rising occupancies in the portfolio. (inaudible) off-set by higher expenses. Last year’s results benefited from about $4 million in expense credits that didn’t reoccur in 2009. On a reoccurring basis NOI’s down  3% in the portfolio year-over-year. Year-over-year our medical office building NOI grew to $23.2 million from $17.3 million due primarily to acquisitions and lease-up activity.
Interest expense decreased approximately 13% to $178.5 million from $204.5 million last year, primarily due to lower debt value. G&A decreased from 4.5% to $38.8 million in 2009, from the $40.7 million in 2008. G&A as a percentage of total revenues fell to 4.1% from 4.4%. Weighted average shares outstanding increased 9.2% in 2009 due to equity issuances.
And finally, guidance; as Debbie mentioned we are initiating 2010 normalized FFO fully diluted share guidance at $2.69-$2.75, without NOI from some of those (inaudible) operations expected to be between $128-138 million. The mid-point of our initial 2010 guidance is $2.72, which represents 1.5% of FFO per share growth in 2010.
There is an $0.08-$0.09 dilution in 2010 from our 2009 debt and equity offerings in asset sales, which were completed in 2009 to strengthen our balance sheet and to slightly higher 2010 G&A. This should be more than off-set by positive, strong increases in FFO from contractual escalations from our triple-net portfolio. The full-year impact 2009 investments increased that a lot from our centralized managed communities and in a creative use of cash-on-hand during 2010.
Our key assumptions for our guidance (inaudible) that total summarized NOI from our 79 assets bring us from $128million to $138 million. G&A expenses range between $39 million and $41 million and we invest our cash-on-hand. But our guidance does not include other material acquisition or vesture activity, deal cause, capital transaction or litigation expenses or proceeds.

Just proportionally so because it earns virtually nothing as it sits on our balance sheet, so the whole acquisitions department is pretty much lining up to get their deal for that $100 million so that they can get all that good accretion.  So obviously  I mean that's real earnings growth but it is somewhat artificial when you take a longer term view and you step back and - you know putting all joking aside, when we look at acquisitions we're looking at our long term cost to capital which we believe is continuing to decrease.  We do have an attractive balance sheet and liquidity position, and we have a lot of liquidity available to make acquisitions, and we think because of our investment grade rating that we should be able to continue to drive down our cost to capital.  Our long term cost to capital.  Which has been our goal because that's really how you make money over the long term and we believe we need to invest over that long term cost to capital to really make money and drive value for the franchise.

Now in addition to that I think that within our Sunrise portfolio there's been continued and increased focus on targeted marketing and development of referral services which I think has also enabled them to get more actionable and qualified leads in the door so they're able to close on a higher percentage of the folks that they're bringing into the buildings and that's been helpful as well.

I think our portfolio has performed very well, our occupancies are excellent.  The cash flow is consistent and growing so we're happy to chip away at it if we can find good large opportunities we can bite it off in a bigger chunk and make money for our shareholders and certainly we'd like to do that, but we're not going to press to make that happen.

We always felt that our portoflio is well postiioend, the assets that we were targetin gwe well positioned to play into those incrmeental benefits, but I think whether or not health care reform comes, MOBs, for instance, are still very well positoined.  They're the first place where the agign baby boom demographic touches the helath care system and they're turnign 65 in this year and nex tyear.  
So that dynamic hasn't changed.  The funding of that hasn't changed so I think that the things that we liked about medical office buildings remain intact.  What may have changed is whether or not there are going ot be another pool of currently unisnured people that would have access to sort of hyperdrive those growth drivers.

My Ventas colleagues and I are pleased to be joining you today from our Chicago office. Today, we will have a brief overview of the quarter followed by a portfolio performance review and investment outlook from Ray Lewis and a detailed discussed of financial results from Rich Schweinhart. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to answer your questions.
Ventas first quarter results showed continued strong and improving financial results including and normalized FSO per share at $0.57 at the clinical growth rate of 1.6% in an ally for our Sunrise managed portfolio and reliable and increasing rent in our tripe net leased portfolio. Overall, our portfolio of high quality productive senior housing and house care assets enjoying 4.3% same store cash NOI growth in the quarter compared to last year. During the quarter, we were very pleased to share our growing cash flows with our stock holders by paying the cash dividends at annual rate at $2.14 per share. This represents a 4.4% increase from our 2009 dividend level and demonstrates the confidence we have in our company, our assets our assets and our process. We have also made continued significant progress on the credit rating and liquidity side. 
We believe strongly and have stated consistently that reducing our cost of capital and managing risk. Our team measures of our ability to succeed on behalf of shareholders. Having three investment grade ratings and a recent positive outlook revision for S&P will help us achieve our goal of lower debt cost. They also serve as important indicator that we continue to manage the firm prudently on your behalf. Turning to our balance sheet, our unsecured line of credit stand at a $1 billion of committed capital, maturing in 2012. We have received a total of $410 million in additional commitment since we extended our line in March 2009 including over 200 million of additional commitments received from the beginning of this year. This liquidity condition creates excellent financial flexibility and provides a ready source of capital progress. We are sincerely delighted to have a great lineup of quality vendor, those long time Ventas supporters and new institutions backing us on with their participation in our line of credit.
Finally, I want to emphasize the consistency and reliability of a tax growth in the health care and senior housing real estate phase. Throughout the recent and severe economic downturn, Ventas delivered positive same store underlying growth and FFO. And our ability to deliver the carrier returns to stakeholders is not limited to recessionary period. In fact, healthcare race for the top performing sector for the tax re-size and tenure period all of all real property factors.
Our business model relationship, rate management team and financial strength should allow us to drive in a variety of economic capital market and reimbursement environment. The healthcare real estate representing a $700 billion growing market, Ventas is an excellent position to capitalize on opportunities and it continues to build shareholder value. Ray?

Our diversified portfolio high-quality healthcare and seniors housing assents exhibited another strong performance during the first quarter, driven by cash flow growth in both our triple-net leased and third-party managed operating portfolios.
You recall that 75% of our NOI come from our pool mobile facility maps releases with credit and structural support that can track growth escalations. Another 23% comes from our high quality operating portfolio of senior housing and MOB assets. During the first quarter of 2010, same store cash NOI under 397 assets and our triple-net leased portfolio increased by 2.85 over the first quarter of 2009. Cash NOI in our hospitals grew 2.6%, senior’s housing grew 2.7% and skilled nursing delivered 3% growth versus the prior period. Ventas’ triple-net lease-to-assets continue to displace stable cash flow coverage of 1.8 times through the fourth quarter of 2009, the latest date reported.
It is important to remember that Ventas has cash flows for rent from our triple-net leased tenant are not affected by as in flows and our operator’s cash flows due to changes in the operating results or reimbursement. We are the most senior obligation in our tenant’s capital structure and are large pool guaranteed master leases are designed to anticipate and absorb changed in tenant EBITDA overtime.
That is why our triple-net leased cash flow conjunction system and reliable growth year-after-year. Our triple-net lease portfolio has very limited near-term maturities. The weighted average remaining lease term for our triple-net leased assets is approximately 6.5 years and only 1% of our triple-net portfolio is up for renewal before 2013. So our triple-net leased portfolio continued to perform very well and beyond track to provide same store cash growth in 2010 exceeding 2.5% consistent with what we have said in our February call.
Now let's turn to our operating portfolio which consists of 79 high end mansion style system living communities managed by Sunrise Senior living and 26 medical office building. Performance in our combined operating portfolio is also very strong with annualized growth in the first quarter of 2010 of 16.6% versus the first quarter of 2009, up from a combination of both acquisition and improving fundamental.
First, I will discuss our portfolio at senior housing community managed by Sunrise from which we derived 18% of our ST level NOI. These communities delivered $33.8 million of NOI in the first quarter, an increase of $500,000 or 1.6% over the fourth quarter of 2009 despite the fact that first quarter had two fewer days.
Perhaps more encouraging is the fact that Sunrise NOI grew 11% on year-over-year basis. In each case, NOI improvements in our Sunrise portfolio were driven by higher rate and higher margin. During the quarter, we saw positive trends in average daily rate as many of our U.S. communities were able to increase resident rate on the first of the year. 
At the first quarter, average daily rate was $178, up 2.4% over the fourth quarter, year-over-year, the ADR increased 4.8%, driven by a combination of annual rate increases and favorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate. Margins in the portfolio also trended positively during the first quarter, increasing 50 basis points, 31.3% sequentially, notably margin also showed an improvement of 170 basis point over the first quarter of 2009.
NOI for 78 stable communities improved this quarter, rising to $33.1 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Occupancy softened to 88.4% down 40 basis points compared to the fourth quarter and 60 basis points compared to last year. 
Our loan lease of asset had a great quarter. Steel at the high end independent living and assisted living building in Toronto NOI occupancy and rate at this property all improved significantly versus prior period as the building continues to trend towards stabilization. 
So to sum it up our Sunrise portfolio has started the year well and is in line with our previously issued NOI guidance of $128 to $138 million. The rest of Ventas’ operating portfolio is comprised of over 1.7 million square feet of medical office buildings which accounts for about 5% of our total NOI. 
This portfolio of which over 80% is located on campuses of major hospital systems again provided stable and growing cash flow for Ventas. Starting with our same store stabilized pool of 18 medical office buildings, Ventas share of NOI in the first quarter increased both sequentially by 2.1% and year-over-year by over 11% to $4.7 million. 
Same store medical office building NOI of $4.9 million increased sequentially by 2.1% and year-over-year by 4.3%. Margins also improved compared to prior periods. Occupancy at our medical office building remains strong at over 94% and rents remain stable over the prior period. 
We had one property our 93% lease property in Aventura, Florida moved from lease up to stabilize during the first quarter bringing our total stabilized portfolio to 22 buildings and 1.4 million square feet. Our four remaining properties and lease up continue to show positive leasing momentum and perform in line with expectations. Leasing prospects for this portfolio remained positive including 47,000 square feet of leases assigned but not yet an occupancy and a solid forward pipeline of potential tenants.
When tenants who have already signed leases move in the occupancy in our four medical office building lease of asset sure to rise from 73% to over 87% and we expect occupancy to increase in our leased portfolio to over 90% in the next 12 months.
So we are pleased with the company’s progress in medical office. Our portfolio has ground to over 1.7 million square feet accounts for 5% of our total NOI continues to provide reliable and growing cash flow and is currently generating an un-leveraged yield on investment of over 8.5. 
We continue to believe that MOBs present a compelling long term investment thesis. The sector will be fueled by the baby boomer demographic that is turning 65, and becoming Medicare eligible in 2011 additionally this over 65 population is also growing at three times the rate of the total population over the next 10 years.
We believe that over time health care reform in increasing coverage for the uninsured will also increase utilization of outpatient health care facilities such as medical office building
And finally as health care providers continue to seek ways of generating capital; we expect to see a continued trend of hospital asset monetization that will transfer ownership to more efficient holder of real-estate such as health care we expect that this area will continue to be a focus for us in 2010.
While we are on that topic, let’s turn it to the acquisition outlook for a moment. You may recall that we began to ramp up our investment level during the second half of 2009 and during the first quarter we began to see an increase in the number of opportunities coming to market.
Improvements in both the debt and equity capital market should lead to an increasing number of transactions being completed in the market as the year goes on. However given the improving general economic environment the amount of capital looking to invest in cash flow and real-estate and the strong underlying fundamentals of health-care and senior housing, we expected that acquisitions, the market for acquisition will be increasingly competitive, we have positioned the company well for 16 by creating an investment great balance sheet with tremendous liquidity and access to multiple low cost sources of capital. We are currently working on a variety of investments opportunities both large and small. 
With our resources financial strength and relationships we are committed further growing and diversifying our business in 2010. With that I will turn the call over to Richard Schweinhart and to discuss our financial results, Rick?

First quarter normalized FFO was $0.67 per diluted share. Additionally we continue to focus on the gaining strong balance sheet double liquidity and increasing cash flow from operations. 
At March 31, our cash balance was $133 million and we have only $38 million outstanding on a revolving credit facility. Currently we have $992 million of undrawn availability and cash on hand is approximately $126 million. Our credit status remained excellent with net debt to pro-forma EBITDA to 4.1 tons and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 3.2 times. 
Our March 31, 2010 debt to enterprise value is 27%, our cash flow from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, increased to 116 million from a 114 million with a comparable quarter last year and 99 million in the fourth quarter.
Details of the first quarter earnings are normalized FFO was $105.2 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Normalize FFO experienced $2.2 million consisting of merger related expenses, deal cost and income tax benefit. First quarter normalized FFO increased from last years first quarter due to NOI increases in all three of our portfolios, triple net sunrise managed and medical office building and rollover interest expense.
Triple net lease revenues grew to $117.0 million from $114.1 million primarily due to contractual escalations. Under NOI increased 11%, to $33.8 million this quarter from $30.5 million last year. Also year-over-year our medical office building NOI grew to $8 million from $5.4 million primarily due to acquisitions.
Interest expense decrease to $44.3 million from $45.9 million in the first quarter last primarily as a result of lower debt balances in the forward. G&A and stock based compensation was fairly flat of last year. Weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter at 157 million increased 10% over first quarter of last year due to our second quarter of 2009 equity issuance and remained fairly flat versus $156.7 million in the fourth. First quarter had for diluted share increased to $0.65 compared to 40.64 in the first quarter last year and $0.62 in the fourth quarter.
We are reaffirming our 2010 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance at $2.69 to $2.75. We continue to see year-over-year growth in our earnings per share even though we have 3% more shares outstanding for the year. 
This positive trend as indicative of the growing and reliable cash flows, where our diversified high quality and productive portfolio of healthcare and senior housing continues to provide. Our key assumptions for our 2010 normalized FFO for share guidance haven’t changed. They are total sunrise NOI for our 79 assets ranges from $128 million to $138 million, G&A expenses ranges between $39 million and $41 million and we invest our cash on hand by mid year.
But our guidance does not include other material acquisitions or divestiture activity. Deal costs, capital transaction or litigation expenses are proceeds. Operator, if you will please open the call for question.

I think it really goes back to whether or not the asset has more dynamic cash flows and if it does, maybe appropriate for the REIT to employ a RIDEA structure on that assets, so if it’s an expansion or something where the cash flows are going up, you might want to do a RIDEA structure participate in that. And if it’s a asset with more static cash flows where you are more likely to track CPI overtime then it’s probably more suitable for a triple net lease structure.

And we were really happy to get recognized for that at lower our cost to debt which at the end of the day it's really what it's all about because we want to use that to make more money for shareholders.
So I don't believe that it reduces our flexibility at all. And I think we’ve always managed the company to really be an investment grade quality company, I think we’ve had really excellent balance sheet and risk management which we would expect to continue.
And so I only see the rating agencies to doing any constraints on that, that are not goals that we set for ourselves, which is release and balance, growing tax growth and continually managing risk and that's what we always do and that we will continue to do.
So if you look at what we’ve said to all constituencies at overtime we would expect to manage the firm at about a five times EBITDA level we are about four times now.
And then over time that could vary may be a turn plus or minus for short periods of time so if you look at that and at about $5 billion. I’ve read about five times I think we have $1 billion or more of investment capacity even just to get to the five times. And so I feel really good about where we are.

Today the Ventas management team is with me in our Chicago office and we are very pleased to be joined by Todd Lillibridge",1071,"Thanks, David. Good morning to all of our shareholders and participants and welcome to the Ventas 2010 second quarter earnings call. Today the Ventas management team is with me in our Chicago office and we are very pleased to be joined by Todd Lillibridge, our newest colleague.
We have a lot of excellent news to cover today, including positive earnings, increased normalized FFO per share guidance, the closing of the Lillibridge acquisition, good results from our operating portfolio of seniors housing and a constructive and active investment outlook. 
Ventas is delivering on its promise of preserving and creating value for its stakeholders through consistent reliable cash flow growth from a diversified portfolio of productive, healthcare and senior housing assets. We continue to enhance our growth through strategic and accretive acquisitions, while also maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. 
After an overview of results and a discussion of our acquisition of Lillibridge, Ray Lewis will discuss our asset performance and investment strategy and Rick Schweinhart will report on our financial results in detail. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to answer your questions. 
Let's begin with the exciting acquisition of Lillibridge Healthcare Services which closed earlier this month. In one fell swoop, we acquired an interest in 96 medical office buildings. We are now the national leader in the large and growing medical office building sector. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Lillibridge Healthcare Services, we own and/or manage a 153 medical office and outpatient assets containing $8.6 million square feet located in 20 states.
The combination of Ventas' strong balance sheet and access to capital with Lillibridge's experienced, relationship and integrated capabilities should provide attractive real estate solutions for hospital clients and drive value in our firm.
The acquired MOBs have a very desirable profile. They are 92% on campus; all affiliated with single A and double A rated hospitals and health systems. 86% occupied and located in 17 states. The 92 stabilized MOBs in which we acquired an ownership interest are over 87% occupied and the 34 wholly owned stabilized MOBs we purchased are 94% occupied. 
There is a compelling thesis for investing in the large and growing MOB arena that I'd like to recap today. 
First, its $175 billion highly fragmented market. Hospitals remain the largest owners of the asset class which is expected to grow 30% in the next 10 years. We should see increased utilization as the 79 million baby (inaudible) become Medicare eligible starting in 2011, and grow at three times the rate of the overall population.
Healthcare reform should also increase demand as roughly 32 million uninsured individuals gain access to the healthcare system. Importantly, healthcare reform will also drive patient care to the lowest cost most clinically appropriate setting which in many cases is an outpatient site.
Hospital capital needs should incent hospital owners of MOBs to sell their real estate to more efficient owners like Ventas in order to fund operations and higher yielding capital projects. And finally, well located on campus MOBs tend to deliver long term stable cash flow. 
Moving from the strategic to the specific let me describe the financial terms of our Lillibridge transaction. Our acquisition price for Lillibridge was $381 million in total. The purchase price represents approximately 15 times expected second half 2010 normalized EBITDA of (inaudible) as an integrated real estate owner and services business. This is in line with and at the low end of the EBITDA multiples of the publicly traded integrated MOB company.
We funded the acquisition with cash on hand, a draw on our revolver and the assumption of $125 million of mortgage debt. 
We estimate that the $381 million purchase price will be allocated approximately 93% to the real estate and 7% to the platform businesses, subject to final allocation valuation.
The real estate purchase price equates to a per square foot value of between $150 and $160.
With cash NOI for the second half of 2010 for Ventas' portion of the MOBs, estimated to be between $13.5 million and $14 million. The cap rate on the real estate NOI should range between 7.6% and 7.9%. 
Recall that we acquired a 100% interest in 38 MOBs, a 20% interest in 24 MOBs and a 5% interest in 34 MOBs, as well as a 100% interest in (inaudible) brand, client relationships and integrated platform of property management, leasing, construction and development, advisory and asset management services. The allocated estimated purchase price for the platform businesses represents about a 2.5 types multiple on Lillibridge's estimated second half annualized revenues from the service businesses.
Our investment in this excellent business platform should enable us to grow the MOB business in a scalable way by giving us the internalized capabilities, relationships and scale we need.
We're also very excited to have Todd Lillibridge and his team leading our combined MOB and outpatient business under the nationally recognized (inaudible) brand. Their 20 plus years principally serving highly rated healthcare systems and hospitals have been characterized by high integrity, strong relationships with clients and an excellent track record.
We welcome Todd and our new Lillibridge colleagues to Ventas. We are confident that all the pieces are in place for the Lillibridge acquisition to create significant additional value for Ventas stakeholders by further diversifying our portfolio, delivering reliable cash flows, and providing new avenues for growth. We will do everything we can to execute this transaction effectively so we can deliver those results.
Turning to the highlights of our quarter. First we are very pleased to report strong normalized FFO per share of $0.71, an increase of 4.4%, compared to last year. Increased 2010 normalized FFO guidance, that if achieved would represent year-over-year per share growth of 2.6 to 4.5%.
This quarter, we enjoyed year-over-year cash flow from operations growth of over 6%. 
Our seniors housing operating portfolio also exhibited positive NOI and occupancy trends. Our total portfolio of high quality and productive senior housing and healthcare assets achieved year-over-year same store NOI growth of 5.4%.
And we ended the quarter with an incredibly strong balance sheet that positions us to continue to grow and diversify.
Before I turn the call over to Ray, I'd like to make one comment on the Medicare rate increases expected for both skilled nursing facilities and long term acute care hospitals. In both asset classes, Medicare reimbursement is slated to increase for fiscal year 2011 which begins October 1, 2010. Ray?

With the closing of the Lillibridge's acquisition, Ventas' portfolio of high quality healthcare and seniors housing assets now totals approximately 600 properties located in 44 states and two Canadian provinces and is even more diversified",1131,"Thanks, Debby. With the closing of the Lillibridge's acquisition, Ventas' portfolio of high quality healthcare and seniors housing assets now totals approximately 600 properties located in 44 states and two Canadian provinces and is even more diversified by tenant, operator, payer source, and asset class.
First, I will review the performance of our triple net lease portfolio. Approximately 73% of our NOI comes from our pooled multi facility master leases with credit and structural support and contractual growth escalations.
Once again, this part of our portfolio provided consistent and growing cash flows to Ventas during the quarter as it generated a 2.6% year-over-year increase in same store cash NOI. This strong performance was driven by among other things our annual Kindred rent escalations that occurred on May 1. NOI from Kindred now approximates 38% of total portfolio NOI and equals about $249 million annually.
Our triple-net lease portfolio continues to track our guidance that we stated at the beginning of the year when we projected same store cash growth of over 2.5% for 2010. Occupancies in our triple-net senior housing and hospital properties trended positively during the first quarter, the latest date reported on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Occupancy in our skilled nursing portfolio remains stable at a nearly 90% level.
Cash flow coverage across our triple-net portfolio decreased slightly from 1.8 times to 1.7 times. You will recall that our triple-net leases are designed to anticipate ebbs and flows and operator cash flows based on changes in their operating results or reimbursement and are mostly in large pooled multi-facility master leases which provide structural protection to Ventas cash flows.
Ventas remains very well covered and secure. Moreover, the majority of these rent payments come from and are guaranteed by large, publicly traded operators that are leaders in their industry such as (inaudible), the largest post acute provider and Brookdale, the largest senior living provider. So the take away for our triple-net portfolio is that we continue to be pleased with the growing and reliable cash flows these assets provide Ventas year after year.
Now I'd like to turn to the performance of our operating portfolio. During the second quarter our operating portfolio included 79 high-end matching style assisted living communities managed by Sunrise Senior Living and 26 medical office buildings managed by third parties. This portfolio accounted for 25% of our NOI during the quarter. As I'll discuss, this part of our portfolio continues to perform well and deliver improving results.
First, let me address our portfolio of need driven seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise, which accounted for 20% of our portfolio NOI during the second quarter. We acquired this portfolio in April of 2007 and in reviewing the historical trends, occupancy in the second quarter has always been lower than in the first quarter.
However this year, the portfolio outperformed that trend as our stable portfolio achieved average occupancy of 88.4%, which was flat with the first quarter levels and 120 basis points higher than the second quarter of last year. Moreover, we finished the quarter with a spot occupancy rate of over 89% on our stable properties.
Total portfolio NOI for the quarter was $38.8 million. These results include a $3 million cash payment from Sunrise for expense overruns. Excluding this payment our portfolio delivered a 6% increase in NOI sequentially driven primarily by an extra day in the quarter and lower expenses.
Again, excluding the $3 million cash payment, margins for the 78 stabilized communities increased 140 basis points to 32.8% compared to the first quarter of this year. Year-over-year NOI for the portfolio also excluding the $3 million payment from Sunrise grew to 5.9% during the quarter driven by increases in rate and occupancy.
We have one lease up asset in the portfolio which is the high end 229 unit independent living community in Toronto known as Steals. This newly built property continues to fill with occupancy up 150 basis points sequentially and up 1,870 basis points year-over-year to 86.6% in the quarter. NOI, occupancy and margin all continue to trend well versus prior periods.
The operating trends in the portfolio continue to improve across the board. As a result of the year-to-date performance, we are increasing our NOI guidance for the Sunrise portfolio to $139 million to $145 million compared to our prior guidance of $128 million to $138 million.
For the balance of the year, we expect consistent performance for the first half. At the mid point of this range, this would equate to an impressive 8.4% year-over-year growth in NOI compared to the $131 million in 2009. 
Now let's turn to medical office. Our medical office building portfolio which comprised 1.7 million square feet during the second quarter also did well with occupancy stable and margin improving on a sequential and year-over-year basis.
Our stabilized pool of 22 assets generated $6.5 million of NOI to Ventas which implies a gap yield of roughly 8.5% on average on Ventas' investment. Year-over-year, our same-store stabilized pool of 19 assets, occupancy remains strong at 93.5% and margin improved. We also have four assets that remain in our lease up portfolio totaling 330,000 square feet which continue to perform well.
Occupancy in the second quarter for these four assets was 81.6%, an increase of 820 basis points compared to the first quarter's 73.4% occupancy. NOI and margin also continued to exhibit positive trends during the quarter, as current signed leases take occupancy, we expect continued improvement in this portfolio.
So we continue to be pleased with the performance of our MOB portfolio, including the Lillibridge assets, MOB NOI will now comprise 8% of Ventas' annualized NOI and total $8.6 million square feet. We look forward to providing you with the operating performance of that portfolio during our next earnings call. 
Let me turn for a moment to the acquisitions environment. We were pleased to close the Lillibridge transaction earlier this quarter. This transformative transaction puts the Ventas squarely on the medical office map with 153 medical office buildings owned or managed in 20 states, 45 cities, and 65 markets nationwide.
Moreover, with the addition of our new Lillibridge colleagues, we now have the integrated management, leasing and development platform that we have so long aspired to. With the Lillibridge acquisition we have closed over $400 million of new investments in 2010, but we are not done.
We continue to work on a number of interesting opportunities in each of our core asset types and while the market remains competitive for high quality cash flowing healthcare real estate we are well positioned to compete because of our low leverage relationships, track record, experience and excellent access to low cost capital.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart to discuss our financial results.

The highlights of the second quarter are that operating income was up from last year's second quarter and also increased compared to the first quarter. Second quarter 2010 normalized FFO was $0.71 per diluted share, an increase of 4.4% compared to the second quarter of 2009 on 2% more shares outstanding.
Additionally, we continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flow from operations.
At June 30th our cash balance was $28 million and we had $126 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility. Our credit stats remain excellent with net debt to pro forma EBITDA at four times and our fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of three times. Our June 30th, 2010 debt to enterprise value is 26%. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter ended June 30th, 2010 increased to $92 million from $82 million for the comparable quarter last year, up 12%. 
On July 1st, we acquired Lillibridge Healthcare Services and currently have approximately $35 million of cash and $345 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility.
During the quarter we had five items of note. First, in June, we opportunistically redeemed $142.7 million of our 7% and 1/8% senior notes due 2015. We used the call option in our bonds and paid 103.6 of par. The economic return of this investment was 7%. We recorded a $6.4 million of loss on extinguishment of debt. We also repaid $52 million of maturing mortgage debt.
Second. Also in June, we acquired from Sunrise its minority interest in two of our Sunrise managed properties for $9.9 million. This represented a cap rate of over 9% on NOI.
Third. We sold four assets not current tenant for $22.5 million and achieved a $5 million gain on sale. Fourth. Normalized FFO includes $3 million cash payment from Sunrise for expense overrides. And fifth. Merger related expenses and deal costs total $4.2 million in quarter, mostly due to our July 1 acquisition of Lillibridge. 
Details of the second quarter earnings are as follows:
Normalized FFO was $111.9 million or $0.71 per diluted share. Normalized FFO includes the previously mentioned $3 million cash payment from Sunrise and excludes $5.6 million net expense consisting of loss on the early extinguishment of debt, merger related expenses and deal costs offset by gains on the sale of properties and an income tax benefit.
Second quarter normalized FFO increased from last years second quarter due to NOI increases in all three of our portfolios, triple-net, Sunrise managed and medical office buildings.
Triple-net leases grew to $118 million from $116.3 million, primarily due to contractual escalations. Sunrise managed NOI increased 15% to $38.8 million this quarter from $33.9 million last year. Second quarter 2010 NOI includes the Sunrise $3 million, cash payment as a reduction of expenses.
Excluding the $3 million, Sunrise managed NOI increased 5.9%. In comparison first quarter was $33.8 million. Also, second quarter year-over-year our medical office building NOI grew to $8.1 million from $5.3 million primarily due to acquisitions. Second quarter results do not include any results from our July 1st acquisition of Lillibridge. 
Interest expense was flat at $44 million compared to last year and slightly better than the first quarter. G&A and stock based compensation was fairly flat with last year and slightly down from the first quarter. Weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter at $157.4 million, increased 2% over second quarter of last year and remain fairly flat versus $157.0 million in the first. Second quarter normalized FAD per diluted share increased to $0.69 compared to $0.66 in the second quarter last year and $0.65 from the first quarter.
We are increasing our 2010 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance to $2.75 to $2.80 from $2.69 to $2.75. This reflects a positive trend in our Sunrise portfolio, our debt retirements and our Lillibridge acquisition. This positive trend is indicative of the growing and reliable cash flows that are diversified, high quality and productive portfolio of healthcare and senior housing continues to provide.
Our key assumptions for our 2010 normalized FFO per share guidance are that total Sunrise NOI for our 79 assets ranges from $139 million to $145 million, up from $128 million to $138 million. Corporate G&A expenses ranges between $41 million and $43 million. You will recall that our original guidance assumed we would invest all of our cash, approximately $150 million mid year which we have now accomplished. Our guidance does not include other material acquisitions or divestiture activity, deal cost, capital transactions, or litigation expenses or proceeds.

Basically the residents that live in our buildings don't really have any alternative to stay in their homes any longer. They need the services that our buildings provide and they are not capable of living independently in their home. 
So while they have the ability to potentially delay the decision for a few months, they can't postpone it indefinitely and that's why I think you're seeing both in the industry and then within our portfolio that assisted living and Alzheimer have held up extremely well even through the depths of the downturn.

There are a number of opportunities to pursue in that space and we're excited about working on those. The TRS structure, I think, is appropriate for the seniors housing space. If you believe where we are in the cycle as being a good entry point, then you'd be willing to use the TRS. We certainly have additional capacity to do that so we would be interested in those types of transactions. 
With respect to skilled nursing, as you point out, there are a number of companies that have either near term liquidity needs or private equity or other recapitalization requirements that could present opportunities for us. We are comfortable with and understand the space and that's another area where we would deploy capital. So as I said in my opening remarks, we're pleased to get the Lillibridge transaction done. We're not done with acquisitions for the year. We're working on a lot of things and we'll continue to make progress.

We actually do believe that Medicaid will increase, and again in healthcare, when people talk about cuts a lot of times they're talking about reductions in the rate of growth, not necessarily cuts, and it's our own internal expectation that Medicaid on the whole portfolio at skilled nursing will actually be positive and we believe and it's not certain, but we believe Congress will extend the SMAP assistance to the State, which in turn supports in many cases the Medicaid program.

And welcome to the Ventas 2010 third quarter earnings call. My colleagues and I are pleased to join you today from our Chicago office.
I'd like to address our recent acquisition activity and this quarter's excellent earnings. Ray Lewis will cover operations and investments. And after Rick Schweinhart reviews our financial results in detail we'll be happy to take your questions. Ventas has been very active since the beginning of the third quarter. We closed our Lillibridge acquisition, announced a mutually beneficial deal with Sunrise Senior Living, we agreed to acquire the real estate assets of Atria Senior Living Group and we made important organizational moves.
First, we closed the acquisition of Lillibridge Healthcare Services, adding 96 medical office buildings to our portfolio and becoming the national leader in integrated medical office building ownership, development, property management and advisory work. Both the MOBs and the Lillibridge service businesses are performing well, slightly ahead of our expectations and the combination of our firms is complete. We are enjoying our new relationship with Todd Lillibridge and his organization and we look forward to building our businesses together.
Second, we were very pleased to announce an attractive transaction with Sunrise Senior Living to purchase all of its real estate interest in our Sunrise managed high quality assisted living portfolio and amend our management contracts with Sunrise. Our collaboration with Sunrise and its management resulted in a multi-faceted transaction that benefits both companies and we are working together to close that deal in the coming weeks. We are really starting to see the benefits of the focused efforts of the Sunrise team and the quality of our Sunrise managed assets as our NOIs and occupancies in our Sunrise portfolio continue to improve.
Third, we recently agreed to acquire the real estate assets of Atria Senior Living Group for $3.1 billion. This exciting and transformational investment will add 118 high quality private pay seniors housing assets to Ventas' portfolio and will make us the largest donor of seniors housing in the U.S. We are acquiring high quality assets in superior locations with excellent growth prospects.
As structured, the transaction will increase the amount of Ventas NOI derived from private pay sources to fully two-thirds, improve our tenant operator diversification, expand our scale to over 700 assets and a $14 billion enterprise value and last, keep us in a strong and safe balance sheet position.
Finally, Atria is a fantastic operator of seniors housing with a robust scalable infrastructure and an excellent team committed to high quality care for seniors. Atria will be owned by Lazard and the management team as an independent private company, following the closing. Supply demand fundamentals in the senior housing sector are extremely favorable and Ventas is well-positioned to enjoy the benefits of these powerful demographic trends through our ownership of over 35,000 units of independent and assisted living.
Importantly, the best assets in the best markets are Sunrise and Atria assets, are in a management contract or RIDEA structure so the growth in these assets will flow directly to Ventas shareholders. We strongly believe that the Atria transaction will create value for Ventas stakeholders. It represents our sixth major acquisition since 2004 and advances our strategic vision of building an excellent, high performing enterprise composed of diverse and productive healthcare and senior living assets.
Earlier this week, I was genuinely delighted to announce the promotion of my colleague, Ray Lewis to President of Ventas. Ray's promotion is well deserved and recognizes his many contributions to our success, his leadership and his commitment to our Firm. Ray will continue to supervise all of our investments and our asset management function for our soon to be $14 billion portfolio.
Overall, we are very fortunate to have a dedicated group of professionals with a lot of continuity at Ventas. It is the combination of our cohesive team and our growing diverse asset base supported by powerful demographic trends that position Ventas for another decade of success and excellence.
Moving to the quarter, we're very happy to report positive news on many fronts. We have excellent normalized FFO per share this quarter of $0.73, an increase of 11% over the prior year, improving occupancies and NOI in our Sunrise portfolio that Ray will discuss in greater detail.
Year-over-year, same store NOI growth for our whole portfolio of 5.6%. Cash flow from operations growth of 8%, compared to the 2009 same period. A great balance sheet with low leverage of 4.3 time’s net debt to EBITDA and 26% debt to enterprise value. And, as a result of all of these factors, we are increasing our 2010 normalized FFO guidance to $2.84 to $2.86 per share. At the midpoint, this would equal 6.3% year-over-year per share growth.
With that overview, I'd like to turn the call over to our newly appointed President, Ray Lewis.

398549,114253812,86031,"Ventas Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2010",2010-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Debbie. Our diversified portfolio of roughly 600 properties experienced another quarter of strong performance. These high quality assets have Best-in-Class tenant operators and will be complemented by our recent announcement that we will acquire 1",1253,"Thanks, Debbie. Our diversified portfolio of roughly 600 properties experienced another quarter of strong performance. These high quality assets have Best-in-Class tenant operators and will be complemented by our recent announcement that we will acquire 118 senior housing properties from Atria, the country's fourth largest operator.
Upon the closing of the Atria transaction, Ventas' portfolio will increase to over 700 assets in 44 states and two Canadian provinces and will be well diversified by tenants, operator, pay or source and asset class. Let me start by talking about the performance of our triple-net lease portfolio where Ventas receives approximately 69% of its NOI.
As you'll recall, this portfolio provides stable and growing cash flows backed by pooled multi-facility master leases with credit and structural support from industry leading operators. During the second quarter of 2010, the most recent available, cash flow coverage was a strong 1.7 times. Occupancies in our triple-net seniors housing portfolio continue to trend positively during the second quarter, up 60 basis points sequentially and 270 basis points year-over-year.
Moreover, same store cash flows to Ventas continued to grow steadily during the third quarter at 2.6% year-over-year, on track with our guidance at the beginning of the year. We continue to have minimal near term lease maturities with less than 1% of the portfolio rolling before 2013 and an average remaining lease term of approximately six years.
Our tenant, Kindred which currently accounts for 36% of Ventas' NOI and is the largest provider of post acute care in the U.S., reported another great quarter of earnings with operating cash flows up 18% year-over-year and third quarter earnings per share at the top end of its corporate guidance. Additionally, Kindred should benefit from the better than expected final ruling for Medicare Part B therapy was that was released on Tuesday.
Now let's turn to Ventas' operating portfolio which is comprised of 79 high end mansion style assisted living communities managed by Sunrise Senior Living and 153 medical office buildings managed by Lillibridge and other third party managers. This portfolio accounts for approximately 28% of Ventas' NOI and provided another quarter of strong performance.
Starting with our Sunrise portfolio, which accounts for 19% of our NOI, the third quarter exhibited strong occupancy gains. Third quarter occupancy in our 78 stable assets was 89.5%, up 110 basis points over the second quarter. This positive trend and stabilized occupancy has continued into the fourth quarter as the portfolio is currently over 90%.
As the economy has stabilized, these need driven assets are benefiting from strong industry fundamentals as there is limited new supply and a fast growing 85 plus population fueling demand. NOI for all 79 communities during the third quarter was $39 million which includes the receipt from Sunrise of a $2 million cash payment for prior period expense overruns.
Excluding this payment, NOI was up 11% over the comparable 2009 period driven primarily by the previously mentioned occupancy gains as well as rate increases and increased margins. Quarter-over-quarter for our 78 stabilized communities margins, excluding the cash payment, increased 50 basis points to 33.3% in the third quarter.
Ventas also has one lease-up asset located in Toronto known as Steeles which continues to march toward stabilization. Third quarter occupancy at this 229 unit independent living asset was stable at 86.7%, though our latest reports on spot occupancy show it trending above 90%. We continue to be pleased with the performance of this property.
Finally, as previously announced, Ventas entered into an agreement with Sunrise to acquire the minority interests in 58 of the Sunrise communities for $186 million including $145 million of mortgages already on our balance sheet. This represents over a 10% capitalization rate on in place NOI.
Upon closing, we will own 100% of all 79 Sunrise properties in our portfolio. We also negotiate improvements to our management agreements with Sunrise including a reduction in the Sunrise management fee to 3.5% of revenues for most of 2010 and 3.75% for 2011. After which, the base management fee will be 5% to 7% of revenues.
Due to the strong performance and the positive occupancy trends we are seeing to date coupled with the favorable restructuring of our management contracts, we are increasing our 2010 NOI guidance for the Sunrise portfolio to $150 million to $154 million, compared to our prior guidance of $139 million to $145 million. At the midpoint, this equates to a year-over-year NOI growth of 16%.
Excluding cash payments we have received from Sunrise and the expected pickup from a lower management fee, Ventas' year-over-year growth for this portfolio is still an impressive 8.5% at the midpoint of our guidance range which gives confidence to our expectations for the to be acquired Atria assets.
Now let's turn to our medical office portfolio. The third quarter represented our first full quarter of ownership of Lillibridge which closed at the beginning of the quarter. Combined with Lillibridge, Ventas now owns and manages 153 medical office buildings across $8.6 million square feet and accounts for 9% of the company's NOI.
Ventas' stable consolidated MOB portfolio of 57 assets continues to post strong occupancy, exceeding 94% and good margins exceeding 65%. Regarding our Lillibridge portfolio, third quarter results exceeded our underwriting projections. During last quarter's call we told you that we expected second half cash NOI to approximate $13.5 million to $14 million. Our latest projection is forecasting cash NOI to equal or slightly exceed $14 million. If achieved, this would equate to a cash yield of approximately 8% and a GAAP yield of over 9%.
We are pleased with the initial performance of our Lillibridge MOB portfolio, along with the Ventas legacy portfolio. We intend to expand our medical office platform through the combination of Lillibridge's brand, experience, tenured professionals and long standing relationships with highly rated hospital systems along with Ventas' cost of capital, legacy partnerships and investment team.
Turning to the acquisition environment, the big news at Ventas is our previously announced $3.1 billion agreement to acquire from Atria 118 senior housing properties that Atria will manage under long-term management agreements. Pro forma for the Atria acquisition, Ventas has announced $3.6 billion of acquisitions during 2010. Moreover, we have significantly advanced two key strategic objectives by creating the market leading fully integrated medical office ownership, management, leasing and development company and adding another top tier senior housing provider to our stable of Best-in-Class tenant operators.
After the closing we will be doing business with four of the five top senior living operators in the US. With regard to market, deal flow has been steadily increasing during the quarter. The pipeline remains strong and we are continuing to see and consider a number of interesting opportunities across the healthcare real estate landscape. We have also announced the addition of John Cobb as our new Chief Investment Officer. Through his years as a senior executive at GE Healthcare Financial Services and Heller Financial, John has developed a deep role of decks of healthcare real estate contacts and an established track record of growing healthcare real estate financing businesses and leading teams of investment professionals. Moreover, John’s recent experience running a senior housing company gives him a unique insight into the operation of Seniors’ housing assets.
So I am pleased with the progress we have made across the company this year and look forward to continuing that momentum into the fourth quarter and into next year. With that, I will turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart to discuss our financial results.

Thi",772,"Thank you, Ray. The highlights of the third quarter are that on July 1st, we acquired Lillibridge Healthcare Services and their consolidated operating income was up for the last year’s third quarter and also increased compared to the second quarter. Third quarter 2010 normalized FFO was $0.73 per diluted share, an increase of 10.6% compared to the third quarter of 2009 on 1% more shares outstanding.
Additionally, we continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash flows from operations. At September 30th, our cash balance was $34 million and we had $244 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility. Our credit stats remained excellent with net debt adjusted pro forma EBITDA at 4.3 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio is in excess of three times.
Our September 30, 2010 debt-to-enterprise value is 26%. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 increased to $138 million, from $128 million for the comparable quarter last year, up 8%. We currently have approximately $30 million of cash and $240 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility.
During the quarter we had three items of note. First, the debt activity. In July, with the acquisition of Lillibridge, we assumed $79 million of mortgage debt with an average 6.3% rate. We also assumed $29 million of debt which was paid one week after the acquisition. In August, we repaid $80 million of maturing mortgage debt with an interest rate of 7.75% [ph]. In September, we closed on a $200 million three year unsecured term loan with a 4% fixed interest rate.
The proceeds were used to pay down the revolver. Second, normalized FFO includes a $2 million cash payment from Sunrise for the expense overages and third, merger related expenses and deal costs totaled $5.1 million in the quarter, primarily due to our July 1st acquisition of Lillibridge. After quarter end in October, we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of $71.7 million of our 6 5/8 senior notes due 2014 with a premium of $1.6 million.
Details of the third quarter earnings are as follows. Normalized FFO was $115.4 million, or $0.73 per diluted share. Normalized FFO includes the previously mentioned $2 million cash payment from Sunrise and excludes the $6 million net expense consisting of merger related expenses, integration costs and deal costs which I mentioned before and non-cash income tax expense.
Third quarter normalized FFO increased from last year’s third quarter due to NOI increases in all three of our portfolios, triple net, Sunrise-managed and medical office buildings. Triple net lease revenues grew to $117.9 million, from $115.8 million last year, primarily due to contractual escalations. Sunrise managed NOI increased 17% to $39 million this quarter, from $33.4 million last year. Third quarter 2010 NOI includes the Sunrise $2 million cash payment as a reduction of expenses. Excluding the $2 million, Sunrise managed NOI increased 11%.
In comparison, second quarter was $38.8 million, which included $3 million cash payment from Sunrise for expense overages. Due to the Lillibridge acquisition on July 1st, third quarter medical office building NOI grew from $5.8 million to $16.3 million including $1.4 million in unconsolidated joint ventures. Second quarter MOB NOI was $8.1 million.
Consistent with our projections, Lillibridge contributed $6.5 million in EBITDA in the third quarter, inclusive of all Lillibridge G&A. Partly as a result of the Lillibridge combination, consolidated G&A in the third quarter including stock-based compensation, totaled $15.3 million, up from the $9.9 million in the second quarter. Interest expense was up at $45.5 million this quarter, compared to last quarter’s $43.8 million, primarily due to the Lillibridge acquisition. Weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter at 157.9 million, increased 1% over third quarter of last year and remained fairly flat versus 157.4 million in the second.
We are increasing our 2010 normalized FFO per diluted share guidance to $2.84 to $2.86 from $2.75 to $2.80. This reflects the positive trends in our Sunrise portfolio, our negotiated Sunrise management fee adjustment and our Lillibridge acquisition. This positive trend is indicative of the growing and reliable cash flows that our diversified high quality and productive portfolio of healthcare and senior housing continues to provide.
Our key assumption for our 2010 normalized FFO per share guidance is that total Sunrise NOI for our 79 assets including the negotiated management fee adjustment ranges from $150 million to $154 million and consistent G&A for the fourth quarter. Our guidance does not include other material acquisitions or divestiture activity, deal costs, capital transactions, non-cash income tax expense or litigation expenses or proceeds.

You know, I think there is some additional upside in those assets through redevelopment and we’ve had some discussions with our tenants about ways that we can work together to - for us to provide capital to them to redevelop some of those assets at Alzheimer’s wings, expand, et cetera. And those are very attractive investments because you get to leverage all the fixed costs in the building and all the common area that exists. So, the returns tend to be pretty high as you can see from the materials we prepared for Atria.
With respect to transitioning those assets to RIDEA structures, I don’t think we have any current plans to do that. But I think if we talk with our operators and it made sense for both of us to do that, it’s something we would consider.

Today, I'll provide a company overview, Ray Lewis will discuss our portfolio performance and investment outlook, and Rick Schweinhart will address financial results in detail. After that, we will be happy to answer your questions.
Ventas had an excellent and highly productive 2009, overcoming the severely negative conditions that challenged our economy and capital markets during the year. I'd like to quickly recap some of the Ventas highlights of 2009.
Normalized FFO per share was $2.68, exceeding our guidance of $2.62-$2.65 per share. Notably, 2009 normalized FFO per share compressed only 1% from 2008, despite 9% more shares outstanding, meaning that our entity level FFO grows considerably during the year.
Our cash flow from operations was $422 million, an increase of over 11% from 2008, the passed the data to the S&P 500. We were also named the top financial stock of the decade, providing over 2000% total returns to shareholders during the period. In this regard we led all bank, insurance companies, REITs and diversified financials, total shareholder returns for 2009 alone was 39%.
We purchased or repaid during the year $560 million of bonds and mortgage debts. In 2009 we received an upgrade from Fitch to BBB-, one of only five total upgrades in the REIT sector from all three rating agencies during the year.
We extended our revolver to 2012 and our revolver has total current capacity of $1 billion. We raised $312 million of equity and $341 million of debt financing, we also sold 14 assets and recognized the net gain of over $66 million.
We opened or acquired 6 high quality on-campus medical office buildings all affiliated with highly rated not-for-profit hospital systems. This expanded our MOB portfolio to $1.7 million square feet. We extended the lease term on 108 healthcare assets operated by Kindred, had escalated rent levels of $126 million per year, the lease term for those assets would have expired on April 30, 2010, but was extended until 2015.
We received a unanimous jury verdict in our favor of $102 million in our lawsuit against HCP for tortuous interference with our 2007 acquisition of Sunrise REIT.
And we ended the year with an excellent balance sheet and liquidity position. Net debt to EBIDTA was 4.1 time, at year end we held over $100 million in cash-on-hand and our revolver capacity approximated $1 billion.
In sum, we have managed the company in a prudent manner that protected the downside and preserved the upside for our stakeholders. We finished the year and the decade consistent with our objectives, as a cash flowing, productive enterprise delivering consistent, superior value for all our stakeholders. Well positioned to drive in a variety of economic capital markets and reimbursing environment and ready to execute our growth and diversification plans.
2010 has begun on a very positive trajectory as well, I'd like to highlight three items in particular. Credit ratings positive momentum, a 4.4% dividend increased and improved earnings guidance for 2010.
First ratings, because of our excellent credit statistic and our cash flowing assets Moody's recently upgraded the rating on Ventas's senior unsecured debt to investment grade, awarding us a Baa3 rating earlier this month. As most of you know we have worked long and hard to merit this improved rating, we appreciate Moody's confidence in us and we now have an investment grade rating from all three major rating agencies. It is a significant accomplishment for any real-estate company to continue ratings improvement in today's environment.
Second, our board of directors just approved a 4.4% increase in our past dividend to an annualized rate of $2.14 per share. We are pleased to share our stable growing cash-flows with our shareholders while we also retain significant cash flows for growth. This decision demonstrates our confidence in Ventas' future.
And last we have introduced 2010 normalized FFO guidance of $2.69 to $2.75 per share. In terms of total normalized FFO dollars we expect FFO to grow from $409 million in 2009 to a range of $422 million to $432 million in 2010. Our same store cash NOI growth should increase by 2%-3% for the whole portfolio in 2010.
While our 2010 guidance does not (inaudible) material acquisitions the healthcare real estate sector is large growing and highly fragmented, with REITs owning only about 6% of the total investable assets. The sector generally is not over-levered in contrast with many other real-estate sectors. This should permit private owners to sell assets and obtain a much desired liquidity. As a result we do expect to see increased transactional volume in 2010 compared to the last two years, only time will tell whether these trends will translate into significant investments for Ventas, and if so, the timing and size of those investments. But we do believe we will have the opportunity to reignite our growth and diversification efforts in 2010.
I'm going to turn the call over to Ray who is going to walk you through our portfolio performance and talk a little further about the current investment environment."

Our high quality cash flowing portfolio of healthcare and senior's housing assets performed well in 2009. For the year same store cash NOI growth on our triple net leased portfolio increased by 3.4%. Cash NOI in our hospitals grew 2.6%, se",1033,"Thanks, Debbie. Our high quality cash flowing portfolio of healthcare and senior's housing assets performed well in 2009. For the year same store cash NOI growth on our triple net leased portfolio increased by 3.4%. Cash NOI in our hospitals grew 2.6%, senior's housing grew 3.2% and skilled nursing delivered 4% growth. Our triple net lease assets continue to have excellent cash flow coverages across the spectrum of independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals.
75% of our NOI comes from our pool, multi-facility master leases with credit and structural support and contractual growth escalation. Cash flow coverage through the third quarter of 2009, the latest data available remains stable at 1.8 times, this strong metric has been consistent to 2007, occupancies in the triple net seniors housing portfolio increased 80 basis points in the third quarter versus the second as we saw evidence of occupancy beginning to rise in the third quarter.
The weighted average remaining lease term for our triple net lease assets is approximately seven years and only 1% of our total triple net portfolio is up for renewal before 2013. We expect same store cash growth in our triple net portfolio to exceed 2.5% in 2010. Overall, our pool, multi-facility master leases with credit tenants continue to provide strong and steady contractual cash flow growth to Ventas.
The company's operating portfolio, which consists of 79 high-end mansion style, assisted living communities, managed by Sunrise Senior Living and 26 medical office buildings accounts for 23% of our NOI, this portion of our portfolio exhibited improving fundamentals during the quarter and ended the year on a strong note. First, let me address our need-driven operating portfolio of senior living communities managed by Sunrise.
We derive 18% of our entity level NOI from this portfolio, there occupancy in our 78 stable communities continue the trend positively during the fourth quarter and increased 70 basis points sequentially to 88.8%. This continued the positive trend and occupancy that began in the third quarter, we are pleased with two consecutive quarterly increases in occupancy for the portfolio.
Notably fourth quarter occupancy and senior's housing tends to be weaker than the third and industry statistics released by Nick(ph) earlier this week confirm that. Though our Sunrise portfolio distinguished itself by enjoying a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter occupancy and in our Sunrise lease of asset in Toronto known as, Stealth, we continue to gain momentum.
All metrics were positive sequentially in the fourth quarter and Stealth continues to gain occupancy and NOI as the community trends towards stabilization. As a result of these trends our total fourth quarter property NOI for our 79 Sunrise communities was $33.3 million fairly consistent with the $33.4 million we earned in the third quarter. This was slightly higher than what we had projected, driven by improved occupancy and slightly increased average daily rate, which rose to $173 per day in the fourth quarter, off-set by the anticipated higher expenses in the fourth quarter attributable to the spending of repair and maintenance budgets and labor cost.
Finishing the year on such a positive note caused our full year Sunrise results to total $131 million dollars above the high-end of our 2009 expectations that range from $122-$129 million.
Looking forward to 2010 guidance in our Sunrise portfolio, our total NOI projection is $128 - $138 million. The mid-point of this range $133 million represents an NOI increase of 1.5% over 2009. Our projections assume that occupancies will rise slightly ADR will increase about 1.5% and margin may experience some compression due to inflation and expense increases.
So our mid-point NOI expectation assumes that positive rate and occupancy trends continue into 2010. This should result in positive NOI growth for the portfolio absents (inaudible) double every session or another shock to the financial system. Over time very favorable supply demand fundamentals should drive growth in our Sunrise portfolio. With the over-85 population being the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population and virtually no new assisted living supply coming online in 2010 or 2011 the conditions are right for excellent performance as the economy improves.
Our medical office building portfolio, which now totals over 1.7 million square feet and represents 5% of our NOI also performed well this quarter substantially all of our 26 MOBs are on the campus of major hospital systems. In our 21 stabilized assets occupancy was a strong 94.7% in the fourth quarter. Before occupancy and our same store stabilized portfolio of 18 MOBs increased sequentially by 50 basis points to 94.4% and generated NOI of $4.8 million and increased of 2% compared to Q3 2009.
We also continue to have strong results in our MOB lease-up portfolio. We have added three development assets to this pool since the fourth quarter of 2008 all of which were on-time, on-budget substantially preleased and generating positive NOI to Ventas. NOI for the four lease-up assets we own in both the third and the fourth quarters of 2009 increased by 20%.
Leasing prospects for this portion of the portfolio are good, including 54,000 square feet of leases signed but not yet in occupancy and a strong forward pipeline of potential tenants. When tenants who have already signed leases have moved in, the occupancy on our five lease-up assets should rise from 74%-87%.
In the fourth quarter we began investing again but purchasing four Class A, on-campus medical office buildings valued at $77.7 million. The MOB acquisitions should provide Ventas with unlevered yield succeeding 8%.
In sum, our growing MOB portfolio provided stable and increasing NOI to Ventas in 2009. As you saw with our MOB acquisition activity in December we're beginning to put capital to work to continue to grow and diversify the company. Moreover we are seeing an increase in flow of opportunities across all asset classes in the healthcare and senior housing spectrum. And although we are shifting to a more offensive stance on acquisition, we remained disciplined in our investment approach and continue our practice of targeting high quality, accreted investments with excellent operators that can create long-term value for shareholders.
With that I'll turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart to discuss our financial results."

The highlights to the fourth quarter are the operating income increased 1% from the third quarter, resulting in normalized FFO of $0.67 per delivered share, additionally we continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, doubling liquidity and increasing cash-flows from operations. As Debbie mentioned we are extremely pleased that Moody's raised our rating to investment grade earlier this month. We now have investment grade ratings from all three rating agencies; we also have increased our revolver from the September capacity of $167 million to $1 billion.
The (inaudible) in April of 2012 has increased from $590 million to $800 million. At December 31, our cash balance was $107 million and we have only $8.5 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility, currently $992 million of undrawn availability and cash-on-hand of approximately $155 million. Our credit stands for being very good with net debt to pro forma EBIDTA at 4.1 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 3.2 times we closed 2009 with debt to enterprise value of 28%.
Early 2009 we repaid our purchase $411 million of our senior notes and reduced our mortgage balances by $148.7 million, which $25 million of normal periodic principal amortization. We have $175 million in total debt maturities in 2010, excluding normal periodic principal amortization payments, most of which is mortgaged debt. Our cash-flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased 11% to $422 million, from $380 million from last year.
Turning to (inaudible) for the quarter, fourth quarter normalized FFO was $104.8 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Normalized FFO excludes merger related expenses and (inaudible) of approximately $1.6 million. Fourth quarter normalized FFO increased from third quarter to primarily NOI increases in our MOB portfolio due to acquisitions and lower D&A.
Interest expense increased to $44.6 million from $43.6 million in the third quarter, primarily as a result of additional interest expense from our GSE mortgage financing of $173 million at 6.3%, which closed in the second and third quarter. D&A was $8.2 million down $1.4 million from the $9.7million in the third quarter, primarily as a result of lower non-cash stock based compensation.
Weighted average shares outstanding remained fairly plaid at $156.7 million in the fourth quarter, versus $156.5 million in the third. Fourth quarter FAD per diluted share was $0.62 compared to $0.63 in the third quarter as a result of higher routine capital expenditures in the fourth quarter, down when we compare the fourth quarter 2009 normalized FFO per diluted share to the fourth quarter of 2008.
Normalized FFO grew 11.5% to $104.8 million from $94 million from last year and the fourth quarter FFO per diluted share was $0.67 compared to $0.66 last year. Triple-net leased revenues grew to $117 million from $114.4 million, primarily due to contractual escalations. It is important to note that (inaudible) NOI increased 3% to $33.3 million this quarter from $32.2 million from last year. Also year-over-year our medical office building NOI grew to $6.7 million from $5.3 million, primarily due to acquisitions.
Interest expense decreased to $44.6 million from $50.6 million last year. Principally due to debt repayments and senior note purchases. Our weighted average cost of debt is about 6.6%.
G&A was $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, down $2.9 million from the $11.2 million in 2008, primarily as a result of low professional fees. Weighted average shares outstanding increased 9.5% for the fourth quarter of 2009, versus the comparable 2008 period to $156.7 million from $143 million. The share count increased due to our April 2009 equity offer.
Finally, left to compare the year ended December 31, 2009 to 2008. Normalized FFO grew 8% to $409 million from $379.5 million last year and FFO per diluted share was $2.68 compared to $2.71 last year. Triple-net lease revenues grew 2.5% to $465.2 million from $453.7 million primarily due to contractual escalations.
Internalized NOI decreased to $131 million from $138.8 million last year, which was better than forecast due to rising occupancies in the portfolio. (inaudible) off-set by higher expenses. Last year's results benefited from about $4 million in expense credits that didn't reoccur in 2009. On a reoccurring basis NOI's down 3% in the portfolio year-over-year. Year-over-year our medical office building NOI grew to $23.2 million from $17.3 million due primarily to acquisitions and lease-up activity.
Interest expense decreased approximately 13% to $178.5 million from $204.5 million last year, primarily due to lower debt value. G&A decreased from 4.5% to $38.8 million in 2009, from the $40.7 million in 2008. G&A as a percentage of total revenues fell to 4.1% from 4.4%. Weighted average shares outstanding increased 9.2% in 2009 due to equity issuances.
And finally, guidance; as Debbie mentioned we are initiating 2010 normalized FFO fully diluted share guidance at $2.69-$2.75, without NOI from some of those (inaudible) operations expected to be between $128-138 million. The mid-point of our initial 2010 guidance is $2.72, which represents 1.5% of FFO per share growth in 2010.
There is an $0.08-$0.09 dilution in 2010 from our 2009 debt and equity offerings in asset sales, which were completed in 2009 to strengthen our balance sheet and to slightly higher 2010 G&A. This should be more than off-set by positive, strong increases in FFO from contractual escalations from our triple-net portfolio. The full-year impact 2009 investments increased that a lot from our centralized managed communities and in a creative use of cash-on-hand during 2010.
Our key assumptions for our guidance (inaudible) that total summarized NOI from our 79 assets bring us from $128million to $138 million. G&A expenses range between $39 million and $41 million and we invest our cash-on-hand. But our guidance does not include other material acquisition or vesture activity, deal cause, capital transaction or litigation expenses or proceeds.

Just proportionally so because it earns virtually nothing as it sits on our balance sheet, so the whole acquisitions department is pretty much lining up to get their deal for that $100 million so that they can get all that good accretion. So obviously I mean that's real earnings growth but it is somewhat artificial when you take a longer term view and you step back and - you know putting all joking aside, when we look at acquisitions we're looking at our long term cost to capital which we believe is continuing to decrease. We do have an attractive balance sheet and liquidity position, and we have a lot of liquidity available to make acquisitions, and we think because of our investment grade rating that we should be able to continue to drive down our cost to capital. Our long term cost to capital. Which has been our goal because that's really how you make money over the long term and we believe we need to invest over that long term cost to capital to really make money and drive value for the franchise. So that's what we've done over time and that's how we think about it."

We always said look, there's a couple of things that are the focus of that.

We always felt that our portfolio is well positioned, the assets that we were targeting we well positioned to play into those incremental benefits, but I think whether or not health care reform comes, MOBs, for instance, are still very well positioned. They're the first place where the aging baby boom demographic touches the health care system and they're turning 65 in this year and next year.
So that dynamic hasn't changed. The funding of that hasn't changed so I think that the things that we liked about medical office buildings remain intact. What may have changed is whether or not there are going to be another pool of currently uninsured people that would have access to sort of hyperdrive those growth drivers."

Good morning to all of our shareholders and participants and welcome to the Ventas' 2009 year-end earnings call. My colleagues and I are pleased to be joining you today from our Louisville office.
Today, I'll provide a company overview, Ray Lewis will discuss our portfolio performance and investment outlook, and Rick Schweinhart will address financial results in detail. After that, we will be happy to answer your questions.
Ventas had an excellent and highly productive 2009, overcoming the severely negative conditions that challenged our economy and capital markets during the year. I'd like to quickly recap some of the Ventas highlights of 2009.
Normalized FFO per share was $2.68, exceeding our guidance of $2.62-$2.65 per share. Notably, 2009 normalized FFO per share compressed only 1% from 2008, despite 9% more shares outstanding, meaning that our entity level FFO grows considerably during the year.
Our cash flow from operations was $422 million, an increase of over 11% from 2008, the passed the data to the S&P 500. We were also named the top financial stock of the decade, providing over 2000% total returns to shareholders during the period. In this regard we led all bank, insurance companies, REITs and diversified financials, total shareholder returns for 2009 alone was 39%.
We purchased or repaid during the year $560 million of bonds and mortgage debts. In 2009 we received an upgrade from Fitch to BBB-, one of only five total upgrades in the REIT sector from all three rating agencies during the year.
We extended our revolver to 2012 and our revolver has total current capacity of $1 billion. We raised $312 million of equity and $341 million of debt financing, we also sold 14 assets and recognized the net gain of over $66 million.
We opened or acquired 6 high quality on-campus medical office buildings all affiliated with highly rated not-for-profit hospital systems. This expanded our MOB portfolio to $1.7 million square feet. We extended the lease term on 108 healthcare assets operated by Kindred, had escalated rent levels of $126 million per year, the lease term for those assets would have expired on April 30, 2010, but was extended until 2015.
We received a unanimous jury verdict in our favor of $102 million in our lawsuit against HCP for tortuous interference with our 2007 acquisition of Sunrise REIT.
And we ended the year with an excellent balance sheet and liquidity position. Net debt to EBIDTA was 4.1 time, at year end we held over $100 million in cash-on-hand and our revolver capacity approximated $1 billion.
In sum, we have managed the company in a prudent manner that protected the downside and preserved the upside for our stakeholders. We finished the year and the decade consistent with our objectives, as a cash flowing, productive enterprise delivering consistent, superior value for all our stakeholders. Well positioned to drive in a variety of economic capital markets and reimbursing environment and ready to execute our growth and diversification plans.
2010 has begun on a very positive trajectory as well, I'd like to highlight three items in particular. Credit ratings positive momentum, a 4.4% dividend increased and improved earnings guidance for 2010.
First ratings, because of our excellent credit statistic and our cash flowing assets Moody's recently upgraded the rating on Ventas's senior unsecured debt to investment grade, awarding us a Baa3 rating earlier this month. As most of you know we have worked long and hard to merit this improved rating, we appreciate Moody's confidence in us and we now have an investment grade rating from all three major rating agencies. It is a significant accomplishment for any real-estate company to continue ratings improvement in today's environment.
Second, our board of directors just approved a 4.4% increase in our past dividend to an annualized rate of $2.14 per share. We are pleased to share our stable growing cash-flows with our shareholders while we also retain significant cash flows for growth. This decision demonstrates our confidence in Ventas' future.
And last we have introduced 2010 normalized FFO guidance of $2.69 to $2.75 per share. In terms of total normalized FFO dollars we expect FFO to grow from $409 million in 2009 to a range of $422 million to $432 million in 2010. Our same store cash NOI growth should increase by 2%-3% for the whole portfolio in 2010.
While our 2010 guidance does not (inaudible) material acquisitions the healthcare real estate sector is large growing and highly fragmented, with REITs owning only about 6% of the total investable assets. The sector generally is not over-levered in contrast with many other real-estate sectors. This should permit private owners to sell assets and obtain a much desired liquidity. As a result we do expect to see increased transactional volume in 2010 compared to the last two years, only time will tell whether these trends will translate into significant investments for Ventas, and if so, the timing and size of those investments. But we do believe we will have the opportunity to reignite our growth and diversification efforts in 2010.
I'm going to turn the call over to Ray who is going to walk you through our portfolio performance and talk a little further about the current investment environment."

Our high quality cash flowing portfolio of healthcare and senior's housing assets performed well in 2009. For the year same store cash NOI growth on our triple net leased portfolio increased by 3.4%. Cash NOI in our hospitals grew 2.6%, se",1033,"Thanks, Debbie. Our high quality cash flowing portfolio of healthcare and senior's housing assets performed well in 2009. For the year same store cash NOI growth on our triple net leased portfolio increased by 3.4%. Cash NOI in our hospitals grew 2.6%, senior's housing grew 3.2% and skilled nursing delivered 4% growth. Our triple net lease assets continue to have excellent cash flow coverages across the spectrum of independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals.
75% of our NOI comes from our pool, multi-facility master leases with credit and structural support and contractual growth escalation. Cash flow coverage through the third quarter of 2009, the latest data available remains stable at 1.8 times, this strong metric has been consistent to 2007, occupancies in the triple net seniors housing portfolio increased 80 basis points in the third quarter versus the second as we saw evidence of occupancy beginning to rise in the third quarter.
The weighted average remaining lease term for our triple net lease assets is approximately seven years and only 1% of our total triple net portfolio is up for renewal before 2013. We expect same store cash growth in our triple net portfolio to exceed 2.5% in 2010. Overall, our pool, multi-facility master leases with credit tenants continue to provide strong and steady contractual cash flow growth to Ventas.
The company's operating portfolio, which consists of 79 high-end mansion style, assisted living communities, managed by Sunrise Senior Living and 26 medical office buildings accounts for 23% of our NOI, this portion of our portfolio exhibited improving fundamentals during the quarter and ended the year on a strong note. First, let me address our need-driven operating portfolio of senior living communities managed by Sunrise.
We derive 18% of our entity level NOI from this portfolio, there occupancy in our 78 stable communities continue the trend positively during the fourth quarter and increased 70 basis points sequentially to 88.8%. This continued the positive trend and occupancy that began in the third quarter, we are pleased with two consecutive quarterly increases in occupancy for the portfolio.
Notably fourth quarter occupancy and senior's housing tends to be weaker than the third and industry statistics released by Nick(ph) earlier this week confirm that. Though our Sunrise portfolio distinguished itself by enjoying a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter occupancy and in our Sunrise lease of asset in Toronto known as, Stealth, we continue to gain momentum.
All metrics were positive sequentially in the fourth quarter and Stealth continues to gain occupancy and NOI as the community trends towards stabilization. As a result of these trends our total fourth quarter property NOI for our 79 Sunrise communities was $33.3 million fairly consistent with the $33.4 million we earned in the third quarter. This was slightly higher than what we had projected, driven by improved occupancy and slightly increased average daily rate, which rose to $173 per day in the fourth quarter, off-set by the anticipated higher expenses in the fourth quarter attributable to the spending of repair and maintenance budgets and labor cost.
Finishing the year on such a positive note caused our full year Sunrise results to total $131 million dollars above the high-end of our 2009 expectations that range from $122-$129 million.
Looking forward to 2010 guidance in our Sunrise portfolio, our total NOI projection is $128 - $138 million. The mid-point of this range $133 million represents an NOI increase of 1.5% over 2009. Our projections assume that occupancies will rise slightly ADR will increase about 1.5% and margin may experience some compression due to inflation and expense increases.
So our mid-point NOI expectation assumes that positive rate and occupancy trends continue into 2010. This should result in positive NOI growth for the portfolio absents (inaudible) double every session or another shock to the financial system. Over time very favorable supply demand fundamentals should drive growth in our Sunrise portfolio. With the over-85 population being the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population and virtually no new assisted living supply coming online in 2010 or 2011 the conditions are right for excellent performance as the economy improves.
Our medical office building portfolio, which now totals over 1.7 million square feet and represents 5% of our NOI also performed well this quarter substantially all of our 26 MOBs are on the campus of major hospital systems. In our 21 stabilized assets occupancy was a strong 94.7% in the fourth quarter. Before occupancy and our same store stabilized portfolio of 18 MOBs increased sequentially by 50 basis points to 94.4% and generated NOI of $4.8 million and increased of 2% compared to Q3 2009.
We also continue to have strong results in our MOB lease-up portfolio. We have added three development assets to this pool since the fourth quarter of 2008 all of which were on-time, on-budget substantially preleased and generating positive NOI to Ventas. NOI for the four lease-up assets we own in both the third and the fourth quarters of 2009 increased by 20%.
Leasing prospects for this portion of the portfolio are good, including 54,000 square feet of leases signed but not yet in occupancy and a strong forward pipeline of potential tenants. When tenants who have already signed leases have moved in, the occupancy on our five lease-up assets should rise from 74%-87%.
In the fourth quarter we began investing again but purchasing four Class A, on-campus medical office buildings valued at $77.7 million. The MOB acquisitions should provide Ventas with unlevered yield succeeding 8%.
In sum, our growing MOB portfolio provided stable and increasing NOI to Ventas in 2009. As you saw with our MOB acquisition activity in December we're beginning to put capital to work to continue to grow and diversify the company. Moreover we are seeing an increase in flow of opportunities across all asset classes in the healthcare and senior housing spectrum. And although we are shifting to a more offensive stance on acquisition, we remained disciplined in our investment approach and continue our practice of targeting high quality, accreted investments with excellent operators that can create long-term value for shareholders.
With that I'll turn the call over to Rick Schweinhart to discuss our financial results."

The (inaudible) in April of 2012 has increased from $590 million to $800 million. At December 31, our cash balance was $107 million and we have only $8.5 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility, currently $992 million of undrawn availability and cash-on-hand of approximately $155 million. Our credit stands for being very good with net debt to pro forma EBIDTA at 4.1 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 3.2 times we closed 2009 with debt to enterprise value of 28%.
Early 2009 we repaid our purchase $411 million of our senior notes and reduced our mortgage balances by $148.7 million, which $25 million of normal periodic principal amortization. We have $175 million in total debt maturities in 2010, excluding normal periodic principal amortization payments, most of which is mortgaged debt. Our cash-flows from operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased 11% to $422 million, from $380 million from last year.
Turning to (inaudible) for the quarter, fourth quarter normalized FFO was $104.8 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Normalized FFO excludes merger related expenses and (inaudible) of approximately $1.6 million. Fourth quarter normalized FFO increased from third quarter to primarily NOI increases in our MOB portfolio due to acquisitions and lower D&A.
Interest expense increased to $44.6 million from $43.6 million in the third quarter, primarily as a result of additional interest expense from our GSE mortgage financing of $173 million at 6.3%, which closed in the second and third quarter. D&A was $8.2 million down $1.4 million from the $9.7million in the third quarter, primarily as a result of lower non-cash stock based compensation.
Weighted average shares outstanding remained fairly plaid at $156.7 million in the fourth quarter, versus $156.5 million in the third. Fourth quarter FAD per diluted share was $0.62 compared to $0.63 in the third quarter as a result of higher routine capital expenditures in the fourth quarter, down when we compare the fourth quarter 2009 normalized FFO per diluted share to the fourth quarter of 2008.
Normalized FFO grew 11.5% to $104.8 million from $94 million from last year and the fourth quarter FFO per diluted share was $0.67 compared to $0.66 last year. Triple-net leased revenues grew to $117 million from $114.4 million, primarily due to contractual escalations. It is important to note that (inaudible) NOI increased 3% to $33.3 million this quarter from $32.2 million from last year. Also year-over-year our medical office building NOI grew to $6.7 million from $5.3 million, primarily due to acquisitions.
Interest expense decreased to $44.6 million from $50.6 million last year. Principally due to debt repayments and senior note purchases. Our weighted average cost of debt is about 6.6%.
G&A was $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, down $2.9 million from the $11.2 million in 2008, primarily as a result of low professional fees. Weighted average shares outstanding increased 9.5% for the fourth quarter of 2009, versus the comparable 2008 period to $156.7 million from $143 million. The share count increased due to our April 2009 equity offer.
Finally, left to compare the year ended December 31, 2009 to 2008. Normalized FFO grew 8% to $409 million from $379.5 million last year and FFO per diluted share was $2.68 compared to $2.71 last year. Triple-net lease revenues grew 2.5% to $465.2 million from $453.7 million primarily due to contractual escalations.
Internalized NOI decreased to $131 million from $138.8 million last year, which was better than forecast due to rising occupancies in the portfolio. (inaudible) off-set by higher expenses. Last year's results benefited from about $4 million in expense credits that didn't reoccur in 2009. On a reoccurring basis NOI's down 3% in the portfolio year-over-year. Year-over-year our medical office building NOI grew to $23.2 million from $17.3 million due primarily to acquisitions and lease-up activity.
Interest expense decreased approximately 13% to $178.5 million from $204.5 million last year, primarily due to lower debt value. G&A decreased from 4.5% to $38.8 million in 2009, from the $40.7 million in 2008. G&A as a percentage of total revenues fell to 4.1% from 4.4%. Weighted average shares outstanding increased 9.2% in 2009 due to equity issuances.
And finally, guidance; as Debbie mentioned we are initiating 2010 normalized FFO fully diluted share guidance at $2.69-$2.75, without NOI from some of those (inaudible) operations expected to be between $128-138 million. The mid-point of our initial 2010 guidance is $2.72, which represents 1.5% of FFO per share growth in 2010.
There is an $0.08-$0.09 dilution in 2010 from our 2009 debt and equity offerings in asset sales, which were completed in 2009 to strengthen our balance sheet and to slightly higher 2010 G&A. This should be more than off-set by positive, strong increases in FFO from contractual escalations from our triple-net portfolio. The full-year impact 2009 investments increased that a lot from our centralized managed communities and in a creative use of cash-on-hand during 2010.
Our key assumptions for our guidance (inaudible) that total summarized NOI from our 79 assets bring us from $128million to $138 million. G&A expenses range between $39 million and $41 million and we invest our cash-on-hand. But our guidance does not include other material acquisition or vesture activity, deal cause, capital transaction or litigation expenses or proceeds.

I mean, one is for example we have assumed we invest our cash on hand and clearly that will be accretive. Just proportionally so because it earns virtually nothing as it sits on our balance sheet, so the whole acquisitions department is pretty much lining up to get their deal for that $100 million so that they can get all that good accretion. So obviously I mean that's real earnings growth but it is somewhat artificial when you take a longer term view and you step back and - you know putting all joking aside, when we look at acquisitions we're looking at our long term cost to capital which we believe is continuing to decrease. We do have an attractive balance sheet and liquidity position, and we have a lot of liquidity available to make acquisitions, and we think because of our investment grade rating that we should be able to continue to drive down our cost to capital. Our long term cost to capital. Which has been our goal because that's really how you make money over the long term and we believe we need to invest over that long term cost to capital to really make money and drive value for the franchise. So that's what we've done over time and that's how we think about it."

We always felt that our portfolio is well positioned, the assets that we were targeting we well positioned to play into those incremental benefits, but I think whether or not health care reform comes, MOBs, for instance, are still very well positioned. They're the first place where the aging baby boom demographic touches the health care system and they're turning 65 in this year and next year.
So that dynamic hasn't changed. The funding of that hasn't changed so I think that the things that we liked about medical office buildings remain intact.
