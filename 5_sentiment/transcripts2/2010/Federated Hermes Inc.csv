I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials. Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets",1201,"Thank you, Ray, and Good morning. I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials. Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets decreased by about $5 billion or 2% from the prior quarter. Money market funds decreased about $6 billion and were partially offset by an increase in cash separate account assets. We have seen significant asset movements in our money funds over the last several weeks. We saw about $5 billion of inflows during the last week or so of December, followed by outflows during January to date of approximately $22 billion. These outflows were concentrated in the middle of the month, a period where we generally see cash movement related to tax payments and other uses of cash. During the week ending January 15, outflows totaled about $15 billion. Money fund assets have been essentially flat since mid-month. Now in addition to regular uses of cash, the outflows included the withdrawal of assets that came in late in the year, which we expected. We also had some client-specific actions that were planned for this period. In addition, market condition, including rates and yields, regulatory uncertainty and competition from our bank products were factors. Importantly, our client base remains intact.Low interest rates continue to impact yields and fee waivers for money funds in Q4. And the waiver impact is likely to increase in Q1 as rates fell further in January. However, we believe that we will begin to see some upward movement in rates over the next couple of months, initially within the current zero to 25 basis point Fed funds target range. As such, we believe that we will begin to see less impact from money fund fee waivers in the second quarter. Tom will provide more specific information in his remarks.Our Cash Management business continues to be very well-positioned. We expect this business to continue to grow overtime with higher highs and higher lows during particular cycles. Looking at this most recent cycle, our money funds grew by about $173 billion in '07 and '08 combined. In '09, and here so far in '10, we have seen about $68 billion leave or money funds. Now the SEC's adoption of new money market rules was a welcome development. We believe that the changes announced will strengthen the regulatory framework that money funds operate within. And do what all of the regulators and governmental officials have said is their goal, enhance the resiliency of money funds.It was clear to us that the SEC carefully considered the comments made by Federated and others in arriving at these changes. We anticipate that these changes will not materially alter the way we manage our funds or even the yields of our products as we have generally applied these standards already. We are encouraged by the process and expect that any future changes follow the path of preserving the key characteristics of money funds that enable those products to play a vital role in our capital markets.Now beyond the cash, we have a broad array of solid products in both bonds and equities. Our sales growth in '09 of 64% were combined bond and equity mutual fund gross sales, was a result of a combination of solid performance and successful product distribution. We gained market share in '09 of gross sales for bond funds and for equity funds utilizing the industry's most recent data. Now looking more specifically at equity assets, they increased slightly during Q4 to just under $30 billion at year end.Equity flows were positive. We continue to have success with alternative strategy mutual funds, with good results in particular, from the Prudent Bear fund. The Strategic Value dividend-oriented fund continues to solid flows as does the Kaufmann Small Cap Fund. Bond funds sales continue to dominate industry results in the fourth quarter. Federated's fixed income products again showed strong sales results, gaining share against strong industry flows.The composition of our fourth quarter bond fund flows improved compared to the third quarter. Though gross bond fund sales decreased from the prior quarter. The drop was due mainly to lower sales of Ultrashort products. Gross sales of all other bond fund products increased 6% and net sales of these products were up 25%.Ultrashorts were about 40% of the fourth quarter gross bond fund sales and 24% of net sales. Comparatively, in the third quarter, Ultrashorts were 48% of gross sales and 58% of net.Total net bond fund sales were strong at $1.3 billion for the quarter and reached $6.8 billion for the entire '09 season, more than 4x higher than '08 sales. For the fourth quarter, all categories of bond funds showed net inflows.As announced on Wednesday, we launched a new closed-end bond fund that raised $178 million in a differentiated strategy, utilizing Treasury instruments. We are pleased to add another closed-end fund and expect to be active in this area going forward. We also added $241 million in fixed income separate account net flows in the fourth quarter. And believe that our consistent performance over the full cycle has positioned us for further growth in this area.So far in January, bond fund flows remain solidly positive while equity fund flows are modestly negative. As always, we caution about drawing conclusions from limited data. Turning to investment performance and looking at the year end Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds, 22% of rated assets, are in the first or second quartile over the last year: 62%, three years; 81%, five years; 79%, 10 years. For bond fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are: 28% for one year; 68%, three years, 76% for five years; and 80% for 10 years.The decrease in one-year equity assets in the top quartiles from prior periods was largely due to the defensive positioning of certain funds relative to the large market upswing in 2009. Within fixed income the decrease in one-year Lipper rankings reflects in large part the success we had in '08 with the high quality of our products, returns in '09, favored lower quality products. Our three and five-year records are strong. And we are above the benchmarks in most of our taxable income strategies on a one, three, and five-year basis.As of January 27, our managed assets were approximately $370 billion, including $294 billion in money markets, $29 billion in equities, $47 billion in fixed income, which includes our liquidation portfolios. Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $260 billion. Now so far in January, our money fund assets have ranged between $259 billion and $281 billion and are averaging about $268 billion.Regarding acquisitions, with the integration of Clover Capital and Prudent Bear largely completed during '09, we are not looking for acquisitions targeted to specific investment expertise though this type of deal always remains a possibility. We continue to evaluate multiple acquisition opportunities to add assets and clients, including money market consolidation deals. We're actively seeking acquisitions or partnerships outside of the United States as a part of developing our strategy to expand global distribution. As always, we really can't predict the probability or timing of any potential deal. Tom?"

Federated's total revenues decreased by about $48 million or 4% in 2009 due largely to the impact from money fund yield waivers. These waivers reduced revenues by about $121 million in 2009 compared to the $4 million reduction in 2008. R",667,"Thank you, Chris. Federated's total revenues decreased by about $48 million or 4% in 2009 due largely to the impact from money fund yield waivers. These waivers reduced revenues by about $121 million in 2009 compared to the $4 million reduction in 2008. Revenue growth, excluding the impact of waivers was due to our diversified business mix as higher money market and fixed-income revenue partially was offset by lower equity revenue.The Q4 revenue impact of money fund waivers to keep yields positive or zero was $57.5 million, largely offset by $42.6 million in related lower marketing and distribution expenses. The impact to operating income from these waivers was $14.9 million compared to $8.6 million in Q3. For Q1, volatility and the rates for overnight repo complicates waiver calculation. After averaging about 10 basis points for Q4, Treasury-backed overnight repo rates were literally zero for the first couple of days in the first quarter and averaged just about five basis points through January 15. Since then, these rates have been between 10 and 14 basis points. We believe that these rates will move up a bit more over the rest of Q1. In this rate scenario and with recent asset levels and mix, the operating income impact in Q1 from these waivers would be approximately $17.5 million.Lower rates on key builds and prime paper compare to Q4 also impacted Q1 potential waiver, impact calculations as older paper continues to reset at lower rates. Looking at the rest of the year, we expect rates to move into the upper half of the current zero to 25 basis point Fed funds target range over the next several months. And expect the Fed to begin increasing the target rate during the latter part of Q3.Under this scenario, we expect money fund, yield waivers, to decrease in each the second, third and fourth quarter of the year. As we have consistently emphasized, with a wide range of outcomes, including higher impact for these waivers as possible. Factors that impact the waivers include yield levels available in the market, changes in assets within the funds, actions by the Fed, Treasury, the SEC and other governmental entities, changes in the expenses of the funds and our willingness to continue to waive.  Terms and sensitivity, we estimate that a 10 basis point increase in yields would reduce the waiver impact by about 1/3 while a 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3.Turning to operating expenses. 2009 levels decreased 2% from 2008 due largely to lower marketing and distribution expenses related to money market fund yield waivers. We were successful in managing expenses in 2009 and exceeded our targeted range of savings. When comparing '09 and '08, keep in mind that the Clover and Prudent Bear acquisitions closed in December of '08, so very little expense was booked during 2008. For Q1, remember that the launch of our new closed-end fund will impact earnings. We anticipate approximately $2 million to $2.5 million pretax or $0.01 to $0.02 EPS impact from the deal related expenses in Q1. From a revenue standpoint, we expect our net management fee realization rate to be in the mid-40s.We announced a special dividend of $1.26 in addition to the $0.24 regular quarterly dividend. We look at this special dividend as a way to a reward shareholders for the success of the company in navigating difficult conditions in 2009. For Q1, a special dividend will reduce EPS by approximately $0.04 per share due to the impact of the two class method required for calculating EPS.On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments were $122 million at the end of the year and recourse debt was $126 million. We also repurchased 50,000 shares in Q4 and 829,000 shares during 2009. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and expect to continue to use cash and loan facilities to fund acquisitions, dividends,  share repurchases, capital expenditures and debt repayments. We would now like to open the call for your questions."

No matter how often someone talks about doing it, you have to face the reality of the importance of these funds in the capital markets in terms of the securities that are owned by a $3.3 trillion industry. And you also have to acknowledge the fact that about $325 trillion has gone through money funds since the SEC's successful initiation of Rule 2A7. So this is a systemic liquidity enhancement. And you also have to note that there's been, over the last say 24 years, about $450 billion paid to investors more than they would have gotten in the MMDAs. So yes, you can consider all of these things and that's fine. But we don't place much weight on the idea that they are going to change the NAVs.

We do have a lot of confidence that, that will not happen despite protestations and commentaries by others in the marketplace. And part of the reasons for that, that you have to ask yourself, is this business supportable by a 10% or real bank capital on it? Go ask JPMorgan what their situation would be with $400 billion in money market funds is to how that business would function if they put real bank capital requirements on them. And the need for it is a little odd when you consider that the money funds don't do the leverage thing and they surely don't fail the way our banks fail. Even in the reserve situation, they got $0.99 at the end, that wasn't a pleasant result because of the delay. But don't forget that in the Putnam situation, it was all able to be resolved within the context of other money funds and some cooperation from various regulators. So when Mary Schapiro is summarizing the very things that she is looking at, capital wasn't one of the ones that she listed during her call earlier this week. So it's again, one of those things that gets mentioned out in the marketplace a lot, you can have a lot of fun with it, but we don't think that it's going to come about. Now footnote, Mary Schapiro did mention of course, ""The private liquidity facility to provide liquidity to money market funds in times of stress."" That's a quote. And so there may be some modest capital requirements and however that ends up being structured, but that's all that I can say about that so-called liquidity bank."

Also I think if you look at yesterday or maybe it was the day before news items, the Treasury came out that and basically said, they are not at all happy with this potential fee, especially in the context of the repo market. And we're looking to find carve outs in the proposal to remove repo from that particular fee. And they have a very vested interest in doing exactly that given the amount of funding that occurs in the repo market with Treasury collateral. So our thought process is at this point in time, that if it did come to fruition, obviously it reduces the amount of paper that's available in the marketplace for certainly prime funds to buy and potentially for government funds to buy also in the context of the repo side of the equation. It would mitigate -- it would narrow the differentiation between the two types of products, governments and primes. But in an overall response at this point from the market, as well as from other regulators in the marketplace, we don't really think it's going to hold up in the form that was initially previewed to the marketplace."

Secondly, with the FOMC statement on Wednesday, although they did not indicate an end to their purchasing program for their government agency and government agency mortgage backed mandate onto the Fed's balance sheet. They in fact said they are reviewing not going to their maximum levels that they had announced previously. So our thought is that they are going to stop the purchasing of those securities, number one out of the marketplace. And as soon as they do that, begin very shortly after that, the reverse repo process where they take that collateral that's sitting on their balance sheet and starts to reverse it back into the marketplace. So that funds again have usage of it and again increasing supply, bringing us back into that marketplace where rates even though that you're still in that zero to 0.25 range end up on an overnight basis up near the 20 to 25 basis point range where they were for most of 2009.

The proposal that the SEC put out was that the industry has to be capable of actually computing to the third decimal place. And this is obviously to make a situation like reserve work a lot better if you can't do a Putnam situation which basically was baked in to the rules. That the Putnam situation is now okay with the rules as written. So the fact that you have the capability of moving into a third decimal point for times when the NAV is cracked, does not mean that they do not allow you to continue to run the dollar NAV when that's appropriate. And in fact, part of the reasoning that the SEC gave for the second part of your question which is the shadow work. To date, money funds have been filing on a twice-a-year-basis their shadow price. And it's public in a certain way but you had to know how to work it out in order to figure it out. So the new requirement of a 60-day delay on publishing it monthly. The SEC said the purpose of that is to get the people familiar with the fact that these funds are not guaranteed, and that they are run at a dollar under 2a-7 and amortized cost and that they are investment products. And that was part of the learning experience or teaching experience that the SEC wanted to do and the reason it's a 60-day delay is they don't want people playing games with it. And so this was their way to teach what they thought was important to teach. So teaching people that to me does not mean that they are going to go to a variable NAV, which is not going to enhance the efficacy or strength of money funds."

They did so in a format that was not easily transferred into any kind of comparative mechanism from their perspective. By collecting monthly data for every fund going forward, what I think that allows them to do is build their own database of NAVs across fund type, across fund families, across a certain time periods in relation to changes in interest rates and changes in market condition. And in their own mind, build a database that verifies that the $1 NAV is in fact justified because of the course of the 35 years of the industry essentially there have only been one or two institutions on one or two occasions where that $1 NAV on a mark-to-market basis has been compromised. So I think this will help them in their argument against why a fluctuating NAV in fact is not needed going forward."

From an illiquid security perspective, across the board we have about 1% in illiquid securities at this point. So the SEC going from 10% to 5%  is something that we actually advocated and thought it made a lot of sense especially in the context of what their original proposal was, which was to cut it out completely. Importantly, although 1% doesn't sound like very much. Historically, there have been times when that number has been 4% or 5%. And generally speaking, what we used from an argument perspective against why it's should not be eliminated is that oftentimes, not oftentimes but occasionally, what comes to the market initially as an illiquid private placement type of security often times then grows into something that becomes very liquid and very much accepted in the context of the overall market. A couple of just an examples of those on the taxable side of the equation would be asset-backed commercial paper, and on the tax free side of the marketplace will be tender option bonds. So that was the argument that was used. And although 1% doesn't sound like very much now, we didn't want to completely take it away as something that might find the next part of the marketplace that eventually turns from an illiquid security into something that's very well accepted. For the second part of the question with regard to Tier 2, we currently only have four funds that have the ability to use Tier 2. Most of our funds are first tier funds as such -- they're restricted by their prospectus in that regard. But for the second tier funds that we manage, generally speaking, we hold them at 4.5% to 5%, so near the limit as it existed two days ago. We will go forward in those same funds, obviously with the reduction that takes us down to 3% on an overall basis in second-tier holdings in those products. And that will be done just by the natural course of maturities as most of the second-tier paper that we buy within the product is one month and under type of maturities. So that's very easily achieved to go from 5% down to 3%. But our expectation is that as long as that market place and the issuers that we follow within that sector offer good relative value in the marketplace, we will continue to maximize our allowances in those funds that can use it and be at very close to that 3% threshold."

I will start with a brief review of Federated’s recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials. Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets decreased by $41 billion or 13% from the prior quarter.  The decrease came from money market funds as cash separate account assets increased slightly.
We noted in our January call that money fund assets were down about $22 billion.  Assets were relatively stable in February before decreasing in March and we have seen the expected tax related outflows here in April.
Unprecedented market conditions and short-term interest rates have led to unprecedented changes in client money fund balances over the last three years.  In this period our clients added about $173 billion to their money fund balances in '07 and '08.
In '09 and through mid April of '10 we've seen about $100 billion leave our money funds.  Money fund withdrawals have included certain assets that came in late in '09 with an intended short stay, draws outs of cash by corporations beginning to increase investment spending and increased use of certain high-yielding investments including direct market investments and bank deposit products by some investors who are more yield sensitive.
Throughout this period, including in 2010, our client relationships have remained strong, stable and, in fact, growing.  Our clients have appreciated the strength and stability of our products and our willingness to keep funds open during periods when other providers closed funds, even as we waived most or, in some cases, all of our advisory fees in some of the funds.
We are confident that looking beyond the unprecedented market and interest rate environment of recent years our cash management business continues to be very well positioned.  We expect this business to continue to grow over time with higher highs and higher lows during particular cycles.
Although low rates continue to impact yields and fee waivers for money funds in Q1, we believe that we saw the high water mark for these waivers in January and February.  As we expected, there was some upward movement in certain rates within the current zero to 25 basis point Fed funds target range in March.
We believe that we will see less impact from money fund fee waivers beginning in the second quarter and continuing over the rest of the year.  Tom will provide some more specific comments in his remarks.  Importantly, our money market funds share has remained over 8% during the quarter.
Beyond cash we have a broad array of solid products in both bonds and equities.  In Q1 we saw gross mutual fund tails increase to over $2 billion per month for combined equity and bond funds.  This is an increase of about 7.5% from the average in 2009 and builds on the 64% growth we saw in the 2009 versus 2008 timeframe.  We gained market share in 2009 on the gross sales for bond funds and for equity funds as well.
Now, looking more specifically at equities, assets increased slightly during the first quarter to just over $30 billion.  Net inflows were negative in January and March and positive in February.  For the first two weeks of April these flows are negative.
For the full quarter we saw positive flows in the Intercontinental Fund and in the alternative space with the Prudent Bear Fund.  The Strategic Value dividend [REN] fund continues to show solid flows and net flows were also positive in the [Caughman] Large Cap Fund, the Clover Smaller Value Fund and Federated Mid-Cap Growth Strategies Fund.
Looking at our equity product lineup, we have solid products in a variety of areas that should be well positioned to capture flows including on the domestic side Clover Value and Small Clover Value, [Caughman] Products, Prudent Bear and our group of value and income products.  The Intercontinental and International Leaders Funds are solid performers among our international products.
Within the equity separate account outflows were largely due to net redemption in our SMA products.  Now looking at bonds, our sales continue to be strong in the first quarter with gross sales of more than $4.5 billion and net sales of $1.2 billion.
We continue to see improvement in the composition of these sales.  For the first quarter all categories of domestic bond funds showed net inflows.  The percentage of gross sales in ultra short products has decreased from about 50% in mid '09 to just under 30% here in the first quarter.
The percentage of net sales in these funds has dropped from around 60% to 14% in the same timeframe.  Bond fund flows remain positive in the first two weeks of April.  In fixed income separate accounts we won a handful of mandates in the first quarter that we expect to fund for over $1.5 billion over the next couple of quarters.
We expect to continue to see significant wins in this area given our solid performance over the cycle.  We had approximately $350 million in new financing of institutional fixed income separate accounts in Q1 partially offset by the closing of a $240 million account from a client who made a mandate change no related to investment performance.
About half of the new institutional assets were sources outside the United States and we expect additional success in this area as we've improved our profile with certain large mandate wins.
Turning to fund investment performance and looking at the quarter-end Lipper rankings for federated equity funds, 20% of rates assets are in the first or second quartile over the last year, 32% over three years, 76% over five years and 78% over 10.  With the bond fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 25% for one year, 65% three years, 74% for five years and 83% for 10 years.
Interestingly, 99% of international equity assets are in the top two quartiles for the first year, one year, 71% for three years, 76% for five years and 71% for 10 years.
As of April 21st our managed assets were approximately $337 billion, including $260 billion in money markets, $30 billion in equities and $47 billion in fixed income which includes liquidation portfolios.  Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $229 billion.
So far in April, our money funds assets have ranged between $239 billion and $228 billion and have averaged about $235 billion.
Regarding acquisition, we continue to conduct an active search for an acquisition or partnership to further advance our business outside the US as an important component of our strategy to expand global distribution and footprint.
We remain active in looking for potential consolidation deals including in the money market business.  As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deals.  Tom?

The revenue decrease in Q1 compared to the prior quarter was due largely to the impact from money fund yield waivers and lower money market assets as detailed in the press release.  With lower distribution expense due to the money fund",620,"Thank you, Chris.  The revenue decrease in Q1 compared to the prior quarter was due largely to the impact from money fund yield waivers and lower money market assets as detailed in the press release.  With lower distribution expense due to the money fund waivers, the operating income impact of these waivers was $17.8 million.
As Chris mentioned, we have started to see some improvement in certain short-term rates and this is beginning to positively impact waivers.  For Q2 we think that based on current market conditions and our expectations for rates, the operating income impact from these waivers will decrease to around $15.5 million.
While we believe that the impact will continue to decrease thereafter we caution that a wide range of outcomes is possible.  Factors that impact these waivers include yield levels, available on the market, changes in assets within the funds, actions by the Fed, Treasury, the SEC and other governmental entities, changes in the expenses of the funds and our willingness to continue the waivers.
In terms of sensitivity, we continue to estimate that a 10 basis point increase in fund gross yields would reduce the waiver impact by about one-third while a 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about two-thirds.
Looking at our assets weighted average money fund gross yields from mid-January to mid-April, overall gross yields are only up about one basis point as higher Treasury fund yields were partially offset by lower government agency fund yields.  Prime has remained about the same.
Fewer days in Q1 also impacted revenues by $6.8 billion compared to Q4, partially offset by $1.6 million in related lower distribution expense.
Turning to expenses, compensation expense increased from the prior quarter due mainly to seasonality of payroll taxes and 401K matching contributions.  Q1 also included a true up of bonus expense, therefore, we would expect that about $65.5 million would be a good estimate for Q2 comp run rates.
Looking at distribution expense, yield waiver, lower money fund assets and fewer days in the first quarter drove the variance from the prior quarter.
The successful launch of the Federated Enhanced Treasury Closed End Fund in January added approximately $850,000 in net operating expenses in Q1.  The expense was near the low end of the range due to contributions from other Geo parties.  The operating rate was $180 million in new assets and we are looking for additional opportunities in the closed fund space.
As we discussed last quarter, the dividends paid in January reduced reported EPS by approximately $0.04 per share due to the impact of the two-class method required for calculating EPS.
On the balance sheet we recently announced the closing of an amended and restated term loan facility effective April 9th.  The $425 million structure is fully drawn.  Approximately $186 million of the proceeds were used to retire existing debt.  The balance of the loan is $236 million and our $200 million revolving credit facilities are available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions and related contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new products, [seeding] and other investments.
We entered into an interest rate swap to produce a fixed interest rate of 4.396% for the five-year term.  We felt that the opportunity to extend the term and the size of our debt funding at this rate was attractive and positions us to be opportunistic as we actively seek an acquisition or partnership to expand our international business.
The deal was very well received in the bank market and was oversubscribed with 22 banks participating.  In addition to the $1.50 dividend paid in January, we repurchased 111,000 shares during the quarter and that concludes our presentation.
We would now like to open up the call for questions.

The reason they don0't work is because the money market fund is so simple and so transparent that it will not allow any of those kinds of creative changes [to do] what the product is.  The people want daily liquidity at par.
So whatever the inflation view, whatever the Fed view, the structure of the money fund is its very strength.  We just haven't been able to figure out ways to have that change to enable ourselves to collect a fee or I assure you we would have been working on those.

We're currently, I think, pleased by the rise that we've seen in the first quarter and into the second quarter in short-term interest rates, which doesn't reflect necessarily an expectation of near-term monetary policy changes from the Fed but really is more a reflection of the beginning of the Fed's exit strategy in managing the excess reserves it has on its balance sheet.
So we would expect as we go forward in the second quarter that will continue to trade with repo rates and the Fed funds rate in the 20 basis point area, which is a pretty good distance from the close to zero that we saw in the beginning of this year.
As we move forward towards the second half of the year we expect that the Fed should begin to employ some of the tools that it has begun to develop for use in its exit strategy.  We would look for monetary policy tightening from the Fed probably well into the latter part of the year, possibly into the fourth quarter.

We cannot repeat this enough that late March, April people actually do pay taxes and build up money for that purpose.
Generally speaking, however, the real question that people could be asking about money funds is how come there's still almost $3 trillion in money funds at all?  The real answer to that is because these customers want daily liquidity a part of cash management service.  So, yes, there will be movement as the interest rates stay low.
People at various times click off and move into some other instrument.  But the vast majority stay because it is an integrated cash management system and has as much, if not more of an operational overlay than an investment overlay.
So now the question is what about these people leaving right now?  Again, I go back to taxes, people who came in the year-end for short term, regular cash management uses and then other things in the marketplace.

So that cleared the deck of putting out what amounts to best practices that we and others got together to put out and help the SEC come up with to A7.
So I think A7 - an excellent job on that and that took a lot of pressure off of the immediacy of enhancing the resiliency of money funds.  The next thing is going to be the president's working group report.
If you know when it's going to come out then I'd appreciate knowing because we don't have any indication as to when that will happen.  We understand that they will continue to mention in there that they want to study the idea of variable net asset value on money funds, which, of course, is debt for money funds, which, of course, is not good and we don't think will happen.
So the next round of money market fund regulation, I think, is pretty far off.  At least there's no movement.  There's no current SEC rule proposal that's out there.  They asked a lot of questions the last time so that they could begin to solicit the industry's views on subjects that maybe weren't covered in that first round of rules but have not given an indication other than it will be post-president's working group as to when they would come up with something.
So it's very, very difficult for us to put a time on it.  We are thankful and appreciative that the SEC did do the first round of [2A7] so that at least in this industry we can say the first and important movements on enhancing the resiliency of money funds have been accomplished.

The reason I comment on mismatch is because we think and our clients think that this business is about confidence and not about capital because money market funds are, in fact, investment products and that's just the essence of what they are.
So we have not had commentary from clients on this subject.  It is a known discussion but I think people recognize that what they first want is the confidence of the product and the management of the product because relying on something to happy after something else happens is really not what they want.  They're interested in daily liquidity at par.  So we just haven't had that kind of push back from the clients.

Second question or another question, you look back at your capital management big picture perspective in the last couple of quarters, in the last quarter you had the special dividend and it looks like you pawned it out of operations.  I guess the yield on that portfolio probably would have been close to zero.
Then you roll forward and you've built up the debt at about a 5% borrowing cost.  Can you sort of step back a little bit and help explain just the logic flow around the capital management and how paying a dividend with zero borrowing now, maybe doing a deal with 5% borrowing is in the best use of the shareholder interest?

I think the dividend which we did was a view of shareholders and looking at the stock price and how are we going to reward shareholders and not being satisfied with the level of our stock price, not thinking that it reflected the earnings power and growth into the future of the company.
So how are we going to reward shareholders?  We decided to do that through a special dividend.  Now you come back and say, ""Now what about raising capital and why getting $425 million into the company and the opportunity to do things?""
Number one, as I said before, we are attracted to the rate, locking in the five-year program was what we wanted.  In the past the bank group did not really - because of the market situation - been really willing to do that.  They were now willing to do that.  So we signed up as you see.
In terms of taking that money and investing it and using it, we will continue to try to do that and our number one criteria we always talk about is the acquisitions and when we'll see share buybacks and, of course, we declared a $0.24 dividend, so we see continuing that too.

Let me - just to give you a summary of some of the things that have been done that have accounted for the rather impressive increase in gross sales, especially on the equity side and that has been the addition in only the fourth quarter of '08 of Prudent Bear and Clover.
It has been the revamping internally of the focus of the compensation program on the sales force where that compensation program has been restructured to more lean on getting products on platforms and equalizing the benefits of the compensation program, whatever products happen to be sold.  That's only now being realized in the marketplace this year.
So we've looked at the comp and the structure.  We're pretty happy with the total number of wholesalers, 186.  You can go plus or minus a few but we're not looking for that.  Now if you start talking about advertising or image and things, we consider that often.
But it just strikes us that for our wholesaling force we're better off spending the money on rifle shots with our intermediaries than trying to spend the $1 million a month on making waves in the marketplace through the advertising.
So you're right that it is very competitive but it is a source of positive to us that we have been able to increase the equity sales and knowing that we have these products that we think can do a pretty good job that we think we can get our gross sales and net sales of equity back positive and in numbers like what we had almost a decade ago.

The thing about this business is almost no matter what you do since the single most important right in the investment company act is the right to redeem.  It's very, very, very hard to change that.
Now, our historic pattern has been higher than industry average and that is correct.  Part of that is because of certain funds that have suffered redemptions recently, namely the [MVT] gang and the larger [Caughman] Fund and some redemptions that have occurred in the capital appreciation fund, all of which, you look at and you say, ""CapApp has been turned around in terms of the performance and the [Caughman] boys have been here before.

It was maybe three weeks or so ago that the ICI and the person of [Paul Stevens] in coordination with those that we're trying to work with, namely the governmental entities, went public with the idea of what this liquidity bank would or could do in broad terms.
So now this is progress because now it is out and being discussed.  Basically the discussion is that it would be capitalized by a combination of monies from the investment advisors who run commercial paper funds and investments by those commercial paper funds themselves in a liquidity bank that would be either a special purpose trust company or a special bank that would invest in very, very high-grade US government securities and provide the liquidity facility and at the end of the day it would have the availability of the Fed window with its intended discounts/premiums if it needed to be utilized.
This is all within the context of the requirements of [2A7] to have 10% of your money in daily available and 30% on a weekly basis.  So this is something that if needed would come in after those features.  So that's all I know about it right now.
I can't give you an update as to where the regulators are on it but it seems to us to be an excellent idea that captures a lot of the flavor of what people are looking for and it's one that the industry has done a lot of work on and I think shows a lot of good faith and accurate substantive understanding of what could address issues that people are concerned about.

But once again, I come back to the fact that when you have people calling you and telling you to leave funds open that are paying zero yield because it's an integral part of their cash management system the idea that those clients are going to move because of a yield variance is really hard to see.
So we can't tell you exactly what the top hat of that chart or that bar is going to look like bu there is certainly a large component of it that makes up the vast majority of our client base that continue to look at it as a cash management service.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets",1130,"Thank you, Ray, and good morning. I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.
Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets decreased by $41 billion or 13% from the prior quarter. The decrease came from money market funds, as cash separate account assets increased slightly. We noted in our January call that money fund assets were down about $22 billion. Assets were relatively stable in February before decreasing in March. And we have seen the expected tax related outflows here in April.
Unprecedented market conditions and short-term interest rates have led to unprecedented changes in client money fund balances over the last three years. In this period, our clients added about $173 billion to their money fund balances in '07 and '08. In '09 and through mid April of '10, we've seen about $100 billion leave our money funds.
Money fund withdrawals have included certain assets that came in late in '09 with an intended short stay, drawdowns of cash by corporations beginning the increased investment spending, and increased used to certain high yielding investments, including direct market investments and bank deposit products by some investors who are more yield-sensitive. 
Throughout this period, including in 2010, our client relationships have remained strong, stable and in fact, growing. Our clients have appreciated the strength and stability of our products and our willingness to keep funds open during periods when other providers close funds even as we waived most, or in some cases, all of our advisory fees in some of the funds.
We are confident that looking beyond the unprecedented market and interest rate environment of recent years, our Cash Management business continues to be very well-positioned. We expect this business to continue to grow over time, with higher highs and higher lows during particular cycles.
Although low rates continue to impact yields and fee waivers for money funds in Q1, we believe that we saw the high watermark for these waivers in January and February. As we expected, there was some upward movement in certain rates within the current zero to 25 basis point fed funds target range in March. We believe that we will see less impact from money fund fee waivers beginning in the second quarter and continuing over the rest of the year. Tom will provide some more specific comments in his remarks. 
Importantly, our money market funds share has remained over 8% during the quarter.
Beyond cash, we have a broad array of solid products in both bonds and equities. In Q1, we saw gross mutual fund sales increased to over $2 billion per month for combined equity and bond funds. This is an increase of about 7.5% from the average in 2009 and builds on the 64% we saw in the 2009 versus 2008 timeframe. We gained market share in 2009 on the gross sales for bond funds and equity funds as well. 
Now looking more specifically at equities, assets increased slightly during the first quarter to just over $30 billion. Net inflows were negative in January and March, and positive in February. For the first two weeks of April, these flows are negative. 
For the full quarter, we saw positive flows in the intercontinental fund and in the alternatives space with the Prudent Bear fund. The Strategic Value Dividend Oriented Fund continues to show solid flows, and net flows were also positive in the Kaufmann Small Cap Fund, the Clover Small Value Fund and Federated Mid Cap Growth Strategies Fund.
Looking at our equity product lineup, we have solid products in a variety of areas that should be well positioned to capture flows, including on the domestic side, Clover Value and Small Clover Value, Kaufman products, Prudent Bear and our group of value and income products. The InterContinental and International Leaders Funds are solid performers among our international products. Within the equity separate accounts, outflows were largely due to net redemptions in our SMA products. 
Now looking at bonds, our sales continue to be strong in the first quarter, with gross sales of more than $4.5 billion and net sales of $1.2 billion. We continue to see improvement in the composition of these sales. 
For the first quarter, all categories of domestic bond funds showed net inflows. The percentage of gross sales in Ultrashort products has decreased from about 50% in mid '09 to just under 30% here in the first quarter. The percentage of net sales in these funds has dropped from around 60% to 14% in the same timeframe. Bond fund flows remain positive in the first two weeks of April.
In fixed income separate accounts, we won a handful of mandates in the first quarter that we expect to fund for over $1.5 billion over the next couple of quarters. We expect to continue to see significant wins in this area, given our solid performance over the cycle. We had approximately $350 million in new financing of institutional fixed income separate accounts in Q1, partially offset by the closing of a $240 million account from a client who made a mandate change not related to investment performance. About half of the new institutional assets were sourced outside the United States, and we expect additional success in this area as we've improved our profile with certain large mandate wins.
Turning to fund investment performance and looking at the quarter and the Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds, 20% of rated assets were in the first or second quartile over the last year, 32% over three years, 76% over five years and 78% over 10. For the bond fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 25% for one year, 65%, three years, 74% for five years and 83% for 10 years. Interestingly, 99% of international equity assets are in the top two quartiles for the first year, one year, 71% for three years, 76% for five years and 71% for 10 years.
As of April 21, our managed assets were approximately $337 billion, including $260 billion in money market, $30 billion in equities and $47 billion in fixed income, which includes liquidation portfolios. Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $229 billion. So far in April, our money fund assets have ranged between $239 billion and $228 billion and have averaged about $235 billion.
Regarding acquisitions, we continue to conduct an active search for an acquisition or partnership to further advance our business outside the U.S. as an important component of our strategy to expand global distribution and footprint. We remain active in looking for potential consolidation deals, including in the money market business. As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deals. Tom?"
383724,100534730,57461,"Federated Investors, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-23-2010",2010-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Federated Hermes, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris.

With lower distribution expense due to the money fund wa",621,"Thank you, Chris. The revenue decrease in Q1 compared to the prior quarter was due largely to the impact from money fund yield waivers and lower money market assets as detailed in the press release. With lower distribution expense due to the money fund waivers, the operating income impact of these waivers was $17.8 million. As Chris mentioned, we have started to see some improvement in certain short-term rates, and this is beginning to positively impact waivers.  
For Q2, we think that based on the current market conditions and our expectations for rates, the operating income impact from these waivers will decrease to around $15.5 million. While we believe that the impact will continue to decrease thereafter, we caution that a wide range of outcomes is possible. Factors that impact these waivers include yield levels available in the market, changes in assets within the funds, actions by the Fed, Treasury, the SEC and other governmental entities, changes in the expenses of the funds and our willingness to continue the waivers. 
In terms of sensitivity, we continue to estimate the 10 basis point increase in fund gross yields would reduce the waiver impact by about 1/3, while 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3.
Looking at our asset weighted average money fund gross yields from mid-January to mid-April, overall gross yields are only up about one basis point, as higher treasury fund yields were partially offset by the lower government agency fund yields. Prime has remained about the same.  Fewer days in Q1 also impacted revenues by $6.8 million compared to Q4, partially offset by $1.6 million in related lower distribution expense.
Turning to expenses, compensation expense increased from the prior quarter due mainly to the seasonality of payroll taxes and 401(k) matching contributions. Q1 also included a true up of bonus expense, therefore, we would expect that about $65.5 million would be a good estimate for Q2 cost run rates.
Looking at distribution expense, yield waiver, lower money fund assets and fewer days in the first quarter drove the variance from the prior quarter. 
The successful launch of the Federated Enhanced Treasury Income Closed-End Fund in January added approximately $850,000 in net operating expenses in Q1. The expense was near the low end of the range due to contributions from other deal parties. The offering raised $180 million in new assets, and we are looking for additional opportunities in the Closed-Fund space.
As we discussed last quarter, the dividend paid in January reduced reported EPS by approximately $0.04 per share due to the impact of the two class method required for calculating EPS. On the balance sheet, we recently announced the closing of an amended and restated term loan facility effective April 9, the $425 million structure is fully drawn, approximately $186 million of the proceeds were used to retire  the existing debt, the balance of the loan is $236 million and our $200 million revolving credit facility are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and related contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product seeding and other investments.
We entered into an interest rate swap to produce a fixed interest rate of 4.396% for the five-year term. We felt that the opportunity to extend the term and the size of our debt funding at this rate was attractive and positions us to be opportunistic as we actively seek an acquisition or partnership to expand our international business. The deal was very well-received in the bank market, and was oversubscribed with 22 banks participating. In addition to the dollar 50 dividend paid in January, we repurchased 111,000 shares during the quarter. 
And that concludes our presentation. We would now like to open up the call for questions."

On the other hand, there are excellent pods of performance in every one of our teams that give us the product that can progress in the future. And I mentioned some of those in my remarks, namely the two offerings of Value from our friends at Clover and Rochester, namely the dividend fund, the Strategic Value Fund, namely the afore-discussed Prudent Bear fund, a couple of Kaufmann offerings, even the stock and bond funds. So there's a good array of products in each pod that give us a lot of options. I think it's either six or seven funds that have top quartile three-year records. And those are the ones that have the positive flows and have the good stature for growth here in '10."

So yes, there will be movements as the interest rates stay low, people at various times click off and move into some other instrument.

So that cleared the deck of putting out what amounts to best practices that we and others got together to put out and help the SEC come up with 2a-7. So I think they've done an excellent job on that.

And if you know when it's going to come out, then I'd appreciate knowing, because we don't have any indication as to when that will happen. We understand that they will continue to mention in there that they want to study the idea of variable net asset value on money funds, which, of course, is debt for money funds, which of course is not good and we don't think will happen. So the next round of money market fund regulation, I think, is pretty far off. At least, there is no current movement, there is no current SEC rule proposal that's out there. They asked a lot of questions the last time so that they could begin to solicit the industry's views on subjects that maybe weren't covered in that first round of rules but have not given an indication other than it will be post-President's Working Group as to when they would come up with something. So it's very, very difficult for us to put a time on it.

And that has been the addition in only the fourth quarter of '08 of Prudent Bear and Clover. It has been the revamping internally of the focus of the compensation program on the sales force where that compensation program has been restructured to more lean on getting products on platforms and equalizing the benefits of the compensation program, whatever products happen to be sold. And that's only now being realized in the marketplace this year. So we've looked at the comp and the structure. We're pretty happy with the total number of wholesalers, 186. I mean you can go plus, minus a few, but we're not looking for that. Now if you start talking about advertising or image in things, we consider that often. But it just strikes us that for our wholesaling force, we're better off spending the money on rifle shots with our intermediaries than trying to spend a million a month on making waves in the marketplace through the advertising. So you're right that it is very competitive, but it is a source of positive to us that we have been able to increase the equity sales and knowing that we have these products that we think can do a pretty good job, that we think we can get our gross sales and net sales of equity back positive and in numbers like what we had almost a decade ago."

And the thing about this business is that no matter what you do since the single most important rate in the Investment Company Act is the right to redeem, that it's very, very hard to change that. Now our historic pattern has been higher than industry average, and that is correct. Part of that is because of certain funds that have suffered redemptions recently, namely the MDT gang and the larger Kaufmann Fund, and some redemptions  that have occurred in the Capital Appreciation Fund. All of which, you look at and you say, ""Hey, Cap App has been turned around in terms of the performance"" And the Kaufmann boys have been there before, they love their healthcare positions, and I, certainly, wouldn't be one to bet against them.

And so now this is progress because now it is out and being discussed. And basically, the discussion is that it would be capitalized by a combination of monies from the investment advisors who run commercial paper funds and investments by those commercial paper funds themselves in a liquidity bank that would be either a special purpose trust company, or a special bank that would invest in very, very high-grade U.S. government securities and provide the liquidity facility and at the end of the day would have the availability of the Fed window with its attendant discounts/premiums if it needed to be utilized. And this is all within the context of the requirements from 2a-7 to have 10% of your money in daily care [ph] to daily available and 30% on a weekly basis. So this is something that, if needed, would come in after those features. So that's all I know about it right now. I can't give you an update as to where the regulators are on it, but it seems to us to be an excellent idea that captures a lot of the flavor of what people are looking for. And it's one that the industry has done a lot of work on and I think shows a lot of good faith and accurate substantive understanding of what could address issues that people are concerned about."

Now in terms of people with recent analysis of rates, we're back to the question we've talked about before where, yes, we do see some money going out and see that continuing on some pace that's pretty hard to detect. And people, slowly but surely, some of them look to higher rates. But once again, I come back to the fact that when you have people calling you and telling you to leave funds open that are paying zero yield because it's an integral part of their cash management system, the idea that those clients are going to move because of a yield variance is really hard to see. So we can't tell you exactly what the top hat of that chart or that bar is going to look like, but there's certainly a large component of it that makes up the vast majority of our client base that continue to look at it as a cash management service.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets",1133,"Thank you, Ray, and good morning. I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.
Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets decreased by $41 billion or 13% from the prior quarter. The decrease came from money market funds, as cash separate account assets increased slightly. We noted in our January call that money fund assets were down about $22 billion. Assets were relatively stable in February before decreasing in March. And we have seen the expected tax related outflows here in April.
Unprecedented market conditions and short-term interest rates have led to unprecedented changes in client money fund balances over the last three years. In this period, our clients added about $173 billion to their money fund balances in '07 and '08. In '09 and through mid April of '10, we've seen about $100 billion leave our money funds.
Money fund withdrawals have included certain assets that came in late in '09 with an intended short stay, drawdowns of cash by corporations beginning the increased investment spending, and increased used to certain high yielding investments, including direct market investments and bank deposit products by some investors who are more yield-sensitive. 
Throughout this period, including in 2010, our client relationships have remained strong, stable and in fact, growing. Our clients have appreciated the strength and stability of our products and our willingness to keep funds open during periods when other providers close funds even as we waived most, or in some cases, all of our advisory fees in some of the funds.
We are confident that looking beyond the unprecedented market and interest rate environment of recent years, our Cash Management business continues to be very well-positioned. We expect this business to continue to grow over time, with higher highs and higher lows during particular cycles.
Although low rates continue to impact yields and fee waivers for money funds in Q1, we believe that we saw the high watermark for these waivers in January and February. As we expected, there was some upward movement in certain rates within the current zero to 25 basis point fed funds target range in March. We believe that we will see less impact from money fund fee waivers beginning in the second quarter and continuing over the rest of the year. Tom will provide some more specific comments in his remarks. 
Importantly, our money market funds share has remained over 8% during the quarter.
Beyond cash, we have a broad array of solid products in both bonds and equities. In Q1, we saw gross mutual fund sales increased to over $2 billion per month for combined equity and bond funds. This is an increase of about 7 1/2% from the average in 2009 and builds on the 64% growth we saw in the 2009 versus 2008 timeframe. We gained market share in 2009 on the gross sales for bond funds and for equity funds as well. 
Now looking more specifically at equities, assets increased slightly during the first quarter to just over $30 billion. Net inflows were negative in January and March, and positive in February. For the first two weeks of April, these flows are negative. 
For the full quarter, we saw positive flows in the intercontinental fund and in the alternatives space with the Prudent Bear fund. The Strategic Value Dividend Oriented Fund continues to show solid flows, and net flows were also positive in the Kaufmann Large Cap Fund, the Clover Small Value Fund and Federated Mid Cap Growth Strategies Fund.
Looking at our equity product lineup, we have solid products in a variety of areas that should be well positioned to capture flows, including on the domestic side, Clover Value and Small Clover Value, Kaufman products, Prudent Bear and our group of value and income products. The InterContinental and International Leaders Funds are solid performers among our International products. Within the equity separate accounts, outflows were largely due to net redemptions in our SMA products. 
Now looking at bonds, our sales continue to be strong in the first quarter, with gross sales of more than $4.5 billion and net sales of $1.2 billion. We continue to see improvement in the composition of these sales. 
For the first quarter, all categories of domestic bond funds showed net inflows. The percentage of gross sales in Ultrashort products has decreased from about 50% in mid '09 to just under 30% here in the first quarter. The percentage of net sales in these funds has dropped from around 60% to 14% in the same timeframe. Bond fund flows remained positive in the first two weeks of April.
In fixed income separate accounts, we won a handful of mandates in the first quarter that we expect to fund for over $1.5 billion over the next couple of quarters. We expect to continue to see significant wins in this area, given our solid performance over the cycle. We had approximately $350 million in new financing of institutional fixed income separate accounts in Q1, partially offset by the closing of a $240 million account from a client who made a mandate change not related to investment performance. About half of the new institutional assets were sourced outside the United States, and we expect additional success in this area as we've improved our profile with certain large mandate wins.
Turning to fund investment performance and looking at the quarter and the Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds, 20% of rated assets are in the first or second quartile over the last year, 32% over three years, 76% over five years and 78% over 10. For the bond fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 25% for one year, 65%, three years, 74% for five years and 83% for 10 years. Interestingly, 99% of international equity assets are in the top two quartiles for the first year, one year, 71% for three years, 76% for five years and 71% for 10 years.
As of April 21, our managed assets were approximately $337 billion, including $260 billion in money market, $30 billion in equities and $47 billion in fixed income, which includes liquidation portfolios. Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $229 billion. So far in April, our money fund assets have ranged between $239 billion and $228 billion and have averaged about $235 billion.
Regarding acquisitions, we continue to conduct an active search for an acquisition or partnership to further advance our business outside the U.S. as an important component of our strategy to expand global distribution and footprint. We remain active in looking for potential consolidation deals, including in the money market business. As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deals. Tom?"

The revenue decrease in Q1 compared to the prior quarter was due largely to the impact from money fund yield waivers and lower money market assets as detailed in the press release. With lower distribution expense due to the money fund waivers, the operating income impact of these waivers was $17.8 million. As Chris mentioned, we have started to see some improvement in certain short-term rates, and this is beginning to positively impact waivers.  
For Q2, we think that based on current market conditions and our expectations for rates, the operating income impact from these waivers will decrease to around $15.5 million. While we believe that the impact will continue to decrease thereafter, we caution that a wide range of outcomes is possible. Factors that impact, these waivers include yield levels available in the market, changes in assets within the funds, actions by the Fed, Treasury, the SEC and other governmental entities, changes in the expenses of the funds and our willingness to continue the waivers. 
In terms of sensitivity, we continue to estimate the 10 basis point increase in fund gross yields would reduce the waiver impact by about 1/3, while 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3.
Looking at our asset weighted average money fund gross yields from mid-January to mid-April, overall gross yields are only up about one basis point, as higher treasury fund yields were partially offset by a lower government agency fund yields. Prime has remained about the same. Fewer days in Q1 also impacted revenues by $6.8 million compared to Q4, partially offset by $1.6 million in related lower distribution expense.
Turning to expenses, compensation expense increased from the prior quarter due mainly to the seasonality of payroll taxes and 401(k) matching contributions. Q1 also included a true up of bonus expense, therefore, we would expect that about $65.5 million would be a good estimate for Q2 cost run rates.
Looking at distribution expense, yield waiver, lower money fund assets and fewer days in the first quarter drove the variance from the prior quarter. 
The successful launch of the Federated Enhanced Treasury Closed-End Fund [Federated Enhanced Treasury Income Closed-End Fund] in January added approximately $850,000 in net operating expenses in Q1. The expense was near the low end of the range due to contributions from other deal parties. The offering raised $180 million in new assets, and we are looking for additional opportunities in the Closed-Fund space.
As we discussed last quarter, the dividend paid in January reduced reported EPS by approximately $0.04 per share due to the impact of the two class method required for calculating EPS. On the balance sheet, we recently announced the closing of an amended and restated term loan facility effective April 9, the $425 million structure is fully drawn, approximately $186 million of the proceeds were used to retire existing debt, the balance of the loan is $236 million and our $200 million revolving credit facility are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and related contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product seeding and other investments.
We entered into an interest rate swap to produce a fixed interest rate of 4.396% for the five-year term. We felt that the opportunity to extend the term and the size of our debt funding at this rate was attractive and positions us to be opportunistic as we actively seek an acquisition or partnership to expand our International business. The deal was very well-received in the bank market, and was oversubscribed with 22 banks participating. In addition to the $1.50 dividend paid in January, we repurchased 111,000 shares during the quarter. 
And that concludes our presentation. We would now like to open up the call for questions."

So that cleared the deck of putting out what amounts to best practices that we and others got together to put out and help the SEC come up with 2a-7. So I think they've done an excellent job on that. And that took a lot of pressure off of the immediacy of enhancing the resiliency of money funds. The next thing is going to be the President's Working Group report. And if you know when it's going to come out, then I'd appreciate knowing, because we don't have any indication as to when that will happen. We understand that they will continue to mention in there that they want to study the idea of variable net asset value on money funds, which, of course, is debt for money funds, which of course is not good and we don't think will happen. So the next round of money market fund regulation, I think, is pretty far off. At least, there is no current movement, there is no current SEC rule proposal that's out there. They asked a lot of questions the last time so that they could begin to solicit the industry's views on subjects that maybe weren't covered in that first round of rules but have not given an indication other than it will be post-President's Working Group as to when they would come up with something. So it's very, very difficult for us to put a time on it. We are thankful and appreciative that the SEC did do the first round of 2a-7, so that at least in this industry, we can say the first and important movements on enhancing the resiliency of money funds have been accomplished."

Let me just give you a summary of some of the things that have been done, that have accounted for, that rather impressive increase in gross sales, especially on the equity side. And that has been the addition in only the fourth quarter of '08 of Prudent Bear and Clover. It has been the revamping internally of the focus of the compensation program on the sales force where that compensation program has been restructured to more lean on getting products on platforms and equalizing the benefits of the compensation program, whatever products happen to be sold. And that's only now being realized in the marketplace this year. So we've looked at the comp and the structure. We're pretty happy with the total number of wholesalers, 186. I mean you can go plus, minus a few, but we're not looking for that. Now if you start talking about advertising or image in things, we consider that often. But it just strikes us that for our wholesaling force, we're better off spending the money on rifle shots with our intermediaries than trying to spend a million a month on making waves in the marketplace through the advertising. So you're right that it is very competitive, but it is a source of positive to us that we have been able to increase the equity sales and knowing that we have these products that we think can do a pretty good job, that we think we can get our gross sales and net sales of equity back positive and in numbers like what we had almost a decade ago."

And so now this is progress because now it is out and being discussed. And basically, the discussion is that it would be capitalized by a combination of monies from the investment advisors who run commercial paper funds and investments by those commercial paper funds themselves in a liquidity bank that would be either a special purpose trust company, or a special bank that would invest in very, very high-grade U.S. government securities and provide the liquidity facility and at the end of the day would have the availability of the Fed window with its attendant discounts/premiums if it needed to be utilized.

But once again, I come back to the fact that when you have people calling you and telling you to leave funds open that are paying zero yield because it's an integral part of their cash management system, the idea that those clients are going to move because of a yield variance is really hard to see. So we can't tell you exactly what the top hat of that chart or that bar is going to look like, but there's certainly a large component of it that makes up the vast majority of our client base that continue to look at it as a cash management service.

Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets decreased by $12 billion or 4% from the prior quarter. Money market mutual funds decreased by $9 billion and money market separate accounts decreased by $3 billion, which was due largely to tax seasonality.
Money market asset changes are best understood within the context of the unprecedented cycle we are experiencing. All our clients added $182 billion to their money fund balances in '07 and '08, and in '09 and through the end of Q2 here in '10, we've seen about $95 billion flow out, meaning, by the famous subtraction method that we are up $87 billion from the beginning of this cycle.
During Q2, we saw our money market fund assets decrease in April due largely to expected tax seasonality. These assets then increased in both May and June and average assets so far in July are higher than the June 30 period end level. Growth from clients outside of the US has helped with these results.
While market conditions continue to be challenging, our clients have remained strong, stable and growing. Our clients have appreciated the strength, the stability and the availability of our products. We remain confident that our cash management business is well positioned and we expect this business to grow overtime with higher highs and higher lows during particular cycles. We also expect further growth through consolidation.
The transaction we announced last week with SunTrust is expected to result in the transition of about $17 billion in money market assets in the Federated money market products during Q4. This is an example of our ability to work successfully with long-term clients as they make changes in their approach to cash management, and we expect to see more of these arrangements, as banks and other organizations are attracted to our long-term commitment to this business and our long-term record of providing high quality products and service that they can rely on for their client.
Turning to the money market fund yield waivers. Q2 saw some relief in the impact from these waivers. As we expected, repo rates moved in to the upper portion of the zero to 25 basis point target range. In addition, LIBOR rates further increased reflecting market condition that developed, following uncertainty in Europe. This helps to decrease the waivers more than anticipated. We expect these waivers to decrease going forward though at a slower rate than we saw in Q2 and Tom will comment further on these in his remarks. 
Our money market fund share increased in the second quarter to about 8.2%, up from approximately 8.1% at the end of first quarter. For reference recall that in 2009 and2008, our market share was about 8.5%, up from about 7% in '07 and 5% at the turn of the millennium. 
As we turn to other products, it is worth noting that in the midst of the difficult market conditions in Q2, Federated was able to use its broad product lineup to offer products geared to challenging equity market. A prime example is the set of alternative strategy equity mutual fund products that we have developed featuring the Prudent Bear Funds which we acquired in December of '08. This fund returned just under 10% for the quarter and produced solid gross sales of $573 million and net sales of $212 million.
It has surpassed $2 billion in assets and as of mid-July had more than doubled in size from the end of 2008. Flows in this product changed quickly with changes in the equity market. While we stressed to clients we believe this type of product should be a part of every portfolio, its value becomes most apparent during tough equity markets.
Other funds with net inflows in Q2 included the InterContinental, Strategic Value, Kaufman Large Cap and Clover Small Value funds. With these and other funds we have a solid equity fund product in growth value income, international and alternative. And we believe that these products will be attractive as equity markets improve and flows pickup.
Our overall equity fund net flows were negative in the second quarter. Growth sales year-to-date 2010 were up 16% compared to the same period in 2009. Equity fund flows are positive for the first half of July driven by the strategic value and Prudent Bear funds. Within equity separate accounts, outflows were negative due largely to net redemption in our SMA products.
Now looking at bond funds, our sales continue to be solid in the second quarter with gross sales of $3.6 billion and net sales of $310 million. Our total return on bond funds showed another quarter of solid inflows above $385 million. Ultra short products however were slightly negative, about a $136 million, but have returned to positive here in the early flows of the third quarter.
Bond fund flows remain positive in the first two weeks of July. Fixed income separate accounts, we had about $1.8 billion in net new funding of institutional accounts in the second quarter. We won another handful of mandates in the second quarter and the early part of Q3 that we expect will fund for approximately $400 million in the mutual funds and separate accounts.
We expect to continue to see significant wins in this area, given our solid performance over the cycle and higher profile after a series of wins. Moving back to the first quarter of '09 we won about 15 institutional fixed income and equity mandates ranging in size up to $1.9 billion. They include core Ag, core fixed some even into our total return government bonds fund, corporates, short-term governments, short-intermediate government, MDT Small Cap and Strategic Value, certainly an array of product offerings. 
Turning to fund investment performance and looking at the quarter end Lipper Rankings for Federated's equity fund, 14% of rated assets are in the first or second quartile over the last year, 34% three years, 77% five years, 82% ten years. For bond assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 28% one year, 69% three years, 71% for five years and 86% for ten years.
Interestingly, 77% of international equity-rated assets are in the top two quartiles. For year one, 24% three years, 72% five years and 72% for ten years. Taking a look a Morningstar rated funds, 35% of rated equity fund assets are four and five-star products as the 6/30 and the 82% are three, four or five-star products. 
As of July 21st, our managed assets were approximately $338 billion, including $260 billion in money markets, $28 billion in equities and $50 billion in fixed income which includes our liquidation portfolio. Money market, mutual fund assets stand at about $231 billion. So far in July, our money fund assets have ranged between $231 million and $235 billion and have averaged at about $233 billion.
Regarding acquisition, we continue to conduct an active search for an alliance to further advance our business outside of the United States, as an important component of our strategy to expand global distribution. We remain active in looking for consolidation deals, including money market business. As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deal.
At this point, I will turn it over to Tom to discuss our financials.

As expected, we saw less impact from money market fund yields waivers in Q2 and this impacted related revenue and expense items as detailed in the press release. The reduction in operating income from these waivers grew up to $13 million, compared to $17.8 million in Q1. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, we expect these waivers to reduce operating income by $11 billion to $12 billion in the third quarter. We do not expect the impact from waivers to decrease material from this level until the Fed begins to increase the interest rates. Debbie will comment on our great outlook at the end of my comments.
In terms of sensitivity, we have estimated that a 10 basis point increase in gross money fund yield would decrease waivers by about one-third, and this is essentially what we experienced in the second quarter. Looking forward, we estimate they are gaining another 10 basis points during gross yield, we will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by another one-third from our current levels, and a 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about two-thirds. We caution that a wide range of outcomes with possible factors that impact these waivers include yield levels available in the market, changes in assets within the funds, actions by the Fed, Treasury, the SEC and other governmental entities, changes in the expenses of the funds and our willingness to continue the waivers.
Looking at operating expenses. The press release detailed by line item, the impact of the insurance recovery on expenses we had booked in earlier periods. Compensation and related expenses decreased from the prior quarter due largely to lower incentive compensation expense; seasonality in payroll taxes and benefit expense and credit from the insurance recovery. Q1 had also included a reversal of previously accrued incentive comp expense.
We expect Q3 comp expense to be approximately $64 million. Q2 also saw an impairment charge of $7 million to certain assets from our acquisition of MDT Advisers in 2006, which became our quantitative equity team. We have approximately $7.5 million and remaining book value in the amortizable assets from this acquisition.  
On the balance sheet, Q2 was the first quarter to include the impact from the $425 million term loan stability put in place on April 9. As we discussed last quarter, proceeds were used to initially pay existing debt. No net proceeds have been invested in various Federated equity and bond funds with additional investments made to see potential new products.
Long proceeds and availability on our $200 million revolver, as well as earnings and cash flow are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisition and related continued payment, share repurchases, dividends, new product seeding and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments.
We announced last week, the definitive agreement reached with SunTrust to acquire money market business, sending approval process, we expect to transition the $17 billion through a series of closing is expected to occur during the fourth quarter. Beginning in Q1 of 2011, we expect to add approximately $0.01 to $0.015 cents per share to our quarterly earnings. Actual incremental earnings will vary and will depend on asset levels, transitioning waivers, the final valuation for related intangible assets and other factors.
That completes my comments and I would like to ask Debbie to give some comments on our great outlook.

I thought I would list maybe a couple positives and negatives for why interest rates should go up and why they should stay where they are. On the positive side of the equation, currently you have a deeper curve. That deeper curve has been based on wider spreads, as well as expectations of our near-term Fed tightening. Fed has remained wider during the quarter and has started to come in, in July based on some European debt concerns in the marketplace and that also has caused that deeper curve to be beneficial, especially to our plan and government plan.
Other countries are also tightening, you've got Australia, Canada very close to Denmark and other two have been in the tightening mode now for the better part of the last nine months. On the same kind of the equation, you do have a slowdown in a lot of the economic statistics as we've been receiving over the course of the last three to four weeks. Notably, both housing and employment with our key statistics on that economic side of the equation have slowed down markedly. You also have had a bit of mitigation of some of the European debt spread increases that occurred. We get a little bit more news on that front today as the European debt stress test for 91 of banking institutions are going to be released at noon today.
Overall, when we processed all of this information, we have pushed our tightening expectation from a Fed perspective into the 2011 time period just recently. I think it will be a first half event of 2011. We don't think that we will be going into any sort a double-dip recession which would push it out even further. But we do think that because of some of factors that I have listed on the negative side of the equation, this tightening process will not occur in 2010, but will rather start in the 2011 time period with a measured 25 basis point per clip days Federal Reserve action that will be precipitated by a stronger growth in economic statistics in the market place.

But over the longer term, we still expect this to be a good, solid, strong business because of the need for cash management service by our clients, and we don't have to get into the consolidation we already mentioned that point as well.

That market has almost halved inside from its peak which was in the summer of '07. Having said that, CD deposit type investments have increased by three times their size during that same time period. So, although our available supply is coming in a more concentrated form from an industry perspective, it's more related to financial services, banks and other types of financial services companies than it had been historically the availability for supply is still very good and it's still out there. Some of the things that have been a little bit challenging over the course of last several quarters in the retail marketplace has been from a supply perspective, and that is starting to loosen up a little bit also.
The potential for the Fed to come into marketplace and begin reversing some of their collateral back into the market and creating additional supply there, it will be a welcome relief. So, there are things that are happening that are mitigating some of what has been supply pressures in the marketplace, and overall although we would wish for more diversification in the supply. The supply itself remains pretty good.

The negative flows as I mentioned were in the equity side and that continues to be driven overwhelmingly by redemptions from our MDT SMA purchase. And these things just continue because of the relative performance of MDT quant model, both in the downdraft in '08 and the updraft in '09. And although they are doing better now, the redemptions still continue. 
Well, maybe six out of seven of their mandates are ahead from inception, but on a current basis, it's still a challenge because of the '08, '09 performance. Historically, when they have had a tough performance before, they have bounced back; these model's been around for 15 years and has worked well. So like other quant managers, we are working with them and believe in their long-term viability, but I can't hearsay that we are going to see a reversal in that trend of negative flows on the MDT separate account equity business.

And our view is that, when the 12(b)-1 fees are running at a billion dollars a month. Last year they were less than that, maybe like a total of none or something. Those fees are for legitimate and proper services. So now comes the question of how you structure them in a way that makes sense not to the regulator.
Point two is, don't forget that the origin of 12(b)-1 is in SEC hall pass to the industry, which, P.S. we opposed when it came out, because it represented using fund assets for distribution. And so now, the challenges that put the genie back in the bottle, and that is becoming a bit of a challenge. So what we are looking at is, how do you preserve legitimate business expenses and charges and add to the SECs legitimate desire to have a transparency understanding disclosure on what's going on. So within that context, we are not thinking that it's going to injure our business at this point. Remember that, within the context of the overall 12(b)-1, the first 25 basis points is acceptable through the SEC in that arrangement. I have not read the whole thing yet. When they first came out, whether it was just the three page item that they put on their website, but nonetheless, those are some initial look at it.
Next thing is that I think there is going to be a 90-day common period, and believe me, they are going to be comments on this that I think will accurately and appropriately reflect what is going on legitimately in the market place, and I believe there is a sound way to get everybody what they want, transparency, understanding and legitimate expenses being covered in a legitimate way.

We had had longer duration targets in most of 2007, 2008 and even into most of 2009. We pulled that back a little bit and it's served us well in the context of the steepening yield curve that occurred in the second quarter of 2010.
Our expectation is that that's sort of on hold again at this point. So for now, again we are still in that neutral phase but the potential for going a little bit longer given what we think is a longer period of time before the Fed actually starts tightening, and the curve has already done part of the job for them. That still is a debatable and discussed item at this point. But right now we are neutral across all of our products.
From a European debt perspective, we own European banks within all of our money funds, taxable, tax free, they are counterparts to repo within our government funds. So, we have exposure to European institutions, banking institutions. None of the sovereigns, but banking institutions across the continent during the '07 and '08 credit crunch time period. What we effectively did was shorten the duration on many of those products. So, if we had historically been comfortable using one of those names, at six months we tightened it down to three months. If we had historically been comfortable using it at three months, we tightened it down to one month.
Over the course of this year, year-to-date 2010, that process has begun to be reversed. And for the institutions that we are dealing with, what we've seen over the course of last three months in the European debt situation really hasn't changed that. The ones that we are dealing with are very global in nature. They are not the Spanish saving bank. They are not the smaller German Londis banks. They are the very large global players in the marketplace, and as such, spreads have widened out in sympathy with some of the others and we've taken advantage of that. We don't find this to be truly a setback in the context of their overall credit profile and our metrics of how we are viewing that.

We feel like at this point there is really a leveling off of assets that there is likely expectation going forward, not only from our perspective but from an industry perspective. If you look at where some of those assets went, they went into some bank deposit-type instruments that would be increased, and the yield curve that we've seen over the last quarter has made funds competitive with those products again. And that's why you've seen sort of a leveling off of those asset flows. And the expectation would be that, that will be maintained.
Having said that, anytime you go into a rising rate environment, although we are pushing that out into the 2011 time period, the fact of the matter is we hit no lower from here. So we expect that to occur at some point in the fairly near future. Rising rate environments are definitely companies on a cyclical basis with a decline in assets from money fund perspective because of the lag in the funds versus the direct market. Having said that, we think the good portion of that has already played itself out, and the 3.9 to 2, that's a more than $1 trillion that's gone out from an industry perspective already.
A good portion of what was in there also at its peak, what I will call non-traditional money market investment. They fled the markets during a time period in 2008 and in early 2009, when they were looking just for Safe Harbor, and I would certainly the biggest portion of those are those types of investors are gone at this point.

We are in the middle of our fourth decade of doing the money market fund business, and one of the reasons that we were willing to do the waivers in the beginning was for a commitment for the long-haul, and we think this is still an important thing. And so, as long as the math works, as I'm about to describe which it is, we are okay with doing the waivers and that is that the short term interest rate cover the core expenses of the fund, and this is just an average kind of a number, but basically that means the three basis points roughly of third party expenses and the 7 basis points of administration in order to keep the functions of the funds alive and well. So, if the growth yield and the fund is ten, and those third parties expenses are ten and that is covered, then we are still quite happy to be proceeding with waivers, and that's what happened. We got close to some of those points in early January when the Fed funds rates and repo rates were low single digits. But it didn't last long enough to affect the entire yield on the fund.
So now when we have rates that are periodically in the 20s and mostly in the 18s, you can see that those core expenses are covered. So our attitude is such that given this scenario, we would continue to waive and further from our clients, we get the comment that even if funds are at zero or we've really been having to increasing yields here recently as Debby mentioned, but even at zero the clients prefer to have the funds open evidencing the fact that they're utilized as part of a cash management service.

The first blush of the President's Working Group was very precise on money funds saying that they were going to do things to quote, enhance the resiliency of money fund, and they are going to keep studying all sorts of different ideas, some of which we of course don't like, like variable net asset value and things like that.
But we believe that overall what they did with the 2a-7 rules was an excellent job of putting best practice and enhancing the resiliency of money fund. Point two, we think that it has worked well in the market place, and that this fact will be very helpful in the next round, and we don't know exactly what the SEC or the President's Working Group may have in store for the next round.

If you look at the various sectors of funds, the government money market funds are most affected by the interest rate risk reductions that were put through specifically the weighted average life calculation and this has to do with the longer dated floating rate securities from Fannie and Freddie that were historically a large portion of those products.
If you look at prime money market funds, prime money market funds are also affected by the same weighted average life calculation, but to a larger degree the prime funds are affected by the 10% and 30% overnight and weekly calculations that are required for liquidity purposes. Lastly for the muni sector, the muni-money market sector, it's the credit quality changes, the reduction, the amount of second tier paper that can be used within those products that will cost the most amount of obtained or yield loss in the product going forward.
In the current environment, where you are still working in an interest-rate scenario that maybe 20 to 80 basis points in range at this point, a very little change in overall product yield based on any of these issues that I just mentioned or risk mitigation items that have been have been required by the SEC.
Having said that if you get back into a more normalized sort of environment, the 2% to 3% area, what we are thinking is the result of all of these changes across the board in the various products. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of three to 8 basis point. Any yes, that's a hit when you are looking at something that may have a one or two or 3% yield, but it's not the end of the world. It's something that still allow these products to remain competitive in their market place. Yes, it has gone a long way in reducing the overall risk of the product because of these changes..

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets",1242,"Thank you, Ray, and good morning. I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.
Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets decreased by $12 billion or 4% from the prior quarter. Money market mutual funds decreased by $9 billion. And money market separate accounts decreased by $3 billion, which was due largely to tax seasonality. Money market asset changes are best understood within the context of the unprecedented cycle we are experiencing. Our clients added $182 billion to their money fund balances in '07 and '08. And in '09 and through the end of Q2 here in '10, we've seen about $95 billion blowup. Meaning, by the payments of traction method that we are up $87 billion from the beginning of this cycle. During Q2, we saw our money market fund assets decrease in April due largely to expected tax seasonality. These assets then increased in both May and June, and average assets so far in July are higher than the June 30, period-end level. Growth from clients outside of the U.S. has helped with these results. 
While market conditions continue to be challenging, our clients have remained strong, stable and growing. Our clients have appreciated the strength, the stability and the availability of our products. We remain confident that our Cash Management business is well positioned, and we expect this business to grow over time with higher highs and higher lows during particular cycles. 
We also expect further growth through consolidation. The transaction we announced last week with SunTrust is expected to result in the transition of about $17 billion in money market assets in the Federated money market products during Q4. This is an example of our ability to work successfully with long-term clients, as they make changes in their approach to cash management. And we expect to see more of these arrangements as banks and other organizations are attracted to our long-term commitment to this business and our long-term record of providing high-quality products and service that they can rely on for their clients.
Turning to money market fund yield waivers. Q2 saw some relief in the impact from these waivers. As we expected, repo rates moved into the upper portion of the 0 to 25 basis point target range. In addition, LIBOR rates further increased reflecting market conditions that developed following uncertainty in Europe. This helped to decrease the waivers more than anticipated. We expect these waivers to decrease going forward, though at a slower rate than we saw in Q2, and Tom will comment further on these in his remarks. 
Our money market fund share increased in the second quarter to about 8.2%, up from approximately 8.1% at the end of the first quarter. For reference, recall that in '09 and '08, our market share is about 8.5%, up from about 7% in '07 and 5% at the turn of the millennium. As we turn to other products, it is worth noting that in the midst of difficult market conditions in Q2, Federated was able to use this broad product lineup to offer products geared to challenging equity markets. 
A prime example is the set of alternative strategy equity mutual fund products that we have developed featuring the Prudent Bear fund, which we acquired in December of '08. This fund returned just under 10% for the quarter and produced solid growth sales of $573 million and net sales of $212 million. It has surpassed $2 billion in assets, and as of mid-July, had more than doubled in size from the end of 2008. Growth in this product changed quickly with changes in the equity markets. While we stressed to clients that we believe this type of product should be a part of every portfolio, its value becomes most apparent during tough equity markets. 
Other funds with net inflows in Q2 included the InterContinental, Strategic Value, Kaufmann Large Cap Fund and Clover Small Value Fund. With these and other funds, we have a solid equity fund products in growth, value, income, international and alternative. And we believe that these products will be attractive as equity markets improve and close pickup. 
While overall, equity fund net flows were negative in the second quarter, gross sales year-to-date 2010 were up 16% compared to the same period in 2009. Equity fund flows are positive for the first half of July driven by the Strategic Value and Prudent Bear Fund. Within equity separate accounts, outflows were negative due largely to net redemptions in our SMA products. 
Now looking at bond funds, our sales continue to be solid in the second quarter with gross sales of $3.6 billion and net sales of $310 million. Our total return of bond fund showed another quarter of solid inflows, about $385 million. Ultrashort products however, were slightly negative, about $136 million but have returned to positive here in the early flows of the third quarter. Bond fund flows remained positive in the first two weeks of July. 
Fixed income separate accounts, we had about $1.8 billion in net new funding of institutional accounts in the second quarter. We won another handful of mandates in the second quarter and the early part of Q3 that we expect will fund for approximately $400 million in the mutual funds and separate accounts. We expect to continue to see significant wins in this area given our solid performance over the cycle and higher profile after a series of wins. 
Going back to the first quarter of '09, we've won about 15 institutional fixed income and equity mandates ranging in size up to $1.9 billion. They include core ag, core fixed, some even into our total return government bond fund and Total Return Bond Fund, corporates, short-term governments, short-intermediate governments, MDT small cap and Strategic Value. Certainly, an array of product offerings.
Turning to fund investment performance and looking at the quarter end Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds, 14% of rated assets are in the first or second quartile over the last year; 34%, three years; 77%, five years; 82%, 10 years. For bond assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 28%, one year; 69%, three years; 71% for five years; and 86% for 10 years. Interestingly, 77% of international equity-rated assets are in the top two quartiles for year one; 24%, three years; 72%, five years; and 72% for 10 years.
Taking a look at Morningstar rated funds, 35% of rated equity fund assets are a four- and five-star products as of 6/30, and 82% are three-, four- or five-star products. As of July 21, our managed assets were approximately $338 billion, including $260 billion in money markets, $28 billion in equities and $50 billion in fixed income, which includes our liquidation portfolios. Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $231 billion. So far in July, our money fund assets have ranged between $231 billion and $235 billion and have averaged about $233 billion.
Regarding acquisitions, we continue to conduct an active search for alliance to further advance our business outside of the United States as an important component of our strategy to expand global distribution. We remain active in looking for consolidation deals, including money market business. As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deals. 
At this point, I would turn it over to Tom to discuss our financials."
383724,109061632,69077,"Federated Investors, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-23-2010",2010-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Federated Hermes, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. As expected, we saw less impact for money markets fund yield waivers in Q2, and this impacted related revenue and expense items as detailed in the press release. The reduction in operating income from these waivers dropped to $13 million",558,"Thank you, Chris. As expected, we saw less impact for money markets fund yield waivers in Q2, and this impacted related revenue and expense items as detailed in the press release. The reduction in operating income from these waivers dropped to $13 million compared to $17.8 million in Q1. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, we expect these waivers to reduce operating income by $11 million to $12 million in the third quarter. We do not expect the impact from waivers to decrease material from this level until the Fed begins to increase interest rates. Debbie will comment on our rate outlook at the end of my comments. 
In terms of sensitivity, we have estimated that a 10 basis point increase in gross money fund yields will decrease waivers by about one-third, and this is essentially what we experienced in the second quarter. Looking forward, we estimate that gaining another 10 basis points in gross yields will likely to reduce the impact of these waivers by another  one-third from our current levels, and a 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about two-thirds. We caution that a wide range of outcomes is possible factors that impact these waivers include: yield levels available in the market; changes and assets within the funds; actions by the Fed, treasury, the SEC and other governmental entities; changes in the expenses of the funds; and our willingness to continue the waivers. 
Looking at operating expenses. The press release detailed by line item the impact of the insurance recovery on the expenses we have booked in earlier periods. Compensation and related expenses decreased from the prior quarter due largely to lower incentive compensation expense, seasonality and payroll taxes and benefit expense and credit from the insurance recovery. Q1 also included a reversal of previously accrued incentive comp expense. We expect Q3 comp expense to be approximately $64 million.
Q2 also saw an impairment charge of $7 million to certain assets from our acquisitions of MDT Advisers in 2006, which became our quantitative equity team. We have approximately $7.5 million in remaining book value and the amortizable assets from this acquisition. 
On the balance sheet, Q2 was the first quarter to include the impact from the $425 million term loan facility put in place in April 9. As we have discussed last quarter, proceeds were used to initially to pay existing debt. Net proceeds have been invested in various federated equity and bond fund with additional investments made to see potential new products.
Loan proceeds and availability on our $200 million revolver, as well as earnings in cash flow, are available for general purposes including acquisitions and related continued payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product seeding and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayment. 
We announced last week the definitive agreement reached with SunTrust to acquire the money market business, pending approval process, we expect to transition the $17 billion through a series of closings expected to occur during the fourth quarter. Beginning in Q1 2011, we expect to have approximately $0.01 to $0.015 per share to our quarterly earnings. Actual incremental earnings will vary and will depend on asset levels, transitions, waivers, the final valuation for related intangible assets and other factors. 
That completes my comments and I'd like to ask Debbie to give some comments on our rate outlook."

I thought I'd lift maybe a couple of positives and negative for why interest rates should go up and why they should stay where they are. On the positive side of the equation, currently, you have a steeper curve. 
That steeper curve has been based on wider spreads as well as expectation on near-term Fed tightening. 
Spreads have remained wider during the quarter and has certain command in July based on some European debt concerns in the marketplace. And that also has caused that steeper curve to be beneficial, especially to our client and government funds. 
Other countries are also tightening. You got Australia, Canada, very close to home, Denmark and others who have been in a tightening mode now for the better part of the last nine months. On the, say, the same side of the equation, you do have a slowdown in a lot of the economic statistics that we've been receiving over the course of last three to four weeks. Notably, those housing and employment with our key statistics on that economic side of the equation has slowed down markedly. You also have had a bit of a mitigation of some of the European debt spread increases that occurred. We get a little bit more news on that front today as the European debt stress test for 91 of the banking institutions are going to be released at noon today. 
Overall, when we process all of these information, we have pushed our tightening expectation from a Fed perspective into the 2011 time period just recently. We think it'll be a first-half event of 2011. We don't think that we will be going into any sort of a double-dipper session, which would push it out even further. But we do think that because of some of the factors that I've listed on the negative side of the equation, this tightening process will not occur in 2010, but will rather start in the 2011 time period with a measured 25 basis point per clip Federal reserve action that will be precipitated by a growth again, a stronger growth in the economic statistics on the marketplace."

That market has almost halved in size from its peak, which was in the summer of '07. Having said that, CDs, deposit-type investments have increased by about 3x their size during that same-time period. So although available supply is coming in a more concentrated form from an industry perspective, it's more related to financial services, banks and other type of financial services companies than it has been historically. The availability for supply is still very good, and it's still out there. Some of the things that have been a little bit challenging over the course of the last several quarters in the repo marketplace has been from a supply perspective, and that is starting to loosen up a little bit also. The potential for the Fed to come into the marketplace and begin reversing some of their collateral back into the market and creating additional supply there, it will be a welcome relief. So there are things that are happening that are mitigating some of what has been supply pressures in the marketplace. And overall, although we would wish for more diversification in the supplies, the supply itself remain pretty good."

Having said that, when you look at the increases that we experienced during the second quarter, we talked about it in the context of how the market has steepened out and the yield curve has steepened out. In fact, our product yields, depending upon what category you were talking about, whether it was munis, governments or prime increase anywhere from two 10 basis points, that was the direct response to that steeper yield curve. Although that curve is not steepening further, and in fact many have flattened a few basis points at the end of June and beginning into July, when you compare that to what we say -- especially during the month of April, it got better. The seasoning part of the curve occurred mostly in May and June. That's where we expect, still, progress to be made in the context of overall fund yields, which then also makes progress on the fee waiver side of the equation.

And our view is that when the 12b-1 fees are running at $1 billion a month, last year they were less than that, maybe like a total of $900 million or something, those fees are for legitimate and proper services. So now comes the question of how you structure them in a way that makes sense not to the regulator. Point two is, don't forget that the origin of 12b-1 is in SEC call pass to the industry which, P.S. , we opposed when it came out because it represented using fund assets for distribution. And so now, the challenge is to put the genie back in the bottle, and that is becoming a bit of a challenge. So what we're looking at is how do you preserve legitimate business expenses and charges and add to the SEC's legitimate desire to have transparency, understanding, disclosure on what's going on. So within that context, we're not thinking that it's going to injure our business at this point. Remember that within the context of the overall 12b-1, the first 25 basis points is acceptable to the SEC in that arrangement. I have not read the whole thing yet. When they first came out, we thought it was just a three-page item that they put on their website. But nonetheless, those are some initial looks at it. Next thing is that I think there is going to be a 90-day comment period. And believe me, there are going to be comments on this that I think will accurately and appropriately reflect what is going on legitimately in the marketplace.

We have had longer duration targets in most of 2007, 2008 and even in to those -- to all of them, or most of 2009.

Our expectation is that, that's sort of on hold again at this point. So for now, again, we're still in that neutral phase, but the potential for going a little bit longer given what we think is a longer period of time before the Fed actually starts tightening and the curve has already done part of the job for them, that still is a debatable and discussed item at this point. But right now, we're neutral across all of our products. From a European debt perspective, we own European banks within all of our money funds, taxable, tax-free. They are counterparts to repo within our government funds. So we have exposure to European institutions, banking institutions. None of the sovereigns, but banking institutions across the continent. During the '07 and '08 credit crunch time periods, what we effectively did was shorten the duration on many of those products. So if we had historically been comfortable using one of those names at six months, we tighten it down to three months. If we have historically been comfortable using it at three months, we tighten it down to one month. Over the course of this year, year-to-date 2010, that process has begun to be reversed. And for the institutions that we're dealing with, what we've seen over the course of the last three months in the European debt situation really hasn't changed that. The ones that we're dealing with are very global in nature, they're not the Spanish savings bank. They're not the smaller -- German largest banks. They are the very large global players in the marketplace. And as such, although the spreads have widened out in sympathy with some of the others and we've advantage of that, we don't find it to be truly a setback in the context of their overall credit profile and our metrics of how we are viewing them."

And so the jobs continue, the income continues, and everything marches along even though the CFO or the whomsoever decides that this really isn't a strategic-type business. So it takes a long time. Point two, we started putting banks into these businesses in the late '80s, and we have been unraveling it over the last several years. So we took a long time to get banks into the business, and I think it goes at a similar pace on the way out. And as each regulation comes in, then it adds another piece of weight to the decision to exit. That's why we look for more. But in answer to your question about why people haven't done it, I think that's one of the principal -- those are the two principal reasons that if you're running the redemptions, you don't have a problem.

We feel like at this point, there is really a leveling off of assets that there is likely expectation going forward, not only from our perspective but from an industry perspective. If you look at where some of those assets went, they went into some bank deposit-type instruments that with the increase in the yield curve that we've seen over the last quarter had made funds competitive with those products again. And that's why you've seen sort of a leveling off of those asset flows. And the expectation would be that, that will be maintained. Having said that, anytime you go into a rising rate environment which, although we're pushing that out into a 2011 time period, the fact of the matter is we expect it -- we hit no lower from here. So we expect that to occur at some point in the fairly near future. Rising rate environments are definitely accompanied on a cyclical basis with a decline in assets from a money funds some perspective just because of the lag in the funds versus the direct market. Having said that, we think a good portion of that has already played itself out. And the $3.9 trillion to two -- the more than $1 trillion have gone out from an industry perspective already. A good portion of what we've seen in there, also at its peak, what I'll call nontraditional money market investors. They fled the markets during a time period in 2008 and early 2009 when they were looking just for Safe Harbor.

We're in the middle of our fourth decade of doing the Money Market Fund business. And one of the reasons that we were willing to do the waivers in the beginning was for a commitment for the long haul. And we think this is still an important thing. And so as long as the math works as I'm about to describe, which it is, we are okay with doing the waivers. And that is that the short-term interest rates cover the core expenses of the fund. And this is just an average kind of a number. But basically, that means the three basis points roughly are third party expenses and the seven basis points at administration in order to keep the functions of the funds alive and well. So if the grow shield on the fund is 10 and those third party expenses are 10, and that is covered, then we are still quite happy to be proceeding with waivers. And that's what happened. Well, we got close to some of those points in early January when the then Fed fund rates and repo rates were low-single digits, but it didn't last long enough to affect the entire yield on the fund. So now when we have rates that are periodically in the 20s and mostly in the 18s, you can see that those core expenses are covered. So our attitude is such that, given this scenario, we would continue to waive and further from our clients, we get to comment that even if funds are at zero or -- we really have been having the increasing yields here recently, as Debbie mentioned. But even at zero, the clients prefer to have the funds open, evidencing the fact that they're utilized as part of the Cash Management service. Now the other part of the question."

The President's Working Group has been studying in conjunction with the SEC various things, but they have not come out. We thought that, that would come out as part of the financial reform regulations, but it hasn't. So this is still another effort. The first blush of the President's working group was very precise on money funds, saying that they were going to do things to ""enhance the resiliency of money funds"". And they are going to keep studying all sorts of different ideas, some of which we, of course, don't like, like variable net asset value and things like that. But we believe that overall, what they did with the 2a-7 rules was an excellent job of putting best practice and enhancing the resiliency of money funds.

And we don't know exactly what the SEC, or the President's working group may have in store for the next round.

And this has to do with the longer dated floating rate securities from Fannie and Freddie that are historically a large portion of those products. If you look at prime money market funds, prime money market funds are also affected by those same weighted average life calculations. But for a larger degree, the prime funds are affected by the 10% and 30% overnight and weekly calculations that are required for liquidity purposes. And then lastly, for the muni [municipal] sectors, the muni money market sector, it's the credit quality changes, the reduction and the amount of second-tier paper that can be used within those products that will cost the amount of change or yield lost in the product going forward. In the current environment where you're still working in an interest rate scenario that's maybe 20 to 80 basis points in range at this point, there's very little change in overall products yield base on any of these issues that I just mentioned or risk mitigation items that have been required by the SEC. Having said that, if you get back into a more normalized short-term environment in the 2% to 3% area, what we we're thinking is, the result of all of these changes across the board in the various products is somewhere in the neighborhood of three-day basis points. And yes, that's a hit when you're looking at something that may have a 1% or 2% or 3% yield. But it's not the end of the world, it's still something that's still allows these products to remain competitive in their marketplace, yet had gone a long way in reducing the overall risk of the product because of these changes."

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets",1242,"Thank you, Ray, and good morning. I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.
Looking first at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets decreased by $12 billion or 4% from the prior quarter. Money market mutual funds decreased by $9 billion. And money market separate accounts decreased by $3 billion, which was due largely to tax seasonality. Money market asset changes are best understood within the context of the unprecedented cycle we are experiencing. Our clients added $182 billion to their money fund balances in '07 and '08. And in '09 and through the end of Q2 here in '10, we've seen about $95 billion blowup. Meaning, by the payments of traction method that we are up $87 billion from the beginning of this cycle. During Q2, we saw our money market fund assets decrease in April due largely to expected tax seasonality. These assets then increased in both May and June, and average assets so far in July are higher than the June 30, period-end level. Growth from clients outside of the U.S. has helped with these results. 
While market conditions continue to be challenging, our clients have remained strong, stable and growing. Our clients have appreciated the strength, the stability and the availability of our products. We remain confident that our Cash Management business is well positioned, and we expect this business to grow over time with higher highs and higher lows during particular cycles. 
We also expect further growth through consolidation. The transaction we announced last week with SunTrust is expected to result in the transition of about $17 billion in money market assets in the Federated money market products during Q4. This is an example of our ability to work successfully with long-term clients, as they make changes in their approach to cash management. And we expect to see more of these arrangements as banks and other organizations are attracted to our long-term commitment to this business and our long-term record of providing high-quality products and service that they can rely on for their clients.
Turning to money market fund yield waivers. Q2 saw some relief in the impact from these waivers. As we expected, repo rates moved into the upper portion of the 0 to 25 basis point target range. In addition, LIBOR rates further increased reflecting market conditions that developed following uncertainty in Europe. This helped to decrease the waivers more than anticipated. We expect these waivers to decrease going forward, though at a slower rate than we saw in Q2, and Tom will comment further on these in his remarks. 
Our money market fund share increased in the second quarter to about 8.2%, up from approximately 8.1% at the end of the first quarter. For reference, recall that in '09 and '08, our market share is about 8.5%, up from about 7% in '07 and 5% at the turn of the millennium. As we turn to other products, it is worth noting that in the midst of difficult market conditions in Q2, Federated was able to use this broad product lineup to offer products geared to challenging equity markets. 
A prime example is the set of alternative strategy equity mutual fund products that we have developed featuring the Prudent Bear fund, which we acquired in December of '08. This fund returned just under 10% for the quarter and produced solid growth sales of $573 million and net sales of $212 million. It has surpassed $2 billion in assets, and as of mid-July, had more than doubled in size from the end of 2008. Growth in this product changed quickly with changes in the equity markets. While we stressed to clients that we believe this type of product should be a part of every portfolio, its value becomes most apparent during tough equity markets. 
Other funds with net inflows in Q2 included the InterContinental, Strategic Value, Kaufmann Large Cap and Clover Small Value Fund. With these and other funds, we have a solid equity fund products in growth, value, income, international and alternative. And we believe that these products will be attractive as equity markets improve and flows pickup. 
While overall, equity fund net flows were negative in the second quarter, gross sales year-to-date 2010 were up 16% compared to the same period in 2009. Equity fund flows are positive for the first half of July driven by the Strategic Value and Prudent Bear Fund. Within equity separate accounts, outflows were negative due largely to net redemptions in our SMA products. 
Now looking at bond fund, our sales continue to be solid in the second quarter with gross sales of $3.6 billion and net sales of $310 million. Our total return of bond fund showed another quarter of solid inflows, about $385 million. Ultrashort products however, were slightly negative, about $136 million but have returned to positive here in the early flows of the third quarter. Bond fund flows remained positive in the first two weeks of July. 
Fixed income separate accounts, we had about $1.8 billion in net new funding of institutional accounts in the second quarter. We won another handful of mandates in the second quarter and the early part of Q3 that we expect will fund for approximately $400 million in the mutual funds and separate accounts. We expect to continue to see significant wins in this area given our solid performance over the cycle and higher profile after a series of wins. 
Going back to the first quarter of '09, we've won about 15 institutional fixed income and equity mandate ranging in size up to $1.9 billion. They include core ag, core fixed, some even into our total return government bond fund and Total Return Bond Fund, corporates, short-term governments, short-intermediate governments, MDT small cap and Strategic Value. Certainly, an array of product offerings.
Turning to fund investment performance and looking at the quarter end Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds, 14% of rated assets are in the first or second quartile over the last year; 34%, three years; 77%, five years; 82%, 10 years. For bond assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 28%, one year; 69%, three years; 71% for five years; and 86% for 10 years. Interestingly, 77% of international equity-rated assets are in the top two quartiles for year one; 24%, three years; 72%, five years; and 72% for 10 years.
Taking a look at Morningstar rated funds, 35% of rated equity fund assets are a four- and five-star products as of 6/30, and 82% are three-, four- or five-star products. As of July 21, our managed assets were approximately $338 billion, including $260 billion in money markets, $28 billion in equities and $50 billion in fixed income, which includes our liquidation portfolios. Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $231 billion. So far in July, our money fund assets have ranged between $231 billion and $235 billion and have averaged about $233 billion.
Regarding acquisitions, we continue to conduct an active search for an alliance to further advance our business outside of the United States as an important component of our strategy to expand global distribution. We remain active in looking for consolidation deals, including money market business. As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deals. 
At this point, I would turn it over to Tom to discuss our financials."
383724,109061632,72312,"Federated Investors, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-23-2010",2010-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Federated Hermes, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chris. As expected, we saw less impact from money market fund yield waivers in Q2, and this impacted related revenue and expense items as detailed in the press release. The reduction in operating income from these waivers dropped to $13 million",556,"Thank you, Chris. As expected, we saw less impact from money market fund yield waivers in Q2, and this impacted related revenue and expense items as detailed in the press release. The reduction in operating income from these waivers dropped to $13 million compared to $17.8 million in Q1. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, we expect these waivers to reduce operating income by $11 million to $12 million in the third quarter. We do not expect the impact from waivers to decrease material from this level until the Fed begins to increase interest rates. Debbie will comment on our rate outlook at the end of my comments. 
In terms of sensitivity, we have estimated that a 10 basis point increase in gross money fund yields will decrease waivers by about one-third, and this is essentially what we experienced in the second quarter. Looking forward, we estimate that gaining another 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by another one-third from our current levels, and a 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about two-thirds. We caution that a wide range of outcomes is possible factors that impact these waivers include: yield levels available in the market; changes in assets within the funds; actions by the Fed, Treasury, the SEC and other governmental entities; changes in the expenses of the funds; and our willingness to continue the waivers. 
Looking at operating expenses. The press release detailed by line item the impact of the insurance recovery on the expenses we have booked in earlier periods. Compensation and related expenses decreased from the prior quarter due largely to lower incentive compensation expense, seasonality and payroll taxes and benefit expense and credit from the insurance recovery. Q1 also included a reversal of previously accrued incentive comp expense. We expect Q3 comp expense to be approximately $64 million.
Q2 also saw an impairment charge of $7 million to certain assets from our acquisitions of MDT Advisers in 2006, which became our quantitative equity team. We have approximately $7.5 million in remaining book value in the amortizable assets from this acquisition. 
On the balance sheet, Q2 was the first quarter to include the impact from the $425 million term loan facility put in place on April 9. As we have discussed last quarter, proceeds were used to initially pay existing debt. Net proceeds have been invested in various federated equity and bond fund with additional investments made to see potential new products.
Loan proceeds and availability on our $200 million revolver, as well as earnings in cash flow, are available for general purposes including acquisitions and related continued payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product seeding and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayment. 
We announced last week the definitive agreement reached with SunTrust to acquire the Money Market business, pending approval process, we expect to transition the $17 billion through a series of closings expected to occur during the fourth quarter. Beginning in Q1 2011, we expect to have approximately $0.01 to $0.015 per share to our quarterly earnings. Actual incremental earnings will vary and will depend on asset levels, transitions, waivers, the final valuation for related intangible assets and other factors. 
That completes my comments and I'd like to ask Debbie to give some comments on our rate outlook."

I thought I'd lift maybe a couple of positives and negative for why interest rates should go up and why they should stay where they are. On the positive side of the equation, currently, you have a steeper curve.",362,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I thought I'd lift maybe a couple of positives and negative for why interest rates should go up and why they should stay where they are. On the positive side of the equation, currently, you have a steeper curve. 
That steeper curve has been based on wider spreads as well as expectation on near-term Fed tightening. 
Spreads have remained wider during the quarter and has certain command in July based on some European debt concerns in the marketplace. And that also has caused that steeper curve to be beneficial, especially to our client and government funds. 
Other countries are also tightening. You got Australia, Canada, very close to home, Denmark and others who have been in a tightening mode now for the better part of the last nine months. On the, say, the same side of the equation, you do have a slowdown in a lot of the economic statistics that we've been receiving over the course of last three to four weeks. Notably, those housing and employment with our key statistics on that economic side of the equation has slowed down markedly. You also have had a bit of a mitigation of some of the European debt spread increases that occurred. We get a little bit more news on that front today as the European debt stress test for 91 of the banking institutions are going to be released at noon today. 
Overall, when we process all of these information, we have pushed our tightening expectation from a Fed perspective into the 2011 time period just recently. We think it'll be a first-half event of 2011. We don't think that we will be going into any sort of a double-dipper session, which would push it out even further. But we do think that because of some of the factors that I've listed on the negative side of the equation, this tightening process will not occur in 2010, but will rather start in the 2011 time period with a measured 25 basis point per clip Federal reserve action that will be precipitated by a growth again, a stronger growth in the economic statistics on the marketplace."

The availability for supply is still very good, and it's still out there. Some of the things that have been a little bit challenging over the course of the last several quarters in the repo marketplace has been from a supply perspective, and that is starting to loosen up a little bit also. The potential for the Fed to come into the marketplace and begin reversing some of their collateral back into the market and creating additional supply there, it will be a welcome relief. So there are things that are happening that are mitigating some of what has been supply pressures in the marketplace.

Although that curve is not steepening further, and in fact many have flattened a few basis points at the end of June and beginning into July, when you compare that to what we say -- especially during the month of April, it got better. The seasoning part of the curve occurred mostly in May and June.

So now comes the question of how you structure them in a way that makes sense not to the regulator. Point two is, don't forget that the origin of 12b-1 is in SEC call pass to the industry which, P.S. , we opposed when it came out because it represented using fund assets for distribution. And so now, the challenge is to put the genie back in the bottle, and that is becoming a bit of a challenge. So what we're looking at is how do you preserve legitimate business expenses and charges and add to the SEC's legitimate desire to have transparency, understanding, disclosure on what's going on. So within that context, we're not thinking that it's going to injure our business at this point. Remember that within the context of the overall 12b-1, the first 25 basis points is acceptable to the SEC in that arrangement. I have not read the whole thing yet. When they first came out, we thought it was just a three-page item that they put on their website. But nonetheless, those are some initial looks at it. Next thing is that I think there is going to be a 90-day comment period. And believe me, there are going to be comments on this that I think will accurately and appropriately reflect what is going on legitimately in the marketplace.

We have had longer duration targets in most of 2007, 2008 and even in to those -- to all of them, or most of 2009.

Our expectation is that, that's sort of on hold again at this point. So for now, again, we're still in that neutral phase, but the potential for going a little bit longer given what we think is a longer period of time before the Fed actually starts tightening and the curve has already done part of the job for them, that still is a debatable and discussed item at this point. But right now, we're neutral across all of our products. From a European debt perspective, we own European banks within all of our money funds, taxable, tax-free. They are counterparts to repo within our government funds. So we have exposure to European institutions, banking institutions. None of the sovereigns, but banking institutions across the continent. During the '07 and '08 credit crunch time periods, what we effectively did was shorten the duration on many of those products. So if we had historically been comfortable using one of those names at six months, we tighten it down to three months. If we have historically been comfortable using it at three months, we tighten it down to one month. Over the course of this year, year-to-date 2010, that process has begun to be reversed. And for the institutions that we're dealing with, what we've seen over the course of the last three months in the European debt situation really hasn't changed that. The ones that we're dealing with are very global in nature, they're not the Spanish savings bank. They're not the smaller -- German largest banks. They are the very large global players in the marketplace.

We feel like at this point, there is really a leveling off of assets that there is likely expectation going forward, not only from our perspective but from an industry perspective. If you look at where some of those assets went, they went into some bank deposit-type instruments that with the increase in the yield curve that we've seen over the last quarter had made funds competitive with those products again. And that's why you've seen sort of a leveling off of those asset flows. And the expectation would be that, that will be maintained. Having said that, anytime you go into a rising rate environment which, although we're pushing that out into a 2011 time period, the fact of the matter is we expect it -- we hit no lower from here. So we expect that to occur at some point in the fairly near future. Rising rate environments are definitely accompanied on a cyclical basis with a decline in assets from a money fund perspective just because of the lag in the funds versus the direct market. Having said that, we think a good portion of that has already played itself out. And the $3.9 trillion to two -- the more than $1 trillion have gone out from an industry perspective already. A good portion of what was in there, also at its peak, what I'll call nontraditional money market investors. They fled the markets during a time period in 2008 and early 2009 when they were looking just for Safe Harbor.

We're in the middle of our fourth decade of doing the Money Market Fund business. And one of the reasons that we were willing to do the waivers in the beginning was for our commitment for the long haul. And we think this is still an important thing. And so as long as the math works as I'm about to describe, which it is, we are okay with doing the waivers. And that is that the short-term interest rates cover the core expenses of the fund. And this is just an average kind of a number, but basically, that means the three basis points roughly are third party expenses and the seven basis points at administration in order to keep the functions of the funds alive and well. So if the grow shield on the fund is 10 and those third party expenses are 10, and that is covered, then we are still quite happy to be proceeding with waivers. And that's what happened. And we got close to some of those points in early January when the then Fed funds rates and repo rates were low-single digits, but it didn't last long enough to affect the entire yield on the fund. So now when we have rates that are periodically in the 20s and mostly in the 18s, you can see that those core expenses are covered. So our attitude is such that, given this scenario, we would continue to waive and further from our clients, we get to comment that even if funds are at zero or -- we really have been having the increasing yields here recently, as Debbie mentioned. But even at zero, the clients prefer to have the funds open, evidencing the fact that they're utilized as part of the Cash Management service. Now the other part of the question?"

The President's Working Group has been studying in conjunction with the SEC various things, but they have not come out. We thought that, that would come out as part of the financial reform regulations, but it hasn't. So this is still another effort. The first blush of the President's Working Group was very precise on money funds, saying that they were going to do things to ""enhance the resiliency of money funds"". And they are going to keep studying all sorts of different ideas, some of which we, of course, don't like, like variable net asset value and things like that. But we believe that overall, what they did with the 2a-7 rules was an excellent job of putting best practice and enhancing the resiliency of money funds.

And this has to do with the longer dated floating rate securities from Fannie and Freddie that are historically a large portion of those products. If you look at prime money market funds, prime money market funds are also affected by those same weighted average life calculations. But for a larger degree, the prime funds are affected by the 10% and 30% overnight and weekly calculations that are required for liquidity purposes. And then lastly, for the muni [municipal] sectors, the muni money market sector, it's the credit quality changes, the reduction in the amount of second-tier paper that can be used within those products that will cost the amount of change or yield lost in the product going forward. In the current environment where you're still working in an interest rate scenario that's maybe 20 to 80 basis points in range at this point, there's very little change in overall product yield base on any of these issues that I just mentioned or risk mitigation items that have been required by the SEC. Having said that, if you get back into a more normalized short-term environment, in the 2% to 3% area, what we we're thinking is, the result of all of these changes across the board in the various products is somewhere in the neighborhood of three-day basis points. And yes, that's a hit when you're looking at something that may have a 1% or 2% or 3% yield. But it's not the end of the world, it's something that still allows these products to remain competitive in their marketplace, yet had gone a long way in reducing the overall risk of the products because of these changes."

I will start with a brief review of Federated’s recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.Looking at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets we",739,"Thank you, Ray, and good morning.  I will start with a brief review of Federated’s recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.
Looking at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets were up slightly from the prior quarter as the 11 billion increase from the first phase of conversions from the SunTrust acquisition was largely offset by late quarter decreases in our money fund assets and by expected seasonal decreases in money market separate account assets.  Assets had been fairly stable here in October as our money fund assets have ranged between 229 and 235 billion, and have averaged about 232 billion.  
Through mid-September, money market fund assets were up slightly from the prior quarter.  With the mid-September corporate tax payment date and other redemptions, money market fund assets, excluding the SunTrust acquisition, decreased by about 8 billion with most of this occurring during the last couple weeks of the quarter.
The SunTrust conversions will continue with an additional 3.5 billion expected in the fourth quarter for a deal total of 14.5 billion.  We continue to have active discussions with other money market fund sponsors for these types of arrangements.
The third quarter saw further relief in money fund yield waivers.  Tom will comment on this in his remarks.  We continue to expect that additional relief will not happen until short-term interest rates begin to move up, and Debbie will discuss this part of our rate outlook later.  Our money fund market share at the end of the third quarter was about 8.3%.  
On the regulatory front, the President’s working group report on money market reform options was issued last week.  We were pleased to see that the report noted the important role of money market funds and the role they play in our financial system.  Among the options discussed was the liquidity bank which Federated strongly supports.  
The implementation of the extensive changes recently made by the SEC to Rule 2a-7 continues.  We look forward to working with the regulators and other money market fund providers in our industry to shape any additional measures that further strengthen the resiliency of money funds.
Turning to other products, our equity investment performance generally improved in the quarter, and we believe that we are well-positioned with an array of quality equity fund products to generate excellent sales results.  Our equity mutual fund flows were positive in the third quarter, led by the Strategic Value Dividend Fund and the Prudent Bear Fund.  We also saw positive flows into the Kaufmann Large Cap and Clover Small Value funds.  Our equity gross sales increased 16% from the prior quarter while redemptions declined 14%.  
Looking at results through most of October, equity fund flows have remained positive.  
Within equity separate accounts, outflows were largely due to net redemptions in quant products, mainly our MDT, SMA, and institutional accounts.  
Looking at bond funds, our sales continue to be solid in the third quarter with gross sales of 3.6 billion and net sales of 826 million.  Our total return bond fund showed another quarter of solid inflows, about 374 million.  Ultra-short products were also positive and we saw inflows in our high-yield funds as well.  Bond fund flows are also positive here in October.
In fixed income separate accounts, we had a solid quarter of net inflows of about 280 million, and we expect another 1.1 billion from recent wins, the Fund in Q4 and into 2011.
Turning to investment performance and looking at the quarter-end Lipper rankings for Federated’s equity funds, 58% of rated assets per in the first or second quartile over the last year, 61% over three years, 71% over five years, and 81% over 10 years.  For bond fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 34% for one year, 68% three years, 72% five years, and 81% for 10 years.
As of October 27, our managed assets were approximately 343 billion, including 262 billion in money markets, 30 billion in equity, 51 billion in fixed income, including liquidation portfolios.  Money market mutual fund assets stand at about 234 billion.
Regarding acquisitions, we continue to conduct an active search for an alliance to further advance our business outside the United States as an important component of our strategy to expand global distribution.  We remain active in looking for consolidation deals including the money fund business and other opportunities as the market presents them.  As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deals.
Tom?

Operating income was up by 9.3 million compared to the prior quarter, excluding the second quarter insurance recovery and impairment charges.  Net income on the same basis increased from $0.35 to $0.42 per share, or an increase of 20%.",541,"Thank you, Chris.  Operating income was up by 9.3 million compared to the prior quarter, excluding the second quarter insurance recovery and impairment charges.  Net income on the same basis increased from $0.35 to $0.42 per share, or an increase of 20%.  
Revenue growth from the second quarter was driven by money market funds and fixed income products, and was boosted by an additional day in the third quarter.  We realized 1.3 million in investment performance fees, and the SunTrust acquired assets added about 700,000 of revenues.
As expected, we saw less impact from money market fund yield waivers in Q3 and this impact-related revenue and expense items as detailed in the press release.  The reduction in operating income from these waivers dropped to 11 million compared to 13 million in the second quarter.  Based on current market conditions and asset levels, we expect these waivers to reduce operating income by 11 to 12 million in the fourth quarter.  We do not expect the impact from waivers to change materially from this level until the Fed begins to increase interest rates, and Debbie will talk about that later.
Looking forward, we estimate that gaining another 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about one-third from the current level, and a 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about two-thirds.  We caution that a wide range of outcomes of possible factors that impact these waivers include yield levels available in the market, changes in assets within the fund, actions by the Fed, Treasury, and SEC and other governmental entities, changes in the expenses of the fund, and our willingness to continue the waivers.
Turning to operating expenses, compensation and related expense was down slightly, excluding the 1.5 million insurance recovery recognized in Q2 as we recalibrated our investment compensation expectations for the year.  Distribution expense increased compared to Q2 due to the growth and mix of money market fund assets as well as lower minimum yield waiver impact.  The number of days impacted this line item as well.
The other significant variances in operating expenses were due mainly to the impact of the insurance recovery and impairment charges recorded in the second quarter.
Looking at our balance sheet, cash and marketable securities totaled 316 million at quarter-end.  This, combined with expected additional cash flows from operations and availability under present debt facilities, provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities when they arise, as well as the ability to fund contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product fees and other investments, capital expenditures, and debt repayments.
As Chris mentioned earlier, the SunTrust conversions began in the third quarter, earlier than we originally expected.  We have paid 4.9 million for the initial conversion of the 11 billion that came over in the third quarter.  We expect to complete the conversion in November with 3.5 billion more in assets, brining the total to 14.5 billion.  Based on these assets, we will pay approximately 7 million upfront and will pay an additional approximately 27 million in contingent consideration over the next five years.  Actual contingent payments will, of course, vary based on the asset levels and related revenues.
So before we open the call for questions, let’s hear Debbie’s forecast on rates.

Just to review basically where we were at the end of the last quarter versus today, the yield curve today on money markets is 30 basis points flatter than it was at that point; yet in comparison with the flattish yield curve that we’ve had in the course of the last several years, that was in the first quarter of 2010, it’s much deeper than that.  So it’s not as good as it was at the end of the second quarter but much better than at the end of the first quarter.
Our outlook at this point is for the curve to stay in its current configuration until sometime in the second quarter of so of 2011, at which point we expect economic factors will start to kick in, and allowing the expectations for interest rate rises in the future at that point to start to steepen out the yield curve.  Unfortunately we don’t think that actual movement, however, on that front end of the yield curve, as anchored by the Fed fund rate, will actual start to occur now until the second half—into the second half of 2011.

It seems like they put a lot of options out there.  It’s going to take a lot of discussions, working with the industry, other players in the market to figure out if anything else will change.  You guys have been very vocal on the liquidity bank and also, on the opposite side, on the floating NAVs and capital requirements, and all those are included in there.  I guess two that stick out that are maybe not new but to shed more light on it would be insurance and then, like, a two-tier system.  So I just wanted to get your thoughts on either one of those.

One of the philosophies we have that we share with many others in this industry is that the socialization of credit risk is unwise, and I don’t have to give you a speech on all of the follow-up to that.  And then the cost and expense of it and actually having somebody do it is highly problematic.  So yes, this is an okay discussion but understand that this discussion has gone on since the 70s as people have looked in and out of this question.  And there hasn’t been a solution to date and we’re just not optimistic that that’s what’s going to happen.
On the two-tiered, it’s interesting that our friends in Europe did a similar thing but we don’t think that’s really the way to go.  What they did was said in their rules something called a market money fund that had a variable net asset value, and then something called a short-term money market fund that had a $1 net asset value.  And we just don’t see how that’s going to exactly work.  
I think what you also get from the flavor of the President’s working group is an understanding that if you keep the resiliency of money funds that have been improved under 2a-7 strong, you will be able to attract the money funds into that corral where you can see what’s going on, and the regulators are not really that interested, at least if you read the President’s working group, in having that money switch out into something else that doesn’t have the strength associated with the money funds.
So it’s good that all of these things are discussed back and forth and all of the points are analyzed, but of all of them, we think the lead one coming out of that is, as you mentioned and as we mentioned, the liquidity bank.

And they make that very clear in the President’s working group simply by looking at all the ebbs and flows and positive things that money funds offer into the economy.  So we remain enthusiastic and positive that they’re not going to put any kind of crazy capital requirements on, and we think we are in a pretty good spot with cash and capital.

That’s an important thing to remember.  Next thing is that this is a two-prong proposal.  One is an overall limit to 10, and the other is a by-family limit of two.  And as it stands right now on our book of business, if that were adopted, we’d probably be a net winner.  We’re not aware of any of our clients having more than 2% in our funds right now anyway, so if they go to a big diversification move, we’d probably be net winners; and if at the current level, we don’t see how it affects the clients right now.

In terms of a turnaround, the performance has improved a bit in the most recent quarter but we’ve had a couple years of underperformance and so it’s going to take more than a quarter of better performance to reasonably expect those flows to turn around.  We have seen, though, that customers that stayed with the product understand why the model underperformed in the kind of macro environment that we were in, and they appreciate the fundamental orientation of the model and continue to use it because they believe that ultimately over the long term, that’s where—that that will bring success.  And if you look at the strategies, there are seven of them on the managed account side, and six of the seven continue to outperform versus their benchmarks from inception.  So the long-term record still argues for the model.

Obviously the mutual funds in general and money funds in particular are not on leverage.  Whether there are off balance sheet exposures - well, mutual funds don’t have those.  Whether where sources of credit for low or low income or minority or underserved communities, so that’s not exactly a factor.  Whether we manage the assets or own the assets - that’s a big factor, and obviously in the funds we manage them.  And the degree to which the company is already regulated, it’s already regulated very well by the SEC and this is perhaps, in our mind, one of the most important points because the source of the regulation comes from an entity who is primarily geared toward protecting the shareholders of the funds.  And the Fed’s attitude is to protect a different constituency or a different philosophy, and we think it’s very important that that be maintained.  And there are other factors as well, and so I think that’s where the debate is.  And it’s pretty tough to say where these guys will come out.  I think they have a lot bigger fish to fry, but nonetheless I can’t make a solid prediction.

I think that the liquidity bank does add a feature of strengthening the resiliency of money funds and therefore it should not surprise you that the leading purveyors of money funds, who have been working together on coming up with this, would also speak in favor of it.  It’s because they came together in response to an initial request from the President’s working group to come up with a private feature that would link into the liquidity system.  And so it has a certain beauty, namely that it would be capitalized by the advisors of prime funds, that it would issue securities that would be available to third parties and others, and that it would build up capital; and then at the end of the day after the 30% of cash and funds were used, it could buy high quality securities at amortized cost from funds that were having liquidity challenges, and then have access to the discount window which, of course, would have attendant costs and charges that would make that something you’d just as soon not do, but certainly if you had to do it, you would surely do it.

This is a way to capture that same degree of liquidity provision, doing it ahead of time, number one, and doing it from an industry perspective, number two.  So we think both of those are positive features that could replicate something that was quite a good success story already.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.Looking at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets were",762,"Thank you, Ray, and good morning. I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.
Looking at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets were up slightly from the prior quarter, as the $11 billion increase from the first phase of conversions from the SunTrust acquisition was largely offset by late quarter decreases in our Money Fund assets, and by expected seasonal decreases in money market separate account assets.
The assets have been fairly stable here in our October, as our Money Fund assets have ranged between $229 billion and $235 billion and have averaged about $232 billion.
Through mid-September, money market fund assets were up slightly from the prior quarter. With the mid-September corporate tax payment date and other redemptions, money market fund assets, excluding the SunTrust acquisition, decreased by about $8 billion, with most of this occurring during the last couple of weeks of the quarter.
The SunTrust conversions will continue with an additional $3.5 billion expected in the fourth quarter for a deal total of $14.5 billion. We continue to have active discussions with other money market fund sponsors for these types of arrangements.
The third quarter saw further release in Money Fund yield waivers, Tom will comment on this in his remarks. We continue to expect that additional relief will not happen until short-term interest rates begin to move up, and Debbie will discuss this part of our rate outlook later.
Our Money Fund market share at the end of the third quarter was about 8.3%. On the regulatory front, the President's Working Group report on money market reform options was issued last week. We were pleased to see that the reports noted the important role of money market funds and the role they play in our financial system. Among the options discussed was the liquidity bank, which Federated strongly supports.
The implementation of the extensive changes recently made by the SEC to Rule 2a-7 continue. We look forward to working with the regulators and other money market fund providers in our industry to shape any additional measures that further strengthened the resiliency of Money Funds.
Turning to other products. Our equity investment performance generally improved in the quarter. And we believe that we are well-positioned with an array of quality equity fund products to generate excellent sales results.
Our equity mutual funds close were positive in the third quarter, led by the Strategic Value Dividend Fund and the Prudent Bear Fund. We also saw positive flows into the Kaufmann Large Cap and Clover Small Value Fund. Our equity growth sales increased 16% from the prior quarter, while redemptions declined 14%.
Looking at results through most of October, equity fund close have remained positive.  Within equity separate accounts, outflows were largely due to net redemptions in Quant products, namely our MDT, FMN and institutional accounts.
Looking at Bond Fund. Our sales continue to be solid in the third quarter, with gross sales of $3.6 billion and net sales of $826 million. Our total return Bond Fund showed another quarter of solid inflows, about $374 million. Ultrashort products were also positive, and we saw inflows in our high-yield funds as well.
Bond Fund flows are also positive here in October. In fixed income separate accounts, we had a solid quarter of net inflows of about $280 million, and we expect another $1.1 billion from recent wins in the fund in Q4 and into 2011.
Turning to investment performance and looking at the quarter end of Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds. 58% of rated assets are in the first or second quartile of the last year, 61% over three years, 71% over five years, and 81% over 10 years.
For Bond Fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 34% for one year; 68%, three years; 72%, five years; and 81% for 10 years.
As our October 27, our managed assets were approximately $343 billion, including $262 billion in money markets, $30 billion in equity, $51 billion in fixed income including liquidation portfolios. Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $234 billion.
Regarding acquisitions, we continue to conduct an active search for an alliance to further advance our business outside the United States as an important component of our strategy to expand global distribution. We remain active in looking for consolidation deals, including the Money Fund business, and other opportunities as the market presents them. As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deals.

Operating income was up by $9.3 million compared to the prior quarter, excluding the second quarter insurance recovery and impairment charges. Net income on the same basis increased from $0.35 to $0.42 per share, or an increase of 20%.",562,"Thank you, Chris. Operating income was up by $9.3 million compared to the prior quarter, excluding the second quarter insurance recovery and impairment charges. Net income on the same basis increased from $0.35 to $0.42 per share, or an increase of 20%.
Revenue growth from the second quarter was driven by money market funds and fixed-income products and was boosted by an additional day in the third quarter.  We realized $1.3 million in investment performance fees, and the SunTrust acquired assets added about $700,000 of revenues.
As expected, we saw less impact from money market funds yield waivers in Q3 and its impact related revenue and expense items as detailed in the press release.
The reduction in operating income from these labors dropped to $11 million compared to $13 million in the second quarter. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, we expect these labors to reduce operating income by $11 million to $12 million in the fourth quarter. We do not expect the impact from waivers to change materially from this level until the Fed begins to increase interest rates, and Debbie will talk about that later. 
Looking forward, we estimate that gaining another 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current level, and a 25 basis point increase would reduced the impact by about 2/3.
We caution that a wide range of outcomes is possible. The factors that could impact these waivers include yields, levels available in the market, changes in assets within the funds, actions by the Fed, Treasury and SEC, and other governmental entities, changes in the expense of the funds, and our willingness to continue the waivers.
Turning to operating expenses. Compensation and related expense was down slightly, excluding the $1.5 million insurance recovery recognized in Q2, as we recalibrated our investment compensation expectations for the year.
Distribution expense increased compared to Q2 due to the growth and mix of money market fund assets, as well as lower minimum yield waiver impacts. The number of days impacted this line item as well.  The other significant variances in operating expenses were due mainly to the impact of the insurance recovery and impairment charges recorded in the second quarter.
Looking at our balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities totaled $316 million at quarter end. This, combined with the expected additional cash flows from operations and availability under present debt facilities, provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of that acquisition opportunities when they arise, as well as the ability to fund contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product fees and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments.
As Chris mentioned earlier, the SunTrust conversions began in the third quarter, earlier than we originally expected. We have paid $4.9 million for the initial conversion of the $11 billion that came over in the third quarter. We expect to complete the conversions in November with $3.5 billion more in assets, bringing the total to $14.5 billion.
Based on these assets, we will pay approximately $7 million up front, and we'd pay an additional, approximately $27 million, in contingent consideration over the next five years. Actual contingent payments will, of course, vary based on the asset levels and related revenues.
Now before we open up the call for questions, let's hear Debbie's forecast on rates."

Just to review basically where we were at the end of the last quarter versus today, the yield curve today on money markets is 30 basis points flatter than it was at that point, yet it compares in with flattish little curve that we've had in the course of the last several years, that was in the first quarter of 2010. It's much steeper than that. So it's not as good as it was in the end of the second quarter, but much better than at the end of the first quarter.
Our outlook at this point is for the curve to stay in the current configuration until sometime in the second quarter or so of 2011, at which point, we expect economic factors will start to kick in and allowing the expectations for interest rate rises in the future at that point to start to see a healthy yield curve.
Unfortunately, we don't think that actual movement, however, on that front end of the yield curve is anchored by the Fed funds rate. It will actually start to occur now until the second half into the second half of 2011."

One of the philosophies we have that we share with many others in this industry is that the socialization of credit risk is unwise. And I don't have to give you a speech on all of the follow-ups to that. And then the cost and expense of it, and actually having somebody do it, is highly problematic. So yes, it's an okay discussion, but understand that this discussion has gone on since the 70s, as people have looked in and out of this question, and there hasn't been a solution to date. And we're just not optimistic that that's what's going to happen. On the two-tiered, it's interesting that our friends in Europe did a similar thing, but we don't think that's really the way to go. What they did was, set in their rules, something called a money market fund that had a variable net asset value and then something called a short-term money market fund that had a $1 net asset value. And we just don't see how that's going to exactly work. I think what you'll also get from the flavor of the President's Working Group is an understanding that if you keep the resiliency of money funds that have been improved under [Rule] 2a-7 strong, you will be able to attract the money funds into that corral where you can see what's going on. And the regulators are not really that interested, at least, if you read the President's Working Group, and having that money squish out into something else that doesn't have the strength associated with the money funds. So it's good that all of these things are discussed back and forth and all of the points are analyzed. But of all of them, we think the lead one coming out of that is, as you mentioned and as we mentioned, the liquidity bank."

The net effect of which, economically, kills the business because the capital can't be sustained by the marketplace on the money funds.

Obviously, the mutual funds, in general, and Money Funds, in particular, are not on leverage. Whether they are of balance sheet exposures, well, mutual funds don't have those. Whether we're sources of credit for low or low income or minority or underserved communities, so that's not exactly a factor. Whether we manage the assets or own the assets, that's a big factor, and obviously, in the funds we manage them. And the degree to which the company is already regulated, it's already regulated very well by the SEC. And this is perhaps, in our mind, one of the most important points because the source of the regulation comes from an entity whose primarily geared toward protecting the shareholders of the funds. And the Fed's attitude is to protect a different constituency or a different philosophy. And we think it's very important that, that we maintain, and there are other factors as well. And so I think that's where the debate is, and it's pretty cost to say where these guys will come up. I think they have a lot bigger fish to fry, but nonetheless, I can't make a solid prediction."

It's because they came together in response to an initial request from the President's Working Group to come up with a private feature that would link into the liquidity system. And so, it has a certain beauty, namely, that would be capitalized by the advisers of prime funds that if we'd issue securities that would be available to third parties and others, and that would build up capital, and then in the end of the day, after the 30% of cash and funds were used, it could buy high-quality securities at amortized costs from funds that were having liquidity challenges. And then have access to the discount window, which of course, would have attendant costs and charges that would make that something you just assumed not due.

I will start with a brief review of Federated's recent business performance before turning the call over to Tom to discuss our financials.
Looking at the cash management portion of our business, money market assets were up slightly from the prior quarter, as the $11 billion increase from the first phase of conversions from the SunTrust acquisition was largely offset by late quarter decreases in our Money Fund assets, and by expected seasonal decreases in money market separate account assets.
The assets have been fairly stable here in our October, as our Money Fund assets have ranged between $229 billion and $235 billion and have averaged about $232 billion.
Through mid-September, money market fund assets were up slightly from the prior quarter. With the mid-September corporate tax payment date and other redemptions, money market fund assets, excluding the SunTrust acquisition, decreased by about $8 billion, with most of this occurring during the last couple of weeks of the quarter.
The SunTrust conversions will continue with an additional $3.5 billion expected in the fourth quarter for a deal total of $14.5 billion. We continue to have active discussions with other money market fund sponsors for these types of arrangements.
The third quarter saw further release in Money Fund yield waivers, Tom will comment on this in his remarks. We continue to expect that additional relief will not happen until short-term interest rates begin to move up, and Debbie will discuss this part of our rate outlook later.
Our Money Fund market share at the end of the third quarter was about 8.3%. On the regulatory front, the President's Working Group report on money market reform options was issued last week. We were pleased to see that the reports noted the important role of money market funds and the role they play in our financial system. Among the options discussed was the liquidity bank, which Federated strongly supports.
The implementation of the extensive changes recently made by the SEC to Rule 2a-7 continue. We look forward to working with the regulators and other money market fund providers in our industry to shape any additional measures that further strengthened the resiliency of Money Funds.
Turning to other products. Our equity investment performance generally improved in the quarter. And we believe that we are well-positioned with an array of quality equity fund products to generate excellent sales results.
Our equity mutual funds flows were positive in the third quarter, led by the Strategic Value Dividend Fund and the Prudent Bear Fund. We also saw positive flows into the Kaufmann Large Cap and Clover Small Value Fund. Our equity growth sales increased 16% from the prior quarter, while redemptions declined 14%.
Looking at results through most of October, equity fund flows have remained positive.  Within equity separate accounts, outflows were largely due to net redemptions in Quant products, namely our MDT, FMN and institutional accounts.
Looking at Bond Fund. Our sales continue to be solid in the third quarter, with gross sales of $3.6 billion and net sales of $826 million. Our Total Return Bond Fund showed another quarter of solid inflows, about $374 million. Ultrashort products were also positive, and we saw inflows in our high-yield funds as well.
Bond Fund flows are also positive here in October. In fixed income separate accounts, we had a solid quarter of net inflows of about $280 million, and we expect another $1.1 billion from recent wins in the fund in Q4 and into 2011.
Turning to investment performance and looking at the quarter end of Lipper rankings for Federated's equity funds. 58% of rated assets are in the first or second quartile of the last year, 61% over three years, 71% over five years, and 81% over 10 years.
For Bond Fund assets, the comparable first and second quartile percentages are 34% for one year; 68%, three years; 72%, five years; and 81% for 10 years.
As our October 27, our managed assets were approximately $343 billion, including $262 billion in money markets, $30 billion in equity, $51 billion in fixed income including liquidation portfolios. Money market mutual fund assets stand at about $234 billion.
Regarding acquisitions, we continue to conduct an active search for an alliance to further advance our business outside the United States as an important component of our strategy to expand global distribution. We remain active in looking for consolidation deals, including the Money Fund business, and other opportunities as the market presents them. As always, we cannot predict the probability or timing of any potential deals.

Operating income was up by $9.3 million compared to the prior quarter, excluding the second quarter insurance recovery and impairment charges. Net income on the same basis increased from $0.35 to $0.42 per share, or an increase of 20%.",562,"Thank you, Chris. Operating income was up by $9.3 million compared to the prior quarter, excluding the second quarter insurance recovery and impairment charges. Net income on the same basis increased from $0.35 to $0.42 per share, or an increase of 20%.
Revenue growth from the second quarter was driven by money market funds and fixed-income products and was boosted by an additional day in the third quarter.  We realized $1.3 million in investment performance fees, and the SunTrust acquired assets added about $700,000 of revenues.
As expected, we saw less impact from money market funds yield waivers in Q3 and its impact related revenue and expense items as detailed in the press release.
The reduction in operating income from these labors dropped to $11 million compared to $13 million in the second quarter. Based on current market conditions and asset levels, we expect these labors to reduce operating income by $11 million to $12 million in the fourth quarter. We do not expect the impact from waivers to change materially from this level until the Fed begins to increase interest rates, and Debbie will talk about that later. 
Looking forward, we estimate that gaining another 10 basis points in gross yields will likely reduce the impact of these waivers by about 1/3 from the current level, and a 25 basis point increase would reduce the impact by about 2/3.
We caution that a wide range of outcomes is possible. The factors that could impact these waivers include yields, levels available in the market, changes in assets within the funds, actions by the Fed, Treasury and SEC, and other governmental entities, changes in the expense of the funds, and our willingness to continue the waivers.
Turning to operating expenses. Compensation and related expense was down slightly, excluding the $1.5 million insurance recovery recognized in Q2, as we recalibrated our investment compensation expectations for the year.
Distribution expense increased compared to Q2 due to the growth and mix of money market fund assets, as well as lower minimum yield waiver impacts. The number of days impact this line item as well.  The other significant variances in operating expenses were due mainly to the impact of the insurance recovery and impairment charges recorded in the second quarter.
Looking at our balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities totaled $316 million at quarter end. This, combined with the expected additional cash flows from operations and availability under present debt facilities, provides us with significant liquidity to be able to take advantage of that acquisition opportunities when they arise, as well as the ability to fund contingent payments, share repurchases, dividends, new product fees and other investments, capital expenditures and debt repayments.
As Chris mentioned earlier, the SunTrust conversions began in the third quarter, earlier than we originally expected. We have paid $4.9 million for the initial conversion of the $11 billion that came over in the third quarter. We expect to complete the conversions in November with $3.5 billion more in assets, bringing the total to $14.5 billion.
Based on these assets, we will pay approximately $7 million up front, and we'd pay an additional, approximately $27 million, in contingent consideration over the next five years. Actual contingent payments will, of course, vary based on the asset levels and related revenues.
Now before we open up the call for questions, let's hear Debbie's forecast on rates."

Just to review basically where we were at the end of the last quarter versus today, the yield curve today on money markets is 30 basis points flatter than it was at that point, yet it compares in with flattish little curve that we've had in the course of the last several years, that was in the first quarter of 2010. It's much steeper than that. So it's not as good as it was in the end of the second quarter, but much better than at the end of the first quarter.
Our outlook at this point is for the curve to stay in the current configuration until sometime in the second quarter or so of 2011, at which point, we expect economic factors will start to kick in and allowing the expectations for interest rate rises in the future at that point to start to see a healthy yield curve.
Unfortunately, we don't think that actual movement, however, on that front end of the yield curve is anchored by the Fed funds rate. It will actually start to occur now until the second half into the second half of 2011."

What they did was, set in their rules, something called a money market fund that had a variable net asset value and then something called a short-term money market fund that had a $1.00 net asset value. And we just don't see how that's going to exactly work. I think what you'll also get from the flavor of the President's Working Group is an understanding that if you keep the resiliency of money funds that have been improved under [Rule] 2a-7 strong, you will be able to attract the money funds into that corral where you can see what's going on. And the regulators are not really that interested, at least, if you read the President's Working Group, in having that money squish out into something else that doesn't have the strength associated with the money funds. So it's good that all of these things are discussed back and forth and all of the points are analyzed. But of all of them, we think the lead one coming out of that is, as you mentioned and as we mentioned, the liquidity bank."

In terms of a turnaround, the performances has improved a bit in the most recent quarter. But we've had a couple of years of underperformance, and so it's going to take more than a quarter of better performance to reasonably expect the slows to turnaround. We have seen though those customers that have stayed with the product and understand why the model underperformed in the kind of macro environment that we were in. And they appreciate the fundamental orientation of the model and continue to use it because they believe that all of it, over the long-term, that will bring success.

And I think that the issues will turn on all of those factors which were listed in Dodd-Frank that have to become is considered, like for example, are these entities on leverage or are they not. Obviously, the mutual funds, in general, and Money Funds, in particular, are not on leverage. Whether they are of balance sheet exposures, well, mutual funds don't have those. Whether we're sources of credit for low or low income or minority or underserved communities, so that's not exactly a factor. Whether we manage the assets or own the assets, that's a big factor, and obviously, in the funds we manage them. And the degree to which the company is already regulated, it's already regulated very well by the SEC. And this is perhaps, in our mind, one of the most important points because the source of the regulation comes from an entity whose primarily geared toward protecting the shareholders of the funds. And the Fed's attitude is to protect a different constituency or a different philosophy. And we think it's very important that, that be maintained, and there are other factors as well. And so I think that's where the debate is, and it's pretty cost to say where these guys will come up. I think they have a lot bigger fish to fry, but nonetheless, I can't make a solid prediction."

And therefore, it should not surprise you that the leading purveyors of money funds, who have been working together on coming up with this, would also speak in favor of it. It's because they came together in response to an initial request from the President's Working Group to come up with a private feature that would link into the liquidity system. And so, it has a certain beauty, namely, that would be capitalized by the advisers of prime funds that if we'd issue securities that would be available to third parties and others, and that it would build up capital, and then in the end of the day, after the 30% of cash and funds were used, it could buy high-quality securities at amortized costs from funds that were having liquidity challenges. And then have access to the discount window, which of course, would have attendant costs and charges that would make that something you just assumed not do. But certainly, if you have to do it, you would surely do it. So I think that's how we're looking at it and we think it would be a good addition to the system. And Debbie has a comment as well."
