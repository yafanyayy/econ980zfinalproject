On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising. Thi",1256,"Thank you, and good morning and welcome to our 2009 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising. This morning, I'll provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter and full-year 2009 results along with our priorities as we enter 2010 and Kathy will discuss category results, share recent insights into how our guests are thinking and behaving in this environment and outline initiatives to drive our business forward in 2010. And finally, Doug will provide detail on our 2009 financial results and our 2010 performance outlook. Following Doug's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.As a reminder, we're joined on this call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. We are very pleased with the fourth quarter financial results we announced earlier this morning. Our fourth quarter's earnings per share of $1.24 are well above the expectations we had going into the quarter and these very strong results clearly demonstrate the resilience of our strategy, the effectiveness of our operating model and the power of continued strong execution by our team. Our fourth quarter marketing and merchandising programs generated better-than-expected sales growth, particularly in the holiday season, which combined with continued disciplined inventory management, to deliver outstanding gross margin and profit performance. We also continued to deliver strong productivity in our stores and expense control across the company. When combined, the strength of these fourth quarter results contributed to the highest 2009 full-year Retail segment EBIT in our history, even with a 2.5% decline in comparable store sales for the year. And our Credit Card portfolio generated solid profits in return on investment for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, a notable achievement in light of the challenges faced by many other credit card issuers in 2009.A year ago, we outlined the decisive actions we were taking to manage our business responsibly while staying true to our brand in a very uncertain and challenging environment. I'm pleased that we are able to accomplish both of these objectives in 2009 and as a result, we are entering 2010 in a very strong strategic and financial position.In a year of unprecedented challenges, we turbocharged our commitment to innovation, positioning our business for the long term and ensuring our continued relevance with consumers. We completely reinvented our marketing approach and initiated more merchandising innovation in a single year than I have seen in any of my 30 years with the company. We described a number of these innovations during our January meeting with many of you at Philadelphia, and Kathy will share some additional initiatives today. We believe that collectively, this set of innovations will be a powerful catalyst for future market share growth.In 2009, we set out to remove price as a perceived barrier to shopping at Target and surveys indicate that we've made meaningful progress. Regardless of the economic environment going forward, we'll continue to address the gap between the perception and the reality of our pricing while maintaining our focus on fashion, design and a superior store experience that combine to make Target a unique and valued shopping destination.As we assess the state of both the economy and our business, it's clear that things have meaningfully improved from a year ago. While economic conditions are far from being back to the normal of 2006 and 2007, employment appears to have stabilized, consumer confidence has recovered and credit markets are no longer frozen. And our fourth quarter results show that we are on our game, and that we can generate great results in this economy.Compared to a year ago, our sales trends are much stronger and volatility is much lower, giving us greater confidence in our outlook for 2010 sales and profitability. We expect economic recovery to continue in 2010, but we expect progress to remain slow as consumers face historically high rates of unemployment and lack of access to consumer credit, particularly in light of anticipated effects of the CARD act. Against the backdrop of the external environment, we are confident that Target is in a very strong position. Our broad assortment of need-based food and commodity items helped us to weather the downturn. And as the economy recovers, our unique combination of high-quality, affordably priced home and apparel merchandise is perfectly aligned with today's more frugal consumer mindset. We have a world-class brand, a strong pipeline of merchandising innovation and we've implemented expense disciplines that we'll maintain going forward, even when the economy has fully recovered. With this unique combination of discipline and innovation, we believe we will continue to profitably gain market share from a variety of competitors in 2010.As we contemplate growth in our stores, we've identified four distinct opportunities. In the near term, we're focusing on refreshing our existing store base by incorporating merchandising reinventions across the sales floor including food, home, beauty and electronics and getting high return on general merchandising in Super Target locations in trade areas across the United States. In the longer term, we see potential opportunities to develop a smaller footprint that would allow us to operate in dense urban markets where our brand is strong but where real estate availability prevents us from opening larger stores, and expand beyond the United States potentially into Canada, Mexico or Latin America in a timeframe that is likely three to five years out or even longer.As we previously announced, our primary focus in 2010 is to remodel about 340 stores, far more than in past years. We expect to complete just under 100 of these remodels in the first quarter with the remaining remodels spread roughly equally across the second and third quarters. In addition, we expect to open 13 new stores in 2010, adding about 10 new locations net of closings and relocations. These stores will open in the July and October cycles with no new stores planned for our march cycle this year. We also continue to invest in online and mobile tools to improve the guest experience and drive sales across channels by creating an anywhere, anytime shopping experience for shopping Target guests. As we explore opportunities to invest in our business, we apply the same financial discipline and returns-based approach we have taken in the past. Our prudent management of capital in the environment of the last 18 months provide ample evidence that we do not invest mechanically in growth for its own sake but only when we identify a clear opportunity to strengthen our business, capture market share profitably and create long-term value for our shareholders. Going forward, we will invest without hesitation in initiatives we believe are appropriate from a strategic and financial standpoint.Our ability to balance discipline and innovation is part of our D&A. It allowed us to achieve great financial results in 2009 while positioning us for a stronger 2010. We are confident that if we focus on our guests and stay true to our brand, we will continue to drive meaningful value for our shareholders over time. Now Kathy will provide additional color on our guests' insights research and additional detail on our merchandising and marketing initiatives. Kathy?"

From the beginning of the economic downturn, we were determined to exceed our guests' evolving expectations while remaining firmly committed to our Expect More Pay Less brand promise. I believe our fourth quarter sales and traffic trends validate that we have achieved both of these objectives by delivering on a strategy that continues to resonate with our guests. In addition, these results indicate that consumers are beginning to show signs of cautious optimism. Guest traffic continue to improve in the fourth quarter, up about 2% compared to 2008. Our improving traffic trend is very encouraging, confirming what our guests research has indicated over the last 18 months. As the recession began, guests told us that they were still as loyal to Target as ever, but they were cutting back on discretionary shopping trips and focusing more exclusively on needs-based trips. Today, guests are telling us that they are increasingly confident and are visiting more often and shopping more of the store. Once hesitant and even fearful, they now are taking pride in their newfound financial discipline and their confidence is leading them to add a few more home and apparel items to their basket. This subtle change in guests' behavior has significantly narrowed the sales gap between our Discretionary and Non-discretionary businesses. In fact, the impact of sales mix on fourth-quarter gross margin was a very slight 6 basis points of headwind, much smaller than we've seen over time and less than we expect over the longer term. We're particularly pleased with our performance over the holiday season, which reflects our efforts to better align our marketing and merchandising strategies to drive the business. We surprised our guests with new and enticing merchandise, provided a superior shopping environment and punctuated the experience with fresh marketing. Our breakthrough holiday marketing campaigns in print, TV and online engaged our guests and drove a sense of urgency, generating a mid-single-digit comp for our two-day sale. Our redesigned circular clearly resonated with guests as we saw strong double-digit comps for featured items. And Target.com's Thanksgiving Day online-only sale generated considerable site traffic in more than a 60% sales increase over 2008.Beyond the holiday season, our Merona line continues to lead in women's apparel with guests drawn to great quality, price and design in core and must-have items. In Home, we are seeing improvement in numerous businesses with particular strength in core basic categories and the relaunch of Room Essentials is off to a great start.In addition, some of our best lines including the new Giada De Laurentiis' Kitchen Collection and our reinvented and newly acquired Smith & Hawken line are off to very strong starts. We're also pleased with the results from The Great Save, our warehouse club style event that replaced last year's Home Design event. The guests' response has been extremely positive. Sales for the event were in line with our expectations and much stronger than for the Home Design event last year.We continue to manage inventories conservatively while ensuring that we remain reliably in stock on the commodity items our guests need every day. Disciplined inventory control was a key factor in our strong fourth quarter gross margin and profitability.  In 2010, we'll continue to experience to exercise discipline in our buying decisions while creating contingency plans that will allow us to chase stronger-than-expected sales trends in our discretionary categories when they emerge. It's important to note that while the overall sales environment in 2009 was quite challenging, Target gained market share across the store. And we have plans in place to accelerate that trend in 2010. As Gregg already mentioned, we've driven unprecedented innovation in merchandising over the last year, and we'll see the results of that innovation throughout 2010.In particular, we are excited about the transformational changes you'll see in about 350 new and remodeled Target stores, innovations we covered in depth at last month's financial community meeting. Much of the discussion at that meeting was about the P Fresh food layout and its ability to win the fill-in grocery trip within our general merchandise format, driving trips and sales. But we are equally excited about innovations throughout the store including beauty, where we're creating an environment that's easier for guests to shop, provides opportunities to discover and test the latest products and incorporates lighting and fixtures usually found at upscale beauty retailers; home, where we're making our own brands even more appealing and intuitive to shop by clarifying the assortment, better defining and aligning each style with guests' segments and where we're improving the shopping environment by creating a more open and visually compelling department that features dominant worlds, inspirational signage and more opportunities to actually touch and feel the product; video games, where we're creating a one-of-a-kind experience that is more open, intuitive and informative with games positioned on tethers to provide easy access to game information on the back of the package; electronics, where we're providing our guests with added convenience through a variety of initiatives like TV delivery, installation, set-up and recycling; and Bullseye Mobile Solutions, a full-service cellphone program that's currently in about 100 stores now and set to expand to 800 stores by October; and shoes, where we're providing a more engaging shopping experience with improved sight lines, better impact visibility and greater convenience, accompanied by a simplified operational process that enhances both in stocks and store productivity.As you know, our own brands drive sales, guest loyalty and generate strong gross margins. We continue to focus on strengthening our own brand portfolio and in 2009, we saw great results for Circle [ph] in kids, Merona in women's apparel and up & up in commodities. In 2010, we'll continue to leverage our most powerful brands to telemark cohesive story and deliver clear and compelling value for our guests. In support of the Expect More side of our brand promise in 2010, we have a roster of designer partnerships that is second to none. This spring, we've announced a comprehensive new cookware and food line from Giada De Laurentiis, exciting limited-edition collections from fashion icon, Jean Paul Gaultier and Zac Posen, vibrant spring floral prints from Liberty of London and limited time-only accessory collections from contemporary design stars Cynthia Vincent and Eugenia Kim. Of course, because our guests don't just experience the Target brand in our stores, we need to make sure that we are driving the best aspects of the brand across all environments and channels, so it's clear what we stand for at every touchpoint. Our multimedia approach to communicating with our guests is aimed at connecting with her during all of her discovery, exploration, research and purchase moments.  We'll continue to position Target as the go-to resource for many things in her life while evolving to deliver what she loves, the element of surprise in newly relevant ways. Like our guests, we're proud to have weathered the storm having delivered one of our most profitable years on record. We did this without compromising on our brand, our culture, our quality or the guest experience. We are excited about innovations in store for 2010 and confident that we're in an excellent position to continue to gain market share profitably. If the last year has taught us anything, it's that our ability to be in tune with the guests, nimble in our approach and still disciplined in our execution will serve us well beyond 2009. Now, Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for 2010. Doug?"

In my remarks today, I plan to review our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results, paying particular attention to trends within then year. Then I'll provide a view of our 2010 outlook for both business segments and earnings per share.As you heard from Gregg, our fourth quarter financial performance was well ahead of our expectations, primarily due to stronger-than-expected results in our Retail segment and secondarily, due to favorability in our income tax provision. Our fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.24 represent an increase of more than 50% compared to last year and our full year 2009 EPS of $3.30 is only 1% below the all-time high that we posted in 2007. This is truly remarkable profit performance in light of the economic challenges and top-line pressure we faced over the last two years. Specifically, our comparable store sales in 2009 compounded to a level about 5 percentage points below our 2007 results and comparable store sales in our discretionary categories have declined even more. The combined impact of these factors have the potential to genuinely corrode our profits and returns. But in EPS terms, we were able to offset all but 1% of that pressure through a combination of gross margin rate improvement within categories, thoughtful expense control and prudent investment decisions.Fourth quarter sales exceeded our baseline expectations, and we're particularly strong during the holiday season. As a result, we ended December with very little clearance inventory leading to a sharp decline in January clearance sales compared to a year ago. In other words, within the quarter, we substituted higher sales of full-priced merchandise for lower sales of much less profitable clearance inventory, particularly in January. This form of sales mix experience, combined with the unusually small gross margin rate impact from the more traditional group sales mix that Kathy described earlier, drove strong performance in the quarter. In summary, on a sales gain of just under $700 million, our gross margin improved by more than $500 million.Retail SG&A expenses were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Store productivity remain strong, yet as expected, it improved only slightly over last year due to unusually strong store productivity gains we enjoyed in fourth quarter 2008. Also notable in the fourth quarter was the beneficial impact of the previously disclosed Visa-MasterCard settlement and the adverse impact of higher-than-expected incentive compensation, resulting from our equally higher-than-expected fourth quarter financial performance.Fourth quarter Credit Card segment performance was in line with our expectations. Net write-offs were $293 million, a little more than our bad debt expense. Gross receivables ended the year at just under $8 billion, representing a reduction of $1.1 billion compared to a year ago. On average during the year, we reduced Target's investment in the portfolio by about 32% or $1.3 billion.  Against this sharply lower base of invested capital, our Credit Card segment profit generated a 30% increase in its pretax profit. These two trends combined to produce a near doubling of Credit Card segment pretax ROIC for the year.Now let's turn to our balance sheet and our capital structure. During this call last year, we said that we expected to generate cash flow from operations in excess of $4 billion in 2009, and I expressed the opinion that this would likely be sufficient to fund our capital investments and dividends and pay off our $1.3 billion of maturing debt all through internally-generated funds. Our actual results for the year reflect the generation of just under $6 billion in cash flow from operations, beating our previous record by more than $1 billion. This cash flow result was driven primarily by beating the 2009 First Call EPS estimate of $2.38 in place a year ago by $0.92 per share. Ultimately, this robust cash flow allowed us to achieve all of our original treasury objectives and in addition, it allowed us to fund the early payoff of the $550 million 2010 debt maturity to restart our share repurchase program much earlier than anticipated and to enjoy a $1.3 billion increase in marketable securities at year end.Now, let's turn our attention to our earnings prospects in 2010. I'll do that by reviewing each segment and then touching on a couple of important consolidation matters. In the Retail segment, we expect to generate increases in comparable store sales, perhaps in the range of 2% to 4% for the year, including an expected one percentage point lift from our remodel program. And while our comparisons are easier in the spring than the fall, the remodel impact will grow as the year progresses. We just achieved a 10% EBITDA margin rate in this segment in 2009, nearly a record high performance, driven by actual record high gross margin rate performance. To me, this means that our recipe to grow retail segment EBIT in 2010 and beyond will more likely result from our ability to grow sales while generally preserving our healthy operating margins, than from trying to engineer increases in operating margins from our current levels. In other words, in 2010, we expect to be able to grow retail segment EBIT by a mid-single-digit percentage in line with our total sales growth while generally preserving our strong EBITDA margin rate experience of 2009.To provide some color on prospects by quarter, we first looked at the pattern in 2009 of generally non-recurring matters such as benefits from the Visa-MasterCard settlement and from adjustments to our workers' compensation accruals. We then looked at the year-over-year patterns by quarter of things like incentive compensation, marketing expense and depreciation in start-up expense for our new stores and remodel activity. In 2010, the net of all of this will be a modest year-over-year headwind in each of the first two quarters and a modest tailwind in each of the third and fourth quarters. For example, in the first quarter, the impact of these issues will be between $0.03 and $0.04 per share with the previously-disclosed accelerated depreciation representing the largest driver.In our Credit Card segment, we're entering the year with strong momentum yet what may be the most adverse impact of the anti-stimulative CARD Act will not hit until the fall. At that time, we'll be subject to regulations that will establish limits on late fees. But as of today, we're waiting on the Fed to define those limits. Overall, we expect to be able to produce yet another year of improving ROIC in this segment, although segment profit may be flattish for the year considering the likelihood of continued low double-digit percentage reductions in receivables.As we've previously discussed, we continue to test two separate ideas which could shape the future of this business segment. In one test, we're exploring the idea of returning to issuing cards solely for use in our stores. In another, we're testing a totally different reward structure in two markets, offering guests to use our cards in Kansas City, for example, 5% off on every item, every transaction, everyday. We expect to have more to save about each of these two tests as the year progresses.Beyond our two segments, I'll touch on two other key factors affecting earnings and EPS. We expect our 2010 book effective tax rate to approximate our long-term structural rate, perhaps in the range of 37% to 37.5%. Please remember that about $0.07 of 2009 EPS resulted from fourth quarter discrete matters that temporarily drove this rate well below this range. Separately, we expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase authorization, not just because we can easily afford to do so but rather and most importantly, because we believe it will prove to be a great investment of shareholder capital over time.We expect our 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, reflective of projects we'll complete in 2010 as well as initial spending for our 2011 and 2012 new store programs. Our preliminary expectation is that our 2011 new store program will be in the range of 20 to 30 stores, and lead times will require us to firm up that number over the next six to nine months. We'd love to invest more aggressively in new stores but we think this is likely all the projects that will make sense to pursue in this environment.During the early repayment of the August 2010 debt maturity, the only significant remaining 2010 maturity prior to our seasonal peak is the $900 million public series collateralized by our credit card receivables that's due in October. We don't intend to continue to deleverage our consolidated balance sheet further, so it's likely that we would elect to refinance this amount at some point. We continue to enjoy very efficient access to the debt capital markets in light of our strategy, our balance sheet and our strong investment-grade credit ratings. As is our custom, I'll close with some specific comments on EPS guidance. I feel very good about our momentum and prospects as we enter 2010 with two healthy business segments and an overall balance sheet and cash flow picture that remains very strong. The current First Call median EPS estimate for the year is $3.62 and while the outlook we've laid out today would produce results somewhat lower than $3.62 per share, this figure is clearly within the potential range of achievability. Similarly, the current First Call median EPS estimate for first quarter is $0.76, which would represent about a 10% increase from last year's result of $0.69. Even with our current strong momentum, this growth expectation feel somewhat stronger than the middle-of-the-road outlook, especially in light of the $0.03 to $0.04 headwind in the quarter I discussed earlier. Now, Gregg has a few brief closing remarks."

Something in the range of 20 to 30 basis points in consolidation. Separately, the mixed impact of a normalized set of growth rates, ignoring those remodels in an average year in history has been another 20 or 30 basis points, been a lot more than that for most of the last couple of years. So I think we're starting from an adjusted base that could be down 20, 40, 60 basis points before we talk about margin rate improvements within categories that are opportunities. Net net, we just don't think it's prudent to think that anyone should take last year's all-time record high gross margin rate and believe that the net of these factors would increase in the middle-of-the-road forecast. Certainly, nothing we do will inhibit that from occurring if we can do it while remaining price competitive with Wal-Mart, and while continuing to produce spectacular values for our guests in these more discretionary categories. It could happen, I just wouldn't predict it. I will reiterate that I don't believe the path to prosperity is paved with the idea of enhancing operating margins in our retail segment.

We made a lot of predictions a year ago. Some of them, we ended up well exceeding the predictions we laid out. The forward-looking statements we laid for our Cards segment by and large turned out to be spot-on. We predicted $300 million plus or minus in write-offs in each of the first two quarters, that's exactly what happened.

Thi",1256,"Thank you, and good morning and welcome to our 2009 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising. This morning, I'll provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter and full-year 2009 results along with our priorities as we enter 2010 and Kathy will discuss category results, share recent insights into how our guests are thinking and behaving in this environment and outline initiatives to drive our business forward in 2010. And finally, Doug will provide detail on our 2009 financial results and our 2010 performance outlook. Following Doug's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.As a reminder, we're joined on this call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. We are very pleased with the fourth quarter financial results we announced earlier this morning. Our fourth quarter's earnings per share of $1.24 are well above the expectations we had going into the quarter and these very strong results clearly demonstrate the resilience of our strategy, the effectiveness of our operating model and the power of continued strong execution by our team. Our fourth quarter marketing and merchandising programs generated better-than-expected sales growth, particularly in the holiday season, which combined with continued disciplined inventory management, to deliver outstanding gross margin and profit performance. We also continued to deliver strong productivity in our stores and expense control across the company. When combined, the strength of these fourth quarter results contributed to the highest 2009 full-year Retail segment EBIT in our history, even with a 2.5% decline in comparable store sales for the year. And our Credit Card portfolio generated solid profits in return on investment for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, a notable achievement in light of the challenges faced by many other credit card issuers in 2009.A year ago, we outlined the decisive actions we were taking to manage our business responsibly while staying true to our brand in a very uncertain and challenging environment. I'm pleased that we are able to accomplish both of these objectives in 2009 and as a result, we are entering 2010 in a very strong strategic and financial position.In a year of unprecedented challenges, we turbocharged our commitment to innovation, positioning our business for the long term and ensuring our continued relevance with consumers. We completely reinvented our marketing approach and initiated more merchandising innovation in a single year than I have seen in any of my 30 years with the company. We described a number of these innovations during our January meeting with many of you at Philadelphia, and Kathy will share some additional initiatives today. We believe that collectively, this set of innovations will be a powerful catalyst for future market share growth.In 2009, we set out to remove price as a perceived barrier to shopping at Target and surveys indicate that we've made meaningful progress. Regardless of the economic environment going forward, we'll continue to address the gap between the perception and the reality of our pricing while maintaining our focus on fashion, design and a superior store experience that combine to make Target a unique and valued shopping destination.As we assess the state of both the economy and our business, it's clear that things have meaningfully improved from a year ago. While economic conditions are far from being back to the normal of 2006 and 2007, employment appears to have stabilized, consumer confidence has recovered and credit markets are no longer frozen. And our fourth quarter results show that we are on our game, and that we can generate great results in this economy.Compared to a year ago, our sales trends are much stronger and volatility is much lower, giving us greater confidence in our outlook for 2010 sales and profitability. We expect economic recovery to continue in 2010, but we expect progress to remain slow as consumers face historically high rates of unemployment and lack of access to consumer credit, particularly in light of anticipated effects of the CARD act. Against the backdrop of the external environment, we are confident that Target is in a very strong position. Our broad assortment of need-based food and commodity items helped us to weather the downturn. And as the economy recovers, our unique combination of high-quality, affordably priced home and apparel merchandise is perfectly aligned with today's more frugal consumer mindset. We have a world-class brand, a strong pipeline of merchandising innovation and we've implemented expense disciplines that we'll maintain going forward, even when the economy has fully recovered. With this unique combination of discipline and innovation, we believe we will continue to profitably gain market share from a variety of competitors in 2010.As we contemplate growth in our stores, we've identified four distinct opportunities. In the near term, we're focusing on refreshing our existing store base by incorporating merchandising reinventions across the sales floor including food, home, beauty and electronics and getting high return on general merchandising in Super Target locations in trade areas across the United States. In the longer term, we see potential opportunities to develop a smaller footprint that would allow us to operate in dense urban markets where our brand is strong but where real estate availability prevents us from opening larger stores, and expand beyond the United States potentially into Canada, Mexico or Latin America in a timeframe that is likely three to five years out or even longer.As we previously announced, our primary focus in 2010 is to remodel about 340 stores, far more than in past years. We expect to complete just under 100 of these remodels in the first quarter with the remaining remodels spread roughly equally across the second and third quarters. In addition, we expect to open 13 new stores in 2010, adding about 10 new locations net of closings and relocations. These stores will open in the July and October cycles with no new stores planned for our march cycle this year. We also continue to invest in online and mobile tools to improve the guest experience and drive sales across channels by creating an anywhere, anytime shopping experience for shopping Target guests. As we explore opportunities to invest in our business, we apply the same financial discipline and returns-based approach we have taken in the past. Our prudent management of capital in the environment of the last 18 months provide ample evidence that we do not invest mechanically in growth for its own sake but only when we identify a clear opportunity to strengthen our business, capture market share profitably and create long-term value for our shareholders. Going forward, we will invest without hesitation in initiatives we believe are appropriate from a strategic and financial standpoint.Our ability to balance discipline and innovation is part of our D&A. It allowed us to achieve great financial results in 2009 while positioning us for a stronger 2010. We are confident that if we focus on our guests and stay true to our brand, we will continue to drive meaningful value for our shareholders over time. Now Kathy will provide additional color on our guests' insights research and additional detail on our merchandising and marketing initiatives. Kathy?"

From the beginning of the economic downturn, we were determined to exceed our guests' evolving expectations while remaining firmly committed to our Expect More Pay Less brand promise. I believe our fourth quarter sales and traffic trends validate that we have achieved both of these objectives by delivering on a strategy that continues to resonate with our guests. In addition, these results indicate that consumers are beginning to show signs of cautious optimism. Guest traffic continue to improve in the fourth quarter, up about 2% compared to 2008. Our improving traffic trend is very encouraging, confirming what our guests research has indicated over the last 18 months. As the recession began, guests told us that they were still as loyal to Target as ever, but they were cutting back on discretionary shopping trips and focusing more exclusively on needs-based trips. Today, guests are telling us that they are increasingly confident and are visiting more often and shopping more of the store. Once hesitant and even fearful, they now are taking pride in their newfound financial discipline and their confidence is leading them to add a few more home and apparel items to their basket. This subtle change in guests' behavior has significantly narrowed the sales gap between our Discretionary and Non-discretionary businesses. In fact, the impact of sales mix on fourth-quarter gross margin was a very slight 6 basis points of headwind, much smaller than we've seen over time and less than we expect over the longer term. We're particularly pleased with our performance over the holiday season, which reflects our efforts to better align our marketing and merchandising strategies to drive the business. We surprised our guests with new and enticing merchandise, provided a superior shopping environment and punctuated the experience with fresh marketing. Our breakthrough holiday marketing campaigns in print, TV and online engaged our guests and drove a sense of urgency, generating a mid-single-digit comp for our two-day sale. Our redesigned circular clearly resonated with guests as we saw strong double-digit comps for featured items. And Target.com's Thanksgiving Day online-only sale generated considerable site traffic in more than a 60% sales increase over 2008.Beyond the holiday season, our Merona line continues to lead in women's apparel with guests drawn to great quality, price and design in core and must-have items. In Home, we are seeing improvement in numerous businesses with particular strength in core basic categories and the relaunch of Room Essentials is off to a great start.In addition, some of our best lines including the new Giada De Laurentiis' Kitchen Collection and our reinvented and newly acquired Smith & Hawken line are off to very strong starts. We're also pleased with the results from The Great Save, our warehouse club style event that replaced last year's Home Design event. The guests' response has been extremely positive. Sales for the event were in line with our expectations and much stronger than for the Home Design event last year.We continue to manage inventories conservatively while ensuring that we remain reliably in stock on the commodity items our guests need every day. Disciplined inventory control was a key factor in our strong fourth quarter gross margin and profitability.  In 2010, we'll continue to experience to exercise discipline in our buying decisions while creating contingency plans that will allow us to chase stronger-than-expected sales trends in our discretionary categories when they emerge. It's important to note that while the overall sales environment in 2009 was quite challenging, Target gained market share across the store. And we have plans in place to accelerate that trend in 2010. As Gregg already mentioned, we've driven unprecedented innovation in merchandising over the last year, and we'll see the results of that innovation throughout 2010.In particular, we are excited about the transformational changes you'll see in about 350 new and remodeled Target stores, innovations we covered in depth at last month's financial community meeting. Much of the discussion at that meeting was about the P Fresh food layout and its ability to win the fill-in grocery trip within our general merchandise format, driving trips and sales. But we are equally excited about innovations throughout the store including beauty, where we're creating an environment that's easier for guests to shop, provides opportunities to discover and test the latest products and incorporates lighting and fixtures usually found at upscale beauty retailers; home, where we're making our own brands even more appealing and intuitive to shop by clarifying the assortment, better defining and aligning each style with guests' segments and where we're improving the shopping environment by creating a more open and visually compelling department that features dominant worlds, inspirational signage and more opportunities to actually touch and feel the product; video games, where we're creating a one-of-a-kind experience that is more open, intuitive and informative with games positioned on tethers to provide easy access to game information on the back of the package; electronics, where we're providing our guests with added convenience through a variety of initiatives like TV delivery, installation, set-up and recycling; and Bullseye Mobile Solutions, a full-service cellphone program that's currently in about 100 stores now and set to expand to 800 stores by October; and shoes, where we're providing a more engaging shopping experience with improved sight lines, better impact visibility and greater convenience, accompanied by a simplified operational process that enhances both in stocks and store productivity.As you know, our own brands drive sales, guest loyalty and generate strong gross margins. We continue to focus on strengthening our own brand portfolio and in 2009, we saw great results for Circle [ph] in kids, Merona in women's apparel and up & up in commodities. In 2010, we'll continue to leverage our most powerful brands to telemark cohesive story and deliver clear and compelling value for our guests. In support of the Expect More side of our brand promise in 2010, we have a roster of designer partnerships that is second to none. This spring, we've announced a comprehensive new cookware and food line from Giada De Laurentiis, exciting limited-edition collections from fashion icon, Jean Paul Gaultier and Zac Posen, vibrant spring floral prints from Liberty of London and limited time-only accessory collections from contemporary design stars Cynthia Vincent and Eugenia Kim. Of course, because our guests don't just experience the Target brand in our stores, we need to make sure that we are driving the best aspects of the brand across all environments and channels, so it's clear what we stand for at every touchpoint. Our multimedia approach to communicating with our guests is aimed at connecting with her during all of her discovery, exploration, research and purchase moments.  We'll continue to position Target as the go-to resource for many things in her life while evolving to deliver what she loves, the element of surprise in newly relevant ways. Like our guests, we're proud to have weathered the storm having delivered one of our most profitable years on record. We did this without compromising on our brand, our culture, our quality or the guest experience. We are excited about innovations in store for 2010 and confident that we're in an excellent position to continue to gain market share profitably. If the last year has taught us anything, it's that our ability to be in tune with the guests, nimble in our approach and still disciplined in our execution will serve us well beyond 2009. Now, Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for 2010. Doug?"
174438,97187215,51192,"Target Corp., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2010",2010-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Target Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kathy.

Then I'll provide a view of our 2010 outlook for both business segments and earnings per",1616,"Thanks, Kathy. In my remarks today, I plan to review our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results, paying particular attention to trends within then year. Then I'll provide a view of our 2010 outlook for both business segments and earnings per share.As you heard from Gregg, our fourth quarter financial performance was well ahead of our expectations, primarily due to stronger-than-expected results in our Retail segment and secondarily, due to favorability in our income tax provision. Our fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.24 represent an increase of more than 50% compared to last year and our full year 2009 EPS of $3.30 is only 1% below the all-time high that we posted in 2007. This is truly remarkable profit performance in light of the economic challenges and top-line pressure we faced over the last two years. Specifically, our comparable store sales in 2009 compounded to a level about 5 percentage points below our 2007 results and comparable store sales in our discretionary categories have declined even more. The combined impact of these factors have the potential to genuinely corrode our profits and returns. But in EPS terms, we were able to offset all but 1% of that pressure through a combination of gross margin rate improvement within categories, thoughtful expense control and prudent investment decisions.Fourth quarter sales exceeded our baseline expectations, and we're particularly strong during the holiday season. As a result, we ended December with very little clearance inventory leading to a sharp decline in January clearance sales compared to a year ago. In other words, within the quarter, we substituted higher sales of full-priced merchandise for lower sales of much less profitable clearance inventory, particularly in January. This form of sales mix experience, combined with the unusually small gross margin rate impact from the more traditional group sales mix that Kathy described earlier, drove strong performance in the quarter. In summary, on a sales gain of just under $700 million, our gross margin improved by more than $500 million.Retail SG&A expenses were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Store productivity remain strong, yet as expected, it improved only slightly over last year due to unusually strong store productivity gains we enjoyed in fourth quarter 2008. Also notable in the fourth quarter was the beneficial impact of the previously disclosed Visa-MasterCard settlement and the adverse impact of higher-than-expected incentive compensation, resulting from our equally higher-than-expected fourth quarter financial performance.Fourth quarter Credit Card segment performance was in line with our expectations. Net write-offs were $293 million, a little more than our bad debt expense. Gross receivables ended the year at just under $8 billion, representing a reduction of $1.1 billion compared to a year ago. On average during the year, we reduced Target's investment in the portfolio by about 32% or $1.3 billion.  Against this sharply lower base of invested capital, our Credit Card segment profit generated a 30% increase in its pretax profit. These two trends combined to produce a near doubling of Credit Card segment pretax ROIC for the year.Now let's turn to our balance sheet and our capital structure. During this call last year, we said that we expected to generate cash flow from operations in excess of $4 billion in 2009, and I expressed the opinion that this would likely be sufficient to fund our capital investments and dividends and pay off our $1.3 billion of maturing debt all through internally-generated funds. Our actual results for the year reflect the generation of just under $6 billion in cash flow from operations, beating our previous record by more than $1 billion. This cash flow result was driven primarily by beating the 2009 First Call EPS estimate of $2.38 in place a year ago by $0.92 per share. Ultimately, this robust cash flow allowed us to achieve all of our original treasury objectives and in addition, it allowed us to fund the early payoff of the $550 million 2010 debt maturity to restart our share repurchase program much earlier than anticipated and to enjoy a $1.3 billion increase in marketable securities at year end.Now, let's turn our attention to our earnings prospects in 2010. I'll do that by reviewing each segment and then touching on a couple of important consolidation matters. In the Retail segment, we expect to generate increases in comparable store sales, perhaps in the range of 2% to 4% for the year, including an expected one percentage point lift from our remodel program. And while our comparisons are easier in the spring than the fall, the remodel impact will grow as the year progresses. We just achieved a 10% EBITDA margin rate in this segment in 2009, nearly a record high performance, driven by actual record high gross margin rate performance. To me, this means that our recipe to grow retail segment EBIT in 2010 and beyond will more likely result from our ability to grow sales while generally preserving our healthy operating margins, than from trying to engineer increases in operating margins from our current levels. In other words, in 2010, we expect to be able to grow retail segment EBIT by a mid-single-digit percentage in line with our total sales growth while generally preserving our strong EBITDA margin rate experience of 2009.To provide some color on prospects by quarter, we first looked at the pattern in 2009 of generally non-recurring matters such as benefits from the Visa-MasterCard settlement and from adjustments to our workers' compensation accruals. We then looked at the year-over-year patterns by quarter of things like incentive compensation, marketing expense and depreciation in start-up expense for our new stores and remodel activity. In 2010, the net of all of this will be a modest year-over-year headwind in each of the first two quarters and a modest tailwind in each of the third and fourth quarters. For example, in the first quarter, the impact of these issues will be between $0.03 and $0.04 per share with the previously-disclosed accelerated depreciation representing the largest driver.In our Credit Card segment, we're entering the year with strong momentum yet what may be the most adverse impact of the anti-stimulative CARD Act will not hit until the fall. At that time, we'll be subject to regulations that will establish limits on late fees. But as of today, we're waiting on the Fed to define those limits. Overall, we expect to be able to produce yet another year of improving ROIC in this segment, although segment profit may be flattish for the year considering the likelihood of continued low double-digit percentage reductions in receivables.As we've previously discussed, we continue to test two separate ideas which could shape the future of this business segment. In one test, we're exploring the idea of returning to issuing cards solely for use in our stores. In another, we're testing a totally different reward structure in two markets, offering guests to use our cards in Kansas City, for example, 5% off on every item, every transaction, everyday. We expect to have more to save about each of these two tests as the year progresses.Beyond our two segments, I'll touch on two other key factors affecting earnings and EPS. We expect our 2010 book effective tax rate to approximate our long-term structural rate, perhaps in the range of 37% to 37.5%. Please remember that about $0.07 of 2009 EPS resulted from fourth quarter discrete matters that temporarily drove this rate well below this range. Separately, we expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase authorization, not just because we can easily afford to do so but rather and most importantly, because we believe it will prove to be a great investment of shareholder capital over time.We expect our 2010 capital expenditures to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, reflective of projects we'll complete in 2010 as well as initial spending for our 2011 and 2012 new store programs. Our preliminary expectation is that our 2011 new store program will be in the range of 20 to 30 stores, and lead times will require us to firm up that number over the next six to nine months. We'd love to invest more aggressively in new stores but we think this is likely all the projects that will make sense to pursue in this environment.During the early repayment of the August 2010 debt maturity, the only significant remaining 2010 maturity prior to our seasonal peak is the $900 million public series collateralized by our credit card receivables that's due in October. We don't intend to continue to deleverage our consolidated balance sheet further, so it's likely that we would elect to refinance this amount at some point. We continue to enjoy very efficient access to the debt capital markets in light of our strategy, our balance sheet and our strong investment-grade credit ratings. As is our custom, I'll close with some specific comments on EPS guidance. I feel very good about our momentum and prospects as we enter 2010 with two healthy business segments and an overall balance sheet and cash flow picture that remains very strong. The current First Call median EPS estimate for the year is $3.62 and while the outlook we've laid out today would produce results somewhat lower than $3.62 per share, this figure is clearly within the potential range of achievability. Similarly, the current First Call median EPS estimate for first quarter is $0.76, which would represent about a 10% increase from last year's result of $0.69. Even with our current strong momentum, this growth expectation feel somewhat stronger than the middle-of-the-road outlook, especially in light of the $0.03 to $0.04 headwind in the quarter I discussed earlier. Now, Gregg has a few brief closing remarks."

I think the question is at what replacement rate will our activity moving forward create bad debt expense? So it isn't really a drawdown, that is the net of two very different activities. The reserve is appropriately sized for the risks we have today. Separately, the portfolio continues to decline at a double-digit percentage year-over-year and therefore, the bad debt expense moving forward will certainly have a component of reduction due to the fact that the portfolio is shrinking. Separately, I think that the risks in the replacement receivables we're putting on the books are likely much lower. So net net, yes, that does mean that the reserve is very likely to be reduced during the year, and we'll stay in touch quarter-by-quarter in terms of the outlook.

Something in the range of 20 to 30 basis points in consolidation. Separately, the mixed impact of a normalized set of growth rates, ignoring those remodels in an average year in history has been another 20 or 30 basis points, been a lot more than that for most of the last couple of years. So I think we're starting from an adjusted base that could be down 20, 40, 60 basis points before we talk about margin rate improvements within categories that are opportunities. Net net, we just don't think it's prudent to think that anyone should take last year's all-time record high gross margin rate and believe that the net of these factors would increase in the middle-of-the-road forecast. Certainly, nothing we do will inhibit that from occurring if we can do it while remaining price competitive with Wal-Mart, and while continuing to produce spectacular values for our guests in these more discretionary categories. It could happen, I just wouldn't predict it. I will reiterate that I don't believe the path to prosperity is paved with the idea of enhancing operating margins in our retail segment. I firmly believe that we'll get there by rejuvenating our topline performance while preserving our very strong margin rate structure, top to bottom."

Actually, one of the things that is a headwind, not a tailwind is the combined impact of remodel startup, new store startup and accelerated depreciation due to the remodels.

We made a lot of predictions a year ago. Some of them, we ended up well exceeding the predictions we laid out. The forward-looking statements we laid for our Cards segment by and large turned out to be spot-on. We predicted $300 million plus or minus in write-offs in each of the first two quarters, that's exactly what happened. We predicted a little less than that in Q3, that's exactly what happened due to a little bit of an echo of expected write-offs from a terms changed in May.

This morn",1113,"Good morning and welcome to Target’s 2010 first quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising. 
This morning I will provide a high-level overview of our first quarter results. Then Kathy will discuss category results, share recent guest insights, and outline upcoming merchandising initiatives, and finally Doug will provide detail on our first quarter financial results, and our outlook for upcoming quarters. Following Doug’s remarks, we’ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. 
As a reminder we're joined on this call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via web cast. Following this conference call John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. 
Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.
Earlier this morning we announced that our first quarter earnings per share rose 30% from a year ago to $0.90, well above our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. As we previously indicated this performance is the highest quarterly EPS in our history, other than a fourth quarter and we are extremely pleased with the effectiveness of our strategy and proud of the superb execution by our team.
Our comparable store sales increased 2.8% in the quarter reflecting the right combination of fashion and basic merchandise at outstanding prices, compelling presentation and in stocks, and outstanding services by stores’ teams. 
This is the largest comparable store sales increase in 10 quarters and represents a meaningful improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009. Comparable store transactions were up more than 2% for the quarter. When guests visited our stores stronger than expected demand for categories like apparel made their trips more profitable, as the items in their baskets represented a healthy gross margin mix. 
Kathy will provide additional detail on our category performance in a few minutes. In addition to strong gross margin performance, our teams turned in another fantastic quarter on the expense line. Store productivity increased even while guest satisfaction scores continued to improve. 
In our credit card segment, receivables balances continued to decline while profit flowing to Target grew to almost three times last year’s first quarter performance as risk indicators turned more favorable than expected in an improving economy. 
Doug will provide more detail on both our credit card segment performance and our retail segment results later in this call. Clearly the economy and consumer sentiment have improved since their weakest point in 2009, but we believe that both are still somewhat unstable and fragile and will likely continue to experience occasional set backs as the year progresses. 
Persistently high unemployment rates and large deficits at both the state and federal level will continue to create uncertainty and volatility. As a result we continue to be cautious regarding our sales outlook in order to prudently manage our expenses while controlling inventory on mark down sensitive merchandise. 
We take this approach to mitigate our downside risks, while at the same time we work to prepare our teams to move quickly if we see unexpected strength. This is precisely what occurred in the first quarter. 
Our 2010 [P Fresh] remodel program is off to a great start. During the first quarter we completed the renovation of 96 stores in 13 markets with the greatest concentration in the Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, DC metro markets. 
Its important to note that in this quarter alone we remodeled more stores than we typically complete in an entire year. In contrast to P Fresh remodels completed in 2009, which focused primarily on food, this year’s remodels include transformations throughout the store, in home, beauty, electronics, video games and in shoes, starting in July. 
We continuously refine our processes with each set of remodels, leading to reduced guest disruption, shorter construction times, and effective control of remodel expenditures. And while many of these remodels have only just been completed recently the results so far have exceeded our expectations. 
Our guests tell us they love the convenience and experience of the new layout and expanded grocery selection and total store sales lifts have been higher than in last year’s remodels. In addition, we’ve seen some early indication that the changes outside of food are leading to more cross shopping. 
As a result we believe that this initiative will transform our general merchandise stores insuring we remain relevant and deliver a superb shopping experience, while meeting our exceeding a return on investment expectation for capital investments in our stores. 
Looking forward we’ll remodel more than 240 additional stores this year with completions spread roughly equally between the second and third quarters. By the end of the third quarter we expect to have more than 450 general merchandise locations, with the P Fresh assortment and presentation.
And in many of these locations the changes outside of food are so extensive the completed renovations resemble a brand new Target store. As we’ve indicated previously we are on track to open 13 new Target stores in 2010, all in the second and third quarters. 
Net of closings and relocations, these openings will add about 10 locations to the chain. We’re particularly excited about the planned opening of our first Manhattan location in Spanish Harlem this July. 
In our marketing we launched a new campaign this month, Life’s a Moving Target. Leveraging our infinitely flexible expect more pay less brand promise, this new campaign has two important facets; broadcast spots that use story-telling to strengthen the emotional connection with our guests during every stage of their lives, and shorter punctuated humorous spots that suggest items from our roster of trusted brands as solutions for their every day challenges. 
All aspects of this new campaign celebrate the fact that Target is the right destination for all of our guests’ wants and needs at a great value, appropriately balancing both sides of our brand promise. This is an exciting time for Target. Teams throughout the organization are focused on driving innovation, transforming our stores and our merchandise assortments, and enhancing our outstanding guest experience. 
They are focused more than ever on delivering both sides of our expect more pay less brand promise, consistently delighting our guests with great prices and unique merchandise in safe, well designed stores with fast, fun, and friendly service. 
I continue to be proud of this team and the results they deliver every day. Now Kathy will provide detail on our guest insights’ research and additional information on our merchandising initiatives.

While we remain flexible in our tactics, we never strayed from our expect more pay less strategy, our commitment to continuous innovation, and our goal of providing a superior shopping environment with great guest service. 
The dedication and discipline of our teams helped us successfully navigate the depths of the recession and today we’re more committed than ever to delivering a relevant and compelling assortment that surprises guests with its quality and value. 
While the economic environment remains somewhat volatile consumers have become much more confident in their ability to manage their spending and carefully select those discretionary items that satisfy their wants at a value that doesn’t break their budgets. 
To be sure there are many households that continue to feel the direct impact of job loss, and other forms of financial stress resulting from the recession. However a much larger portion of our guests did feel such a direct impact from the recession but instead, became extremely cautious in their buying behavior. 
Those guests paid off debt, created and stuck with budgets, and now they’re feeling optimistic enough to begin putting well-considered discretionary items back into their baskets. Many have begun to indulge in small ways with our discretionary assortment provides the perfect opportunity for them to indulge while feeling smart about the decision.
We are seeing this trend particularly in home and apparel. Guests are starting to buy clothing and accessory items for themselves. Both men and women are freshening up their casual wardrobes, replacing basic work pieces, and picking up new shoes and accessories for spring.
In our home category stagnant real estate markets are driving homeowners to make small, affordable investments in their homes such as updating their bath and bedding with new towels and sheets, or adding excitement and color to their living spaces with new decorative accessories. 
Our guests are demonstrating that their eager to purchase items when the styles and price are right. Across both apparel and home our recent collaboration with Liberty of London was an undisputed success. It launched in mid-March with an offering of more than 300 items across several areas of the store that were the perfect mix of color, print, and spring time optimism. 
Sales of the collection both in store and online were well above expectations and were strong in all categories, with the most popular items in women’s tops and accessories, girl’s dresses, table tops, and storage. 
Our own brands continue to resonate with guests generating loyalty and delivering outstanding value. In the 2009 relaunch of our household commodity brand as up and up has been highly successful and this year we plan to add another 100 items. 
We’re enjoying similar success with the relaunch of Circo, with sales in the infant toddler category up double-digits over last year. In home guests have responded very favorably to the relaunch of both our room essentials and home brand. We’ve better clarified the assortments, provided more clear design esthetic, developed new packaging that highlights the most important benefits and features, and improved the quality of both lines.
Results have been outstanding with the two brands combining for a mid single-digit comparable store sales increase in the first quarter. We continue to pursue innovation at an unprecedented pace. The recession taught us to be even more creative, aggressive, and disciplined in bringing new and profitable items to our guests.
One of the most exciting innovations is our electronics and video games reinvention, which will be in all stores by the end of June. We are turning this area of the store into a cohesive electronics and gaming destination. 
The new TV wall provides a compelling focal point for the department with realistic viewing angles that showcase our quality assortment. Our TV delivery and installation service continues to be enthusiastically received by our guests, both for its convenience and value. 
Positioned right next to electronics the video game category remains one of the highest productivity areas of the store. Our new more welcoming environment, easier game access, better-organized assortment, and enhanced information tools are driving positive guest feedback and enhanced conversion. 
Our guests are also excited that the Amazon Kindle will roll out to all Target stores nationwide on June 6. We’re currently the exclusive bricks and mortar retailer for this popular e-reader which practically flew off the shelves during our 100-store test. 
Guests love this product because its fits their busy lifestyles, allowing them to get all the news and books they want most in one incredibly light, portable, easy to read product. We continue to pursue compelling cross merchandising offerings particularly when they tie into the hottest entertainment releases of the season. 
In toys we’ve created a must see in store destination for guests interested in the latest and greatest theatrical releases like Iron Man 2 and Toy Story 3. This fresh approach to merchandising movie releases creates a store within a store environment with movie related product including toys, clothing, bedding, and video games centralized in a boutique like experience. 
Our commitment to differentiation is as strong as ever. We are excited that Caldrea, the luxurious brand of household products has developed a line that’s now available at Target stores nationwide. The Caldrea Essentials collection is affordably priced, from $5.99 to $19.99, and offers our guests superior cleaning products and candles in luxurious scents for their entire home. 
In fashion our collaboration with red carpet design favorite Zac Posen, launched in late April, with 44 pieces ranging from $16.99 to $200.00. We worked with Zac to create a collection that is fresh and fun reflecting his esthetic, lux fabrics, and modern pop culture. 
Also currently in stores are the fantastic lines from Cynthia Vincent and Eugenia Kim. Cynthia’s limited edition footwear collection launched mid April and will be available until July. Eugenia Kim’s collection of timeless hats is the first of its kind at Target and will be available mid April through the end of June. 
And we’re looking ahead to the back to college and back to school season when Target will be ready with the right assortments at the right price in a compelling and easy to shop environment. This critical season is an important opportunity for us to win the loyalty of our newly independent guests and create life long Target fans. 
We experienced great success even in last year’s challenging environment and anticipate more favorable results this year. We’ll drive this momentum by providing must have items at affordable prices keeping our college guests coming back to Target for all their wants and needs. 
We are also focused on further cross channel innovation including the development of new mobile features and intelligent shopping tools that allow our guests to easily manage their budgets and plan store trips. We are extending our lead in mobile retail with an aggressive roadmap for innovation.
In March we announced that Target is the first retailer with the scanning technology at checkout to the gift card and coupon barcodes on mobile devices in all our stores nationwide. And in April we introduced the ability for guests to create lists and manage registries using their mobile devices. 
At the same time we launched a new feature to the iPhone app that lets guests scan items and search for product availability at other Target locations, access rating reviews, view extended assortments, and add items to a gift registry or list. 
The changes we’ve made in response to the recession have positioned us to perform better in this and any economic environment. We remain focused on the most important factor driving our business, our guests, by delivering the quality and value they crave, the products they want and need, in stores that are clean, well organized and efficient to shop, we will reinforce our standing as their trusted friend in both daily essentials and pleasant surprises. 
Now Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for the second quarter.

As Gregg outlined our first quarter fin",1285,"Thanks Kathy, in my remarks today I plan to review our first quarter results in both business segments, and then I’ll provide my perspective on our outlook for the upcoming quarter and the remainder of the year. 
As Gregg outlined our first quarter financial performance was well ahead of our expectations, as both of our business segments well exceeded their respective profit plans. Beyond a comparison to our own expectations, our consolidated performance was also remarkable in comparison to our past results as our 2010 first quarter EPS of $0.90 was $0.08 higher than our results from continuing operations in any other non-holiday quarter in our history. 
In our retail segment sales increased 5.5% due to a 2.8% increase in comparable store sales and a similar contribution from our new stores. Year over year same store traffic trends were up 2.2% driving about 3/4 of our comparable store sales increase. 
By any historical standard, this is a very healthy traffic trend. Our gross margin rate was 31.3% of sales, half a point above last year’s strong performance and it reflected a new first quarter record. The year over year increase in gross margin was entirely the result of rate increases within categories. 
In other words the impact of sales mix on our gross margin rate was essentially neutral because the pace of sales in our higher margin categories was in line with the pace in lower margin consumable and commodity categories. 
We’ve experienced this kind of sales mix dynamic occasionally in the past, yet it has never lasted for very long because of the essence of our long-term traffic building growth strategy. Retail segment SG&A expenses were 20.6% of sales in the first quarter reflecting 30 basis points of favorable leverage. 
This improvement was primarily the result of continued productivity improvements in our stores. We also recorded all time records in reported first quarter retail segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates as gross margin and expense rates both improved and these improvements more than offset the deleveraging of depreciation and amortization expense. 
In our credit card segment we enjoyed a sharp increase in all of our measures of profitability and returns on capital, as a direct result of a rapid improvement in several key risk metrics. In particular favorable trends in delinquencies give us confidence that the likely future write-off experience resulting from new credit extended in the quarter will be significantly improved from our current write-off experience. 
As you know a few weeks ago we announced that we’ve begun to offer only the Target credit card to qualified applicants, although we will continue to service the five million active Target Visa accounts outstanding today and these accounts will likely continue to make up the vast majority of our receivables portfolio for some time to come. 
We’ve made this decision after reviewing the results of a carefully drawn parallel test in which we learned that in the current environment new credit card guests spend considerably more in our stores when issued a Target credit card as opposed to a Target Visa card.
Separately we continue to measure the results from our Kansas City and San Antonio test markets in which we’re piloting a totally different and greatly simplified credit card rewards program. Incremental sales results remain especially intriguing in Kansas City. 
The Card Act which became law last year, reduced the number of tools we and other card issuers formally used to differentiate pricing to accommodate lending to different pools of borrowers with varying risk characteristics. Of course this has had the direct impact of reducing the availability of credit to American households. 
Yet another layer of new restrictions from this Act take effect this August which will reduce our late fee income from that point forward. For reference, late fees contributed a little over three percentage points of annualized pre-tax yield in our portfolio in the quarter. 
Turning to briefly to generation and application of cash, in the first quarter we generated nearly $1.2 billion from our operating activities, up about 16% from last year’s first quarter. Together with $1.6 billion of marketable securities on hand at the beginning of the period, we applied these combined resources during the quarter to retire about $1.2 billion of debt, to invest a little more than $400 million of capital to grow our core business and to invest just under $400 million in our ongoing share repurchase program.
At the end of the quarter we continued to have about a billion dollars of immediate liquidity on hand. Now let’s discuss our prospects for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. Our sales results so far in May are running somewhat behind our expectations for a low to mid single-digit increase.
Through two weeks we’re essentially flat to last year yet we do not believe this two weeks sales performance will hinder our ability to generate comparable store sales in the 2% to 4% range in the second quarter and in the fall season as well. 
On the gross margin line, we expect to return to some moderate rate pressures as the year progresses as we expect to experience a more typical impact of sales mix than we enjoyed in the first quarter. 
We expect to offset some or all of this gross margin rate issue with continued productivity improvements in our stores, and through other means. Of course quarterly data will naturally reflect more volatility than annual data due to the relative impact of generally non-recurring items, and year over year timing differences. 
Notably in the second quarter we expect a roughly neutral year over year SG&A expense rate due in part to a retiming of marketing expenses within 2010. As a reminder our second quarter results will also reflect an increment of accelerated depreciation due to our 2010 remodel program.
In our credit card segment we expect many of our first quarter trends to carry into future quarters, specifically we expect a continued decline in our receivables portfolio and we expect to sustain meaningful year over year improvement in bad debt expense throughout the remainder of 2010 followed by declining net write-off experience as well. 
This late fee issue I described earlier will offset some of this good news. Final late fee regulations are well, late. I guess that’s because no regulation currently governs the timing of issuance of regulations. The bottom line here is that today we can only estimate the likely impact. As a general rule we think that up to about half of our late fee income is likely to go away and that compares to the $59 million we recorded in the first quarter. 
I have one final comment on financial reporting in this segment before turning to our consolidated outlook, we retired our last remaining publically traded receivables backed securities in the quarter and as a result we will no longer be filing monthly 8-K reports reflecting the performance of our receivables portfolio. 
Since some of you seem to want more frequent than quarterly reporting of credit card risk metrics, we will begin posting on our website a monthly series of our credit card delinquency statistics. Generally we expect to provide this fresh data on the same day we release monthly sales statistics, beginning next month. 
Now let’s spend a moment on our expectations for earnings per share in the upcoming quarter and for the remainder of the year. The current first call medium estimates are $0.91 for the second quarter and $3.81 for the year. Based on our outlook in each of our two business segments these are both reasonable single point estimates for our future performance as of today. 
Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.

If risks unfold during the year, consistent with the significant improvement that we’ve seen here in Q1 then of course that percentage will fall perhaps by a couple of percentage points at the outside. I still expect even under the most rosy outlook that the allowance as a percentage of gross receivables will still be a double-digit percentage by year end. 
Now having said that last year we saw pretty significant improvement in risks early and then the improvement in risks slowed down measurably so I think it’s a bit premature to be thinking about much of a significant change in our allowance as a percent of gross receivables from the current 12.8% figure.

As we rolled into 2010 we are focusing more completely on the entire store. 
So the first two cycles of remodels that we just completed has the destination beauty, has home, has electronics, has video games, and some new visual elements throughout the stores and its in those stores that we’re seeing the improvement in cross shopping. 
Ultimately we’ll go back to those stores that we remodeled last year and we will be adding those elements as well and we would expect to see improvements in cross shopping in those discretionary categories once we complete those elements as well. 
But we’re very encouraged. Now again it’s a little early, we’ve only got 96 stores that we’ve completed in our first recycle this year but we’ve seen a nice bump in those categories as we’ve really focused on improving the experience and the visual impact and presentation in those stores.

It is a virtual certainty in my mind that the vast majority of that benefit would be passed along to consumers, to our guests and customers of all other retailers.

Its also comforting from an analytical standpoint to see that the pace of sales increase seems to be sustained. So we’re not seeing any kind of drop off at all in year over year trends and now we’re of course beyond six months into the test in both Kansas City and San Antonio. 
Certainly we’ll be carefully looking at these results here in the short-term and we will need to decide very soon whether we would want to do something on a much broader scale or alternatively other test markets because of the lead times involved to get something like that launched in time for the holiday season.

They are larger changes and more gondola movement and things like that and so that will happen with the P Fresh remodels so that the store is only disrupted once as they go through that remodel, they’ll do all of the rest of it together.

So it’s a more holistic approach. This is a journey not a sprint. This is something that is going to take many, many years for us to really continue to refine and refine and refine but we’re committed to it. We’ve seen good results from our efforts thus far.
And we believe it’s the appropriate thing to do. As you know you go into, food is very localized so as you go into P Fresh remodels you’ll see a food assortment that varies differently from Texas to San Antonio to Boston and that’s part of that segmentation effort.

At the moment trends in those areas are mixed candidly. Florida certainly has shown signs of stability and the beginnings of potentially of a recovery. The best I can say about some of those other geographies is they’re not nearly as challenged as they were and aren’t deteriorating, but by no means reflecting strength at this point.

On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising. 
This morning, I'll provide a high-level overview of our first quarter results. Then Kathy will discuss category results, share recent guest insights and outline upcoming merchandising initiatives. And finally, Doug will provide detail on our first quarter financial results and our outlook for upcoming quarters. 
Following Doug's remarks, we’ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we are joined in this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow [ph] (16:02) questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risk and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. 
Earlier this morning, we announced that our first-quarter earnings per share rose 30% from a year ago to $0.90, well above our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. As we previously indicated, this performance is the highest quarterly EPS in our history other than our fourth quarter, and we are extremely pleased with the effectiveness of our strategy and proud of the superb execution by our team. 
Our comparable store sales increased 2.8% in the quarter, reflecting the right combination of fashion, basic merchandise at outstanding prices, compelling presentation and in-stocks and outstanding service by stores teams. This is the largest comparable store sales increase in 10 quarters and represents a meaningful improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Comparable store transactions were up more than 2% for the quarter. When guests visited our stores, stronger-than-expected demand for categories like Apparel made their trips more profitable as the items in their baskets represented a healthy gross margin mix. Cathy will provide additional detail on our category performance in a few minutes. 
In addition to strong gross margin performance, our teams turned in another fantastic quarter on the expense line. Store productivity increased even while guest satisfaction scores continued to improve. In our Credit Card segment, receivables balances continued to decline while profit flowing to Target grew to almost three times last year's first-quarter performance as risk indicators turned more favorable than expected in an improving economy. Doug will provide more detail on both our Credit Card segment performance and our Retail segment results later in this call. 
Clearly, the economy and consumer sentiment have improved since their weakest point in 2009, but we believe that both are still somewhat unstable and fragile and will likely continue to experience occasional setbacks as the year progresses. Persistently high unemployment rates and large deficits at both the state and federal level will continue to create uncertainty and volatility. As a result, we continue to be cautious regarding our sales outlook in order to prudently manage our expenses while controlling inventory on markdown-sensitive merchandise. We take this approach to mitigate our downside risks while at the same time we work to prepare our teams to move quickly if we see unexpected strength. This is precisely what occurred in the first quarter. 
Our 2010 P Fresh remodel program is off to a great start. During the first quarter, we completed the renovation of 96 stores in 13 markets, with the greatest concentration in the Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington D.C. metro markets. It's important to note that in this quarter alone, we remodeled more stores than we typically complete in an entire year. 
In contrast to P Fresh remodels completed in 2009, which focused primarily on food, this year's remodels include transformations throughout the store in Home, beauty, electronics, video games and in Shoes starting in July. We continuously refine our processes with each set of remodels, leading to reduced guest disruption, shorter construction times and effective control of remodel expenditures. And while many of these remodels have only just been completed recently, the results so far have exceeded our expectations. Our guests tell us they love the convenience and experience of the new layout and expanded grocery selection, and total store sales lifts have been higher than in last year's remodels. 
In addition, we've seen some early indication that the changes outside of food are leading to more cross-shopping. As a result, we believe that this initiative will transform our general merchandise stores, ensuring we remain relevant and deliver a superb shopping experience while meeting or exceeding our return-on-investment expectations for capital investments in our stores. 
Looking forward, we'll remodel more than 240 additional stores this year, with completions spread roughly equally between the second and third quarters. By the end of the third quarter, we expect to have more than 450 general merchandise locations with the P Fresh assortment and presentation. And in many of these locations, the changes outside of food are so extensive, the completed renovations resemble a brand-new Target store. 
As we've indicated previously, we are on track to open 13 new Target stores in 2010, all in the second and third quarters. Net of [ph] (21:14) closings and relocations, these openings will add about 10 locations to the chain. We're particularly excited about the planned opening of our first Manhattan location in Spanish Harlem this July. 
In our marketing, we launched a new campaign this month: Life’s a Moving Target. Leveraging our infinite flexible Expect More Pay Less brand promise, this new campaign has two important facets: Broadcast spots that use storytelling to strengthen the emotional connection with our guests during every stage of their lives, and shorter, punctuated humorous spots that suggest items from our roster of trusted brands as solutions for their everyday challenges. All aspects of this new campaign celebrate the fact that Target is the right destination for all of our guests' wants and needs at a great value, appropriately balancing both sides of our brand promise. 
This is an exciting time for Target. Teams throughout the organization are focused on driving innovation, transforming our stores and our merchandise assortments and enhancing our outstanding guest experience. They are focused more than ever on delivering both sides of our Expect More Pay Less brand promise, consistently delighting our guests with great prices and unique merchandise in safe, well-designed stores with fast, fun and friendly service. I continue to be proud of this team and the results they deliver every day. 
Now Kathy will provide detail on our guest insights research and additional information on our merchandising initiatives. Kathy?"

As we look back at the first quarter, we are proud that we stayed the course during the past couple of years. While we remain flexible in our tactics, we never strayed from our Expect More Pay Less strategy, our commitment to continuous innovation and our goal of providing a superior shopping environment with great guest service. 
The dedication and discipline of our teams helped us successfully navigate the depths of the recession, and today, we're more committed than ever to delivering a relevant and compelling assortment that surprises guests with its quality and value. 
While the economic environment remains somewhat volatile, consumers have become much more confident in their ability to manage their spending and carefully select those Discretionary items that satisfy their wants at a value that doesn't break their budget. To be sure, there are many households that continue to feel the direct impact of job loss and other forms of financial stress resulting from the recession. 
However, a much larger portion of our guests did not feel such a direct impact from the recession but, instead, became extremely cautious in their buying behavior. Those guests paid off debts, created and stuck with budgets, and now they’re feeling optimistic enough to begin putting well-considered Discretionary items back into their baskets. Many have begun to indulge in small ways with our Discretionary assortment provides the perfect opportunity for them to indulge while feeling smart about the decision. 
We are seeing this trend particularly in Home and Apparel. Guests are starting to buy clothing and accessory items for themselves. Both men and women are freshening up their casual wardrobes, replacing basic work pieces and picking up new shoes and accessories for spring. 
In our Home category, stagnant real estate markets are driving homeowners to make small affordable investments in their homes, such as updating their bath and bedding with new towels and sheets or adding excitement and color to their living spaces with new decorative accessories. Our guests are demonstrating that they're eager to purchase items when the style and price are right. 
Across both Apparel and Home, our recent collaboration with Liberty of London was an undisputed success. It launched in mid-March with an offering of more than 300 items across several areas of the store that were the perfect mix of color, print and springtime optimism. Sales of the collection, both in-store and online, were well above expectations and were strong in all categories, with the most popular items in women's tops and accessories, girls’ dresses, tabletop and storage. 
Our own brands continue to resonate with guests, generating loyalty and delivering outstanding value. In the 2009 re-launch of our household commodity brand as up & up has been highly successful and this year we plan to add another 100 items. 
We are enjoying similar success with the re-launch of Circo, with sales in the Infant/Toddler category up double digits over last year. 
In Home, guests have responded very favorably to the re-launch of both our Room Essentials and Home brand. We better clarified the assortments, provided a more clear design aesthetic, developed new packaging that highlights the most important benefits and features and improved the quality of both lines. Results have been outstanding, with the two brands combining for a mid-single-digit comparable-store-sales increase in the first quarter. 
We continue to pursue innovation at an unprecedented pace. The recession has taught us to be even more creative, aggressive and disciplined in bringing new and profitable items to our guests. One of the most exciting innovations is our Electronics and Video Games reinvention, which will be in all stores by the end of June. We are turning this area of the store into a cohesive electronics and gaming destination. The new TV wall provides a compelling focal point for the department, with realistic viewing angles that showcase our high-quality assortment. Our TV delivery and installation service continues to be enthusiastically received by our guests, both for its convenience and value. Positioned right next to electronics, the video game category remains one of the highest-productivity areas of the store. Our new, more welcoming environment, easier game access, better-organized assortment and enhanced information tools are driving positive guest feedback and enhance conversion. 
Our guests are also excited that the Amazon Kindle will roll out to all Target stores nationwide on June 6. We're currently the exclusive bricks-and-mortar retailer for this popular e-reader, which practically flew off the shelves during our 100-store tests. Guests love this product because it fits their busy lifestyles, allowing them to get all the news and books they want most in one incredibly light, portable, easy-to-read product. 
We continue to pursue compelling cross-merchandising offerings, particularly when they tie into the hottest entertainment releases of the season. In Toys, we've created a must-see in-store destination for guests interested in the latest and greatest theatrical releases like Iron Man II and Toy Story 3. This fresh approach to merchandising movie releases creates a store-within-a-store environment, with movie-related product including toys, clothing, bedding and video games centralized in a boutique-like experience. 
Our commitment to differentiation is as strong as ever. We are excited that Caldrea, the luxurious brand of household products, has developed a line that’s now available at Target stores nationwide. The Caldrea Essentials (sic) [Essential] Collection is affordably priced from $5.99 to $19.99 and offers our guests superior cleaning products and candles in luxurious scents for their entire home. 
In Fashion, our collaboration with red carpet design favorite, Zac Posen, launched in late April with 44 pieces ranging from $16.99 to $200. We worked with Zac to create a collection that is fresh and fun, reflecting his aesthetic, luxe fabrics and modern pop culture. 
Also currently in stores are the fantastic lines from Cynthia Vincent and Eugenia Kim. Cynthia's limited-edition footwear collection launched mid-April and will be available until July. Eugenia Kim's collection of timeless hats is the first of its kind at Target and will be available mid-April through the end of June. And we're looking ahead to the back-to-college and back-to-school season, when Target will be ready with the right assortments at the right price in a compelling and easy-to-shop environment. This critical season is an important opportunity for us to win the loyalty of our newly independent guests and create lifelong Target fans. 
We experienced great success even in last year's challenging environment and anticipate more favorable results this year. We'll drive this momentum by providing must-have items at affordable prices, keeping our college guests coming back to Target for all their wants and needs. 
We are also focused on further cross-channel innovation, including the development of new mobile features and intelligent shopping tools that allow our guests to easily manage their budgets and plan store trips. We are extending our lead in mobile retail with an aggressive roadmap for innovation. 
In March, we announced that Target is the first retailer with the scanning technology at checkout the [ph] (30:47) gift card and coupon barcodes on mobile devices in all our stores nationwide. And in April, we introduced the ability for guests to create lists and manage registries using their mobile devices. At the same time, we launched a new feature to the iPhone app that lets guests scan items and search for product availability at other Target locations, access rating reviews, view extended assortments and add items to a gift registry or list. 
The changes we’ve made in response to the recession have positioned us to perform better in this and any economic environment. We remain focused on the most important factor driving our business, our guests, by delivering the quality and value they crave, the products they want and need, in stores that are clean, well-organized and efficient to shop. We will reinforce our standing as their trusted friend, in both daily essentials and pleasant surprises. 
Now Doug will provide more detail in our financial performance and expectations for the second quarter. Doug?"

As Gregg outlined, our first quarter fi",1260,"Thanks, Kathy. In my remarks today, I plan to review our first quarter results in both business segments, and then I'll provide my perspective on our outlook for the upcoming quarter and the remainder of the year. 
As Gregg outlined, our first quarter financial performance was well ahead of our expectations, as both of our business segments well exceeded their respective profit plans. Beyond a comparison to our own expectations, our consolidated performance was also remarkable in comparison to our past results, as our 2010 first quarter EPS of $0.90 was $0.08 higher than our results from continuing operations in any other non-holiday quarter in our history. 
In our Retail segment, sales increased 5.5% due to a 2.8% increase in comparable store sales and a similar contribution from our new stores. Year-over-year same-store traffic trends were up 2.2%, driving about three-quarters of our comparable store sales increase. By any historical standard, this is a very healthy traffic trend. 
Our gross margin rate was 31.3% of sales, half a point above last year's strong performance, and it reflected a new first quarter record. The year-over-year increase in gross margin was entirely the result of rate increases within categories. In other words, the impact of sales mix on our gross margin rate was essentially neutral, because the pace of sales in our higher-margin categories was in line with the pace in lower-margin consumable and commodity categories. We've experienced this kind of sales mix dynamic occasionally in the past, yet it has never lasted for very long because of the essence of our long term traffic-building growth strategy. 
Retail segment SG&A expenses were 20.6% of sales in the first quarter, reflecting 30 basis points of favorable leverage. This improvement was primarily the result of continued productivity improvements in our stores. We also recorded all-time records and reported first quarter Retail segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates as gross margin and expense rates both improved, and these improvements more than offset the deleveraging of depreciation and amortization expense. 
In our Credit Card segment, we enjoyed a sharp increase in all of our measures of profitability and returns on capital, as a direct result of a rapid improvement in several key RiskMetrics. In particular, favorable trends in delinquencies give us confidence that the likely future write-off experience resulting from new credit extended in the quarter will be significantly improved from our current write-off experience. 
As you know, a few weeks ago, we announced that we have begun to offer only the Target Credit Card to qualified applicants, although we will continue to service the 5 million active Target Visa accounts outstanding today, and these accounts will likely continue to make up the vast majority of our receivables portfolio for some time to come. We've made this decision after reviewing the results of a carefully-drawn parallel test in which we learned that in the current environment, new credit card guests spend considerably more in our stores when issued a Target Credit Card as opposed to a Target Visa card. 
Separately, we continue to measure the results from our Kansas City and San Antonio test markets, in which we're piloting a totally different and greatly simplified credit card rewards program. Incremental sales results remain especially intriguing in Kansas City. 
The CARD Act, which became law last year, reduced the number of tools we and other card issuers formerly used to differentiate pricing to accommodate lending to different pools of borrowers with varying risk characteristics. Of course, this has had the direct impact of reducing the availability of credit to American households. Yet another layer of new restrictions from this act take effect this August which will reduce our late fee income from that point forward. For reference, late fees contributed a little over three percentage points of annualized pretax yield in our portfolio in the quarter. 
Turning briefly to generation and application of cash, in the first quarter, we generated nearly $1.2 billion from our operating activities, up about 16% from last year's first quarter. Together with $1.6 billion of marketable securities on hand at the beginning of the period, we applied these combined resources during the quarter to retire about $1.2 billion of debt, to invest a little more than $400 million of capital to grow our core business, and to invest just under $400 million in our ongoing share repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, we continued to have about $1 billion of immediate liquidity on hand. 
Now let's discuss our prospects for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. Our sales results so far in May are running somewhat behind our expectations for a low- to mid-single-digit increase. For [ph] (36:48) two-weeks, we're essentially flat the last year. Yet we do not believe this two-week sales performance will hinder our ability to generate comparable store sales in the 2% to 4% range in the second quarter and in the fall season as well. 
On the gross margin line, we expect to return to some moderate rate pressures as the year progresses as we expect to experience a more typical impact of sales mix than we enjoyed in the first quarter. We expect to offset some or all of this gross margin rate issue with continued productivity improvements in our stores and through other means. Of course, quarterly data will naturally reflect more volatility than annual data due to the relative impact of generally nonrecurring items and year-over-year timing differences. 
Notably in the second quarter, we expect a roughly neutral year-over-year SG&A expense rate due in part to a re-timing of marketing expenses within 2010. As a reminder, our second quarter results will also reflect an increment of accelerated depreciation due to our 2010 remodel program. 
In our Credit Card segment, we expect many of our first quarter trends to carry into future quarters. Specifically, we expect a continued decline in our receivables portfolio and we expect to sustain meaningful year-over-year improvement in bad debt expense throughout the remainder of 2010, followed by declining net write-off experience as well. 
This late fee issue I described earlier will offset some of this good news. Final late fee regulations are, well, late. I guess that's because no regulation currently governs the timing of issuance of regulations. The bottom line here is that today, we can only estimate the likely impact. As a general rule, we think that up to about half of our late fee income is likely to go away, and that compares to the $59 million we recorded in the first quarter. 
I have one final comment on financial reporting in this segment before turning to our consolidated outlook. We retired our last remaining publicly-traded receivables-backed securities in the quarter. And as a result, we will no longer be filing monthly 8-K reports reflecting the performance of our receivables portfolio. Since some of you seem to want more-frequent-than-quarterly reporting of Credit Card RiskMetrics, we will begin posting on our website a monthly series of our Credit Card delinquency statistics. Generally, we expect to provide this fresh data on the same day we release monthly sales statistics beginning next month. 
Now let's spend a moment on our expectations for earnings per share in the upcoming quarter and for the remainder of the year. The current First Call median estimates are $0.91 for the second quarter and $3.81 for the year. Based on our outlook in each of our two business segments, these are both reasonable, single-point estimates for our future performance as of today. 
Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks."

If risks unfold during the year, consistent with the significant improvement that we've seen here in Q1, then, of course, that percentage will fall, perhaps by a couple of percentage points at the outside. I still expect, even under the most rosy outlook, that the allowance as a percentage of gross receivables will still be a double-digit percentage by year end. Now having said that, last year, we saw a pretty significant improvement in risks early. And then the improvement in risks slowed down measurably. So I think it's a bit premature to be thinking about much of a significant change in our allowance as a percent of gross receivables from the current 12.8% figure."

I would say that it's more about guests feeling a little bit more comfortable, putting an extra Discretionary item in their basket. So we're seeing those mixed trips, where they’re buying needs and wants, starting to increase. Your second question about remodels and is there any negative to sales, when we start the remodel, there is a negative impact to sales as we disrupt the stores, but that's being offset by the sales that we’re experiencing once they are set. So there isn't a negative. And in total, all areas are up at our expectation or above, which would include food as well as the others you mentioned like Home and beauty."

In other cases, in older stores, or where we might have an older format or multiple entrances or multiple levels, the extensive nature of that reconstruction is more disruptive, and we'll see a fairly significant dip in the short-term as we really transform that store.

On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising. This morn",1099,"Good morning, and welcome to Target's 2010 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising. 
This morning, I'll provide a high-level overview of our first quarter results. Then Kathy will discuss category results, share recent guest insights and outline upcoming merchandising initiatives. And finally, Doug will provide detail on our first quarter financial results and our outlook for upcoming quarters. Following Doug's remarks, we’ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. 
As a reminder, we are joined in this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risk and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. 
Earlier this morning, we announced that our first quarter earnings per share rose 30% from a year ago to $0.90, well above our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. As we previously indicated, this performance is the highest quarterly EPS in our history other than a fourth quarter, and we are extremely pleased with the effectiveness of our strategy and proud of the superb execution by our team. 
Our comparable store sales increased 2.8% in the quarter, reflecting the right combination of fashion, basic merchandise at outstanding prices, compelling presentation and in-stocks and outstanding service by stores teams. This is the largest comparable store sales increase in 10 quarters and represents a meaningful improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Comparable store transactions were up more than 2% for the quarter. When guests visited our stores, stronger-than-expected demand for categories like Apparel made their trips more profitable as the items in their baskets represented a healthy gross margin mix. Kathy will provide additional detail on our category performance in a few minutes. 
In addition to strong gross margin performance, our teams turned in another fantastic quarter on the expense line. Store productivity increased even while guest satisfaction scores continued to improve. In our Credit Card segment, receivables balances continued to decline while profit flowing to Target grew to almost 3x last year's first quarter performance as risk indicators turned more favorable than expected in an improving economy. Doug will provide more detail on both our Credit Card segment performance and our Retail segment results later in this call. 
Clearly, the economy and consumer sentiment have improved since their weakest point in 2009, but we believe that both are still somewhat unstable and fragile and will likely continue to experience occasional setbacks as the year progresses. Persistently high unemployment rates and large deficits at both the state and federal level will continue to create uncertainty and volatility. As a result, we continue to be cautious regarding our sales outlook in order to prudently manage our expenses while controlling inventory on markdown-sensitive merchandise. We take this approach to mitigate our downside risks while at the same time we work to prepare our teams to move quickly if we see unexpected strength. This is precisely what occurred in the first quarter. 
Our 2010 P Fresh remodel program is off to a great start. During the first quarter, we completed the renovation of 96 stores in 13 markets, with the greatest concentration in the Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington D.C. metro markets. It's important to note that in this quarter alone, we remodeled more stores than we typically complete in an entire year. 
In contrast to P Fresh remodels completed in 2009, which focused primarily on food, this year's remodels include transformations throughout the store in Home, Beauty, Electronics, Video Games and in Shoes starting in July. We continuously refine our processes with each set of remodels, leading to reduced guest disruption, shorter construction times and effective control of remodel expenditures. And while many of these remodels have only just been completed recently, the results so far have exceeded our expectations. Our guests tell us they love the convenience and experience of the new layout and expanded grocery selection, and total store sales lifts have been higher than in last year's remodels. 
In addition, we've seen some early indication that the changes outside of food are leading to more cross-shopping. As a result, we believe that this initiative will transform our general merchandise stores, ensuring we remain relevant and deliver a superb shopping experience while meeting or exceeding our return-on-investment expectations for capital investments in our stores. 
Looking forward, we'll remodel more than 240 additional stores this year, with completions spread roughly equally between the second and third quarters. By the end of the third quarter, we expect to have more than 450 general merchandise locations with the P Fresh assortment and presentation. And in many of these locations, the changes outside of food are so extensive, the completed renovations resemble a brand-new Target store. 
As we've indicated previously, we are on track to open 13 new Target stores in 2010, all in the second and third quarters. Net of closings and relocations, these openings will add about 10 locations to the chain. We're particularly excited about the planned opening of our first Manhattan location in Spanish Harlem this July. 
In our marketing, we launched a new campaign this month: life’s a moving target. Leveraging our infinite flexible Expect More Pay Less brand promise, this new campaign has two important facets: broadcast spots that use storytelling to strengthen the emotional connection with our guests during every stage of their lives, and shorter, punctuated humorous spots that suggest items from our roster of trusted brands as solutions for their everyday challenges. All aspects of this new campaign celebrate the fact that Target is the right destination for all of our guests' wants and needs at a great value, appropriately balancing both sides of our brand promise. 
This is an exciting time for Target. Teams throughout the organization are focused on driving innovation, transforming our stores and our merchandise assortments and enhancing our outstanding guest experience. They are focused more than ever on delivering both sides of our Expect More Pay Less brand promise, consistently delighting our guests with great prices and unique merchandise in safe, well-designed stores with fast, fun and friendly service. I continue to be proud of this team and the results they deliver every day. 
Now Kathy will provide detail on our guest insights research and additional information on our merchandising initiatives. Kathy?"

As we look back at the first quarter, we are proud that we stayed the course during the past couple of years. While we remain flexible in our tactics, we never strayed from our Expect More Pay Less strategy, our commitment to continuous innovation and our goal of providing a superior shopping environment with great guest service. 
The dedication and discipline of our teams helped us successfully navigate the depths of the recession, and today, we're more committed than ever to delivering a relevant and compelling assortment that surprises guests with its quality and value. 
While the economic environment remains somewhat volatile, consumers have become much more confident in their ability to manage their spending and carefully select those Discretionary items that satisfy their wants at a value that doesn't break their budget. To be sure, there are many households that continue to feel the direct impact of job loss and other forms of financial stress resulting from the recession. 
However, a much larger portion of our guests did not feel such a direct impact from the recession but, instead, became extremely cautious in their buying behavior. Those guests paid off debts, created and stuck with budgets, and now they’re feeling optimistic enough to begin putting well-considered Discretionary items back into their baskets. Many have begun to indulge in small ways with our Discretionary assortment provides the perfect opportunity for them to indulge while feeling smart about the decision. 
We are seeing this trend particularly in Home and Apparel. Guests are starting to buy clothing and accessory items for themselves. Both men and women are freshening up their casual wardrobes, replacing basic work pieces and picking up new shoes and accessories for spring. 
In our Home category, stagnant real estate markets are driving homeowners to make small affordable investments in their homes, such as updating their bath and bedding with new towels and sheets or adding excitement and color to their living spaces with new decorative accessories. Our guests are demonstrating that they're eager to purchase items when the style and price are right. 
Across both Apparel and Home, our recent collaboration with Liberty of London was an undisputed success. It launched in mid-March with an offering of more than 300 items across several areas of the store that were the perfect mix of color, print and springtime optimism. Sales of the collection, both in-store and online, were well above expectations and were strong in all categories, with the most popular items in women's tops and accessories, girls’ dresses, tabletop and storage. 
Our own brands continue to resonate with guests, generating loyalty and delivering outstanding value. In the 2009 re-launch of our household commodity brand as up & up has been highly successful and this year we plan to add another 100 items. 
We are enjoying similar success with the re-launch of Circo, with sales in the Infant/Toddler category up double digits over last year. 
In Home, guests have responded very favorably to the re-launch of both our Room Essentials and Home brand. We better clarified the assortments, provided a more clear design aesthetic, developed new packaging that highlights the most important benefits and features and improved the quality of both lines. Results have been outstanding, with the two brands combining for a mid-single-digit comparable-store-sales increase in the first quarter. 
We continue to pursue innovation at an unprecedented pace. The recession has taught us to be even more creative, aggressive and disciplined in bringing new and profitable items to our guests. One of the most exciting innovations is our Electronics and Video Games reinvention, which will be in all stores by the end of June. We are turning this area of the store into a cohesive electronics and gaming destination. The new TV wall provides a compelling focal point for the department, with realistic viewing angles that showcase our high-quality assortment. Our TV delivery and installation service continues to be enthusiastically received by our guests, both for its convenience and value. Positioned right next to electronics, the video game category remains one of the highest-productivity areas of the store. Our new, more welcoming environment, easier game access, better-organized assortment and enhanced information tools are driving positive guest feedback and enhance conversion. 
Our guests are also excited that the Amazon Kindle will roll out to all Target stores nationwide on June 6. We're currently the exclusive bricks-and-mortar retailer for this popular e-reader, which practically flew off the shelves during our 100-store tests. Guests love this product because it fits their busy lifestyles, allowing them to get all the news and books they want most in one incredibly light, portable, easy-to-read product. 
We continue to pursue compelling cross-merchandising offerings, particularly when they tie into the hottest entertainment releases of the season. In Toys, we've created a must-see in-store destination for guests interested in the latest and greatest theatrical releases like Iron Man II and Toy Story 3. This fresh approach to merchandising movie releases creates a store-within-a-store environment, with movie-related product including toys, clothing, bedding and video games centralized in a boutique-like experience. 
Our commitment to differentiation is as strong as ever. We are excited that Caldrea, the luxurious brand of household products, has developed a line that’s now available at Target stores nationwide. The Caldrea Essentials (sic) [Essential] Collection is affordably priced from $5.99 to $19.99 and offers our guests superior cleaning products and candles in luxurious scents for their entire home. 
In Fashion, our collaboration with red carpet design favorite, Zac Posen, launched in late April with 44 pieces ranging from $16.99 to $200. We worked with Zac to create a collection that is fresh and fun, reflecting his aesthetic, luxe fabrics and modern pop culture. 
Also currently in stores are the fantastic lines from Cynthia Vincent and Eugenia Kim. Cynthia's limited-edition footwear collection launched mid-April and will be available until July. Eugenia Kim's collection of timeless hats is the first of its kind at Target and will be available mid-April through the end of June. And we're looking ahead to the back-to-college and back-to-school season, when Target will be ready with the right assortments at the right price in a compelling and easy-to-shop environment. This critical season is an important opportunity for us to win the loyalty of our newly independent guests and create lifelong Target fans. 
We experienced great success even in last year's challenging environment and anticipate more favorable results this year. We'll drive this momentum by providing must-have items at affordable prices, keeping our college guests coming back to Target for all their wants and needs. 
We are also focused on further cross-channel innovation, including the development of new mobile features and intelligent shopping tools that allow our guests to easily manage their budgets and plan store trips. We are extending our lead in mobile retail with an aggressive roadmap for innovation. 
In March, we announced that Target is the first retailer with the scanning technology at checkout with the gift card and coupon barcodes on mobile devices in all our stores nationwide. And in April, we introduced the ability for guests to create lists and manage registries using their mobile devices. At the same time, we launched a new feature to the iPhone app that lets guests scan items and search for product availability at other Target locations, access rating reviews, view extended assortments and add items to a gift registry or list. 
The changes we’ve made in response to the recession have positioned us to perform better in this and any economic environment. We remain focused on the most important factor driving our business: our guests. By delivering the quality and value they crave, the products they want and need, in stores that are clean, well organized and efficient to shop, we will reinforce our standing as their trusted friend, in both daily essentials and pleasant surprises.

In my remarks today, I plan to review our first quarter results in both business segments, and then I'll provide my perspective on our outlook for the upcoming quarter and the remainder of the year. As Gregg outlined, our first quarter fi",1259,"Thanks, Kathy. In my remarks today, I plan to review our first quarter results in both business segments, and then I'll provide my perspective on our outlook for the upcoming quarter and the remainder of the year. 
As Gregg outlined, our first quarter financial performance was well ahead of our expectations, as both of our business segments well exceeded their respective profit plans. Beyond a comparison to our own expectations, our consolidated performance was also remarkable in comparison to our past results, as our 2010 first quarter EPS of $0.90 was $0.08 higher than our results from continuing operations in any other non-holiday quarter in our history. 
In our Retail segment, sales increased 5.5% due to a 2.8% increase in comparable store sales and a similar contribution from our new stores. Year-over-year same-store traffic trends were up 2.2%, driving about three-quarters of our comparable store sales increase. By any historical standard, this is a very healthy traffic trend. 
Our gross margin rate was 31.3% of sales, half a point above last year's strong performance, and it reflected a new first quarter record. The year-over-year increase in gross margin was entirely the result of rate increases within categories. In other words, the impact of sales mix on our gross margin rate was essentially neutral, because the pace of sales in our higher-margin categories was in line with the pace in lower-margin consumable and commodity categories. We've experienced this kind of sales mix dynamic occasionally in the past, yet it has never lasted for very long because of the essence of our long-term traffic-building growth strategy. 
Retail segment SG&A expenses were 20.6% of sales in the first quarter, reflecting 30 basis points of favorable leverage. This improvement was primarily the result of continued productivity improvements in our stores. We also recorded all-time records and reported first quarter Retail segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates as gross margin and expense rates both improved, and these improvements more than offset the deleveraging of depreciation and amortization expense. 
In our Credit Card segment, we enjoyed a sharp increase in all of our measures of profitability and returns on capital, as a direct result of a rapid improvement in several key RiskMetrics. In particular, favorable trends in delinquencies give us confidence that the likely future write-off experience resulting from new credit extended in the quarter will be significantly improved from our current write-off experience. 
As you know, a few weeks ago, we announced that we have begun to offer only the Target Credit Card to qualified applicants, although we will continue to service the 5 million active Target Visa accounts outstanding today, and these accounts will likely continue to make up the vast majority of our receivables portfolio for some time to come. We've made this decision after reviewing the results of a carefully drawn parallel test in which we learned that in the current environment, new credit card guests spend considerably more in our stores when issued a Target Credit Card as opposed to a Target Visa card. 
Separately, we continue to measure the results from our Kansas City and San Antonio test markets, in which we're piloting a totally different and greatly simplified credit card rewards program. Incremental sales results remain especially intriguing in Kansas City. 
The CARD Act, which became law last year, reduced the number of tools we and other card issuers formerly used to differentiate pricing to accommodate lending to different pools of borrowers with varying risk characteristics. Of course, this has had the direct impact of reducing the availability of credit to American households. Yet another layer of new restrictions from this act take effect this August which will reduce our late fee income from that point forward. For reference, late fees contributed a little over three percentage points of annualized pretax yield in our portfolio in the quarter. 
Turning briefly to generation and application of cash. In the first quarter, we generated nearly $1.2 billion from our operating activities, up about 16% from last year's first quarter. Together with $1.6 billion of marketable securities on hand at the beginning of the period, we applied these combined resources during the quarter to retire about $1.2 billion of debt, to invest a little more than $400 million of capital to grow our core business and to invest just under $400 million in our ongoing share repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, we continued to have about $1 billion of immediate liquidity on hand. 
Now let's discuss our prospects for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. Our sales results so far in May are running somewhat behind our expectations for a low- to mid-single-digit increase. Through two-weeks, we're essentially flat the last year. Yet we do not believe this two-week sales performance will hinder our ability to generate comparable store sales in the 2% to 4% range in the second quarter and in the fall season as well. 
On the gross margin line, we expect to return to some moderate rate pressures as the year progresses as we expect to experience a more typical impact of sales mix than we enjoyed in the first quarter. We expect to offset some or all of this gross margin rate issue with continued productivity improvements in our stores and through other means. Of course, quarterly data will naturally reflect more volatility than annual data due to the relative impact of generally nonrecurring items and year-over-year timing differences. 
Notably in the second quarter, we expect a roughly neutral year-over-year SG&A expense rate due in part to a re-timing of marketing expenses within 2010. As a reminder, our second quarter results will also reflect an increment of accelerated depreciation due to our 2010 remodel program. 
In our Credit Card segment, we expect many of our first quarter trends to carry into future quarters. Specifically, we expect a continued decline in our receivables portfolio and we expect to sustain meaningful year-over-year improvement in bad debt expense throughout the remainder of 2010, followed by declining net write-off experience as well. 
This late fee issue I described earlier will offset some of this good news. Final late fee regulations are, well, late. I guess that's because no regulation currently governs the timing of issuance of regulations. The bottom line here is that today, we can only estimate the likely impact. As a general rule, we think that up to about half of our late fee income is likely to go away, and that compares to the $59 million we recorded in the first quarter. 
I have one final comment on financial reporting in this segment before turning to our consolidated outlook. We retired our last remaining publicly traded receivables-backed securities in the quarter. And as a result, we will no longer be filing monthly 8-K reports reflecting the performance of our receivables portfolio. Since some of you seem to want more-frequent-than-quarterly reporting of Credit Card RiskMetrics, we will begin posting on our website a monthly series of our Credit Card delinquency statistics. Generally, we expect to provide this fresh data on the same day we release monthly sales statistics beginning next month. 
Now let's spend a moment on our expectations for earnings per share in the upcoming quarter and for the remainder of the year. The current First Call median estimates are $0.91 for the second quarter and $3.81 for the year. Based on our outlook in each of our two business segments, these are both reasonable, single-point estimates for our future performance as of today. 
Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks."

So essentially, the allowance in the quarter moved directly in line with the reduction in receivables. If risks unfold during the year, consistent with the significant improvement that we've seen here in Q1, then, of course, that percentage will fall, perhaps by a couple of percentage points at the outside. I still expect, even under the most rosy outlook, that the allowance as a percentage of gross receivables will still be a double-digit percentage by year end. Now having said that, last year, we saw a pretty significant improvement in risks early. And then the improvement in risks slowed down measurably.

I think that our expense in P Fresh should be interpreted in that same context."

Given the hotly competitive nature of retailing in the United States, it is a virtual certainty in my mind that the vast majority of that benefit would be passed along to consumers, to our guests and customers of all other retailers. But it's a long way from being a law at this point even though it's a law that makes good sense to me from a public policy standpoint."

On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising.
This morning I will provide a high level overview of our second quarter performance; then Kathee will discuss category results, share recent guest insights and outline upcoming merchandising initiatives; and finally, Doug will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and our outlook for upcoming quarters. Following Doug’s remarks, we’ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we’re joined on this conference call by investors and other who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have.
Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.
We are very pleased with our second quarter financial results, particularly because our team was able to deliver strong profit performance in the face of slightly softer than expected top line sales. Our earnings per share of $0.92 for the quarter was better than we expected and it established another record high for a non-holiday quarter in the company’s history.
Our comparable store sales increased 1.7%, somewhat below our expectation going into the quarter. Healthy traffic trends continued in the second quarter, driving more than 100% of our comparable store sales increase.
While some of that strength was driven by our current remodel program, traffic was quite healthy across the chain, the result of compelling merchandising, innovative marketing, strong store execution and a superior value proposition, the essence of our Expect More Pay Less brand promise. Kathee will provide detail on category performance in a few minutes.
Our teams maintained their disciplined focus on expense control during the quarter, productivity in our stores continues to increase even while our guest survey scores confirm that we’re consistently delivering superior guest service in great looking stores, and because of strong leadership, thoughtful underwriting and superb execution our credit card segment turned in a remarkable second quarter performance, with segment profit up more than 100% over last year.
Looking ahead, teams across the company are preparing for the launch of our exciting new rewards program this October in which guest will began receiving 5% off every day when they use one of our credit cards or the Target debit card. Doug will provide much more detail in a few minutes.
As we consider the economy and the pattern of our sales, it’s clear that the second quarter marked a change in recent trend, following stronger results in the last two quarters, GDP growth softened considerably in the second quarter and our sales trends leveled off as well.
While no one has a clear view of the future, recent results in both our business and the economy reinforce our perspective that the current recovery will be slow and inconsistent. While guests are still cautious, we’re encouraged that we continue to see strong traffic, very healthy sales in discretionary apparel and strong market share gains in virtually all of our frequency categories.
Reflecting our view on the pace of recovery, we continue to take a conservative position with our inventory in seasonal and mark down sensitive categories, preferring that our team is prepared to chase in the even to fan upturn rather than taking excessive risks that would lead to dramatic mark downs in a slower than expected sales environment. As always we remain committed to being in stock in all of our need based categories were mark down risks are negligible.
We opened three new stores in the second quarter, including our first store in Manhattan. We are very excited about the warm welcome we received from the community in and around Spanish Harlem, and we’ve heard from many of you that you’ve already had a chance to see the store in person. We plan to open another 10 stores in the third quarter and after closings and relocations, we expect to add 10 locations this year.
We plan to steadily build from this very elite program in the next few years, adding 20 or more new locations in 2011 and more than 30 in 2012. While we have the appetite, the team and access to capital that would enable our new store base to grow more quickly, we are steadfast in applying a returns based approach to the approval of new stores. These growth expectations reflect our estimate of the number of projects that will meet our investment criteria in the current environment.
In the meantime, we are pleased to invest productively in a refresh of our existing store base, incorporating PFresh food layout, along with improvement in home, beauty, electronics, video games and shoes. We completed another 116 remodels in the second quarter alone. So far this year we’ve remodeled more than 200 stores and have well over 300 PFresh stores operating across the country today.
We continue to make meaningful progress in our ability to execute the remodel process with less disruption for our guests. This quarter we tested an alternative approach with the remodel of our store in Tustin, California. Rather than keeping the store open for a 13-week remodel, we closed it and performed an extreme makeover reopening a brand new store after only five days. While we expect to have only limited opportunities to perform extreme remodels like this one in the future, we learned a lot from the process that we can apply to all of our remodels in the future.
The performance of our remodeled stores continues to meet or exceed the expectations we laid out for you in January in terms of traffic, total sales performance, and the amount of cross-shopping outside of food and the crossover categories, and very importantly we continued to hear directly from our guests that they love the look of their new store and they appreciate the time they save when they can complete their grocery shopping at Target.
At its core our culture is centered on continuous innovation while staying true to our guests and our brands. PFresh and the upcoming 5% rewards program are notable examples of this focus. Both of these initiatives resulted from thoughtful evaluation relying on data, rigorous financial analysis, and consideration of strategic and competitive factors. Obviously, any strategic investment decision creates risks, but moving too slowly creates risks as well.
Just as we all have to consider both risks and opportunity in an investment portfolio, we’ve stress-tested our expectations for both of these strategies and determined that the potential strategic and financial benefits far outweigh the risks.
Now that we’ve made these decisions, we are laser focused on ensuring superb execution to maximize their long-term benefits. I’m proud to lead an organization of highly engaged and motivated team members who are devoted to Target’s success and to creating long-term value for our shareholders.
Now Kathee will provide detail on our guest insights research and additional information on our merchandising and marketing initiatives. Kathee?

At Target fulfilling our Expect More, Pay Less brand promise means we provide our guests the convenience of one stop shopping and the right choices in our well edited unique portfolio of merchandised categories. It means that we achieved the right balance of fashion, newness, and value while delivering a superior guest experience in our stores.
Our ability to fulfill our brand promise has allowed Target to gain market share over time in both healthy and challenging economic environments. Today that promise means more than ever as guest continue to manage their households in an uncertain environment. Without a doubt, consumers have gained confidence and are willing to spend more than a year ago, but they remain cautious about the future and very thoughtful about how then spend their money.
Our strategy and brand promise uniquely positions Target for success in this environment, because we offer guests the right assortment of items across a broad spectrum of categories at fabulous prices. In some cases today, we are seeing guests saving up and splurging on higher ticket items that are meaningful to them. A Kindle for example provides a great value because its thin, light weight and holds lots of books, making it easier to take while traveling. On the other hand, guests are becoming more comfortable purchasing owned brands like up & up where they know they will get the quality of a national brand and pay about 30% less.
During the second quarter our guests were out shopping at Target as evidenced by our strong traffic trends. Sales in food and healthcare continued to grow rapidly while driving store traffic, and guests continued to put a few discretionary items in their baskets when they visited. This led to high single-digit increases in women’s apparel and shoes during the quarter, similar to first quarter trends.
Second quarter sales trends in electronics, videogames, music and movies softened noticeably at Target and elsewhere. While some interpret this trend as a sign that consumers are pulling back on discretionary purchases, we believe it’s also related to product’s lifecycle stages in these categories.
In televisions the industry had to cycle over the digital conversion in the second quarter last year, creating a daunting comparison this year. In addition, videogame hardware platforms are as mature as they’ve ever been and a weaker new release schedule led to softer sales. Looking ahead we believe both of these trends will begin to moderate in the fall as we move beyond the digital conversation and as newness in the videogame category creates interest and spur sales.
As Gregg mentioned earlier, the opening of our Harlem store in New York City was a huge success. We tailored the store’s merchandise assortment to include a generous selection of multi-cultural and urban lifestyle offerings, appropriate items to meet the needs of the community, and earlier this month we launched the Harlem Designer Collection in key stores predominantly on the East Coast and on Target.com.
This diverse partnership features designs from renowned designers, Isabel and Ruben Toledo, Stephen Burrows and chef extraordinaire Marcus Samuelsson. These limited time-only collections span multiple categories and reflects the spirit of Harlem.
We are also very pleased with the performance of the merchandise reinventions incorporated into this year’s remodeled stores. This year’s remodel is build on last year’s success in driving traffic and sales in food and across the store by updating visual elements and transforming categories such as home, beauty, electronics and videogames. As expected, these updates outside of food are leading great cross shopping by our guests.
Beginning in July, our remodels added the transformation of the shoe department. This new destination provides an improved shopping experience for our guests with enhanced site lines, better product visibility and greater guest comfort with additional seating and mirrors. This new shoe experience will be in approximately 260 stores by the end of October.
As I mentioned, many guests are increasingly attracted to our own brands, which provides great value at a great price. To ensure we continue to meet our guests’ high standards, we are creating fewer bigger owned brands throughout the store, up & up and our food owned brands, Market Pantry and Archer Farms, continue to resonate with our guests and sales penetration continues to grow.
Our work in Merona played a key role in driving strong results in ladies apparel this spring and we’re seeing positive results in our efforts to clarify the assortment and aesthetic of Home, Target Home and Room Essentials, positioning us for a successful back-to-college season.
Designer partnerships are important part of our commitment to offering guests access to unique and coveted styles at affordable prices. This fall we’ll share on trend fashions and accessories with our guests through a number of exciting designer partnerships.
Our limited time-only Temple St. Clair for Target jewelry collection will be available later this month through the holidays. The vibrant assortment features 14 carat gold plated brass and cubic zirconium, which fuses rich color into St. Clair’s designs. The Temple St. Clair Collection includes necklaces, cuffs, earrings, rings, and prices range from $30 to $50.
A new John Derian for Target collection for home and office will be available for a limited time beginning September 5. Derian’s new line for Target will feature more than 100 home decor products and office accessories at prices under $25.
Also in September, we’ll launch Tucker for Target. This collection includes women’s apparel and an eclectic mix of Bohemian chic print featuring tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear, and knitwear, and prices ranging from $20 to $80.
In handbags, Target is partnering with the English luxury brand, Mulberry, to launch a limited edition collection for Target. The Target collection features signature Mulberry silhouettes in both prints and interesting textures including Denim, Pink Leopard, Black Velvet and Patent. The collection ranges in price from $15 to $50, and will be available beginning in October.
Tonight Target is taking over the Standard Hotel in New York City to create a brilliant larger than life fashion show debuting Target Fall 2010 collections. Part-fashion show, part-light show the Target Fashion Spectacular will bring the southern façade of the Standard alive.
In 155 rooms, 66 dancers dressed in the latest styles will perform dazzling choreography synchronized with fast paced lighting patterns set to an original music score. A simultaneous presentation will take place at street level. Guests outside of New York will be able to experience this one of a kind event by a live streaming broadcast at Target’s Facebook page.
This back-to-school season Target offers affordable one-stop shopping for students and parents from school supplies and dorm decor to fashionable clothing and the latest gadgets.
New this year is Disney’s D-Signed, a line of apparel and accessories for tween girls. The new collection is based on the fashions worn by Disney channel characters such as Sonny Munroe from Sonny With a Chance and Alex Russo from Wizards of Waverly Place.
For young men we’re introducing style and comfort with the Shaun White Collection of graphic tees, plaid shirts and denim, and new this fall Shaun White’s skate-inspired shoes. And while the season still has a long way to go, initial results for both back-to-school and back-to-college have been encouraging as guest have found the right items and great values when they shop at Target during this important season.
Later in the third quarter for Halloween, we’re offering guests of all ages the chance to experience haunted couture through an exclusive designer partnership with Simon Doonan, creative director of Barneys New York. Simon has created a line of costumers exclusively for Target that reflects his larger than life personality and keen fashion sense. Costume Couture by Simon Doonan for Target will be available for a limited time beginning September 12 at selected Target stores and target.com.
We’re pleased with our results through the first half of 2010. While we prefer a stronger economy and higher levels of consumer spending, we are well positioned to operate profitably in this environment. Inventories are well controlled and we continue to gain market share in categories throughout the store.
Now, Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for the remainder of the year. Doug?

In my remarks today, I plan to review our second quarter and year-to-date results by segment and on an overall basis, and I’ll also provide some color on our outlook for the third and fourth quarters.As Gregg mentioned, on balance we",1362,"Thanks, Kathee. In my remarks today, I plan to review our second quarter and year-to-date results by segment and on an overall basis, and I’ll also provide some color on our outlook for the third and fourth quarters.
As Gregg mentioned, on balance we’re pleased with our second quarter performance as each of our business segments generated strong profitability and cash flow. Our second quarter earnings per share of $0.92 was 17% ahead of last year’s performance and 12% higher than our previous second quarter record of $0.82 achieved in 2008.
In our retail segment, as previously disclosed, our sales grew at a somewhat slower pace than we had expected going into the quarter. Again our profit formula produced very strong EBITDA and EBIT performance measured in dollars and on a rate basis as well.
Overall, our sales increased 3.8%, driven by sales from new stores, combined with the 1.7% in comparable store sales. Comparable store transactions or traffic increased 2.4%, slightly faster than the healthy pace we enjoyed in the first quarter. Average transaction size decreased slightly, as the decline in our average selling price per unit was only partially offset by an increase in units per transaction.
As always, these metrics are driven by a multitude of market and competitive trends. They are also influenced by our PFresh store remodels, which caused our guests to choose to visit our stores more often, and on these new visits purchase a merchandise mix with a lower average selling price per unit.
With a number of PFresh stores increasing every quarter, these locations are gaining importance in their contribution to our overall comparable sales and traffic. For the quarter just ended these stores contributed about 0.7 of a percentage point to our consolidated results on these metrics and for the fall we continue to expect this important strategy to contribute over a full percentage point of incremental comparable sales to our total.
Our second quarter gross margin rate was 32.0%, in line with last year’s modern era record high rate. The impact of sales mix was essentially neutral for the second quarter in a row as strong apparel sales, strong food sales and soft electronic sales led to this neutral outcome. Rate increases within categories were similarly neutral in the quarter. Year-to-date gross margin rate is improved about 20 basis points from last year.
Our second quarter retail segment SG&A expense rate was also essentially in line with last year’s rate, reflecting continued strong expense strong in a relatively weak sales environment. Year-to-date our expense rate was also in line with last year’s rate. Overall, we remain highly satisfied with this result in light of the 2.2% growth in same-store sales for the period.
In our credit card segment most trends from the first quarter continued through the second quarter. Our base of credit card receivables continued to decline, reflecting macro credit card industry trends, driven in large part by the recent legislation and related regulations. In the quarter, solid revenue yield performance, combined with benefit of a rapidly moderating risk environment lead to record high overall portfolio profitability, measured as a spread to LIBOR. This is the case both in dollars and also on a rate basis.
Additionally segment profit our principle measure, calculated after we pay third-parties, mainly Chase Card Services, for the capital they’ve invested in these financial assets more than doubled over last year. This produced an annualized pre-tax return on the $3 billion of capital Target invested in this business segment of just over 20% in the quarter.
As we prepare for the national rollout of our 5% rewards program in mid-October, we continue to enjoy fascinating results in Kansas City test market. Our incremental sales are about evenly split between sales to guests who use our credit cards and those who use the Target debit card, a form of private label debit card attached to guest’s checking accounts.
Incremental sales continue to be heavily concentrated among households who are already spending a lot more with us than our more occasional guests spend. Some of this increase is the result of an increase in shopping frequency among households who were active credit cardholders even before the test. The rest comes from the approximate 50% lift in sales per households we have enjoyed over time and across all geography from the moment existing guests elect to acquire and use one of our cards.
Our aggregate experience in Kansas City continues to validate our belief that this retail segment loyalty strategy will add about a full percentage point to fourth quarter sales and between one and two full points to sales next year.
Turning to other measures of performance, we continue to generate far more cash than we believe is prudent to reinvest in our business at this time. During the quarter we announced a 47% increase in our dividend to an annualize payout of a $1 per share. Coincidentally, we are trading X our first $0.25 quarterly dividend today.
During the quarter we also invested just over $900 million to purchase about 17.5 million of our shares at an average price of $51.72. Over the past five years, we have reduced our shares outstanding by more than 3% per year on a compounded basis. Also in the quarter we issued $1 billion of new fixed-rate 10-year unsecured notes with a 3.875% coupon reflecting one of the lowest coupons in the modern era achieved by any corporation issuing debt of this kind.
Now let’s turn to our outlook for the balance of 2010. In our Retail segment, our same-store sales have increased 2.2% so far this year. In the fall we will enjoy greater benefits from our two powerful traffic driving strategies, PFresh and 5% rewards. Yet we’ll be cycling against stronger prior year performance, and sadly, it’s now clear that the economy is not going to improve as quickly as most of us once expected.
On balance, we expect comparable store sales to increase 1% to 3% in the third quarter, and likely a little faster in the fourth quarter, in both cases driven by healthy same-store traffic growth. Generally we expect to preserve or perhaps slightly enhance our already strong EBITDA and EBIT margin rates in this segment in the fall season, with greater opportunity in the fourth quarter than the third quarter on these measures.
As we’ve discussed before our PFresh and 5% reward strategies are designed to contribute incremental sales at lower gross margin rates and lower SG&A expense rates than our base business, while generally preserving our EBITDA and EBIT margin rate structure over time. This effect on our overall results will become more pronounced as we move forward especially in the fourth quarter and into 2011 with gross margin rates and expense rates, each likely to be somewhat lower relative to our previous experience.
In our Credit Card segment, we expect receivables to continue to decline in the fall season. As we discussed 90 days ago, late fee income will be curtailed beginning this quarter to comply with CARD Act regulations. Now that final regulations is known, we expect third quarter late fee income about one-third lower than our year-to-date experience and expect some sequential recovery from that number in the fourth quarter.
These results in both the third and fourth quarters would be somewhat less onerous than our previous expectations. On a more important note, we expect to continue to enjoy a healthier risk profile in the fall than we experienced last fall. We expect net write-offs to stabilize at about $200 million plus or minus in each of the next two quarters.
On balance though, while there is some potential for an additional risk related reduction in our allowance in the third quarter, we do not expect this factor to continue to contribute to our profitability to nearly the same extent it has on a year-to-date basis.
Overall, current first call median estimate for us envision $0.68 in the third quarter and $1.38 in the fourth quarter. As of today we believe these are responsible single point estimates within the range of possible outcomes.
Now, Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.

This is not anything beyond what in my book is noise in the data.
The expenses, of course, of the PFresh rollout, with the exception of accelerated depreciation, are all contained in retail SG&A expense. That’s a fairly heavy load right now and will continue to be so into the third quarter as well, but of course, if you look back over a long history, we had a lot of new store pre-opening expenses in the prior years that is essentially been replaced by this current form of expense.

I think, most of the noise, or I know most of the noise in the second quarter was really around what was going on at Walmart. I mean, clearly there was some very aggressive discounting early in the quarter with some very extreme rollbacks that moderated considerably. By the end of the quarter there were some very substantial personnel changes in there or announced in the middle of the quarter and along with that some other decisions regarding what they’re going to do with Action Alley and somewhat price modifications. But what we’ve seen is fairly healthy, competitive environment.
Back-to-school has been fairly typically from what we’ve seen in other years, so nothing really out of the ordinary from what we’ve seen in the past. Regarding the marketing launch of 5% rewards, we had an isolated market in Kansas City, but we weren’t really capable of unleashing all of Target’s marketing might behind that. I mean, we had circular, we had a lot of in-store marketing, and I think we did a really good job of communicating this to the guests in that market.
But clearly we’ve learned a lot from that test market and we will apply even more broader strategic and tactical marketing vehicles to support the broad launch of marketing rewards, so you can expect to see some fairly dramatic and impactful ways to communicate this both via all medium and in-store over the fourth quarter this year.

What I said in my earlier remarks was that our outlook for the fall season envisions either about the same or slightly higher rates, with a bigger opportunity in Q4 than in Q3. Spring season, we’re already operating at record high EBITDA margin rates and essentially in line with the highest EBIT margin rates in our retail segments history.
From my standpoint, this simply underscored the notion that the key to strength and prosperity moving forward is to rejuvenate top line growth while generally preserving our current EBITDA and EBIT margin rate structure, and we have two powerful traffic and sales driving strategies in the form PFresh and 5% rewards that are designed to do just that. EBITDA and EBIT margin rates are, of course, the product of what happens with gross margins and what happens with expenses, starting especially in the fourth quarter, less so in the third quarter, because 5% rewards after all doesn’t hit the marketplace until mid-October. Starting in the fourth quarter, I think those gross margin rate and expense rate trends are going to be influenced more heavily by the combination of PFresh and 5% rewards.

There is a seasonal increase in receivables in Q4 that needs to be respected in making the judgment, but the year-over-year percentage declines that you’ve seen in Q1 and Q2 should remain generally intact in Q3 and Q4.
The allowance question is a more fascinating question from my standpoint, because we really need to think about allowance reductions or the potential for allowance reductions in two very distinct categories. Even if we maintain the same allowance as a percentage of receivables, the allowance is preordained to decline in line with receivables decline. In the quarter just ended, if our allowance had ended the quarter at the same percentage of receivable it began the quarter, we would have recorded a $35 million reduction in the allowance, but of course the reduction in the allowance was larger in the current quarter because of the second factor.
As is always the case, we assess the risk in our quarter end receivables in deciding where the allowance should land and in this case, we decided that the risks were lower at the end of the second quarter than they were at the end of the first and therefore there was a second element to the allowance decline. Looking forward, clearly the allowance will decline as a result of continued declines is receivables.
Secondly, in my remarks, I mentioned that I thought that we’d be in a better place certainly in Q3 from a risk standpoint, so maybe there is the potential for further reduction in the allowance due to declines in risks, but obviously at some point those risks will normalize, will stabilize, and that factor in isolation contributing to reserve reductions will be in our past. When that might happen is a matter of a little bit of a speculation. Right now our momentum remains very, very strong in terms of dissipating risks in our Credit Card business.

We went into the second quarter with an expectation of driving 2% to 4% in same-store sales and we did not achieve that expectation, same-store sales ended up a little south of positive 2% during the quarter. The momentum we’re carrying into the third quarter therefore is in the range of 1% to 2%. I think that the extra contribution in the third quarter from our PFresh remodels gives us comfort that a responsible outlook isn’t 1% to 2%, but rather 1% to 3% for the third quarter.
In sequence, in the fourth quarter, in addition to the continued strong contribution from PFresh, we believe that 5% rewards will add essentially a full point to our same-store sales performance. We haven’t quantified with precision what that translates to in the fourth quarter, but certainly each of us could add one percentage point to 1% to 3% and come with a responsible range, but that’s not something that we typically do further out than one quarter. 1% to 3% seems responsible in third quarter for the reasons I outlined, 5% rewards and top of everything else we have going on, all else being equal, we’ll add nearly a full percentage point to our fourth quarter results.

If you look back over time, when we were adding 80, 90 and 100 stores a year or more, about two-thirds of our development or new store development represented Target Stores as a component of much, much larger retail developments with multiple, big box, medium box, anchors and lots and lots of inline space, that marketplace in this country is nearly at absolute zero today.

So, the biggest issue that impacts on new store outlook is that there aren’t nearly as many opportunities being developed in this country that we could participate in. So we are left to focus on the standalone store opportunities and there we are keenly focused on looking at all 50 United States simultaneously, we don’t have a geographic focus in mind of trying to add more stores here or there. We will build any store that is responsible to build, measured in financial and community terms, and we have the capital to do that, we have the team to be able to do that, we have the will to be able to do that.

I am referring to things like Halloween and Christmas, where the day after it goes 50% off and we’re going to leave a little bit of business on the table. We would prefer to leave them on those categories than in our basic categories. We don’t plan these categories for 100% sell through. We plan these to have reasonable sell through somewhere in the range of 70% to 80%.
So, if there is stronger business and there is upside potential then we’ll be able to sell deeper into that assortment and then our sell through goes up, and so it really would have to be something really dramatic for us to really miss business, because we believe we can sell up from 70% to 80% even 90% before we would really start to have some kind of out of stocks. This is just that risk reward kind of thing and do really want to go out there and capture that last sales or do you want to be just a little bit more disciplined and have a little bit more of a scarcity strategy.
So it’s an approach that we have taken for some time. We’re just validating that. We think that in this kind of current environment it’s as important or more important that we stay focused on, make sure that we’re managing those categories more conservatively than we would, categories that have less markdown risks associated with them.

On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising.This mornin",1191,"Good morning, and welcome to Target's 2010 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising.
This morning, I'll provide a high level overview of our second quarter performance. Then Kathy will discuss category results, share recent guest insights and outline upcoming merchandising initiatives. And finally, Doug will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and our outlook for the upcoming quarters. Following Doug's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we are joined in this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.
We are very pleased with our second quarter financial results, particularly because our team was able to deliver strong profit performance in the face of slightly softer-than-expected top line sales. Our earnings per share of $0.92 for the quarter was better than we expected and it established another record high for a non-holiday quarter in the company's history.
Our comparable store sales increased 1.7%, somewhat below our expectation going into the quarter. Healthy traffic trends continued in the second quarter, driving more than 100% of our comparable store sales increase. While some of that strength was driven by our current remodel program, traffic was quite healthy across the chain. The result of compelling merchandising, innovative marketing, strong store execution and the superior value proposition, the essence of our Expect More Pay Less brand promise. Kathy will provide detail on category performance in a few minutes.
Our teams maintained their disciplined focus on expense control during the quarter. Productivity in our stores continues to increase, even while our guest survey store scores confirm that we're consistently delivering superior guest service in great-looking stores. And because of strong leadership, thoughtful underwriting and superb execution,  our Credit Card segment turned in a remarkable second quarter performance, with segment profit up more than 100% over last year. 
Looking ahead, teams across the company are preparing for the launch of our exciting new Rewards program this October, in which guest will begin receiving 5% off every day when they use one of our credit cards or a Target debit card. Doug will provide much more detail in a few minutes.
As we consider the economy and the pattern of our sales, it's clear that the second quarter marked a change in recent trend. Following stronger results in the last two quarters, GDP growth softened considerably in the second quarter, and our sales trends leveled off as well. While no one has a clear view of the future, recent results in both our business and the economy reinforce our perspective that the current recovery will be slow and inconsistent. While guests are still cautious, we're encouraged that we continue to see strong traffic, very healthy sales in discretionary apparel and a strong market share gains in virtually all of our frequency categories.
Reflecting our view on the pace of recovery, we continue to take a conservative position with our inventory and seasonal and markdown-sensitive categories. Preferring that our teams prepared to chase in the event of an upturn rather than taking excessive risks that would lead to a dramatic markdown in a slower-than-expected sales environment. As always, we remain committed to being in stock in all of our need-based categories were markdown risks are negligible. 
We opened three new stores in the second quarter, including our first store in Manhattan. We are very excited about the warm welcome we received from the community in and around Spanish Harlem. And we've heard from many of you that you've already had a chance to see the store in person. We plan to open another 10 stores in the third quarter. And after closings and relocations, we expect to add ten locations this year. 
We plan to steadily build from this very like program in the next few years, adding 20 or more new locations in 2011 and more than 30 in 2012. While we have the appetite, the team and access to capital that would enable our new store base to grow more quickly, we are steadfast in applying our returns-based approach to the approval of new stores. And these growth expectations reflect our estimate of the number of projects that will meet our investment criteria in the current environment.
In the meantime, we're pleased to invest productively in the refresh of our existing store base, incorporating the PFresh food layout along with improvements in home, beauty, electronics, video games and shoes. We completed another 116 remodels in the second quarter alone. So far this year, we remodeled more than 200 stores and have well over 300 PFresh stores operating across the country today.
We continue to make meaningful progress in our ability to execute the remodel process with less disruption for our guests. This quarter, we tested an alternative approach with the remodel of our store in Tustin, California. Rather than keeping the store open for a 13-week remodel, we closed it and performed an extreme makeover, reopening a brand-new store after only five days. While we expect to have only limited opportunities to perform extreme remodels like this one in the future, we learned a lot from the process that we can apply to all of our remodels in the future.
The performance of our remodeled stores continues to meet or exceed the expectations we laid out for you in January in terms of traffic, total sales performance and the amount of cross shopping outside of food and the crossover categories. And very importantly, we continue to hear directly from our guests that they love the look of their new store and they appreciate the time they save when they can complete their grocery shopping at Target.
Added score, our culture is centered on continuous innovation, while staying true to our guests and our brand. PFresh and the upcoming 5% Rewards program are notable examples of this focus. Both of these initiatives resulted from thoughtful evaluation, relying on data, rigorous financial analysis and consideration of strategic and competitive factors. Obviously, any strategic investment decision creates risks, but moving too slowly creates risks as well. Just as we all have to consider both risks and opportunity in an investment portfolio, we've stress tested our expectations for both of these strategies and determine that the potential strategic and financial benefits far outweigh the risks. Now that we've made these decisions, we are laser focused on ensuring superb execution to maximize their long-term benefits.
I'm proud to lead an organization are highly engaged and motivated team members who are devoted to Target's success and to creating long-term value for our shareholders. Now Kathy will provide detail on our guest insights research and additional information on our merchandising and marketing initiatives. Kathy?"

At Target, fulfilling our Expect More Pay Less brand promise means we provide our guests the convenience of one-stop shopping and the right choices in a well-edited unique portfolio of merchandise categories. It means that we achieved the right balance of fashion, newness and value, while delivering a superior guest experience in our stores. Our ability to fulfill our brand promise has allowed Target to gain market share over time in both healthy and challenging economic environment. Today, that promise means more than ever, as guests continue to manage their households in an uncertain environment.
Without a doubt, consumers have gained confidence and are willing to spend more than a year ago, but they remain cautious about the future and very thoughtful about how they spend their money. Our strategy and brand promise uniquely positions Target for success in this environment because we offer guests the right assortment of items across a broad spectrum of categories at fabulous prices. In some cases today, we are seeing guests saving up and splurging on higher ticket items that are meaningful to them. A Kindle, for example, provides a great value because it's thin, lightweight and holds lots of books, making it easier to take while traveling. On the other hand, guests are becoming more comfortable for purchasing owned brands like up & up, where they know they'll get the quality of a national brand and pay about 30% less.
During the second quarter, our guests were out-shopping at Target, as evidenced by our strong traffic trends. Sales in food and healthcare continue to grow rapidly while driving store traffic and guests continue to put a few discretionary items in their baskets when they visited. This led to high single-digit increases in women's apparel and shoes during the quarter, similar to first quarter trends.
Second quarter sales trends in electronics, video games, music and movies softened noticeably at Target and elsewhere. While some interpret this trend as a sign that consumers are pulling back on discretionary purchases, we believe it's also related to product life cycle stages in these categories. In television, the industry had to cycle over the digital conversion in the second quarter last year, creating a daunting comparison this year. 
In addition, video game hardware platforms are as mature as they've ever been, and a weaker new release schedule led to softer sales. Looking ahead, we believe both of these trends will begin to moderate in the fall, as we move beyond the digital conversion and as newness in the video game category creates interest and spur sales.
As Gregg mentioned earlier, the opening of our Harlem store in New York City was a huge success. We tailored the store's merchandise assortment to include a generous selection of multi-cultural and urban lifestyle offerings, appropriate items to meet the needs of the community. And earlier this month, we launched the Harlem designer collection in key stores, predominantly on the East Coast and on Target.com. This diverse partnership features designs from renowned designers, Isabel and Ruben Toledo; Stephen Burrows; and chef extraordinaire, Marcus Samuelsson. These limited-time-only collections span multiple categories and reflects the spirit of Harlem.
We're also very pleased with the performance of the merchandise reinventions incorporated into this year's remodeled stores. This year's remodels build on last year's success in driving traffic and sales in food and across the store by updating visual elements and transforming categories such as home, beauty, electronics and video games. As expected, these updates outside of food are leading to greater cross shopping by our guests. 
Beginning in July, our remodels added the transformation of the shoe department. This new destination provides an improved shopping experience for our guests with enhanced sidelines, better product visibility and greater guest comfort with additional seating and mirrors. This new shoe experience will be in approximately 260 stores by the end of October.
As I mentioned, many guests are increasingly attracted to our own brands, which provide great value at a great price. To ensure we continue to meet our guests' high standards, we're creating fewer, bigger owned brands throughout the store. up & up and our food-owned brands, Market Pantry and Archer Farms, continue to resonate with our guests and sales penetration continues to grow. Our work in Merona played a key role in driving strong results in ladies apparel the spring. And we're seeing positive results in our efforts to clarify the assortment and aesthetic of Home, Target home and Room Essentials, positioning us for a successful back-to-college season.
Designer partnerships are an important part of our commitment to offering guests access to unique and coveted styles at affordable prices. This fall, we'll share on-trend fashions and accessories with our guests through a number of exacting designer partnerships. Our limited-time-only Temple St. Clair for Target jewelry collection will be available later this month through the holidays. The vibrant assortment features 14-karat gold plated brass and cubic zirconia, which fuses rich color into St. Clair's design. The Temple St. Clair collection includes necklaces, cuffs, earrings, rings and prices range from $30 to $50. A new John Derian for Target collection for home and office will be available for a limited time beginning September 5. Derian's new line for Target will feature more than 100 homes decor products and office accessories at prices under $25.
Also, in September, we will launch Tucker for Target. This collection includes women's apparel in an eclectic mix of Bohemian and sheik prints featuring tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear and knit wear in prices ranging from $20 to $80. In handbags, Target is partnering with English luxury brand, Mulberry, to launch a limited edition collection for Target. The Target collection features signature Mulberry silhouettes in bold prints and interesting textures including denim, pink leopard, black velvet and patent. The collection ranges in price from $15 to $50 and will be available beginning in October.
And tonight, Target is taking over the Standard Hotel in New York City to create a brilliant larger-than-life fashion show debuting Target's fall 2010 collection. Part fashion show, part light show, the Target fashion spectacular will bring the southern façade of the Standard alive. In 155 rooms, 66 dancers dressed in the latest styles will perform dazzling choreography, synchronized with fast-paced lighting patterns set to an original music score. A simultaneous presentation will take place at street level. Guests outside of New York will be able to experience this one-of-a-kind event via a live streaming broadcast at Target's Facebook page.
This back-to-school season, Target offers affordable one-stop shopping for students and parents from school supplies and dorm decor to fashionable clothing and the latest gadgets. New this year is Disney's design, a line of apparel and accessories for twin girls. The new collection is based on the fashions worn by Disney Channel characters such as Sonny Munroe from Sonny with a Chance and Alex Russo from Wizards of Waverly Place. 
And for young men, we're introducing style and comfort with the Shaun White collection of graphic tees, plaid shirts and denim; and new this fall, Shaun White skate-inspired shoes. And while the season still has a long way to go, initial results for both back-to-school and back-to-college have been encouraging, as guests have found the right items and great values when they shop at Target during this important season.
Later in the third quarter, for Halloween, we're offering guests of all ages the chance to experience haunted couture through an exclusive designer partnership with Simon Doonan, Creative Director of Barney's New York. Simon has created a line of costumes exclusively for Target that reflects his larger-than-life personality and keen fashion sense. Costume couture by Simon Doonan for Target will be available for a limited time beginning September 12 at selected Target stores and Target.com. 
We're pleased with our results through the first half of 2010. While we prefer a stronger economy and higher levels of consumer spending, we are well positioned to operate profitably in this environment. Inventories are well controlled and we continue to gain market share in categories throughout the store. Now Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for the remainder of the year. Doug?"

In my remarks today, I plan to review our second quarter and year-to-date results by segment and on an overall basis. And I'll also provide some color on our outlook for the third and fourth quarters. As Gregg mentioned, on balance, we're",1368,"Thanks, Kathy. In my remarks today, I plan to review our second quarter and year-to-date results by segment and on an overall basis. And I'll also provide some color on our outlook for the third and fourth quarters. 
As Gregg mentioned, on balance, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance, as each of our business segments generated strong profitability and cash flow. Our second quarter earnings per share of $0.92 was 17% ahead of last year's performance and 12% higher than our previous second quarter record of $0.82 achieved in 2008.
In our retail segment, as previously disclosed, our sales grew at a somewhat slower pace than we had expected going into the quarter. Yet, our profit formula produced very strong EBITDA and EBIT performance, measured in dollars and on a rate basis as well. Overall, our sales increased 3.8%, driven by sales from new stores combined with a 1.7% increase in comparable store sales. Comparable store transactions, or traffic, increased 2.4%, slightly faster than the healthy pace we enjoyed in the first quarter. 
Average transaction size decreased slightly, as the decline in our average selling price per unit was only partially offset by an increase in units per transaction. As always, these metrics are driven by a multitude of market and competitive trends. They're also influenced by PFresh store remodels, which caused our guests to choose to visit our stores more often. And on these new visits, purchase of merchandise mix with a lower average selling price per unit.
With the number of PFresh stores increasing every quarter, these locations are gaining importance in their contribution to our overall comparable sales and traffic. For the quarter just ended, these stores contributed about 7/10 of a percentage point to our consolidated results on these metrics. And for the fall, we continue to expect this important strategy to contribute over a full percentage point of incremental comparable sales to our total.
Our second quarter gross margin rate was 32.0%, in line with last year's modern era record high rate. The impact of sales mix was essentially neutral for the second quarter in a row, as strong apparel sales, strong food sales and soft electronic sales led to this neutral outcome. Rate increases within categories were similarly neutral in the quarter. Year to date, gross margin rate has improved about 20 basis points from last year.
Our second Retail segment SG&A expense rate was also essentially in line with last year's rate, reflecting continued strong expense control in a relatively weak sales environment. Year to date, our expense rate was also in line with last year's rate. Overall, we remain highly satisfied with this result in light of the 2.2% growth in same-store sales for the period.
In our Credit Card segment, most trends from the first quarter continued through the second quarter. Our base of credit card receivables continue to decline, reflecting macro credit card industry trends, driven in large part by the recent legislation and related regulations. 
In the quarter, solid revenue yield performance combined with the benefit of a rapidly moderating risk environment led to record high overall portfolio profitability, measured as spread to LIBOR. This was the case both in dollars and also on a rate basis. Additionally, segment profit, our principal measure, calculated after we paid third parties, mainly Chase Card Services for the capital they've in these financial assets, more than doubled over the last year. This produced an annualized pretax return on the $3 billion of capital Target has invested in this business segment of just over 20% in the quarter.
As we prepare for the national rollout of our 5% Rewards program in mid-October, we continue to enjoy fascinating results in our Kansas City test market. Our incremental sales are about evenly split between sales to guests who use our credit cards and those who use the Target debit card, a form of private label debit card attached to guest checking accounts. 
Incremental sales continue to be heavily concentrated among households who are already spending a lot more with us than our more occasional guests spend. Some of this increase is the result of an increase in shopping frequency among households who are active credit card holders even before the tests. The rest comes from the approximate 50% lift in sales per households we have enjoyed over time and across all geography from the moment existing guest elects to acquire and use one of our cars. Our aggregate experience in Kansas City continues to validate our belief that this Retail segment loyalty strategy will add about a full percentage point to fourth quarter sales and between one and two full points to sales next year.
Turning to other measures of performance, we continue to generate far more cash than we believe is prudent to reinvest in our business at this time. During the quarter, we announced a 47% increase in our dividend to an annualized payout of $1 per share. Coincidentally, we are trading x our first $0.25 quarterly dividend today. 
During the quarter, we also invested just over $900 million to purchase about 17.5 million of our shares in an average price of $51.72. Over the past five years, we have reduced our shares outstanding by more than 3% per year on a compounded basis.  Also, in the quarter, we issued a $1 billion of new fixed rate 10-year unsecured notes with a 3 7/8% coupon, reflecting one of the lowest coupons in the modern era achieved by any corporation issuing debt of this kind. 
Now let's turn to our outlook for the balance of 2010. In our Retail segment, our same-store sales have increased 2.2% so far this year. In the fall, we will enjoy greater benefits from our two powerful traffic driving strategies, PFresh and 5% Rewards. Yet, we'll cycling against stronger prior-year performance. And sadly, it's now clear that the economy is not going to improve as quickly as most of us once expected. On balance, we expect comparable store sales to increase 1% to 3% in the third quarter, and likely a little faster in the fourth quarter, in both cases, driven by healthy same-store traffic growth.
Generally, we expect to preserve or perhaps slightly enhance our already strong EBITDA and EBIT margin rates in this segment in the fall season, with greater opportunity in the fourth quarter than the third quarter on these measures. As we've discussed before, our PFresh and 5% Rewards strategies are designed to contribute incremental sales at lower gross margin rates and lower SG&A expense rates than our base business, while generally preserving our EBITDA and EBIT margin rate structure over time. This effect on our overall results will become more pronounced as we move forward, especially in the fourth quarter and into 2011, with gross margin rates and expense rates each likely to be somewhat lower relative to our previous experience.
In our Credit Card segment, we expect receivables to continue to decline in the fall season. As we discussed 90 days ago, late fee income will be curtailed beginning this quarter to comply with CARD Act regulations. Now that final regulations are known [ph], we expect third quarter late fee income about 1/3 lower than our year-to-date experience and expect some sequential recovery from that number in the fourth quarter. These results, in both the third and fourth quarters, would be somewhat less onerous than our previous expectations. 
On a more important note, we expect to continue to enjoy a healthier risk profile in the fall than we experienced last fall. We expect net write-offs to stabilize at about $200 million plus or minus in each of the next two quarters. On balance though, while there are some potential for an additional risk-related reduction in our allowance in the third quarter, we do not expect this factor to continue to contribute to our profitability to nearly the same extent it has on a year-to-date basis.
Overall, current First Call median estimates for us envision $0.68 in the third quarter and $1.38 in the fourth quarter. As of today, we believe these are responsible single-point estimates within a range of possible outcomes. Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks."

I think most of the noise or I know most of the noise in the second quarter was really around what was going on at Wal-Mart. I mean clearly, there was some very aggressive discounting early in the quarter with some very extreme rollbacks that moderated considerably by the end of the quarter. There were some very substantial personnel changes in there or announced in the middle of the quarter, and along with that, some other decisions regarding what they're going to do with Action Alley and somewhat price modifications. But overall, what we've seen is a fairly healthy competitive environment. Back to School has been fairly typical from what we've seen in other years. So nothing really out of the ordinary from what we've seen in the past. Regarding the marketing launch of 5% rewards, we had an isolated market in Kansas City. But we weren't really capable of unleashing all of Target's marketing might behind that. I mean, we had circular. We had a lot of in-store marketing, and I think we did a really good job of communicating this to guests in that market. But clearly, we've learned a lot from that test market, and we will apply even more broader strategic and tactical marketing vehicles to support the broad launch of marketing reward. So you can expect to see some fairly dramatic and impactful ways to communicate this both via all medium and in-store over the fourth quarter this year."

What I said in my earlier remarks was that our outlook for the fall season envisions either about the same or slightly higher rates with a bigger opportunity in Q4 than in Q3. Spring season, we're already operating at record-high EBITDA margin rates and essentially in line with the highest EBIT margin rates in our Retail segment's history. From my standpoint, this simply underscores the notion that the key to strength and prosperity moving forward is to rejuvenate top line growth while generally preserving our current EBITDA and EBIT margin rate structure. And we have two powerful traffic and sales driving strategies in the form of PFresh and 5% rewards that are designed to do just that. EBITDA and EBIT margin rates or of course the product of what happens at gross margin, what happens with expenses starting especially in the fourth quarter, less so in the third quarter because 5% rewards after all doesn't hit the marketplace until mid-October. Starting in the fourth quarter, I think those gross margin rate and expense rate trends are going to be influenced more heavily by the combination of PFresh and 5% rewards."

There is a seasonal increase in receivables in Q4 that needs to be respected in making the judgment. But the year-over-year percentage declines that you've seen in Q1 and Q2 should remain generally intact in Q3 and Q4. The allowance question is a more fascinating question from my standpoint because we really need to think about allowance reductions or the potential for allowance reductions in two very distinct categories. Even if we maintain the same allowance as a percentage of receivables, the allowance is destined as preordained to a decline in line with receivables decline. In the quarter just ended, if our allowance had ended the quarter at the same percentage of receivables that began the quarter, we would have recorded a $35 million reduction in the allowance. But of course, the reduction in the allowance was larger in the current quarter because of the second factor. As is always the case, we assess the risk in our quarter-end receivables in deciding where the allowance should land. And in this case, we decided that the risks were lower at the end of the second quarter than they were at the end of the first, and therefore, there was a second element to the allowance decline. Looking forward, clearly, the allowance will decline as a result of continued declines in receivables. Secondly, in my remarks, I mentioned that I thought that we'd be in a better place certainly in Q3 from a risk standpoint, so maybe there's the potential for further reduction in the allowance due to declines in risks. But obviously at some point, those risks will normalize, will stabilize and that factor, in isolation, contributing to reserve reductions will be in our past. When that might happen is a matter of a little bit of speculation. Right now, our momentum remains very, very strong in terms of dissipating risks in our Credit Card business."

I think that the extra contribution in the third quarter from our PFresh remodels gives us comfort that a responsible outlook isn't 1% to 2%, but rather 1% to 3% for the third quarter. In sequence, in the fourth quarter, in addition to the continued strong contribution from PFresh, we believe that 5% rewards will add essentially a full point to our same-store sales performance. We haven't quantified with precision what that translates to in the fourth quarter, but certainly, each of us could add one percentage point to 1% to 3% and come up with a responsible range. But that's not something that we typically do farther out than one quarter.

The biggest issue, of course, is that we're internalizing the expense base of what had previously been payments made to an unrelated third party, in this case, Amazon. Thinking about the dynamics though, a couple of things are at play here. Relative to status quo, in other words relative to sticking with Amazon, we are already incurring some double expenses as we prepare for the launch, and that will continue into 2011 as well. So for a period of time, 2010, 2011, we've actually increased over SG&A as a result of the switch. That obviously will create a year-over-year benefit when we get to 2012. Separately, we are replacing what had been what is today a generally variable arrangement with Amazon into what will be more of a fixed-cost arrangement internally. And therefore, be subject to much more favorable or unfavorable leveraging based on changes in sales."

That marketplace in this country is nearly at absolute zero today. There are very few new projects of that kind in-flight or coming out of the ground. So the biggest issue that impacts our new store outlook is that there aren't nearly as many opportunities of being developed in this country that we could participate in. So we're left to focus on the stand-alone store opportunities. And there, we are keenly focused on looking at all 50 United States simultaneously. We don't have a geographic focus in mind of trying to add more stores here or there. We will build any store that is responsible to build, measured in financial and community terms. And we have the capital to do that. We have the team to be able to do that. We have the will to be able to do that.

In addition to that, you've seen Room Essentials grow as part of our Back to College assortment. That brand has performed exceptionally well since our relaunch. And so it's continuing to do well with Back to school and Back to College. In terms of Home, as we look through the back half, there are a lot of things that we're excited about. starting with Back to school and Back to College, which a lot of Home categories pop in that time frame. Room Essentials, as I mentioned, that relaunch has been very successful, and we would expect that to continue throughout the fall. The Home brand has also performed well and gaining strength. And I think in particular, what you'll see this fall in that brand is really some fantastic textures and throws and velvet coverlets and pillows in really incredibly rich colors, purples and teals and greens.

And so if there is stronger business and there's upside potential, then the sell-through can -- we'll be able to sell deeper into that assortment and then our sell-through goes up. And so it really would have to be something really dramatic for us to really miss business because we believe we can sell up from 70% to 80% to even 90% before we would really start to have some kind of out of stocks.

On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President, Merchandising.
This morning, I'll provide a high level overview of our second quarter performance. Then Kathy will discuss category results, share recent guest insights and outline upcoming merchandising initiatives. And finally, Doug will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and our outlook for the upcoming quarters. Following Doug's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we are joined in this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.
We are very pleased with our second quarter financial results, particularly because our team was able to deliver strong profit performance in the face of slightly softer-than-expected top line sales. Our earnings per share of $0.92 for the quarter was better than we expected and it established another record high for a non-holiday quarter in the company's history.
Our comparable store sales increased 1.7%, somewhat below our expectation going into the quarter. Healthy traffic trends continued in the second quarter, driving more than 100% of our comparable store sales increase. While some of that strength was driven by our current remodel program, traffic was quite healthy across the chain. The result of compelling merchandising, innovative marketing, strong store execution and the superior value proposition, the essence of our Expect More Pay Less brand promise. Kathy will provide detail on category performance in a few minutes.
Our teams maintained their disciplined focus on expense control during the quarter. Productivity in our stores continues to increase, even while our guest survey store scores confirm that we're consistently delivering superior guest service in great-looking stores. And because of strong leadership, thoughtful underwriting and superb execution,  our Credit Card segment turned in a remarkable second quarter performance, with segment profit up more than 100% over last year. 
Looking ahead, teams across the company are preparing for the launch of our exciting new Rewards program this October, in which guest will begin receiving 5% off every day when they use one of our credit cards or a Target debit card. Doug will provide much more detail in a few minutes.
As we consider the economy and the pattern of our sales, it's clear that the second quarter marked a change in recent trend. Following stronger results in the last two quarters, GDP growth softened considerably in the second quarter, and our sales trends leveled off as well. While no one has a clear view of the future, recent results in both our business and the economy reinforce our perspective that the current recovery will be slow and inconsistent. While guests are still cautious, we're encouraged that we continue to see strong traffic, very healthy sales in discretionary apparel and a strong market share gains in virtually all of our frequency categories.
Reflecting our view on the pace of recovery, we continue to take a conservative position with our inventory and seasonal and markdown-sensitive categories. Preferring that our teams prepared to chase in the event of an upturn rather than taking excessive risks that would lead to a dramatic markdown in a slower-than-expected sales environment. As always, we remain committed to being in stock in all of our need-based categories were markdown risks are negligible. 
We opened three new stores in the second quarter, including our first store in Manhattan. We are very excited about the warm welcome we received from the community in and around Spanish Harlem. And we've heard from many of you that you've already had a chance to see the store in person. We plan to open another 10 stores in the third quarter. And after closings and relocations, we expect to add ten locations this year. 
We plan to steadily build from this very like program in the next few years, adding 20 or more new locations in 2011 and more than 30 in 2012. While we have the appetite, the team and access to capital that would enable our new store base to grow more quickly, we are steadfast in applying our returns-based approach to the approval of new stores. And these growth expectations reflect our estimate of the number of projects that will meet our investment criteria in the current environment.
In the meantime, we're pleased to invest productively in the refresh of our existing store base, incorporating the PFresh food layout along with improvements in home, beauty, electronics, video games and shoes. We completed another 116 remodels in the second quarter alone. So far this year, we remodeled more than 200 stores and have well over 300 PFresh stores operating across the country today.
We continue to make meaningful progress in our ability to execute the remodel process with less disruption for our guests. This quarter, we tested an alternative approach with the remodel of our store in Tustin, California. Rather than keeping the store open for a 13-week remodel, we closed it and performed an extreme makeover, reopening a brand-new store after only five days. While we expect to have only limited opportunities to perform extreme remodels like this one in the future, we learned a lot from the process that we can apply to all of our remodels in the future.
The performance of our remodeled stores continues to meet or exceed the expectations we laid out for you in January in terms of traffic, total sales performance and the amount of cross shopping outside of food and the crossover categories. And very importantly, we continue to hear directly from our guests that they love the look of their new store and they appreciate the time they save when they can complete their grocery shopping at Target.
Added score, our culture is centered on continuous innovation, while staying true to our guests and our brand. PFresh and the upcoming 5% Rewards program are notable examples of this focus. Both of these initiatives resulted from thoughtful evaluation, relying on data, rigorous financial analysis and consideration of strategic and competitive factors. Obviously, any strategic investment decision creates risks, but moving too slowly creates risks as well. Just as we all have to consider both risks and opportunity in an investment portfolio, we've stress tested our expectations for both of these strategies and determine that the potential strategic and financial benefits far outweigh the risks. Now that we've made these decisions, we are laser focused on ensuring superb execution to maximize their long-term benefits.
I'm proud to lead an organization are highly engaged and motivated team members who are devoted to Target's success and to creating long-term value for our shareholders. Now Kathy will provide detail on our guest insights research and additional information on our merchandising and marketing initiatives. Kathy?"

At Target, fulfilling our Expect More Pay Less brand promise means we provide our guests the convenience of one-stop shopping and the right choices in a well-edited unique portfolio of merchandise categories. It means that we achieved the right balance of fashion, newness and value, while delivering a superior guest experience in our stores. Our ability to fulfill our brand promise has allowed Target to gain market share over time in both healthy and challenging economic environment. Today, that promise means more than ever, as guests continue to manage their households in an uncertain environment.
Without a doubt, consumers have gained confidence and are willing to spend more than a year ago, but they remain cautious about the future and very thoughtful about how they spend their money. Our strategy and brand promise uniquely positions Target for success in this environment because we offer guests the right assortment of items across a broad spectrum of categories at fabulous prices. In some cases today, we are seeing guests saving up and splurging on higher ticket items that are meaningful to them. A Kindle, for example, provides a great value because it's thin, lightweight and holds lots of books, making it easier to take while traveling. On the other hand, guests are becoming more comfortable purchasing owned brands like up & up, where they know they'll get the quality of a national brand and pay about 30% less.
During the second quarter, our guests were outshopping at Target, as evidenced by our strong traffic trends. Sales in food and healthcare continue to grow rapidly while driving store traffic and guests continue to put a few discretionary items in their baskets when they visited. This led to high single-digit increases in women's apparel and shoes during the quarter, similar to first quarter trends.
Second quarter sales trends in electronics, video games, music and movies softened noticeably at Target and elsewhere. While some interpret this trend as a sign that consumers are pulling back on discretionary purchases, we believe it's also related to product life cycle stages in these categories. In television, the industry had to cycle over the digital conversion in the second quarter last year, creating a daunting comparison this year. 
In addition, video game hardware platforms are as mature as they've ever been, and a weaker new release schedule led to softer sales. Looking ahead, we believe both of these trends will begin to moderate in the fall, as we move beyond the digital conversion and as newness in the video game category creates interest and spur sales.
As Gregg mentioned earlier, the opening of our Harlem store in New York City was a huge success. We tailored the store's merchandise assortment to include a generous selection of multi-cultural and urban lifestyle offerings, appropriate items to meet the needs of the community. And earlier this month, we launched the Harlem designer collection in key stores, predominantly on the East Coast and on Target.com. This diverse partnership features designs from renowned designers, Isabel and Ruben Toledo; Stephen Burrows; and chef extraordinaire, Marcus Samuelsson. These limited-time-only collections span multiple categories and reflects the spirit of Harlem.
We're also very pleased with the performance of the merchandise reinventions incorporated into this year's remodeled stores. This year's remodels build on last year's success in driving traffic and sales in food and across the store by updating visual elements and transforming categories such as home, beauty, electronics and video games. As expected, these updates outside of food are leading to greater cross shopping by our guests. 
Beginning in July, our remodels added the transformation of the shoe department. This new destination provides an improved shopping experience for our guests with enhanced sidelines, better product visibility and greater guest comfort with additional seating and mirrors. This new shoe experience will be in approximately 260 stores by the end of October.
As I mentioned, many guests are increasingly attracted to our own brands, which provide great value at a great price. To ensure we continue to meet our guests' high standards, we're creating fewer, bigger owned brands throughout the store. up & up and our food-owned brands, Market Pantry and Archer Farms, continue to resonate with our guests and sales penetration continues to grow. Our work in Merona played a key role in driving strong results in ladies apparel the spring. And we're seeing positive results in our efforts to clarify the assortment and aesthetic of Home, Target home and Room Essentials, positioning us for a successful back-to-college season.
Designer partnerships are an important part of our commitment to offering guests access to unique and coveted styles at affordable prices. This fall, we'll share on-trend fashions and accessories with our guests through a number of exacting designer partnerships. Our limited-time-only Temple St. Clair for Target jewelry collection will be available later this month through the holidays. The vibrant assortment features 14-karat gold plated brass and cubic zirconia, which fuses rich color into St. Clair's design. The Temple St. Clair collection includes necklaces, cuffs, earrings, rings and prices range from $30 to $50. A new John Derian for Target collection for home and office will be available for a limited time beginning September 5. Derian's new line for Target will feature more than 100 homes decor products and office accessories at prices under $25.
Also, in September, we will launch Tucker for Target. This collection includes women's apparel in an eclectic mix of Bohemian and sheik prints featuring tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear and knit wear in prices ranging from $20 to $80. In handbags, Target is partnering with English luxury brand, Mulberry, to launch a limited edition collection for Target. The Target collection features signature Mulberry silhouettes in bold prints and interesting textures including denim, pink leopard, black velvet and patent. The collection ranges in price from $15 to $50 and will be available beginning in October.
And tonight, Target is taking over the Standard Hotel in New York City to create a brilliant larger-than-life fashion show debuting Target's fall 2010 collection. Part fashion show, part light show, the Target fashion spectacular will bring the southern façade of the Standard alive. In 155 rooms, 66 dancers dressed in the latest styles will perform dazzling choreography, synchronized with fast-paced lighting patterns set to an original music score. A simultaneous presentation will take place at street level. Guests outside of New York will be able to experience this one-of-a-kind event via a live streaming broadcast at Target's Facebook page.
This back-to-school season, Target offers affordable one-stop shopping for students and parents from school supplies and dorm decor to fashionable clothing and the latest gadgets. New this year is Disney's design, a line of apparel and accessories for twin girls. The new collection is based on the fashions worn by Disney Channel characters such as Sonny Munroe from Sonny with a Chance and Alex Russo from Wizards of Waverly Place. 
And for young men, we're introducing style and comfort with the Shaun White collection of graphic tees, plaid shirts and denim; and new this fall, Shaun White skate-inspired shoes. And while the season still has a long way to go, initial results for both back-to-school and back-to-college have been encouraging, as guests have found the right items and great values when they shop at Target during this important season.
Later in the third quarter, for Halloween, we're offering guests of all ages the chance to experience haunted couture through an exclusive designer partnership with Simon Doonan, Creative Director of Barney's New York. Simon has created a line of costumes exclusively for Target that reflects his larger-than-life personality and keen fashion sense. Costume couture by Simon Doonan for Target will be available for a limited time beginning September 12 at selected Target stores and Target.com. 
We're pleased with our results through the first half of 2010. While we prefer a stronger economy and higher levels of consumer spending, we are well positioned to operate profitably in this environment. Inventories are well controlled and we continue to gain market share in categories throughout the store. Now Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for the remainder of the year. Doug?"

In my remarks today, I plan to review our second quarter and year-to-date results by segment and on an overall basis. And I'll also provide some color on our outlook for the third and fourth quarters. As Gregg mentioned, on balance, we're",1367,"Thanks, Kathy. In my remarks today, I plan to review our second quarter and year-to-date results by segment and on an overall basis. And I'll also provide some color on our outlook for the third and fourth quarters. 
As Gregg mentioned, on balance, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance, as each of our business segments generated strong profitability and cash flow. Our second quarter earnings per share of $0.92 was 17% ahead of last year's performance and 12% higher than our previous second quarter record of $0.82 achieved in 2008.
In our retail segment, as previously disclosed, our sales grew at a somewhat slower pace than we had expected going into the quarter. Yet, our profit formula produced very strong EBITDA and EBIT performance, measured in dollars and on a rate basis as well. Overall, our sales increased 3.8%, driven by sales from new stores combined with a 1.7% increase in comparable store sales. Comparable store transactions, or traffic, increased 2.4%, slightly faster than the healthy pace we enjoyed in the first quarter. 
Average transaction size decreased slightly, as the decline in our average selling price per unit was only partially offset by an increase in units per transaction. As always, these metrics are driven by a multitude of market and competitive trends. They're also influenced by PFresh store remodels, which caused our guests to choose to visit our stores more often. And on these new visits, purchase of merchandise mix with a lower average selling price per unit.
With the number of PFresh stores increasing every quarter, these locations are gaining importance in their contribution to our overall comparable sales and traffic. For the quarter just ended, these stores contributed about 7/10 of a percentage point to our consolidated results on these metrics. And for the fall, we continue to expect this important strategy to contribute over a full percentage point of incremental comparable sales to our total.
Our second quarter gross margin rate was 32.0%, in line with last year's modern era record high rate. The impact of sales mix was essentially neutral for the second quarter in a row, as strong apparel sales, strong food sales and soft electronic sales led to this neutral outcome. Rate increases within categories were similarly neutral in the quarter. Year-to-date, gross margin rate has improved about 20 basis points from last year.
Our second quarter Retail segment SG&A expense rate was also essentially in line with last year's rate, reflecting continued strong expense control in a relatively weak sales environment. Year-to-date, our expense rate was also in line with last year's rate. Overall, we remain highly satisfied with this result in light of the 2.2% growth in same-store sales for the period.
In our Credit Card segment, most trends from the first quarter continued through the second quarter. Our base of credit card receivables continue to decline, reflecting macro credit card industry trends, driven in large part by the recent legislation and related regulations. 
In the quarter, solid revenue yield performance combined with the benefit of a rapidly moderating risk environment led to record high overall portfolio profitability, measured as spread to LIBOR. This was the case both in dollars and also on a rate basis. Additionally, segment profit, our principal measure, calculated after we paid third parties, mainly Chase Card Services for the capital they've invested in these financial assets, more than doubled over last year. This produced an annualized pretax return on the $3 billion of capital Target has invested in this business segment of just over 20% in the quarter.
As we prepare for the national rollout of our 5% Rewards program in mid-October, we continue to enjoy fascinating results in our Kansas City test market. Our incremental sales are about evenly split between sales to guests who use our credit cards and those who use the Target debit card, a form of private label debit card attached to guests' checking accounts. 
Incremental sales continue to be heavily concentrated among households who are already spending a lot more with us than our more occasional guests spend. Some of this increase is the result of an increase in shopping frequency among households who were active credit card holders even before the tests. The rest comes from the approximate 50% lift in sales per households we have enjoyed over time and across all geography from the moment existing guest elects to acquire and use one of our cards. Our aggregate experience in Kansas City continues to validate our belief that this Retail segment loyalty strategy will add about a full percentage point to fourth quarter sales and between one and two full points to sales next year.
Turning to other measures of performance, we continue to generate far more cash than we believe is prudent to reinvest in our business at this time. During the quarter, we announced a 47% increase in our dividend to an annualized payout of $1 per share. Coincidentally, we are trading x our first $0.25 quarterly dividend today. 
During the quarter, we also invested just over $900 million to purchase about 17.5 million of our shares in an average price of $51.72. Over the past five years, we have reduced our shares outstanding by more than 3% per year on a compounded basis.  Also in the quarter, we issued a $1 billion of new fixed-rate, 10-year unsecured notes with a 3 7/8% coupon, reflecting one of the lowest coupons in the modern era achieved by any corporation issuing debt of this kind. 
And now let's turn to our outlook for the balance of 2010. In our Retail segment, our same-store sales have increased 2.2% so far this year. In the fall, we will enjoy greater benefits from our two powerful traffic driving strategies, PFresh and 5% Rewards. Yet, we'll be cycling against stronger prior year performance. And sadly, it's now clear that the economy is not going to improve as quickly as most of us once expected. On balance, we expect comparable store sales to increase 1% to 3% in the third quarter, and likely a little faster in the fourth quarter, in both cases, driven by healthy same-store traffic growth.
Generally, we expect to preserve or perhaps slightly enhance our already strong EBITDA and EBIT margin rates in this segment in the fall season, with greater opportunity in the fourth quarter than the third quarter on these measures. As we've discussed before, our PFresh and 5% Rewards strategies are designed to contribute incremental sales at lower gross margin rates and lower SG&A expense rates than our base business, while generally preserving our EBITDA and EBIT margin rate structure over time. This effect on our overall results will become more pronounced as we move forward, especially in the fourth quarter and into 2011, with gross margin rates and expense rates each likely to be somewhat lower relative to our previous experience.
In our Credit Card segment, we expect receivables to continue to decline in the fall season. As we discussed 90 days ago, late fee income will be curtailed beginning this quarter to comply with CARD Act regulations. Now that final regulations are known [ph], we expect third quarter late fee income about 1/3 lower than our year-to-date experience and expect some sequential recovery from that number in the fourth quarter. These results, in both the third and fourth quarters, would be somewhat less onerous than our previous expectations. 
On a more important note, we expect to continue to enjoy a healthier risk profile in the fall than we experienced last fall. We expect net write-offs to stabilize at about $200 million plus or minus in each of the next two quarters. On balance though, while there are some potential for an additional risk-related reduction in our allowance in the third quarter, we do not expect this factor to continue to contribute to our profitability to nearly the same extent it has on a year-to-date basis.
Overall, current First Call median estimate for us envisions $0.68 in the third quarter and $1.38 in the fourth quarter. As of today, we believe these are responsible single-point estimates within a range of possible outcomes. Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks."

The expenses of course of the PFresh rollout, with the exception of accelerated depreciation, are all contained in retail SG&A expense. That's a fairly heavy expense load right now and will continue to be so into the third quarter as well. But of course, if you look back over our long history, we had a lot of new store preopening expenses in the prior years that is essentially been replaced by this current form of expense."

I think most of the noise or I know most of the noise in the second quarter was really around what was going on at Wal-Mart. I mean clearly, there was some very aggressive discounting early in the quarter with some very extreme rollbacks that moderated considerably by the end of the quarter. There were some very substantial personnel changes in there or announced in the middle of the quarter, and along with that, some other decisions regarding what they're going to do with Action Alley and somewhat price modifications. But overall, what we've seen is a fairly healthy competitive environment. Back to School has been fairly typical from what we've seen in other years. So nothing really out of the ordinary from what we've seen in the past. Regarding the marketing launch of 5% rewards, we had an isolated market in Kansas City. But we weren't really capable of unleashing all of Target's marketing might behind that. I mean, we had circular. We had a lot of in-store marketing, and I think we did a really good job of communicating this to guests in that market. But clearly, we've learned a lot from that test market, and we will apply even more broader strategic and tactical marketing vehicles to support the broad launch of marketing reward. So you can expect to see some fairly dramatic and impactful ways to communicate this both via all medium and in-store over the fourth quarter this year."

And we have two powerful traffic and sales driving strategies in the form of PFresh and 5% rewards that are designed to do just that. EBITDA and EBIT margin rates or of course the product of what happens at gross margin, what happens with expenses starting especially in the fourth quarter, less so in the third quarter because 5% rewards after all doesn't hit the marketplace until mid-October.

There is a seasonal increase in receivables in Q4 that needs to be respected in making the judgment. But the year-over-year percentage declines that you've seen in Q1 and Q2 should remain generally intact in Q3 and Q4. The allowance question is a more fascinating question from my standpoint because we really need to think about allowance reductions or the potential for allowance reductions in two very distinct categories. Even if we maintain the same allowance as a percentage of receivables, the allowance is destined as preordained to a decline in line with receivables decline. In the quarter just ended, if our allowance had ended the quarter at the same percentage of receivables that began the quarter, we would have recorded a $35 million reduction in the allowance. But of course, the reduction in the allowance was larger in the current quarter because of the second factor. As is always the case, we assess the risk in our quarter-end receivables in deciding where the allowance should land. And in this case, we decided that the risks were lower at the end of the second quarter than they were at the end of the first, and therefore, there was a second element to the allowance decline. Looking forward, clearly, the allowance will decline as a result of continued declines in receivables. Secondly, in my remarks, I mentioned that I thought that we'd be in a better place certainly in Q3 from a risk standpoint, so maybe there's the potential for further reduction in the allowance due to declines in risks. But obviously at some point, those risks will normalize, will stabilize and that factor, in isolation, contributing to reserve reductions will be in our past. When that might happen is a matter of a little bit of speculation. Right now, our momentum remains very, very strong in terms of dissipating risks in our Credit Card business."

Same-store sales ended up a little south of positive 2% during the quarter. The momentum we're carrying into the third quarter, therefore, is in the range of 1% to 2%. I think that the extra contribution in the third quarter from our PFresh remodels gives us comfort that a responsible outlook isn't 1% to 2%, but rather 1% to 3% for the third quarter. In sequence, in the fourth quarter, in addition to the continued strong contribution from PFresh, we believe that 5% rewards will add essentially a full point to our same-store sales performance. We haven't quantified with precision what that translates to in the fourth quarter, but certainly, each of us could add one percentage point to 1% to 3% and come up with a responsible range. But that's not something that we typically do farther out than one quarter. But 1% to 3% seems responsible in the third quarter for the reasons I outlined. 5% rewards on top of everything else we have going on, all else being equal, will add up nearly a full percentage point, plus or minus a full percentage point to our fourth quarter results."

Good morning, and welcome to Target's 2010 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising.",1277,"Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Target's 2010 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising.
This morning, I'll provide a high-level overview of our third quarter performance, then Kathy will share recent guest insights, discuss category results and describe our merchandising and marketing plans for the fourth quarter. And finally, Doug will provide more detail on our third quarter financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Following Doug's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.
We are pleased with our third quarter financial results, which reflect strong performance in our core businesses, as well as favorability in our third quarter income tax rate that Doug will explain in a few minutes. Our comparable store sales increased 1.6%, reflecting the lift from our remodel program along with a modest comp increase in the underlying business. Traffic continued to increase more than 2% in the third quarter, even against the harder comparison presented by last year's third quarter when traffic began to increase for the first time in 2009. Traffic has been healthy across the chain in 2010, particularly in our remodeled stores. And in the last two weeks of the quarter, both traffic and sales benefited from the launch of our new 5% REDcard rewards program, which is being enthusiastically embraced by our guests.
Our sales continued to reflect the underlying economic challenges facing our guests, resulting in volatility from week-to-week and across categories. We continue to enjoy strong sales in nondiscretionary categories like food, healthcare and household commodities, but we're also pleased with recent results in discretionary categories like Beauty and Women's Apparel. These categories offer our guests a well-edited assortment of both fashion and basic items that combine compelling value, quality and style.
Disciplined control of expenses has played a key role in our strong financial performance this year. Our teams are focused on smart expense control, maximizing opportunities to enhance productivity by eliminating non-value added work without compromising the guest experience. While this thinking is applied across the company, our stores teams continue to set the standard by consistently delivering meaningful productivity improvements while maintaining or improving guest service and reliability measures in our guest surveys. This is a testament to the leadership within our stores organization and to the dedication of our 300,000 store team members.
Our Credit Card segment continues to deliver outstanding performance. Both profit dollars and pretax returns in this segment more than doubled from a year ago. This performance was a result of superb execution in a very tough environment, particularly as we began to comply with new late fee regulations. And of course, beyond profitability, the Credit Card segment is completely integrated with our retail strategy, providing platform for our new REDcards rewards loyalty program.
While consumers remain conservative in their purchasing behavior, we're encouraged by recent signs in the broader economy that may signal somewhat stronger and more stable sales in the coming months. For example, job market statistics have improved in recent weeks. We believe that consumers, regardless of their political views, are relieved to have the uncertainties surrounding recent elections behind them. And looking ahead, we believe that consumers would likely respond positively to a decision regarding the expiration of the Bush era tax cuts, particularly if they were extended or made permanent.
While some current signals are more positive, we continue to plan our business cautiously. We believe it's prudent to manage our expenses and inventories to accommodate a slow pace of economic recovery while continuing to innovate and pursue initiatives that drive top line growth. 
In the third quarter, we opened 10 new stores, completing our 2010 new store program. We also completed well over 100 remodels, bringing our total for the year to 341, nearly 4x the number we've completed in any other year in company history. Combining these projects with the PFresh stores we had in place at the beginning of the year, we are now operating 462 general merchandise stores that incorporate this expanded food layout and in addition, we have hundreds of locations reflecting our updated store design in Beauty, Home, Electronics, Video Games and Shoes.
While we expect to slowly ramp up new store growth in the next few years, we don't plan to back off our ambitious program to update existing stores. In 2011, we expect to set a new record by remodeling about 380 additional stores. Including approximately 20 new store projects, we expect to add about 400 additional locations that incorporate our precious thinking in store design, layout and presentation. And while we're very pleased with the execution of the 2010 remodel program, we believe we can improve the process in 2011, meaningfully reducing the disruption experienced by our guests while helping our stores teams manage the process more efficiently.
As we look at our potential growth for beyond 2011, we're excited about the progress we've made in the development of a smaller format, and we expect to have a few locations of this concept open in 2012. In addition, we're monitoring opportunities to open stores outside the 50 states, focusing in the intermediate term on potential opportunities in Puerto Rico and Canada. And of course we believe we have an opportunity to open hundreds of additional locations of our current formats in the United States. Conditions in the commercial real estate market have limited these opportunities in the short term, but we expect conditions to improve slowly in the next few years.
As I look ahead to the fourth quarter, I'm very pleased with the foundation that has been built through the hard work of our teams this year. Our store base has never been in better condition, and we've got two game-changing strategies, PFresh and 5% rewards, that will drive our performance in the fourth quarter and for years to come. From conversations with many of you, I know there's a lot of enthusiasm about these programs and also that some of you still have questions about how these strategies will play out and result. I'm more confident than ever that these strategies will deliver incremental sales while maintaining our current healthy retail operating margin. However, beyond the financial value of these programs, I'm excited because these initiatives are great for our guests, delivering both convenience and value.
At Target, we constantly challenge ourselves to focus first on our guests, understanding their needs today while anticipating what they will want and need tomorrow. Both of these strategies are reflection of this focus, and the guest response confirms their relevance. 
I want to thank the Target team for their unbelievable efforts that have put us in a strong position we're in today. I share their passion to ensure that Target continues to be our guests' favorite shopping, one-stop shopping destination with an unbeatable combination of fashion, quality, value and a great guest experience. I'm confident that this outstanding team will keep us at the forefront of retail for many years to come.
Now Kathy will provide detail on our guest insights research and merchandising and marketing plans for the fourth quarter. Kathy?"

During the third quarter, our merchandising and marketing teams continued to innovate and drive initiatives designed to surprise and delight our guests. From game-changing merchandising reinventions to our loyalty-inspired 5% REDcard reward",1350,"Thanks, Gregg. During the third quarter, our merchandising and marketing teams continued to innovate and drive initiatives designed to surprise and delight our guests. From game-changing merchandising reinventions to our loyalty-inspired 5% REDcard rewards program and our distinctive ""life's a moving target"" marketing campaign, we continue to find new ways to remain relevant in our guests' lives. 
One of the ways we stay connected to our guests is through a considerable investment of time and resources to help us understand their shifting attitudes and preferences, creating insights into their evolving wants and needs. Through these efforts, we know that guests continue to be very deliberate in their shopping behavior. The recession taught them to create and live within budgets. And even as the economy improves, they continue to shop with a list. More recently, guests have started to put an occasional indulgence on that list. In those cases, they're willing to wait and save for the right item rather than settling for a substitute item at a lower price point.  To feel good about these occasional indulgences, guests focus intently on price and value in their everyday purchases. 
Our third quarter results reflect these cross-currents in the consumer environment. We continue to gain market share in categories throughout the store with meaningful gains in beauty, baby, apparel, toys, healthcare and, of course, grocery. In fact, mature sales in grocery continue to grow at a double-digit pace as guests are attracted to our quality and great prices, particularly in our newly remodeled stores where guests tell us they love our expanded assortment. Sales in beauty have been strong all year. In both women's and men's apparel, third quarter mature sales growth outpaced the overall company even though we faced tough prior-year comparisons.
Third quarter sales in home were driven by seasonal categories as guests responded to our back-to-school and back-to-college offering. Third quarter Electronic sales remained soft. Though in October, we began to see improved results as guests responded to declining TV price points, new video game items like Xbox Connect, red DSi and Wii system. And in Entertainment, which has become a very hit-driven business, we saw great success with the new Taylor Swift album, which includes tracks exclusive to Target. In its first week, this release sold more units than any other album in our history. These results demonstrate that even in a tough environment, we continue to find new ways to satisfy our guests, wants and needs and deliver on our ""Expect More. Pay Less"" brand promise. 
As we move into the frenzy of the holiday season, we're continuing to focus on delighting our guests by offering compelling assortments and exceptional value. As always, we expect the season to be highly competitive and promotional, so we are planning tremendous deals across every department throughout the season. And of course, every time a guest uses one of our REDcards, they can receive an additional 5% off our already great prices. This year's Toy catalog features more toys than ever before, and guests will be delighted to find even more discounts this holiday season. The catalog features 48 coupons, including 50% off top brands like Thomas & Friends, FurReal and Trio Building Systems by Fisher-Price.
From popular Barbie dolls to Zhu Zhu Pets, well-known LEGO block to NERF, there is something for every child on our guests' shopping list this year. New this year to the storewide holiday catalog, a tear-out “kids” insert allows parents to give kids their own catalog highlighting the items they care most about. Also, guests can scan the catalog's quick response codes with their smartphone and go directly online to further explore items of interest. Just one more innovative way Target is inspiring guests this holiday.
In apparel and accessories, designer partnerships continue to be an important part of our commitment to offering guests unique styles at affordable prices. This holiday season, we'll share on-trend fashion and accessories with guests through a number of exciting designer partnerships. We'll wrap up our very successful partnership with British luxury handbag designer, Mulberry at the end of the month. Through December 26, guests can experience beautiful and distinctive jewelry from Temple St. Clair. And beginning December 19, we'll round out our holiday assortment in Apparel and Accessories with the William Rast clothing line, founded by American music star Justin Timberlake and his business partner, Trace Ayala. The line will feature premium denim, leather, outerwear and sportswear for men and women.
Beginning this Sunday, to help guests beat the crowds on Black Friday, Target will offer a pre-Thanksgiving four-day sale, offering deep discounts on toys, electronics and more. Coupons will be available on Sunday's weekly ad to provide even greater value on hot holiday gifts. While our stores are closed for Thanksgiving, guests can get a jump start on their holiday deals during target.com's exclusive one-day online Thanksgiving day event, where they'll find online-only deals not available in the two-day sale. We also will be offering our biggest free shipping event ever, covering more than 800,000 items from December 21 through December 11, when guests spend $50 or more on select items. 
On Black Friday, our stores will open at 4:00 a.m., one hour earlier than last year. In addition, Target's two-day sale will feature spectacular savings on apparel, electronics, entertainment, home, toys and more. For guests to spend $100 or more before 10:00 a.m. on Black Friday, Target will provide a $10 gift card for a future day of shopping. Beginning today, guests can visit target.com for more information about the two-day sale and sign up for alerts. 
Beyond great prices, we know that our guests expect a great store experience, even on a crazy day like Black Friday. Target is committed to providing a convenient and safe shopping environment, and we've worked hard to ensure our guests can get in and out of our stores easily. Beginning two days before Black Friday, store maps will be available for guests to download to their mobile devices or print from target.com to help better navigate the store and conveniently find our door buster. Target team members will also provide printed maps to guests waiting in line on Friday morning. And extra team members will be in stores directing traffic at the check lanes to help guests get their gifts and get home quickly.
To ensure our guests know all about our exciting holiday merchandise and great prices, Target is leveraging highly visible marketing vehicles, such as our weekly ad, catalogs and in-store signage. Our broadcast campaign will remind guests that Target is the place to find great gifts and inspiration for holiday decor and entertaining. For the two-day sale, we're bringing back comedienne, Maria Bamford, as an obsessed hyper-shopper. These spots begin running today. 
One of our goals this year was to capture the modern holiday spirit in song to find these authentic, modern-day Christmas carols, holiday tunes that reflect our lives as we live them right now. We reached out to more than 50 bands, big, small, independent, and ask them to write a song to celebrate the joy of the season. We're pleased to be featuring the top tracks of our holiday campaign,, and we're offering them as free download to our guests on target.com.
Through it all, we want to demonstrate that we are uniquely equipped to help guests conquer the stress of the holiday season through our amazing prices, outstanding assortments and convenient and friendly shopping experience. We're pleased with our performance through the first nine months of the year, believe our inventory is appropriately planned for the all-important fourth quarter, and are excited about the plans we have in place to drive our sales throughout the holiday season. As long as we continue to listen to our guests, make their lives easier, save them money and help them to indulge in small ways, we believe we will continue to be their favorite place to shop, driving market share gains today and well into the future. Now Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for the remainder of the year. Doug?"

In my remarks today, I'll review our third quarter results by segment and on a consolidated basis. I'll discuss very early results from the national launch of our 5% REDcards rewards program, and I'll provide some color on our fourth quarter expectations. 
As Gregg mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter performance as each of our business segments generated solid profitability, and we continue to execute our share repurchase program at a robust pace. Our third quarter EPS of $0.74 was 28.5% ahead of last year's performance and included the benefit of a much lower income tax provision. Even without this benefit, our EPS growth rate was well in the double digits.
In our Retail segment, overall sales grew 3.0%, the result of the combined effect of a 1.6% increase in comparable store sales and the contribution to our sales growth from new stores. Same-store traffic or transaction count increased 2.1% and was offset by a half-point decline in average transaction size. Net of remodel-related disruptions, our PFresh stores contributed about 0.09% of a percentage point to our same-store sales growth. 
In light of the October completion of this year's remodel program, today, we operate 462 PFresh stores. And together with our 251 Super Target stores, our guests now enjoy fresh food assortments in about 40% of the 1,752 stores in our chain.
In the quarter, our Retail segment EBIT grew slightly faster than our overall sales, which led to our best third quarter EBIT margin rate in the past several years. As a reminder, the third quarter is our seasonally lowest quarter on this key measure of profitability. There were no remarkable changes or issues to call out on gross margin or SG&A expenses in the quarter. More specifically, the impact on gross margin rate of sales mix was essentially neutral in the quarter. 
Strong Credit Card segment performance continued in the quarter due to sequential improvement in many measures of risk, including delinquencies and write-offs. These favorable trends led to a sharp reduction in the bad debt expense recorded in the quarter, which was the biggest factor driving our increased in segment profit from $60 million last year to $130 million this year.
We ended the quarter with an allowance of $775 million or 11.5% of receivables compared with $851 million or 12.2% of receivables at the beginning of the quarter. The majority of this $76 million reduction was the result of improving risks in the quarter, with sequential declines in receivables making up the rest.
Beyond segment-specific performance, we enjoyed an unusually low effective income tax rate in the third quarter as favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters increased our third quarter EPS by approximately $0.06. Our enterprise continues to generate far more cash than necessary to fund all of the capital we believe is appropriate to reinvest in our core business and to fund our dividend. As a note, we began trading x our $0.25 dividend today. 
Strong cash generation together with an attractive share price allowed for another robust round of share repurchase in the third quarter. We acquired just over 15 million shares at an average price of $52.29 for a total investment of $793 million. In just nine months, we have repurchased more than 40 million of our shares, representing more than 5% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. 
Before I turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter, I want to provide an early read on the results we've enjoyed since the mid-October national launch of our 5% REDcard rewards program. As you know under this program, guests who use either a Target credit card or a Target debit card receive an immediate 5% off at point of sale. So far, the results are fully meeting our expectations. As expected, issuance of credit and debit cards is sharply higher since the launch. And usage of our cards measured as a percent of our sales, a statistic we call penetration, has increased as well, reversing a decade-long trend in four short weeks.
As you see in today's press release, we've added a table to the Retail segment page showing our REDcard penetration separately by credit and debit products. Specifically through the first four weeks since the national launch, sales penetration on our cards has averaged about 1.3 percentage points above last year compared with a 0.4 percentage points decline we were running year-to-date through the second week of October. 
Based on our experience that nearly half of incremental card penetration represents incremental sales, we continue to estimate that this program will drive about a percentage point of same-store sales in the fourth quarter, and between one and two full points in 2011. In Kansas City, you'll recall that our sales lift was heavily concentrated among a subset of the 10% of Target guests who ring up nearly half of our sales. So far, it appears that a similar concentration is taking shape nationally.
Now let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook. In our Retail segment, we continue to believe that our merchandising and marketing execution, combined with the impacts of 5% REDcard rewards and our remodel program, will lead to an increase in the pace of our same-store sales. For the quarter, we believe we are likely to enjoy growth in same-store sales in the 2% to 4% range. By the way, we need to beat our first quarter 2010 performance of 2.8% on this metric to deliver on Gregg's press release quote this morning. We're further encouraged by our sales results through the first two weeks of November, which have run in the mid-single digits on a same-store basis.
Overall, we expect to produce EBITDA and EBIT margin rates consistent with last year's performance in the fourth quarter as we believe favorable leverage of SG&A and depreciation expenses will offset the gross margin rate declines associated with our two key sales building initiatives. In our Credit Card segment, we expect results to reflect trends you've seen so far this year, although likely reflecting more moderate rates of improvement. We expect the year-over-year receivables declines in the fourth quarter to be in line with our experience so far this year, even with a small increment of premium FICO receivables resulting from the 5% REDcard reward program. 
The dollar value of expected write-offs should be consistent with our third quarter experience. And again, we'd expect our bad debt expense to be lower than write-offs. Just how much lower will be determined largely by the degree of improvement in risks in our existing portfolio and to a lesser extent, by seasonal dynamics.
Beyond the performance of our two segments, we expect to continue to repurchase our shares at what we believe will turn out in hindsight to have been highly attractive levels. The current median First Call estimate for our fourth quarter earnings per share is $1.38. Based on our expectations, we believe this is a reasonable, single-point estimate within a range of possible outcomes. Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks."

So as you know, our assortments are fairly segmented within food, depending on the market that we're going into. Of course, we expanded our food footprint across all areas of food, adding the fresh but as well as expanding other categories like dry, dairy and frozen. And so we were able to bring in much more SKUs, much more items across all of the food area. And we have segmented that by market where appropriate to local preferences. So we have learned a lot as we've gone along. Mostly I would say, not any big revelation, I think, I would qualify it more as tweaking, the fresh product is really the most wanted items on the guests' list every week. And so those are pretty stable across all markets. Where we get into kind of specifics by market, whether that's snack or just different items within dry, dairy or frozen that are specific to that market, we've seen different rates of sales maybe than we expected, but not necessarily brands or items that we didn't anticipate. Throughout the rest of the store, some of those areas were shrinking, of course, to make room for food in those remodels, and so we were decreasing assortments in those cases. And for the most part, I would say that they correlated with some new presentations. For example, in beauty, with Destination Beauty, we were changing how we were presenting the products and editing at the same time. Same with home. Same with electronics. And so within that, we're now going back in and looking at productivity to make sure that we've made the right choices and that we haven't eliminated SKUs that guests really cared about.

We've shortened the cycle time of disruption on the sales floor. We're going to be better and smarter at sequencing the work that we do within the sales floor, and then just being far more attentive to making sure we're providing better guest service and redirecting the guests to when categories shift in location from one part of the store to the other. In some stores where we are not undertaking a major disruption, we call those a rightsizing. Those do not have much impact at all in the guests. The stores that are more disruptive are ones where we're really realigning the entire store and moving categories significantly from one end to the other. And we're just going to be a lot smarter having been through what we went through in 2010."

And while even though they might be buying more expensive items within beauty like skincare, it's much cheaper than perhaps what they were buying before, so it's a great value in their mind. Things like C9 and apparel, where still could be looked at as a discretionary item and yet given the marketplace and the other brands that they could buy, C9 is an incredible value. So I would tell you that we're seeing that across the store. I can give you examples, I gave you one in apparel. In home, I would tell you the trend to stay at home and cook, we're seeing some strength in the higher-end brands like kitchen essentials by Calphalon.

Clearly, we're displacing other forms of plastic payment. But of course, there are both seasonal factors and secular, longer-term factors that play here. The business is moving at the margin away from credit and toward debit. So generally speaking, this is a little more precise than, I think, we can actually measure. But generally speaking, guests who want to use credit are going to use credit whether it's ours or someone else's, and similarly for debit. On the Durbin side, who knows where that's going. One of the banks, of course, has filed a lawsuit to try to stop implementation. I think that given the competitive nature of retail, whatever the benefit might turn out to be to us and to our principal competitors is highly likely to be passed along to our guests in the form of lower pricing.

On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandisin",1281,"Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Target’s 2010 third quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathee Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising.
This morning I'll provide a high-level overview of our third quarter performance; then Kathee will share recent guest insights, discuss category results and describe our merchandising and marketing plans for the fourth quarter and finally, Doug will provide more detail on our third quarter financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Following Doug’s remarks, we’ll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we’re joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have.
Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.
We are pleased with our third quarter financial results, which reflect strong performance in our core businesses as well as favorability in our third quarter income tax rate, which Doug will explain in a few minutes. 
Our comparable store sales increased 1.6%, reflecting the lift from our remodel program; along with a modest comp increase net the underlying business. 
Traffic continued to increase more than 2% in the third quarter even against the harder comparison presented by last years third quarter when traffic began to increase for the first time in 2009. Traffic has been healthy across the chain in 2010 particularly in our remodeled stores. And in the last two weeks of the quarter, both traffic and sales benefited from the launch of our new 5% REDCard Rewards Program, which is being enthusiastically embraced by our guests.
Our sales continue to reflect the underlying economics challenges facing our guest resulting in volatility from week to week and across categories. We continue to enjoy strong sales in non-discretionary categories like food, healthcare and household commodities but we're also pleased with recent results in discretionary categories like beauty and women’s apparel. These categories offer our guests a well-edited assortment of both fashion and basic items that combine compelling value, quality and style.  
Disciplined control of expenses has played a key role in our strong financial performance this year. Our teams are focused on smart expense control, maximizing opportunities to enhance productivity by eliminating non-value added work without compromising the guest experience. While this thinking is applied across the company, our stores teams continue to set the standard by consistently delivering meaningful productivity improvements while maintaining or improving guest service and reliability measures in our guest service. This is a testament to the leadership within our stores organization and to the dedication of our 300,000 store team members. 
Our credit card segment continues to deliver outstanding performance both profit dollars and pre-tax returns in this segment more than doubled from a year ago. This performance was the result of superb execution in a very tough environment, particularly as we began to comply with new late fee regulations and of course, beyond profitability the credit card segment is completely integrated with our retail strategy providing the platform for our new REDCards Rewards Loyalty Program. While consumers remained conservative in their purchasing behavior, we're encouraged by recent finds in the broader economy that may signal somewhat stronger and more stable sales in the coming months. For example, job market statistics have improved in recent weeks. We believe that consumers regardless of their political views are relieved to have the uncertainties surrounding recent elections behind them and looking ahead, we believe that consumers would likely respond positively to a decision regarding the expiration of the Bush-Era tax cuts particularly if they were extended or made permanent.
While some current signals are more positive, we continue to plan our business cautiously. We believe it's prudent to manage our expenses and inventories to accommodate a slow paced of economic recovery while continuing to innovate and pursue initiatives that drive top line growth. 
In the third quarter, we opened 10 new stores completing our 2010 new store program. We also completed well over 100 remodels bringing our total for the year to 341, nearly four times the number we've completed in any other year in company history. Combining these projects with the PFresh stores we had in place at the beginning of the year we are now operating 462 general merchandise stores that incorporate the expanded food layout and in addition we have hundreds of locations reflecting our updated store designs in beauty, home, electronics, video games and shoes. While we expect to slowly ramp up new store growth in the next few years we don't plan to back off our ambitious program to update existing stores. 
In 2011, we expect to set a new record by remodeling about 380 additional stores. Including approximately 20 new store projects, we expect to add about 400 additional locations that incorporate our precious thinking in store design, layout and presentation. And while we're very pleased with the execution of the 2010 remodel program we believe we can improve the process in 2011, meaningfully reducing the disruption experienced by our guests while helping our stores teams manage the process more efficiently. 
As we look at our potential growth for beyond 2011, we're excited about the progress we've made in the development of a smaller format and we expect to have a few locations of this concept open in 2012. In addition, we're monitoring opportunities to open stores outside the 50 states focusing in the intermediate term on potential opportunities in Puerto Rico and Canada. And of course, we believe we have an opportunity to open hundreds of additional locations of our current formats in the United States. Conditions in the commercial real estate market have limited these opportunities in the short-term but we expect conditions to improve slowly in the next few years. 
As I look ahead to the fourth quarter, I'm very pleased with the foundation that has been built through the hard work of our teams this year. Our store base has never been in better condition and we've got two game changing strategies, PFresh and 5% Rewards that will drive our performance in the fourth quarter and for years to come.
From conversations with many of you, I know there's a lot of enthusiasm about these programs and also that some of you still have questions about how these strategies will play out in result. I'm more confident than ever that these strategies will deliver incremental sales while maintaining our current, healthy retail-operating margin. However, beyond the financial value of these programs I'm excited because these initiatives are great for our guests, delivering both convenience and value. 
 
At Target, we constantly challenge ourselves to focus first on our guests, understanding their needs today while anticipating what they will want and need tomorrow. Both of these strategies are a reflection of this focus and the guest response confirms their relevance. 
I want to thank the Target team for their unbelievable efforts that have put us in the strong position we're in today. I share their passion to ensure that Target continues to be our guests favorite shopping, one stop shopping destination with an unbeatable combination of fashion, quality, value and a great guest experience. I'm confident that this outstanding team will keep us at the forefront of retail for many years to come. 
Now Kathee will provide detail on our guest insights research and merchandising and marketing plans for the fourth quarter. Kathee?

During the third quarter our merchandising and marketing team has continued to innovate and drive initiatives to surprise and delight our guests.

During the third quarter our merchandising and marketing team has continued to innovate and drive initiatives to surprise and delight our guests. From game changing merchandising reinventions to our loyalty inspired 5%, REDCard Rewards Program and our distinctive Life's A Moving Target marketing campaign we continue to find new ways to remain relevant in our guests lives. One of the ways we stay connected to our guest is through a considerable investment of time and resources to help us understand their shifting attitudes and preferences creating insights into their evolving wants and needs. 
Through these efforts, we know that guests continue to be very deliberate in their shopping behavior. The recession taught them to create and live within budgets and even as the economy improves, they continue to shop with a list. More recently, guests have started to put an occasional indulgence on that list. In those cases, they're willing to wait and save for the right item rather than settling for a substitute item at a lower price point. To feel good about these occasional indulgences guests focus intently on price and value in their everyday purchases. 
Our third quarter results reflect these cross currents in the consumer environment. We continue to gain market share in categories throughout the store with meaningful gains in beauty, baby, apparel, toys, healthcare and of course, grocery. In fact mature sales in grocery continues to grow at a double-digit pace as guests are attracted to our quality and great prices particularly in our newly remodeled stores where guests tell us they love our expanded assortment. 
Sales in Beauty have been strong all year. In both women's and men's apparel third quarter mature sales growth outpaced the overall company even though we faced tough prior year comparisons. Third quarter sales in Home were driven by seasonal categories as guests responded to our back-to-school and back-to-college offering. Third quarter electronic sales remained soft although in October we began to see improved results as guests responded to declining TV price points, new video game items like Xbox Connect, Red DSi and Wii systems and in entertainment which has become a very hit driven business, we saw great success with the new Taylor Swift album which includes tracks exclusive to Target. In its first week, this release sold more units than any other album in our history. These results demonstrate that even in a tough environment we continue to find new ways to satisfy our guest’s wants and needs and deliver on our Expect More, Pay Less brand promise.
As we move into the frenzy of the holiday season, we're continuing to focus on delighting our guests by offering compelling assortments and exceptional value. As always, we expect the season to be highly competitive and promotional so we're planning tremendous deals across every department throughout the season. And of course, every time a guest uses one of our REDCards they can receive an additional 5% off our already great prices. 
This year’s toy catalog features more toys than ever before and guests will be delighted to find even more discounts this holiday season. The catalog features 48 coupons, including 50% off top brands like Thomas & Friends, FurReal and TRIO Building systems by Fisher-Price. From popular Barbie Dolls to Zhu Zhu Pets, well-known Lego blocks to Nerf, there's something for every child on our guest shopping list this year. New this year to the storewide holiday catalog, a tear out kids insert allows parents to give kids their own catalog highlighting the items they care most about. Also, guests can scan the catalogs quick response codes with their Smartphone’s and go directly online to further explore items of interest. Just one more innovative way Target is inspiring guests this holiday. 
In apparel and accessories, designer partnerships continue to be an important part of our commitment to offering guests unique styles at affordable prices. This holiday season we'll share on trends fashions and accessories with guests through a number of exciting designer partnerships. We'll wrap up our very successful partnership with British luxury handbag designer, Mulberry at the end of the month. Through and up to December 26 guests can experience beautiful and distinctive jewelry from Temple St. Clair and beginning December 19 we'll round out our holiday assortment in apparel and accessories with the William Rast clothing line founded by American music star Justin Timberlake and his business partner, Trace Ayala. The line will feature premium denim, leather, outerwear and sportswear for men and women. 
Beginning this Sunday, to help guests beat the crowds on Black Friday Target will offer a pre-Thanksgiving four-day sale offering deep discounts on toys, electronics and more. Coupons will be available in Sunday's weekly ad to provide even greater value on hot holiday gifts. While our stores are closed for Thanksgiving, guests can get a jumpstart on their holiday deals during Target.com's exclusive one-day online Thanksgiving Day event where they'll find online only deals not available in the two days sale. We'll also be offering our biggest free shipping event ever covering more than 800,000 items from December 21 through December 11 when guests spend $50 or more on select items. On Black Friday, our stores will open at 4:00 a.m., one hour earlier than last year. In addition, Target's two-day sales will feature spectacular savings on apparel, electronics, entertainment, home, toys and more. For guests who spend $100 or more before 10:00 a.m. on Black Friday, Target will provide a $10 gift card for a future day of shopping. 
Beginning today guests can visit Target.com for more information about the two-day sale and sign up for alerts. Beyond great prices, we know that our guest expects a great store experience even on a crazy day like Black Friday. Target is committed to providing a convenient and safe shopping environment and we've worked hard to ensure our guests can get in and out of our stores easily. Beginning two days before Black Friday store maps will be available for guests to download to their mobile devices or print from Target.com to help better navigate the store and conveniently find our door buster. Target team members will also provide printed maps to guests waiting in line on Friday morning and extra team members will be in stores directing traffic at the check lines to help guests get their gifts and get back home quickly.
  To ensure our guests know all about our exciting holiday merchandise and great prices, Target is leveraging highly visible marketing vehicles such as our weekly ad, catalogs and in store signage. Our broadcast campaign will remind guests that Target is the place to find great gifts and inspiration for holiday decor and entertaining. For the two-day sale, we're bringing back comedian Maria Bamford as an obsessed hyper shopper. These spots begin running today. 
One of our goals this year was to capture the modern holiday spirit in song. To find these authentic modern day Christmas carols, holiday tunes that reflect our lives as we live them right now, we reached out to more than 50 bands, big, small, independent and asked them to write a song to celebrate the joy of the season. We're pleased to be featuring the top tracks of our holiday campaign and we're offering them as free downloads to our guests on Target.com. Through it all, we wanted to demonstrate that we are uniquely equipped to help guests conquer the stress of the holiday season through our amazing prices, outstanding assortments and convenient and friendly shopping experience. 
We're pleased with our performance through the first nine months of the year, believe our inventory is appropriately planned for the all important fourth quarter and are excited about the plans we have in place to drive our sales throughout the holiday season. As long as we continue to listen to our guests, make their lives easier, save them money and help them to indulge in small ways we believe we will continue to be their favorite place to shop, driving market share gains today and well into the future.  
Now, Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for the remainder of the year. Doug?

In my remarks today, I'll review our third quarter results by segment and on a consolidated basis. I'll discuss very early results from the national launch of our 5%, REDCards Rewards Program and I'll provide some color on our fourth quarter expectations. 
As Gregg mentioned, we’re pleased with our third quarter performance as each of our business segments generated solid profitability and we continued to execute our share repurchased program at a robust pace. Our third quarter EPS of $0.74 was 28.5% ahead of last year’s performance and included the benefit of a much lower income tax provision. Even without this benefit, our EPS growth rate was well into double-digits.
In our retail segment, overall sales grew 3.0%, the results of the combined effect of 1.6% increase in comparable store sales and the contribution to our sales growth from new stores. Same store traffic or transaction count increased 2.1%, and was offset by a half point decline in average transaction size. 
Net of remodeled related disruptions, our PFresh stores contributed about nine-tenths of a percentage point to our same store sales growth. In light of the October completion of this years remodel program today we operate 462 PFresh stores and together with our 251 Super Target stores, our guests now enjoy fresh food assortments in about 40% of the 1,752 stores in our chain. 
 
In the quarter our retail segment EBIT grew slightly faster than our overall sales, which led to our best third quarter EBIT margin rate in the past several years. As a reminder, the third quarter's our seasonally lowest quarter on this key measure of profitability. 
There were no remarkable changes or issues to call out in gross margin or SG&A expenses in the quarter. More specifically the impact on 
gross margin rate of sales mix was essentially neutral in the quarter. 
Strong credit card segment performance continued in the quarter due to sequential improvement in many measures of risk including delinquencies and write-offs. These favorable trends led to a sharp reduction in the bad debt expense recorded in the quarter which was the biggest factor driving our increase in segment profit from $60 million last year to $130 million this year. We ended the quarter with an allowance of $775 million or 11.5% of receivables compared to $851 million or 12.2% of receivables at the beginning of the quarter. The majority of this $76 million reduction was the result of improving risks in the quarter with sequential declines in receivables making up the rest. 
Beyond segment specific performance, we enjoyed an unusually low affective income tax rate in the third quarter as favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters increased our third quarter EPS by approximately $0.06. Our enterprise continues to generate far more cash than necessary to fund all of the capital we believe is appropriate to reinvest in our core business and to fund our dividend. As a note, we began trading X, our $0.25 dividend today. Strong cash generation together with an attractive share price allowed for another robust round of share repurchase in the third quarter. We acquired just over 15 million shares at an average price of $52.29 for a total investment of $793 million. In just nine months, we have repurchased more than 40 million of our shares representing more than 5% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. 
Before I turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter I want to provide an early read on the results we've enjoyed since the mid-October national launch of our 5% REDCard Rewards Program. As you know, under this program guests who use either a Target credit card or a Target debit card received an immediate 5% off the point of sale. So far, the results are fully meeting our expectations. As expected issuance of credit and debit cards is sharply higher since the launch and usage of our cards measured as a percent of our sales, a statistic we call penetration has increased as well reversing a decade long trend in four short weeks. 
As you see in today's press release, we've added a table to the retail segment page showing our REDCard penetration separately by credit and debit products. Specifically, through the first four weeks since the national launch our sales penetration on our cards has averaged about 1.3 percentage points above last year compared to the 0.4 percentage point decline we were running year-to-date through the second week of October. Based on our experience that nearly half of incremental card penetration represents incremental sales we continue to estimate that this program will drive about a percentage point of same store sales in the fourth quarter and between one and two full points in 2011.  
In Kansas City, you will recall that our sales lift was heavily concentrated among a subset of a 10% of Target guests who ring up nearly half of our sales. So far, it appears that a similar concentration is taking shape nationally. 
Now let’s turn to our fourth quarter outlook. In our retail segment we continue to believe that our merchandising and marketing execution combined with the impacts of 5% REDCard Rewards and our remodel program will lead to an increase in the pace of our same store sales. For the quarter, we believe we are likely to enjoy growth in same store sales in the 2 to 4% range. By the way, we need to beat our first quarter 2010 performance of 2.8% on this metric to deliver on Gregg's press release quote this morning. We're further encouraged by our sales results through the first two weeks of November, which have run in the mid single-digits on a same store basis. 
Overall, we expect to produce EBITDA and EBIT margin rates consistent with last years performance in the fourth quarter as we believe favorable leverage of SG&A and depreciation expenses will offset the gross margin rate declines associated with our two key sales building initiatives. In our credit card segment, we expect results to reflect trends you've seen so far this year although likely reflecting more moderate rates of improvement. We expect year-over-year receivables declines in the fourth quarter to be in line with our experience so far this year even with a small increment of premium FICO receivables resulting from the 5% REDCard Reward Program. The dollar value of expected write-offs should be consistent with our third quarter experience and again we'd expect our bad debt expense to be lower than write-offs, just how much lower will be determined largely by the degree of improvement in risks in our existing portfolio and to a lesser extent by seasonal dynamics. 
Beyond the performance of our two segments we expect to continue to repurchase our shares, as what we believe will turn out in hindsight to have been highly attractive levels. The current median first call estimate for our fourth quarter earnings per share is a $1.38. Based on our expectations we believe this is a reasonable single point estimate within a range of possible outcomes. 
Now, Gregg has a few brief closing remarks.

Of course, we expanded our food footprint across all areas of food adding the Fresh but as well as expanding from other categories like Dry, Dairy and frozen. And so we were able to bring in much more items across all of the food areas and we have segmented that by market where appropriate to local preferences. So we have learned a lot as we've gone along. Mostly I would say not any big revelation. I think I would qualify it more as tweaking, the fresh product is really the most wanted items on the guests list every week so those are pretty stable across all markets. 
Where we get into specifics by market, whether that's snacks or just different items within dry, dairy or frozen that are specific to that market, we've seen different rates of sales maybe than we expected but not necessarily brands or items that we didn't anticipate. Throughout the rest of the store some of those areas we're shrinking of course to make room for food in those remodels and so we were decreasing assortment in those cases and for the most part I would say they correlated with it with some new presentation. For example in beauty, with Destination Beauty we were changing how we were presenting the product and editing at the same time. The same with home. The same with electronics and so within that we're now going back in and looking at productivity to make sure that we made the right choices and that we haven't eliminated skus by guests rally cared about but overall we feel very good about the assortments.

Looking forward it'll be bigger than 10 basis points of course but we expect to favorably leverage SG&A expenses as a result of the incremental sales by pulling it back together at EBITDA and EBIT margins.

Whether that's where it's produced or efficiencies within manufacturing and how we're cutting the fabric, using different fabrications. So we're going through the motions of making sure that right now we're designing the best apparels but at the same time with our eye on those cost increases and trying to mitigate that. And then I do think some of that will get passed on in higher retails where there warranted.

I think in sequence next year yet again will be up several hundred million but I need a little wider range around that. Half or more of the capital for the new stores is invested prior to the year of opening so one of the big drivers this year is that next year's store count in terms of new stores is bigger than this years store openings. But generally speaking a nice round number would be 2.5 billion plus or minus a fairly wide range next year versus two billion plus or minus a tight range this year.

They're shopping from their list but at the same time they're looking for great value, which Target offers in many different categories. So in some cases, beauty, they're buying beauty at Target versus other places and while even though they might be buying more expensive items within beauty, like skin care, it's much cheaper than perhaps what they were buying before so it's a great value in their minds. Things like C9 and apparel where still could be looked at a spend a discretionary item yet given the marketplace and the other brands that the could buy, C9 is an incredible value. So I would tell you that we're seeing that across the store. I can give you examples. I gave you one in apparel. In home I would tell you the trend to stay at home and cook. We're seeing some strength in the higher end brands like kitchen essentials by Calphalon so we're really seeing it across the store in many different categories but I will tell you that guests are just being selective but they are investing when it's something they really want.

Clearly we're displacing other forms of plastic payment but of course there are both seasonal factors and secular, longer-term factors at play here. The business is moving at the margin away from credit and towards debit so generally speaking this is a little bit more precise than we can actually measure but generally speaking guests who want to use credit are going to use credit whether it's ours or someone else's and similarly for debit. 
On the Durbin side who knows where that's going. One of the banks of course has filed a lawsuit to try to stop implementation. I think that given the competitiveness nature of retail whatever the benefit might turn out to be to us and to our principal competitors is highly likely to be passed along to our guests in the form of lower pricing. I doubt very seriously that you'll see any meaningful impact on retailer EBITDA and EBIT margin rates as a result of the Durbin amendment.

I think where we've struggled to turn the business around the most is some of the more decorative businesses or  the domestics area, which again has been improving but not to the level of say apparel, what we've experienced on the apparel side so still far more discretionary even than apparel when you compare the two and I just think that's lagging as our guest is making their budget and trying to stick with it. Some of the home products are just the most discretionary and they can go without them right now.

Good morning, and welcome to Target's 2010 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising.",1278,"Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Target's 2010 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. On the line with me today are Doug Scovanner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kathy Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising.
This morning, I'll provide a high-level overview of our third quarter performance, then Kathy will share recent guest insights, discuss category results and describe our merchandising and marketing plans for the fourth quarter. And finally, Doug will provide more detail on our third quarter financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Following Doug's remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments today via webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and Doug will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.
We are pleased with our third quarter financial results, which reflect strong performance in our core businesses, as well as favorability in our third quarter income tax rate that Doug will explain in a few minutes. Our comparable store sales increased 1.6%, reflecting the lift from our remodel program along with a modest comp increase in the underlying business. Traffic continued to increase more than 2% in the third quarter, even against the harder comparison presented by last year's third quarter when traffic began to increase for the first time in 2009. Traffic has been healthy across the chain in 2010, particularly in our remodeled stores. And in the last two weeks of the quarter, both traffic and sales benefited from the launch of our new 5% REDcard rewards program, which is being enthusiastically embraced by our guests.
Our sales continued to reflect the underlying economic challenges facing our guests, resulting in volatility from week-to-week and across categories. We continue to enjoy strong sales in nondiscretionary categories like food, healthcare and household commodities, but we're also pleased with recent results in discretionary categories like Beauty and Women's Apparel. These categories offer our guests a well-edited assortment of both fashion and basic items that combine compelling value, quality and style.
Disciplined control of expenses has played a key role in our strong financial performance this year. Our teams are focused on smart expense control, maximizing opportunities to enhance productivity by eliminating non-value added work without compromising the guest experience. While this thinking is applied across the company, our stores' teams continue to set the standard by consistently delivering meaningful productivity improvements while maintaining or improving guest service and reliability measures in our guest surveys. This is a testament to the leadership within our stores organization and to the dedication of our 300,000 store team members.
Our Credit Card segment continues to deliver outstanding performance. Both profit dollars and pretax returns in this segment more than doubled from a year ago. This performance was a result of superb execution in a very tough environment, particularly as we began to comply with new late fee regulations. And of course, beyond profitability, the Credit Card segment is completely integrated with our retail strategy, providing the platform for our new REDcards rewards loyalty program.
While consumers remain conservative in their purchasing behavior, we're encouraged by recent signs in the broader economy that may signal somewhat stronger and more stable sales in the coming months. For example, job market statistics have improved in recent weeks. We believe that consumers, regardless of their political views, are relieved to have the uncertainties surrounding recent elections behind them. And looking ahead, we believe that consumers would likely respond positively to a decision regarding the expiration of the Bush era tax cuts, particularly if they were extended or made permanent.
While some current signals are more positive, we continue to plan our business cautiously. We believe it's prudent to manage our expenses and inventories to accommodate a slow pace of economic recovery while continuing to innovate and pursue initiatives that drive top line growth. 
In the third quarter, we opened 10 new stores, completing our 2010 new store program. We also completed well over 100 remodels, bringing our total for the year to 341, nearly 4x the number we've completed in any other year in company history. Combining these projects with the PFresh stores we had in place at the beginning of the year, we are now operating 462 general merchandise stores that incorporate this expanded food layout and in addition, we have hundreds of locations reflecting our updated store design in Beauty, Home, Electronics, Video Games and Shoes.
While we expect to slowly ramp up new store growth in the next few years, we don't plan to back off our ambitious program to update existing stores. In 2011, we expect to set a new record by remodeling about 380 additional stores. Including approximately 20 new store projects, we expect to add about 400 additional locations that incorporate our freshest thinking in store design, layout and presentation. And while we're very pleased with the execution of the 2010 remodel program, we believe we can improve the process in 2011, meaningfully reducing the disruption experienced by our guests while helping our stores teams manage the process more efficiently.
As we look at our potential growth for beyond 2011, we're excited about the progress we've made in the development of a smaller format, and we expect to have a few locations of this concept open in 2012. In addition, we're monitoring opportunities to open stores outside the 50 states, focusing in the intermediate term on potential opportunities in Puerto Rico and Canada. And of course we believe we have an opportunity to open hundreds of additional locations of our current formats in the United States. Conditions in the commercial real estate market have limited these opportunities in the short term, but we expect conditions to improve slowly in the next few years.
As I look ahead to the fourth quarter, I'm very pleased with the foundation that has been built through the hard work of our teams this year. Our store base has never been in better condition, and we've got two game-changing strategies, PFresh and 5% rewards, that will drive our performance in the fourth quarter and for years to come. From conversations with many of you, I know there's a lot of enthusiasm about these programs and also that some of you still have questions about how these strategies will play out in results. I'm more confident than ever that these strategies will deliver incremental sales while maintaining our current healthy retail operating margin. However, beyond the financial value of these programs, I'm excited because these initiatives are great for our guests, delivering both convenience and value.
At Target, we constantly challenge ourselves to focus first on our guests, understanding their needs today while anticipating what they will want and need tomorrow. Both of these strategies are reflection of this focus, and the guest response confirms their relevance. 
I want to thank the Target team for their unbelievable efforts that have put us in a strong position we're in today. I share their passion to ensure that Target continues to be our guests' favorite shopping, one-stop shopping destination with an unbeatable combination of fashion, quality, value and a great guest experience. I'm confident that this outstanding team will keep us at the forefront of retail for many years to come.
Now Kathy will provide detail on our guest insights research and merchandising and marketing plans for the fourth quarter. Kathy?"

During the third quarter, our merchandising and marketing teams continued to innovate and drive initiatives designed to surprise and delight our guests. From game-changing merchandising reinventions to our loyalty-inspired 5% REDcard reward",1352,"Thanks, Gregg. During the third quarter, our merchandising and marketing teams continued to innovate and drive initiatives designed to surprise and delight our guests. From game-changing merchandising reinventions to our loyalty-inspired 5% REDcard rewards program and our distinctive ""life's a moving target"" marketing campaign, we continue to find new ways to remain relevant in our guests' lives. 
One of the ways we stay connected to our guests is through a considerable investment of time and resources to help us understand their shifting attitudes and preferences, creating insights into their evolving wants and needs. Through these efforts, we know that guests continue to be very deliberate in their shopping behavior. The recession taught them to create and live within budgets. And even as the economy improves, they continue to shop with a list. More recently, guests have started to put an occasional indulgence on that list. In those cases, they're willing to wait and save for the right item rather than settling for a substitute item at a lower price point.  To feel good about these occasional indulgences, guests focus intently on price and value in their everyday purchases. 
Our third quarter results reflect these cross-currents in the consumer environment. We continue to gain market share in categories throughout the store with meaningful gains in beauty, baby, apparel, toys, healthcare and, of course, grocery. In fact, mature sales in grocery continue to grow at a double-digit pace as guests are attracted to our quality and great prices, particularly in our newly remodeled stores where guests tell us they love our expanded assortment. Sales in beauty have been strong all year. In both women's and men's apparel, third quarter mature sales growth outpaced the overall company even though we faced tough prior-year comparisons.
Third quarter sales in home were driven by seasonal categories as guests responded to our back-to-school and back-to-college offering. Third quarter Electronic sales remained soft. Though in October, we began to see improved results as guests responded to declining TV price points, new video game items like Xbox Connect, Red DSi and Wii system. And in Entertainment, which has become a very hit-driven business, we saw great success with the new Taylor Swift album, which includes tracks exclusive to Target. In its first week, this release sold more units than any other album in our history. These results demonstrate that even in a tough environment, we continue to find new ways to satisfy our guests' wants and needs and deliver on our ""Expect More. Pay Less"" brand promise. 
As we move into the frenzy of the holiday season, we're continuing to focus on delighting our guests by offering compelling assortments and exceptional value. As always, we expect the season to be highly competitive and promotional, so we are planning tremendous deals across every department throughout the season. And of course, every time a guest uses one of our REDcards, they can receive an additional 5% off our already great prices. This year's Toy catalog features more toys than ever before, and guests will be delighted to find even more discounts this holiday season. The catalog features 48 coupons, including 50% off top brands like Thomas & Friends, FurReal and Trio Building Systems by Fisher-Price.
From popular Barbie dolls to Zhu Zhu Pets, well-known LEGO block to NERF, there is something for every child on our guests' shopping list this year. New this year to the storewide holiday catalog, a tear-out “kids” insert allows parents to give kids their own catalog highlighting the items they care most about. Also, guests can scan the catalog's quick response codes with their smartphone and go directly online to further explore items of interest. Just one more innovative way Target is inspiring guests this holiday.
In apparel and accessories, designer partnerships continue to be an important part of our commitment to offering guests unique styles at affordable prices. This holiday season, we'll share on-trend fashion and accessories with guests through a number of exciting designer partnerships. We'll wrap up our very successful partnership with British luxury handbag designer, Mulberry at the end of the month. Through December 26, guests can experience beautiful and distinctive jewelry from Temple St. Clair. And beginning December 19, we'll round out our holiday assortment in Apparel and Accessories with the William Rast clothing line, founded by American music star Justin Timberlake and his business partner, Trace Ayala. The line will feature premium denim, leather, outerwear and sportswear for men and women.
Beginning this Sunday, to help guests beat the crowds on Black Friday, Target will offer a pre-Thanksgiving four-day sale, offering deep discounts on toys, electronics and more. Coupons will be available on Sunday's weekly ad to provide even greater value on hot holiday gifts. While our stores are closed for Thanksgiving, guests can get a jump start on their holiday deals during target.com's exclusive one-day online Thanksgiving Day event, where they'll find online-only deals not available in the two-day sale. We also will be offering our biggest free shipping event ever, covering more than 800,000 items from December (sic) [November] 21 through December 11, when guests spend $50 or more on select items. 
On Black Friday, our stores will open at 4:00 a.m., one hour earlier than last year. In addition, Target's two-day sale will feature spectacular savings on apparel, electronics, entertainment, home, toys and more. For guests to spend $100 or more before 10:00 a.m. on Black Friday, Target will provide a $10 gift card for a future day of shopping. Beginning today, guests can visit target.com for more information about the two-day sale and sign up for alerts. 
Beyond great prices, we know that our guests expect a great store experience, even on a crazy day like Black Friday. Target is committed to providing a convenient and safe shopping environment, and we've worked hard to ensure our guests can get in and out of our stores easily. Beginning two days before Black Friday, store maps will be available for guests to download to their mobile devices or print from target.com to help better navigate the store and conveniently find our door busters. Target team members will also provide printed maps to guests waiting in line on Friday morning. And extra team members will be in stores directing traffic at the check lanes to help guests get their gifts and get home quickly.
To ensure our guests know all about our exciting holiday merchandise and great prices, Target is leveraging highly visible marketing vehicles, such as our weekly ad, catalogs and in-store signage. Our broadcast campaign will remind guests that Target is the place to find great gifts and inspiration for holiday decor and entertaining. For the two-day sale, we're bringing back comedienne, Maria Bamford, as an obsessed hyper-shopper. These spots begin running today. 
One of our goals this year was to capture the modern holiday spirit in song to find these authentic, modern-day Christmas carols, holiday tunes that reflect our lives as we live them right now. We reached out to more than 50 bands, big, small, independent and asked them to write a song to celebrate the joy of the season. We're pleased to be featuring the top tracks of our holiday campaign, and we're offering them as free downloads to our guests on target.com.
Through it all, we want to demonstrate that we are uniquely equipped to help guests conquer the stress of the holiday season through our amazing prices, outstanding assortments and convenient and friendly shopping experience. We're pleased with our performance through the first nine months of the year, believe our inventory is appropriately planned for the all-important fourth quarter, and are excited about the plans we have in place to drive our sales throughout the holiday season. As long as we continue to listen to our guests, make their lives easier, save them money and help them to indulge in small ways, we believe we will continue to be their favorite place to shop, driving market share gains today and well into the future. Now Doug will provide more detail on our financial performance and expectations for the remainder of the year. Doug?"

I'll discuss very early results from the national launch of our 5% REDcards rewards program, and I'll provide some color on our fourth quarte",1175,"Thanks, Kathy. In my remarks today, I'll review our third quarter results by segment and on a consolidated basis. I'll discuss very early results from the national launch of our 5% REDcards rewards program, and I'll provide some color on our fourth quarter expectations. 
As Gregg mentioned, we're pleased with our third quarter performance as each of our business segments generated solid profitability, and we continued to execute our share repurchase program at a robust pace. Our third quarter EPS of $0.74 was 28.5% ahead of last year's performance and included the benefit of a much lower income tax provision. Even without this benefit, our EPS growth rate was well in the double digits.
In our Retail segment, overall sales grew 3.0%, the result of the combined effect of a 1.6% increase in comparable store sales and the contribution to our sales growth from new stores. Same-store traffic or transaction count increased 2.1% and was offset by a half-point decline in average transaction size. Net of remodel-related disruptions, our PFresh stores contributed about 9/10 of a percentage point to our same-store sales growth. 
In light of the October completion of this year's remodel program, today, we operate 462 PFresh stores. And together with our 251 Super Target stores, our guests now enjoy fresh food assortments in about 40% of the 1,752 stores in our chain.
In the quarter, our Retail segment EBIT grew slightly faster than our overall sales, which led to our best third quarter EBIT margin rate in the past several years. As a reminder, the third quarter is our seasonally lowest quarter on this key measure of profitability. There were no remarkable changes or issues to call out on gross margin or SG&A expenses in the quarter. More specifically, the impact on gross margin rate of sales mix was essentially neutral in the quarter. 
Strong Credit Card segment performance continued in the quarter due to sequential improvement in many measures of risk, including delinquencies and write-offs. These favorable trends led to a sharp reduction in the bad debt expense recorded in the quarter, which was the biggest factor driving our increased in segment profit from $60 million last year to $130 million this year.
We ended the quarter with an allowance of $775 million or 11.5% of receivables compared with $851 million or 12.2% of receivables at the beginning of the quarter. The majority of this $76 million reduction was the result of improving risks in the quarter, with sequential declines in receivables making up the rest.
Beyond segment-specific performance, we enjoyed an unusually low effective income tax rate in the third quarter as favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters increased our third quarter EPS by approximately $0.06. Our enterprise continues to generate far more cash than necessary to fund all of the capital we believe is appropriate to reinvest in our core business and to fund our dividend. As a note, we began trading x our $0.25 dividend today. 
Strong cash generation together with an attractive share price allowed for another robust round of share repurchase in the third quarter. We acquired just over 15 million shares at an average price of $52.29 for a total investment of $793 million. In just nine months, we have repurchased more than 40 million of our shares, representing more than 5% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. 
Before I turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter, I want to provide an early read on the results we've enjoyed since the mid-October national launch of our 5% REDcard rewards program. As you know under this program, guests who use either a Target credit card or a Target debit card receive an immediate 5% off at point of sale. So far, the results are fully meeting our expectations. As expected, issuance of credit and debit cards is sharply higher since the launch. And usage of our cards measured as a percent of our sales, a statistic we call penetration, has increased as well, reversing a decade-long trend in four short weeks.
As you see in today's press release, we've added a table to the Retail segment page showing our REDcard penetration separately by credit and debit products. Specifically through the first four weeks since the national launch, sales penetration on our cards has averaged about 1.3 percentage points above last year compared with a 0.4 percentage points decline we were running year-to-date through the second week of October. 
Based on our experience that nearly half of incremental card penetration represents incremental sales, we continue to estimate that this program will drive about a percentage point of same-store sales in the fourth quarter, and between one and two full points in 2011. In Kansas City, you'll recall that our sales lift was heavily concentrated among a subset of the 10% of Target guests who ring up nearly half of our sales. So far, it appears that a similar concentration is taking shape nationally.
Now let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook. In our Retail segment, we continue to believe that our merchandising and marketing execution, combined with the impacts of 5% REDcard rewards and our remodel program, will lead to an increase in the pace of our same-store sales. For the quarter, we believe we are likely to enjoy growth in same-store sales in the 2% to 4% range. By the way, we need to beat our first quarter 2010 performance of 2.8% on this metric to deliver on Gregg's press release quote this morning. We're further encouraged by our sales results through the first two weeks of November, which have run in the mid-single digits on a same-store basis.
Overall, we expect to produce EBITDA and EBIT margin rates consistent with last year's performance in the fourth quarter as we believe favorable leverage of SG&A and depreciation expenses will offset the gross margin rate declines associated with our two key sales building initiatives. In our Credit Card segment, we expect results to reflect trends you've seen so far this year, although likely reflecting more moderate rates of improvement. We expect the year-over-year receivables declines in the fourth quarter to be in line with our experience so far this year, even with a small increment of premium FICO receivables resulting from the 5% REDcard reward program. 
The dollar value of expected write-offs should be consistent with our third quarter experience. And again, we'd expect our bad debt expense to be lower than write-offs. Just how much lower will be determined largely by the degree of improvement in risks in our existing portfolio and to a lesser extent, by seasonal dynamics.
Beyond the performance of our two segments, we expect to continue to repurchase our shares at what we believe will turn out in hindsight to have been highly attractive levels. The current median First Call estimate for our fourth quarter earnings per share is $1.38. Based on our expectations, we believe this is a reasonable, single-point estimate within a range of possible outcomes. Now Gregg has a few brief closing remarks."

So as you know, our assortments are fairly segmented within food, depending on the market that we're going into. Of course, we expanded our food footprint across all areas of food, adding the fresh but as well as expanding other categories like dry, dairy and frozen. And so we were able to bring in much more SKUs, much more items across all of the food area. And we have segmented that by market where appropriate to local preferences. So we have learned a lot as we've gone along. Mostly I would say, not any big revelation, I think I would qualify it more as tweaking. The fresh product is really the most wanted items on the guests' list every week. And so those are pretty stable across all markets. Where we get into kind of specifics by market, whether that's snacks or just different items within dry, dairy or frozen that are specific to that market, we've seen different rates of sales maybe than we expected, but not necessarily brands or items that we didn't anticipate. Throughout the rest of the store, some of those areas were shrinking, of course, to make room for food in those remodels, and so we were decreasing assortments in those cases. And for the most part, I would say that they correlated with some new presentations. For example, in beauty, with Destination Beauty, we were changing how we were presenting the products and editing at the same time. Same with home. Same with electronics. And so within that, we're now going back in and looking at productivity to make sure that we've made the right choices and that we haven't eliminated SKUs that guests really cared about. But overall, we feel very good about the assortment."

Video games is another very large category within electronics. That's in a very mature place. The hardware systems have been out for several years.

I would say as that translates into the garment, there's a lot of things that we can do to help mitigate that, whether that's where it's produced or efficiencies within manufacturing and how we're cutting the fabric using different fabrications. So we're going through the motions of making sure right now that we're designing the best apparel, but at the same time, with our eye on those cost increases and trying to mitigate that. And then I do think some of that will get passed on in higher retails where they're warranted.

They're shopping from their lists. But at the same time, they're looking for great value, which Target offers in many different categories. So in some cases, they're buying beauty at Target versus other places. And while even though they might be buying more expensive items within beauty like skincare, it's much cheaper than perhaps what they were buying before, so it's a great value in their mind. Things like C9 and apparel, where still could be looked at as a discretionary item and yet given the marketplace and the other brands that they could buy, C9 is an incredible value. So I would tell you that we're seeing that across the store. I can give you examples, I gave you one in apparel. In home, I would tell you the trend to stay at home and cook, we're seeing some strength in the higher-end brands like Kitchen Essentials by Calphalon. So we're really seeing it across the store in many different categories. But I would tell you that guests are just being selective, but they are investing when it's something that they really want."

Clearly, we're displacing other forms of plastic payment. But of course, there are both seasonal factors and secular, longer-term factors at play here. The business is moving at the margin away from credit and toward debit. So generally speaking, this is a little more precise than, I think, we can actually measure. But generally speaking, guests who want to use credit are going to use credit whether it's ours or someone else's, and similarly for debit. On the Durbin side, who knows where that's going. One of the banks, of course, has filed a lawsuit to try to stop implementation. I think that given the competitive nature of retail, whatever the benefit might turn out to be to us and to our principal competitors is highly likely to be passed along to our guests in the form of lower pricing. I doubt very seriously that you'll see any meaningful impact on retailer EBITDA and EBIT margin rates as a result of the Durbin amendment."

I think where we've struggled to really turn the business around the most has been in some of the more decorative businesses or the domestics area, which again has been improving. But not to the level of, say, apparel, what we've experienced on the apparel side. So still far more discretionary even than apparel when you compare the two.
