Before I begin, I'd like to acknowledge the victims of the terrible tragedy in Haiti. The global Coca-Cola family continues to focus its efforts and resources in support of the millions of Haitians who are suffering following last month's devastating earthquake, and I'd like to urge everyone who's listening to this call to contribute to one of the many worthy organizations that are helping to provide relief in this time of great need.Now let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased to report that we ended 2009 with solid growth for both the quarter, as well as the full year. We achieved this through strong system alignment, guided by the shared values and strategies in our 2020 Vision, which is our roadmap for winning together with our bottling partners. As we enter a new decade, I'm pleased to say that the foundation of our business, our wonderful dynamic brands, our strong financial position and our unmatched global footprint is stronger than ever. Our global share is growing, this is our 10th consecutive quarter of winning total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share. At the same time, we are generating consistently strong and steady cash flow, while investing in our business for the long term. We are also thinking and acting like an integrated global enterprise, while intensifying our local focus. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver consistent, long-term sustainable results as we usher in another exciting decade of growth for our Coca-Cola system. This past quarter, we delivered strong international unit case volume growth of 6% cycling 6% growth from the prior-year quarter. And total worldwide unit case volume increased 5% cycling 4%. I think it is important to remember that we achieved these results despite the ongoing impact of the global recession across many markets. Strong economic headwinds are still impacting the broader consumer good sector, especially in the developed world. Key international markets are fueling significant volume growth for us. China was up 29% in the fourth quarter, the 26th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. For the full year 2009, China was up 16%. This has widened the share gap against our primary competitor in this key market. India was up 20% for the quarter and 31% for the full year. We've captured volume and value share across both the sparkling and still categories for the quarter and the year. And in Latin America, we delivered consistent growth across our entire portfolio, also gaining share in both the sparkling and still categories for the quarter and also for the year. Brazil was up 8% for the quarter and 4% for 2009 full year and Mexico was up 4% for the quarter and 6% for the full year.Just to put this in perspective, the 2009 incremental volume from China, India and Mexico and Brazil, four countries alone, was equal to adding another, Germany, our sixth largest market to our business. No question, absolute growth is vital. That said, we remain laser-focused on delivering profitable growth. Today, we are pleased to report full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth of 7%. This is in line with our long-term growth target, which we have met or exceeded for the fourth straight year.Equally important, we continue to implement three consistent strategies with our bottling partners. The first is investing ahead of demand in emerging markets; secondly, maximizing capture of value in developing markets; and thirdly, driving profitable growth in developed markets. Along with our global bottling partners, we are winning together locally by effectively executing these strategies in order to best serve each market's unique consumer and customer needs. Our results are a testament to our seasoned system-wide operating teams, who regardless of the market condition, remain focused on engaging consumers, providing value for our customers and building our brand.We shared our 2020 Vision with many of you during our investor and media event in Atlanta last November. Now as we enter 2010 and embark on another era of growth for our Coca-Cola system, we remain very positive about the broader macro trends. We also remain firm in our belief that there is absolutely no better business than the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage business. Consumers, all around world enjoy our brands on average 86 times per year, what we refer to as our per capita consumption. Of course, there are many countries across each continent where per capita consumption is much higher. We will have many other countries like India, like China, Indonesia to name a few that are far below 86, and therefore, offer us significant growth opportunities. And as our 2009 results attest, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue capturing growth in these and all other markets.In the coming decade, as a billion new customers enter into the middle class around the world, we see great opportunity for our per capitas to continue rising. So while we are selling moments of pleasure at cents at a time, 1.6 billion servings everyday, we feel that there is tremendous opportunity, both today as well as tomorrow. And we firmly believe that our great Coca-Cola our system and our 700,000 associates who refresh the world with our brand every single day, are ideally-positioned to help us capture this opportunity and achieve and surpass the goals of our 2020 Vision.Looking forward to 2010 and beyond, we remain intently focused on what critically matters to the long-term growth and success of our business, communicating with our consumers and investing in our brands. Let me just quickly walk you through both of these priorities.First, communicating with our consumers. We have wonderful platforms in place to expand our communication and connect with consumers all across the world. Our plans include engaging consumers in a way that only Coca-Cola can, through our long-standing partnerships with the world's most iconic global sporting events, both occurring this year. First, for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, we launched the 12-month brand activation plan in Canada. We also launched the widespread program across 11 countries that includes the Olympic Torch Relay, consumer as well as customer events. In addition, our Open The Games digital experience has been fully-activated in the United States, as well as Canada and also in six European nations. In addition, we are executing our FIFA 2010 World Cup program. This global football event is the single largest sporting event in the world. It is watched in over 200 countries. Given that 2010 World Cup will be held on the African continent for the very first time, we're likely to see a global television audience of well over 1 billion viewers for the final match alone. In other words, 10 times the size of the Super Bowl. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that our FIFA 2010 activation will be our most comprehensive campaign ever. It will include global commercials, online programs, commemorative packaging and a 225-day World Cup Trophy Tour touching 86 countries.In addition to sports, we're also undertaking our most ambitious social media program ever. It is called Expedition 206, a team of three young Happiness Ambassadors traveling to the 206 countries where Coca-Cola is sold, all to seek out what makes people happy. This exciting program engages consumers both online and on the ground, allowing fans to interact with and follow our team's realtime updates as they crisscross the globe. Let me share how this program is quickly becoming a global phenomena. In January, the team spent most of their time making stops across Latin America. At the same time, the program generated nearly 400 million media imprints in China alone. And of course, our award-winning Open Happiness global campaign continues to connect with more and more consumers around the globe. At the end of 2009, the campaign was running in markets representing approximately 95% of our global Coca-Cola volume. Our most recent Open Happiness television commercials were prominently displayed during this past Sunday's Super Bowl, with MSNBC naming our Simpsons-themed Hard Times commercial, the games number one spot and our sleepwalker ranking on the top five on USA Today's ad meter. The common thread in all of these initiatives is that they enable us to speak efficiently and effectively, directly and passionately to consumers in every single nation. And they do so in a way that it's uniquely Coca-Cola, inspiring moments of optimism and happiness.Now for the second priority, let me turn to investing in our brand. As in 2009, we will maintain a relentless focus on growing our sparkling portfolio and on expanding our still beverages faster. Momentum is on our side. While unit case volume for sparkling beverages grew 1% for the full year in the fourth quarter of 2009, we saw 3% growth with our sparkling international performance, up 5%. Pacific increased sparkling beverages 9% for the quarter and 6% for the whole year. Latin America grew sparkling beverages 5% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. Eurasia and Africa sparkling beverages gained 4% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. And while sparkling beverages in Europe were down 1% for the full year due to the difficult economic challenges faced throughout the region, they were actually up 1% for the quarter.Importantly, brand Coca-Cola grew 4% this past quarter, positive proof that our strategy of winning with Coca-Cola is leading the charge for us all around the world. And while sparkling beverages in North America declined 2% in the quarter as a result of continued macroeconomic pressures, this performance was a sequential improvement relative to the first nine months of the year. In fact, let me take a moment to reflect on our sound progress in North America this past year.We made critical investments in our brand and provided greater consumer choice by developing innovative packaging and industry-leading labeling practices. Our $0.99 cold contour bottle, 2-liter contour package and a new sleek mini-cans that make portion control easy, are great examples of how we provide consumers with affordable value and our system and customers with profitable growth. In addition, Coca-Cola Zero delivered double-digit volume growth for the 15th consecutive quarter. At the same time, we expanded key initiatives and best practices to drive benefits across our North America system, including extending our incident space pricing model to bottlers representing more than 90% of our sparkling volume, further deployment of RED—right execution daily, and also, continued progress with Coca-Cola supply on track to exceed our three-year goal of $150 million in supply chain productivity. All of these are ample evidence that our North America system is operating from a position of increasing strength. Now let me move to our still beverage, which are also experiencing tremendous momentum in the market place. Overall, our global still beverage portfolio grew 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. This growth was consistent and widespread. Each of our five operating groups registered positive still beverage growth for the full year. Latin America still beverages grew 24%, expanding our portfolio of well-established and emerging brands. Both Pacific and Eurasia and Africa group still beverages gained 8% and Europe still beverages increased 2%, and North America still beverages were up 1%, growing both volume and value share in the still category for the second consecutive year. In addition, Simply, our premium North America juice brand, joined the ranks of our billion-dollar brand at retail, becoming our 14th billion-dollar brand. We see great opportunity in 2010 to grow Still beverages faster by leveraging our unique geographic footprint. Let me just give you a couple of examples. Take vitaminwater for example. By the end of 2009, vitaminwater was in 60 international cities, adhering closely to our influential model strategy of focusing on select premium outlets that build brand equity. We have captured over 20 miles of incremental shelf space in over 100,000 stores through this international expansion efforts. In 2010 we plan to expand into more influentials cities abroad, while strengthening and growing our presence in existing markets. Similarly with POWERade, we will launch our first-ever integrated campaign across our top 20 markets. These markets make up 95% of the brand's volume. All of this will be done in conjunction with our FIFA World Cup activation program. And with Minute Maid, we are leveraging a common global identity system to drive marketing productivity in our leading juice brand, while maintaining our local relevance. This also enables us to quickly expand successful brands across borders, as in the case of Minute Maid Pulpy which began in China and was launched in 11 markets by the end of 2009. We also introduced Minute Maid Pulpy in Mexico last month and plan to expand additional markets in Latin America as well as Africa in 2010.You will recall that we indicated to you at the start of last year that 2009 was going to be a challenging year for our business and in fact for all businesses. We also said that we might miss our long-term growth target in the quarter or two over the course of the year. Yet, it is clear that 2009 was a very solid year for us and we are very pleased with our results despite the challenging environment. We stay true to our word and remain confident that we will keep winning together with our great bottling partners in 2010. That said, with consumers still challenged by a mixed global recovery, there again may be bumps along the way with some quarter-to-quarter volatility still possible as we move through 2010.However, we look forward to another exciting decade of growth for our Coca-Cola system. Our 2020 Vision is clear, our strategies are sound, our system is well-positioned and we remain focused on meeting or exceeding our growth targets over the longer term, while always driving sustainable shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call over to Gary."

As Muhtar indicated in 2009, we continued to deliver consistent, sustainable quality growth, growing  volume, share and comparable currency neutral revenue and profit. Importantly, we delivered against our 2009 c",1351,"Thanks, Muhtar and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar indicated in 2009, we continued to deliver consistent, sustainable quality growth, growing  volume, share and comparable currency neutral revenue and profit. Importantly, we delivered against our 2009 commitment, growing volume and profit in line with our long-term targets on a full year basis.First, let me remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2009, we had six fewer selling days than in the same period in 2008. Now I'd try to call out the impact of these days as I review our results for this past quarter. As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.66, up 3% versus the prior year. Full year reported earnings per share were $2.93, up 18%, while comparable earnings per share were $3.6, down 3%, reflecting up large negative currency impact.For the quarter, our business delivered 5% revenue growth, driven by a 1% increase in concentrate sales and a 5% positive currency impact. We estimate fourth quarter net revenues would have been in line with our long-term targets if adjusted for the impact of the six fewer selling days. And excluding structural changes, our comparable currency neutral net revenues increased 4% for the full year. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income was flat, again impacted by the six fewer selling days that I mentioned earlier. Adjusting for that impact, we estimate the currency neutral operating income would have been ahead of our long-term growth targets. For the full year, comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7%, in line with our long-term currency neutral profit target, and in fact up 8%, adjusting for structural change.SG&A expenses were up 9% in the quarter and increased 2% on a currency neutral basis, so seven points of currency in that 9% increase. This increase was partly attributable to an increase in incentive costs, as well as an increase in pension cost due to a decline in the value plan assets in 2008 and lower discount rates.Now I do want to highlight our continued commitment to our brands. As I highlighted last quarter, we've increased our spending and point-of-sale marketing and activation programs to engage and win with consumers within the four walls of our customer outlets. When taken in combination with our direct marketing expenses, we increased our overall marketing investments for the fourth quarter and sustained them for the full year. As I shared last quarter, we expected our operating expense leverage to be negative for the fourth quarter due to the six fewer selling days. Accordingly, our leverage for the fourth quarter was slightly negative, offsetting the operating leverage benefit we reported in the first quarter, when we had five more days in the quarter.Importantly on a currency neutral basis, our operating leverage for the full year was a positive three points in line with our expectations. Our cash flow from operations increased 8% to $8.2 billion for the full year, in spite of the currency headwinds, reflecting the strength of our underlying business performance.For the full year 2009, we repurchased approximately $1.5 billion in stock, which is more than the $1 billion that I indicated in our last call. Given the strong performance of our stock in 2009, we experienced greater activity in our stock option programs in the fourth quarter and we ramped up our repurchases in response to that activity. As for 2010, we expect to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion in stock over the course of the full year.Lastly, let me touch on price mix. We achieved positive pricing for both the quarter and the full year. We're particularly pleased with these results as it was accomplished while implementing brand building affordability programs across many markets in response to the challenging consumer sentiment. As for geographic or country mix, as anticipated, our emerging markets are recovering from the global recession at a quicker rate than our developed markets, resulting in unfavorable geographic mix at a consolidated level. Therefore in the fourth quarter of 2009, we saw price mix slightly down at minus 1%, yet for the full year price mix was even, all while we grew volume and gained the global volume and value share. These results reflect our continued efforts, focus and commitment to both play and win in every type of market as they come out of this global crisis.As for 2010, it would be reasonable to expect similar price mix result to 2009, as consumer sentiment continues to improve at varying rates across our geographic portfolio. And looking beyond 2010, we would expect to see positive price mix over the long term.Now let me take a moment to provide an initial outlook on some of the other key factors that we see impacting 2010. Many of you are aware of the recent devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar and the country's designation as a hyperinflationary country for accounting purposes. As a result in the first quarter of this year, we will incur a one-time exchange loss from remeasurement of approximately $100 million, and that remeasurement of our net assets in Venezuela will be recorded below operating income. As for currencies overall, after considering current spot rates, before what we're seeing happened to the dollar this morning, the anticipated benefits of our hedging coverage, the cycling of prior-year exchange rates and impact of the Venezuela devaluation on our local operations, we expect currencies to have a slightly positive impact on operating income for the full year 2010, with the benefit more heavily weighted in the first half of 2010. And you may have seen that the dollars started weakening again this morning. We will maintain our disciplined approach to SG&A in 2010. While we'll be cycling the initial benefits of our productivity initiatives, we expect to capture between one and two points of operating leverage in 2010 from our productivity programs. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver $500 million in annual savings from this productivity initiatives by year-end 2011.From a capital expenditure standpoint, we expect to maintain our capital investment levels in line with the levels of the past several years. For 2010, our best estimate is that the full year underlying effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 23% to 23.5%. And then two other modeling items, first I'm happy to tell you we're were not going to have a day swing of five and six days like we did in '09, but we will have a day swing of one day. The first quarter of 2010 will have one less day, the fourth quarter of 2010 will have one more day. Lastly, let me take a moment to address some recent accounting rule changes as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Effective January 1 of this year, we are no longer consolidating certain entities, primarily some bottling operations. And let me emphasize this will not impact our consolidated net income earnings per share, but it will impact our 2010 reported results when compared to our '09 results, especially within our bottling investments group. Specifically, and this is for the full year 2009, the entities that were deconsolidated as the first part of this year accounted for 3% of our consolidated net revenues and 2% of our consolidated operating income. We'll let you know how this change impacts our comparable results during each quarter this year.In closing, as I look back at 2009, it was a successful year and I'm very happy with our results. Despite challenging economic conditions, we delivered against our volume and profit growth targets. We strengthened our brands, our company and our global system. And thanks to the efforts of our experienced management team and our system bottling partners, we are much better positioned as we began to emerge from this difficult economic times. So while we expect the economic environment to stay challenging in 2010, our success these past 12 months reaffirms our confidence that we will continue to gain global share and have the value of our brands and drive long-term profitable growth and value for our shareholders.

But I think you will see us striving towards exceeding the $500 million and the timeframe for that, as you know, was 2009, 2010 and 2011. But no questions, I think you need to consider that we're also cycling some of those gains."

And I think this would go for all companies and it's really, you measure that actuaries measure it at the end of each year and then you reflect that expense over the following year. And so what we saw in '09 was a result of the pretty dismal performance of all investment types coming out of '08. That hit us over $100 million of additional expense in '09, and we still got the three points of leverage. I was actually hoping to see some more leverage coming out of those pension expense numbers going down. They're going to go down somewhat, but the offset to much better investment activity and the assets going up in value is that we're not in an environment where interest rates, and this helps in some ways but it hurts in others, interest rates are kind of at historical lows. And so your discount rates are very, very low, and that offset the investment gains we had. So we're not seeing a swing in the pension expense that we had kind of hope and so, that's kind of holding us to that one to two points as well."

And we're rolling out Jugos del Valle now in almost 20 countries already, that brand. And not just in Latin America, we've also rolled it out in some other countries across the world. So we see that it's still a very small base. And again, the picture of success is for us is to grow both sparkling -- continue to grow sparkling in Latin America, as well as still and understanding that because still is coming from a much smaller base, it will grow faster.

We've been growing double digits for the past 26 consecutive quarters. 26 quarters ago, the base was significantly smaller, almost half of what the base is today. So I want to first draw your attention to that. And I want to go back to the whole notion of investing ahead of the curve. I was in China in 2008 at the opening of our Shanghai Global Innovation Center there in Shanghai and announced the $3 billion investment program in China. We're aggressively investing with our bottling partners, creating horizontal growth, creating vertical growth and expanding our outlet coverage and outlet investments in China. You've heard us talk about 6 million customers in China. Of the 6 million customers, we still got a huge way to go in order to cover all of them properly, in the way that we would say it's best practice and the right execution daily. So we continue to invest in people, train people, thousands and thousands of people every year in our Coca-Cola University China, investing in equipment, investing in distribution, investing in production. We just opened a state-of-the-art and again last year, state-of-the-art still beverage plant in China. I was there last year opening two new plants, one in the West and one in Central China, in all grading plant. So we continue to invest in China, invest in the consumer. The Olympic Games really helped our brand, us being the only sponsor of the Shanghai Expo as an international company, is again going to provide great returns for us. But I think over time, and we are now building scale, we're building relevance with our portfolio, with our brands. Brands are getting stronger, and I think, this past quarter was the first time we've widened the gap to more than 2:1 versus our principal international competitor. I think we're just getting started in China. The per capitas are still so low in China, we're just getting started. But again, it takes a lot of investment, a lot of effort to generate 0.25 billion cases of incremental growth a year in China. I think we're the only ones who can really realize that kind of growth, and you will see us continue to focus on generating annual double-digit growth rates in China. I think that's the picture of success, annual double-digit growth rates. As far as Japan is concerned, John, Japan is a very challenging environment. I'm pleased with the results in the last quarter in Japan where we continued to gain and drive share gains. But I think looking ahead, it's really important to understand that we are in the midst of extracting more savings from our system in China so we can continue to invest, increase our investment in our brands. That is the picture of success. It's more about what we can do, how quickly we can do. In Canto, we now manage two of the four bottlers in Canto where we have equity positions in those. And I think you will see us being very active in that area in structural changes going forward."

But the leverage in the fourth quarter, of the negative expense leverage in the fourth quarter, it's exactly what we expected, exactly what I referenced in the third quarter call. And it was entirely due to the six fewer selling days. Since we had 100% of the expenses, but not as many revenues because of the six fewer days, it's entirely due to that. And so you come back to how was it for the full year, it is three points of operating leverage. And again, we had expect operating leverage going forward into 2010, relative to margins in the emerging markets versus the total KO average. I'm going to give you a couple of different views on that. Number one, our view of the world is that, and you heard this from us as we took you through our 2020 Vision, our view of the world is we're going to grow volume, and we're going to grow share in every market in the world, of which where there is value. And so, we're going to grow as fast as we can grow in every market. What that means is, is particularly in an environment where we are today, where a lot of the emerging market countries are actually recovering faster than the developed markets, is giving us negative geographic mix. But the point being, we're playing to win, and we're playing to win in every market. So we're continuing to drive those. Now within, let's take some of those emerging markets. Take China, take in India, et cetera, what you see is margins that are much lower than a company average, but I would go back to, and I think we've probably talked in the past about this, if you go back 15, 20 years ago and looked at Mexico, you'd see the same thing. At the time, Mexico was delivering a lot of volume, but the margins were much lower. What you have to do is buildout, as Muhtar was talking about, as we buildout both vertically and horizontally in these markets, there is a point and this is one of the keys to our business model, there's a point where you gain that critical mass of infrastructure. And when that happens, your margins then actually start really increasing significantly faster than your volume or revenue growth. And it's because of lower marginal spend against every incremental case, if you will, because you built out that critical mass. So we will continue to buildout and grow the emerging markets. As we approach the critical mass, you'll start seeing the margins improve and coming back toward the company average. But today, yes, they are less than the company average. That's exactly what we'd expect. That's why we would expect to see even in 2010, probably some continuing pressure on total price mix. But just being very specific, we had positive pricing in every geographic group for the full year of 2009. It was geographic mix that was a negative. We expected it, we want it because we want to grow every market which we operate. So we're very happy with it. We expect it could happen again in 2010. Overall, we'll be fine and long term, we'll definitely then be come back more balanced, particularly as the rest of the world starts emerging from this economic environment in which we operate today."

You've heard me often say that when a country's reached around 100 per capita, something pretty incredible happens in that the pace of growth of bottom line significantly exceeds the pace of growth of volume of volume and revenue. And I think that is the case. It doesn't only start exactly at 100 per capita. It begins to show its positive phase even at lower per capitas. And one other reference point, I think would maybe be interesting, if you look around 10 years ago and you look at Japan's profit base for us and the world, 10 years ago, as a percent of total, was more above the 20s. In fact, sort of mid-20s. And over the last 10 years, we've grown the base significantly of our Japan profit base. But now, as a result of what's happened in the rest of the world, it's only mid-teens and not because the Japan isn't growing, it has grown.

It's an anomaly to think in that respect, but it is. Southeast Europe, Romania, Bulgaria, former Yugoslavia, countries of former Yugoslavia, as well as Russia, Ukraine, troubled in terms of where the consumer mindset is. But I think overall, our marketing has a brand strength, our marketing, our investments, our alignment with both Coca-Cola Enterprises, as well as Coca-Cola Hellenic has proven results in some of those markets in Western Europe like Italy, like France, and I think we'll continue to invest heavily in our brands. We continue to see opportunities for growth. And as far as issues in terms of what's going on in Greece, I think the international community will come to terms, and I think we're close to seeing some finalization on what will happen in terms of the current financial situation in Greece."

I think the markets are probably, and this is going to be a currency forecast, you know what those are worth, but the markets are probably have overreacted a little to risk aversion, have probably gone into the dollar and strengthened the dollar a little more than it probably should have. I think that will work itself out over the coming weeks, probably four, six weeks, eight weeks, whatever, particularly with the IMF, it looks like going in to help Greece today. That's going to help significantly, I think. So I think we'll see the dollar continue long term to weaken, but there will be these risk aversion spikes.

Before I begin, I'd like to acknowledge the victims of the terrible tragedy in Haiti. The global Coca-Cola family continues to focus its efforts and resources in support of the millions of Haitians who are suffering following last month's devastating earthquake, and I'd like to urge everyone who's listening to this call to contribute to one of the many worthy organizations that are helping to provide relief in this time of great need.Now let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased to report that we ended 2009 with solid growth for both the quarter, as well as the full year. We achieved this through strong system alignment, guided by the shared values and strategies in our 2020 Vision, which is our roadmap for winning together with our bottling partners. As we enter a new decade, I'm pleased to say that the foundation of our business, our wonderful dynamic brands, our strong financial position and our unmatched global footprint is stronger than ever. Our global share is growing. This is our 10th consecutive quarter of winning total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share. At the same time, we are generating consistently strong and steady cash flow, while investing in our business for the long term. We are also thinking and acting like an integrated global enterprise, while intensifying our local focus. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver consistent, long-term sustainable results as we usher in another exciting decade of growth for our Coca-Cola system. This past quarter, we delivered strong international unit case volume growth of 6% cycling 6% growth from the prior-year quarter. And total worldwide unit case volume increased 5% cycling 4%. I think it is important to remember that we achieved these results despite the ongoing impact of the global recession across many markets. Strong economic headwinds are still impacting the broader consumer goods sector, especially in the developed world. Key international markets are fueling significant volume growth for us. China was up 29% in the fourth quarter, the 26th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. For the full year 2009, China was up 16%. This has widened the share gap against our primary competitor in this key market. India was up 20% for the quarter and 31% for the full year. We've captured volume and value share across both the sparkling and still categories for the quarter and the year. And in Latin America, we delivered consistent growth across our entire portfolio, also gaining share in both the sparkling and still categories for the quarter and also for the year. Brazil was up 8% for the quarter and 4% for 2009 full year, and Mexico was up 4% for the quarter and 6% for the full year.Just to put this in perspective, the 2009 incremental volume from China, India, Mexico and Brazil, four countries alone, was equal to adding another, Germany, our sixth largest market to our business. No question, absolute growth is vital. That said, we remain laser-focused on delivering profitable growth. Today, we are pleased to report full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth of 7%. This is in line with our long-term growth target, which we have met or exceeded for the fourth straight year.Equally important, we continue to implement three consistent strategies with our bottling partners. The first is investing ahead of demand in emerging markets; secondly, maximizing capture of value in developing markets; and thirdly, driving profitable growth in developed markets. Along with our global bottling partners, we are winning together locally by effectively executing these strategies in order to best serve each market's unique consumer and customer needs. Our results are a testament to our seasoned system-wide operating teams, who regardless of the market condition, remain focused on engaging consumers, providing value for our customers and building our brand.We shared our 2020 Vision with many of you during our investor and media event in Atlanta last November. Now as we enter 2010 and embark on another era of growth for our Coca-Cola system, we remain very positive about the broader macro trends. We also remain firm in our belief that there is absolutely no better business than the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage business. Consumers, all around world enjoy our brands on average 86 times per year, what we refer to as our per capita consumption. Of course, there are many countries across each continent where per capita consumption is much higher. We will have many other countries like India, like China, Indonesia to name a few that are far below 86, and therefore, offer us significant growth opportunities. And as our 2009 results attest, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue capturing growth in these and all other markets.In the coming decade, as a billion new customers enter into the middle class around the world, we see great opportunity for our per capitas to continue rising. So while we are selling moments of pleasure at cents at a time, 1.6 billion servings everyday, we feel that there is tremendous opportunity, both today as well as tomorrow. And we firmly believe that our great Coca-Cola our system and our 700,000 associates who refresh the world with our brand every single day, are ideally-positioned to help us capture this opportunity and achieve and surpass the goals of our 2020 Vision.Looking forward to 2010 and beyond, we remain intently focused on what critically matters to the long-term growth and success of our business, communicating with our consumers and investing in our brands. Let me just quickly walk you through both of these priorities.First, communicating with our consumers. We have wonderful platforms in place to expand our communication and connect with consumers all across the world. Our plans include engaging consumers in a way that only Coca-Cola can, through our long-standing partnerships with the world's most iconic global sporting events, both occurring this year. First, for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, we launched the 12-month brand activation plan in Canada. We also launched the widespread program across 11 countries that includes the Olympic Torch Relay, consumer as well as customer events. In addition, our Open The Games digital experience has been fully-activated in the United States, as well as Canada and also in six European nations. In addition, we are executing our FIFA 2010 World Cup program. This global football event is the single largest sporting event in the world. It is watched in over 200 countries. Given that 2010 World Cup will be held on the African continent for the very first time, we're likely to see a global television audience of well over 1 billion viewers for the final match alone. In other words, 10 times the size of the Super Bowl. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that our FIFA 2010 activation will be our most comprehensive campaign ever. It will include global commercials, online programs, commemorative packaging and a 225-day World Cup Trophy Tour touching 86 countries.In addition to sports, we're also undertaking our most ambitious social media program ever. It is called Expedition 206, a team of three young Happiness Ambassadors traveling to the 206 countries where Coca-Cola is sold, all to seek out what makes people happy. This exciting program engages consumers both online and on the ground, allowing fans to interact with and follow our team's real-time updates as they crisscross the globe. Let me share how this program is quickly becoming a global phenomenon. In January, the team spent most of their time making stops across Latin America. At the same time, the program generated nearly 400 million media imprints in China alone. And of course, our award-winning Open Happiness global campaign continues to connect with more and more consumers around the globe. At the end of 2009, the campaign was running in markets representing approximately 95% of our global Coca-Cola volume. Our most recent Open Happiness television commercials were prominently displayed during this past Sunday's Super Bowl, with MSNBC naming our Simpsons-themed Hard Times commercial, the game’s number one spot and our Sleepwalker ranking on the top five on USA Today's ad meter. The common thread in all of these initiatives is that they enable us to speak efficiently and effectively, directly and passionately to consumers in every single nation. And they do so in a way that is uniquely Coca-Cola, inspiring moments of optimism and happiness.Now for the second priority, let me turn to investing in our brand. As in 2009, we will maintain a relentless focus on growing our sparkling portfolio and on expanding our still beverages faster. Momentum is on our side. While unit case volume for sparkling beverages grew 1% for the full year in the fourth quarter of 2009, we saw 3% growth with our sparkling international performance, up 5%. Pacific increased sparkling beverages 9% for the quarter and 6% for the whole year. Latin America grew sparkling beverages 5% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. Eurasia and Africa sparkling beverages gained 4% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. And while sparkling beverages in Europe were down 1% for the full year due to the difficult economic challenges faced throughout the region, they were actually up 1% for the quarter.Importantly, brand Coca-Cola grew 4% this past quarter, positive proof that our strategy of winning with Coca-Cola is leading the charge for us all around the world. And while sparkling beverages in North America declined 2% in the quarter as a result of continued macroeconomic pressures, this performance was a sequential improvement relative to the first nine months of the year. In fact, let me take a moment to reflect on our sound progress in North America this past year.We made critical investment in our brand and provided greater consumer choice by developing innovative packaging and industry-leading labeling practices. Our $0.99 cold contour bottle, 2-liter contour package and new sleek mini cans that make portion control easy, are great examples of how we provide consumers with affordable value, and our system and customers with profitable growth. In addition, Coca-Cola Zero delivered double-digit volume growth for the 15th consecutive quarter. At the same time, we expanded key initiatives and best practices to drive benefits across our North America system, including extending our incidence-based pricing model to bottlers representing more than 90% of our sparkling volume, further deployment of RED—right execution daily, and also, continued progress with Coca-Cola supply on track to exceed our three-year goal of $150 million in supply chain productivity. All of these are ample evidence that our North America system is operating from a position of increasing strength. Now let me move to our still beverage, which are also experiencing tremendous momentum in the market place. Overall, our global still beverage portfolio grew 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. This growth was consistent and widespread. Each of our five operating groups registered positive still beverage growth for the full year. Latin America still beverages grew 24%, expanding our portfolio of well-established and emerging brands. Both Pacific and Eurasia and Africa group still beverages gained 8% and Europe still beverages increased 2%, and North America still beverages were up 1%, growing both volume and value share in the still category for the second consecutive year. In addition, Simply, our premium North America juice brand, joined the ranks of our billion-dollar brand at retail, becoming our 14th billion-dollar brand. We see great opportunity in 2010 to grow Still beverages faster by leveraging our unique geographic footprint. Let me just give you a couple of examples. Take vitaminwater for example. By the end of 2009, vitaminwater was in 60 international cities, adhering closely to our influential model strategy of focusing on select premium outlets that build brand equity. We have captured over 20 miles of incremental shelf space in over 100,000 stores through this international expansion efforts. In 2010 we plan to expand into more influential cities abroad, while strengthening and growing our presence in existing markets. Similarly with POWERade, we will launch our first-ever integrated campaign across our top 20 markets. These markets make up 95% of the brand's volume. All of this will be done in conjunction with our FIFA World Cup activation program. And with Minute Maid, we are leveraging a common global identity system to drive marketing productivity in our leading juice brand, while maintaining our local relevance. This also enables us to quickly expand successful brands across borders, as in the case of Minute Maid Pulpy which began in China and was launched in 11 markets by the end of 2009. We also introduced Minute Maid Pulpy in Mexico last month and plan to expand additional markets in Latin America as well as Africa in 2010.You will recall that we indicated to you at the start of last year that 2009 was going to be a challenging year for our business and in fact for all businesses. We also said that we might miss our long-term growth target in the quarter or two over the course of the year. Yet, it is clear that 2009 was a very solid year for us and we are very pleased with our results despite the challenging environment. We stay true to our word and remain confident that we will keep winning together with our great bottling partners in 2010. That said, with consumers still challenged by a mixed global recovery, there again may be bumps along the way with some quarter-to-quarter volatility still possible as we move through 2010.However, we look forward to another exciting decade of growth for our Coca-Cola system. Our 2020 Vision is clear, our strategies are sound, our system is well-positioned and we remain focused on meeting or exceeding our growth targets over the longer term, while always driving sustainable shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call over to Gary."

As Muhtar indicated in 2009, we continued to deliver consistent, sustainable quality growth, growing  volume, share and comparable currency neutral revenue and profit. Importantly, we delivered against our 2009 c",1352,"Thanks, Muhtar and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar indicated in 2009, we continued to deliver consistent, sustainable quality growth, growing  volume, share and comparable currency neutral revenue and profit. Importantly, we delivered against our 2009 commitment, growing volume and profit in line with our long-term targets on a full year basis.First, let me remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2009, we had six fewer selling days than in the same period in 2008. And I’ll try to call out the impact of these days as I review our results for this past quarter. As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.66, up 3% versus the prior year. Full year reported earnings per share were $2.93, up 18%, while comparable earnings per share were $3.06, down 3%, but reflecting a large negative currency impact.For the quarter, our business delivered 5% revenue growth, driven by a 1% increase in concentrate sales and a 5% positive currency impact. We estimate fourth quarter net revenues would have been in line with our long-term targets if adjusted for the impact of the six fewer selling days. And excluding structural changes, our comparable currency neutral net revenues increased 4% for the full year. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income was flat, again impacted by the six fewer selling days that I mentioned earlier. Adjusting for that impact, we estimate the currency neutral operating income would have been ahead of our long-term growth targets. For the full year, comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7%, in line with our long-term currency neutral profit target, and in fact up 8%, adjusting for structural change.SG&A expenses were up 9% in the quarter and increased 2% on a currency neutral basis, so seven points of currency in that 9% increase. This increase was partly attributable to an increase in incentive costs, as well as an increase in pension cost due to a decline in the value plan assets in 2008 and lower discount rates.Now I do want to highlight our continued commitment to our brands. As I highlighted last quarter, we've increased our spending and point-of-sale marketing and activation programs to engage and win with consumers within the four walls of our customer outlets. When taken in combination with our direct marketing expenses, we increased our overall marketing investments for the fourth quarter and sustained them for the full year. As I shared last quarter, we expected our operating expense leverage to be negative for the fourth quarter due to the six fewer selling days. Accordingly, our leverage for the fourth quarter was slightly negative, offsetting the operating leverage benefit we reported in the first quarter, when we had five more days in the quarter.Importantly on a currency neutral basis, our operating leverage for the full year was a positive three points in line with our expectations. Our cash flow from operations increased 8% to $8.2 billion for the full year, in spite of the currency headwinds, reflecting the strength of our underlying business performance.For the full year 2009, we repurchased approximately $1.5 billion in stock, which is more than the $1 billion that I indicated in our last call. Given the strong performance of our stock in 2009, we experienced greater activity in our stock option programs in the fourth quarter and we ramped up our repurchases in response to that activity. As for 2010, we expect to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion in stock over the course of the full year.Lastly, let me touch on price mix. We achieved positive pricing for both the quarter and the full year. We're particularly pleased with these results as it was accomplished while implementing brand building affordability programs across many markets in response to the challenging consumer sentiment. As for geographic or country mix, as anticipated, our emerging markets are recovering from the global recession at a quicker rate than our developed markets, resulting in unfavorable geographic mix at a consolidated level. Therefore in the fourth quarter of 2009, we saw price mix slightly down at minus 1%, yet for the full year price mix was even, all while we grew volume and gained the global volume and value share. These results reflect our continued efforts, focus and commitment to both play and win in every type of market as they come out of this global crisis.As for 2010, it would be reasonable to expect similar price mix result to 2009, as consumer sentiment continues to improve at varying rates across our geographic portfolio. And looking beyond 2010, we would expect to see positive price mix over the long term.Now let me take a moment to provide an initial outlook on some of the other key factors that we see impacting 2010. Many of you are aware of the recent devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar and the country's designation as a hyperinflationary country for accounting purposes. As a result in the first quarter of this year, we will incur a one-time exchange loss from remeasurement of approximately $100 million, and that remeasurement of our net assets in Venezuela will be recorded below operating income. As for currencies overall, after considering current spot rates, before what we're seeing happened to the dollar this morning, the anticipated benefits of our hedging coverage, the cycling of prior-year exchange rates and impact of the Venezuela devaluation on our local operations, we expect currencies to have a slightly positive impact on operating income for the full year 2010, with the benefit more heavily weighted in the first half of 2010. And you may have seen that the dollars started weakening again this morning. We will maintain our disciplined approach to SG&A in 2010. While we'll be cycling the initial benefits of our productivity initiatives, we expect to capture between one and two points of operating leverage in 2010 from our productivity programs. Importantly, we remain on track to deliver $500 million in annual savings from this productivity initiatives by year-end 2011.From a capital expenditure standpoint, we expect to maintain our capital investment levels in line with the levels of the past several years. For 2010, our best estimate is that the full year underlying effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 23% to 23.5%. And then two other modeling items, first I'm happy to tell you we're were not going to have a day swing of five and six days like we did in '09, but we will have a day swing of one day. The first quarter of 2010 will have one less day, the fourth quarter of 2010 will have one more day. Lastly, let me take a moment to address some recent accounting rule changes as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Effective January 1 of this year, we are no longer consolidating certain entities, primarily some bottling operations. And let me emphasize this will not impact our consolidated net income earnings per share, but it will impact our 2010 reported results when compared to our '09 results, especially within our bottling investments group. Specifically, and this is for the full year 2009, the entities that were deconsolidated as the first part of this year accounted for 3% of our consolidated net revenues and 2% of our consolidated operating income. We'll let you know how this change impacts our comparable results during each quarter this year.In closing, as I look back at 2009, it was a successful year and I'm very happy with our results. Despite challenging economic conditions, we delivered against our volume and profit growth targets. We strengthened our brands, our company and our global system. And thanks to the efforts of our experienced management team and our system bottling partners, we are much better positioned as we began to emerge from this difficult economic times. So while we expect the economic environment to stay challenging in 2010, our success these past 12 months reaffirms our confidence that we will continue to gain global share and have the value of our brands and drive long-term profitable growth and value for our shareholders.

And so what we saw in '09 was a result of the pretty dismal performance of all investment types coming out of '08. That hit us over $100 million of additional expense in '09, and we still got the three points of leverage. I was actually hoping to see some more leverage coming out of those pension expense numbers going down. They're going to go down somewhat, but the offset to much better investment activity and the assets going up in value is that we're now in an environment where interest rates, and this helps in some ways but it hurts in others, interest rates are kind of at historical lows. And so your discount rates are very, very low, and that offset the investment gains we had. So we're not seeing a swing in the pension expense that we had kind of hoped and so, that's kind of holding us to that one to two points as well."

And we're rolling out Jugos del Valle now in almost 20 countries already, that brand. And not just in Latin America, we've also rolled it out in some other countries across the world. So we see that it's still a very small base.

We've been growing double digits for the past 26 consecutive quarters. 26 quarters ago, the base was significantly smaller, almost half of what the base is today. So I want to first draw your attention to that. And I want to go back to the whole notion of investing ahead of the curve. I was in China in 2008 at the opening of our Shanghai Global Innovation Center there in Shanghai and announced the $3 billion investment program in China. We're aggressively investing with our bottling partners, creating horizontal growth, creating vertical growth and expanding our outlet coverage and outlet investments in China. You've heard us talk about 6 million customers in China. Of the 6 million customers, we still got a huge way to go in order to cover all of them properly, in the way that we would say it's best practice and the right execution daily. So we continue to invest in people, train people, thousands and thousands of people every year in our Coca-Cola University China, investing in equipment, investing in distribution, investing in production. We just opened a state-of-the-art and again last year, state-of-the-art still beverage plant in China. I was there last year opening two new plants, one in the West and one in Central China, in all grading plant. So we continue to invest in China, invest in the consumer. The Olympic Games really helped our brand, us being the only sponsor of the Shanghai Expo as an international company, is again going to provide great returns for us. But I think over time, and we are now building scale, we're building relevance with our portfolio, with our brands. Brands are getting stronger, and I think, this past quarter was the first time we've widened the gap to more than 2:1 versus our principal international competitor. I think we're just getting started in China. The per capitas are still so low in China, we're just getting started. But again, it takes a lot of investment, a lot of effort to generate 0.25 billion cases of incremental growth a year in China. I think we're the only ones who can really realize that kind of growth, and you will see us continue to focus on generating annual double-digit growth rates in China. I think that's the picture of success, annual double-digit growth rates. As far as Japan is concerned, John, Japan is a very challenging environment. I'm pleased with the results in the last quarter in Japan where we continued to gain and drive share gains. But I think looking ahead, it's really important to understand that we are in the midst of extracting more savings from our system in China so we can continue to invest, increase our investment in our brands. That is the picture of success. It's more about what we can do, how quickly we can do. In Canto, we now manage two of the four bottlers in Canto where we have equity positions in those. And I think you will see us being very active in that area in structural changes going forward."

But the leverage in the fourth quarter, of the negative expense leverage in the fourth quarter, it's exactly what we expected, exactly what I referenced in the third quarter call. And it was entirely due to the six fewer selling days. Since we had 100% of the expenses, but not as many revenues because of the six fewer days, it's entirely due to that. And so you come back to how was it for the full year, it is three points of operating leverage. And again, we had expect operating leverage going forward into 2010. Relative to margins in the emerging markets versus the total KO average I'm going to give you a couple of different views on that. Number one, our view of the world is that, and you heard this from us as we took you through our 2020 Vision, our view of the world is we're going to grow volume, and we're going to grow share in every market in the world, of which where there is value. And so, we're going to grow as fast as we can grow in every market. What that means is, is particularly in an environment where we are today, where a lot of the emerging market countries are actually recovering faster than the developed markets, is giving us negative geographic mix. But the point being, we're playing to win, and we're playing to win in every market. So we're continuing to drive those. Now within, let's take some of those emerging markets. Take China, take in India, et cetera, what you see is margins that are much lower than a company average, but I would go back to, and I think we've probably talked in the past about this, if you go back 15, 20 years ago and looked at Mexico, you'd see the same thing. At the time, Mexico was delivering a lot of volume, but the margins were much lower. What you have to do is build out, as Muhtar was talking about, as we build out both vertically and horizontally in these markets, there is a point and this is one of the keys to our business model, there's a point where you gain that critical mass of infrastructure. And when that happens, your margins then actually start really increasing significantly faster than your volume or revenue growth. And it's because of lower marginal spend against every incremental case, if you will, because you built out that critical mass. So we will continue to build out and grow the emerging markets. As we approach the critical mass, you'll start seeing the margins improve and coming back toward the company average. But today, yes, they are less than the company average. That's exactly what we'd expect. That's why we would expect to see even in 2010, probably some continuing pressure on total price mix. But just being very specific, we had positive pricing in every geographic group for the full year of 2009. It was geographic mix that was a negative. We expected it, we want it because we want to grow every market which we operate. So we're very happy with it. We expect it could happen again in 2010. Overall, we'll be fine and long term, we'll definitely then be come back more balanced, particularly as the rest of the world starts emerging from this economic environment in which we operate today."

You've heard me often say that when a country's reached around 100 per capita, something pretty incredible happens in that the pace of growth of bottom line significantly exceeds the pace of growth of volume of volume and revenue. And I think that is the case. It doesn't only start exactly at 100 per capita. It begins to show its positive phase even at lower per capitas. And one other reference point, I think would maybe be interesting, if you look around 10 years ago and you look at Japan's profit base for us and the world, 10 years ago, as a percent of total, was more above the 20s. In fact, sort of mid-20s. And over the last 10 years, we've grown the base significantly of our Japan profit base. But now, as a result of what's happened in the rest of the world, it's only mid-teens and not because the Japan isn't growing, it has grown.

So I can't give you a hard and fast rule on any of them, but we do evaluate them every year as we go through our strategic plans every summer and are looking at all of them. But there is no hard and fast rule. So without naming names, I can give you an example. One of our equity investees, because we and another shareholder together jointly control the bottler, we would not want to reduce our investment because as a group, we'd probably lose control so that one’s kind of where it needs to be. So there are different reasons for different investment levels, but we're constantly looking at those. To the extent circumstances changed and we no longer needed an investment at the level we were, we will definitely look at that and might reduce them, in fact. But we've reduced them in an orderly fashion, so that we would not create any issues for other shareholders, overhangs on the stock and that kind of thing. But as of today, there are no plans to reduce any of those."

I think the markets are probably, and this is going to be a currency forecast, you know what those are worth, but the markets are probably have overreacted a little to risk aversion, have probably gone into the dollar and strengthened the dollar a little more than it probably should have. I think that will work itself out over the coming weeks, probably four, six weeks, eight weeks, whatever, particularly with the IMF, it looks like going in to help Greece today. That's going to help significantly, I think. So I think we'll see the dollar continue long term to weaken, but there will be these risk aversion spikes.

Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our first quarter results. We once again delivered consistent, profitable and sustainable growth inspired by our 2020 Vision and also fueled by our innovation and global reach.
Despite ongoing challenges in global economic conditions, we continued to invest in our business and build our brands, while generating strong and also steady cash flow. We are competing and winning around the world as one company with our global bottling partners, leveraging our unique scale as well as the increased presence of our brands.
As we announced earlier this quarter, we are taking decisive actions to strategically advance our North America business and further strengthen our franchise system in Europe. We remain confident in our ability to execute our 2020 vision, thus laying the foundation for consistent, long term, sustainable growth.
As I have mentioned on numerous occasions, we see tremendous growth opportunities for our system and for the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry over the next ten years and beyond. This past quarter, despite the lingering effects of the global recession, we delivered solid 9% operating income growth on a comparable currency neutral basis. Overall, global economic unit case volume grew a strong 3% with a significant number of international markets fueling this growth. Our growth in countries with a per capita of less than 150 was an exceptional 10%.
Let me take a moment to share in more detail our performance across our international markets. In Eurasia and Africa, we saw broad-based growth of 11%. This increase was led by India, up a strong 29%, and cycling 31%, making this our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit growth in this fast-growing nation. And while sustaining this high growth rate in India in the coming months will likely depend on weather patterns during the upcoming monsoon season, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent double digit growth for the balance of this year.
We also saw double digit growth in Turkey, Northwest Africa, Southern Eurasia, and the Middle East. Notably, we are beginning to see sequential improvement in Russia, which was down 1%, led by the strong performance of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 12% and gained share this quarter in Russia.
Latin America maintained its steady and consistent performance, up 4% overall, driven by strong 12% growth in Brazil. Our Latin Center unit was up double digits, led by Columbia which grew 19%, while our South Latin unit was up mid-single digits. Mexico, impacted by unseasonably cold weather was down 2%. But as the weather has improved, this trend has reversed, with our business generating positive growth in the month of March and despite these weather challenges in the quarter, we continue to gain total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage share in Mexico, driven by both our sparkling and our still beverages.
Our Pacific Group continued to expand up 5% in total, and led by double digit growth across Korea, Indonesia, and several other markets. Our volume performance in Japan was a sequential improvement on our performance in the last two quarters, down 3%. Despite ongoing economic headwinds, we are experiencing steady improvement in the clinical vending channel as well as strong results in the convenience store channel. This led to better performance for our Georgia Coffee business.
Our trademark Coca-Cola brands in Japan keep widening the gap against our primary competitor led by Coca-Cola Zero, which was up 24% for the quarter. In fact, since 2005, we have grown trademark Coca-Cola incremental unit case volume in Japan five times more than our main competitor has grown its trademark brands over the same period.
And I LOHAS, our fast-growing, eco-friendly natural mineral water brand launched last May is building on its market share leadership. In less than a year, it has become the number one packaged water brand in Japan.
China unit case volume grew 6%, including double-digit growth in the latter half of the quarter. This performance comes on the heels of a strong fourth quarter and a great finish to 2009, which was led by growth across our portfolio as well as new product launches. Over the past six months, our volume grew a solid 16%. And while we may see volume strengths from quarter-to-quarter, the 16% growth over the past six months was ahead of our primary international competitor.
For perspective, our China business has generated more than $100 million incremental unit cases this past six months and continues to be twice the size of our primary international competitor on an annual basis. And we are building momentum across our entire portfolio. We are advancing our sparkling business in China behind strong innovations such as the launch of Spritea, which taps into the combined popularity of green tea and Sprite.
We're expanding our winnings to beverage business through the ongoing growth of our industry-leading juice and juice drink beverages and our Minute Maid Pulpy Super Milky dairy brand. And we are kicking off an exciting new Yuan Ye led tea portfolio, launching in Yuan Ye Jasmine Tea. And as we have shared before, we're just getting started in China and remain resolute in our commitment to invest for solid long-term growth.
Now, moving to Europe. Despite the continuation of difficult economic conditions in Europe, our unit case volume growth was even for the quarter. This was an improvement over our 2009 full year results with growth across France, Belgium, the Netherlands and North Central Europe. Further, our company-owned bottlers in Europe grew well ahead of the region with Germany up mid-single digits and Nordics up low-single digits, as we build towards re-franchising both of these operations.
In the United Kingdom, we were pleased that our trademark Coca-Cola brands became the first to top the £1 billion mark in annual U.K. grocery retail sales. We are excited about our recently announced increased investments in Innocent, reflecting our belief in the long-term growth potential of the smoothie business.
Lastly and in alignment with our 2020 Vision, we recently reorganized our Europe business from 10 business units to four, making it easier for us to do business with our bottlers as well as partners as we gain significant scale, speed and simplicity.
In total, these international performance results are a testament to our seasoned operating team, which is executing our 2020 Vision quickly and also with great discipline. I can assure you that our strategy and focus to build the long-term equity of our brands remains decisively clear. This focus is reflected in the volume and value share gains we continue to realize together with our bottling partners around the world. As a system, we are pulling together to communicate with our consumers, invest in our brands and build for a better tomorrow.
Now, let me briefly explain each of these actions. First, communicating with our consumers. Last quarter, I highlighted some of the important global platforms we're leveraging in 2010 to communicate and connect with consumers around the world. We just concluded our successful Vancouver Olympics program, which helped improve trademark Coca-Cola brand equity scores with Teen in Canada. And these improvements are flowing to the bottom-line as we've grown dollar share for trademark Coca-Cola and system revenue in Canada to their highest levels in years.
Meanwhile, our FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour carries on with its journey all around the world. The tour has now traveled to 27 international markets, engaging thousands of consumers and earning an average of $2 million of media value in each and every country visited. In addition, we are finding new and innovative ways to leverage our FIFA World Cup platform to more effectively communicate with consumers.
For example, we launched Powerade's first ever global marketing campaign, which includes an innovative online experience. A series of digital films highlight the functional benefits of Powerade and also showcase a never-ending football game played around the world. This campaign has already launched on YouTube in Brazil, Mexico, Italy, Spain and 16 more countries. We're also teaming up with customers around the world to bring the passion and the excitement of the FIFA World Cup to life for our consumers.
A great example is the marketing program we developed together with Wal-Mart. By using a jointly produced global toolkit, we will drive incremental sales for Wal-Mart and our company, while making the excitement of the World Cup more affordable and accessible for everyday fans.
Finally, as the global partner of the 2010 world exposition in Shanghai, we expect to host over 100 million visitors from China and around the world at our Coca-Cola Happiness Factory pavilion, engaging consumers, customers and other key global stakeholders through an extensive marketing program that will be executed during this exciting 184-day event. So these are just a few examples of how we are connecting directly with our consumers across many, many nations in a way that only our company with our global footprint can do.
Secondly, we are relentlessly focused on investing in our brands. Let me start with sparkling beverages, where I have already highlighted some of the many countries where we experienced sparkling growth this quarter. Brand Coca-Cola grew in line with our worldwide volume. Coca-Cola unit case volume grew over 1 million unit cases in 24 different countries. We were very proud to see Diet Coke for the first time since its introduction tie for the Number 2 brand position amongst all sparkling brands in the United States behind only Coca-Cola, as reported in Beverage Digest last month.
As for Coca-Cola Zero, it is still driving growth for us in every operating group, increasing double digits for the sixteenth consecutive quarter in North America, and 7% on a worldwide basis. Just like we said in our recent investor event, we intend to keep growing trademark Coca-Cola, the epicenter of our business in 2010 and well beyond, and we're building on our track record, successfully introducing cross-category innovations by launching several new beverages including Spritea in China, which I mentioned earlier, as well as Fanta White a new sparkling, lactic drink, which will launch in Japan next week.
We are innovating and expanding our still beverages as well. We are launching new brand extensions across multiple markets such as Vitaminwater Zero in North America, and Minute Maid Nimbu Fresh Lemonade in India. Both are gaining great momentum and traction. We are expanding our successful innovations across borders such as our Pulpy juice drink innovation, created under the Minute Maid trademark in the Pacific and now also available under the Del Valle trademark in Latin America. Altogether, our Pulpy brands are now present in 12 countries.
We also have plans in place to take Hugo, our juice and dairy innovation launched in Chile last year, into other markets in Latin America later this year. We are leveraging best-in-class programs across borders, as in the case of Vitaminwater, where we are implementing a fully integrated 360 degree summer program in almost all of our international markets. We are leveraging best practices from Canada, Great Britain, Japan, and Mexico to ensure excellence, consistency, and impact for this great brand.
Thirdly, we are building for a better tomorrow, and are fully committed to growing in a sustainable and responsible way in partnership with our consumers, customers, and communities. To the benefit of all our consumers, we are working in partnership with the First Lady of the United States on a program to end childhood obesity in a generation. We have announced our clear, on calories commitment in support of this special effort.
While I already highlighted an example of how we work in partnership with global customers, in the end, the proof is in the results. That is why we were particularly pleased to see our business with our top ten global retail customers grow mid-single digits in volume, and double digits in revenue in 2009 ahead of our total company growth.
Lastly, a great example of our efforts to support our communities is our launch of Odwalla's Haiti Hope Mango juice drink in the United States. 100% of the profits of this beverage will go to support the development of a sustainable food industry, and thousands and thousands of families in Haiti.
As we build these relationships for the future, stakeholders from around the world are recognizing our performance. In the past few weeks, we've been honored to receive several acknowledgements; Fortune Magazine ranked us number 10 in their annual list of the world's most admired companies; number one overall in beverages and number one across multiple beverage industry attributes including innovation, financial standards, and social responsibility.
Paris Interactive ranked us number eight on their annual list of most admired U.S. companies, as well as in the top five in vision and leadership, as well as financial performance. Corporate Social Responsibility magazine ranked their 100 best corporate citizens for 2010, and rated us at number eight, ahead of all other beverage companies. And just this week, Business Week moved us up in their annual ranking of the world's most innovative companies, positioning us as the most innovative consumer goods company in the world.
Our eco-friendly Aloha's bottle was recognized by both the Asian Marketing Effectiveness Festival, where we won their Platinum Award, and Japan's Ministry of Environment, which awarded us with their grand prize for Global Environment. Wal-Mart named us their Supplier of the Year in China, while 7-Eleven's franchise system did the same in North America.
Same in North America, our volume results declined 2% for the quarter, consistent with our 2009 results. Our unit case volume for sparkling beverages declined 1% in the quarter in North America, showing sequential improvement. Our still beverages were down 2% for the quarter, although we were able to still hold value share. Importantly, our newest billion-dollar brand simply grew 26% in the quarter, while strong Powerade activity, driven by effective NCAA March Madness programs helped drive volume and value share gains in the sports drinks category.
Now let me turn to our biggest news of the quarter and update you on the great progress we've made since announcing our intention to acquire CCE's North America business. As previously announced, we have appointed Brian Kelley to lead the integration of the Coca-Cola Company's and CCE's North American operations. Brian's integration team announced internally last week, consistent leaders from both the Coca-Cola Company and CEE whose operations credentials and knowledge of the North American market is second to none. I have the utmost confidence that this team will deliver on our integration goals.
Earlier today, we also announced our post-integration leadership team for North America. Steve Cahillane, currently President of the North American business unit for CCE will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of the new Coca-Cola Refreshments once the company's acquisition of CCE North America is successfully concluded. Sandy Douglas will continue as President of Coca-Cola North America. Both Steve and Sandy who have executed very effectively and in concert with each other for the past two years will report directly to me.
This will be the first time ever that our North American bottling can, fountain and juice businesses will be produced, marketed and sold by an integrated 21st century service organization. We're truly excited by this prospect.
And as I've said before, we are taking decisive actions in North America from a position of strength. I am excited that both Steve and Sandy who have been so instrumental in driving positive change in North America have agreed to lead our efforts to capture the great opportunity that this important marketplace has to offer.
Let me reiterate my fundamental view about our business in North America. Growing here is not optional. It is essential to the health and future of our entire global system. As you look at the external forces shaping our 2020 Vision, especially changing demographics, North America is at the height of many of these trends. The U.S. population is growing and will increase by over 30 million by 2020, outpacing the absolute population gains of fast-growing countries like Brazil, Egypt, and Indonesia. With over 30 million teams in 2020, the team population of the United States is projected to be greater than that of Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, and Vietnam. Clearly, there is great opportunity in our North America business across our entire portfolio, and particularly with trademark Coca-Cola.
Today, our favorite brand scores are higher than they have been in over a decade. We believe, innovative marketing, merchandizing, strong execution, and clear communications will be the key to restoring trademark Coca-Cola growth in North America, just like we were able to successfully bring back growth to Coke in Japan and the United Kingdom. The acquisition of CCE's North American business and the refranchising of our European operations are consistent with our 2020 vision. This evolution in our business will give us the financial flexibility and marketing and distribution leadership required to accelerate our business in North America and Western Europe, while also strengthening the long term health of our franchise system.
As we work to create the world's premier, low cost, and effective beverage manufacturing and distribution business, one with a fully empowered and centralized national sales organization, we are confident these actions will result in greater value for our shareholders.
Let me close by saying that it is clear that consumers are not yet out of this crisis and still remain confused due to the extended economic headwinds around the world. Therefore, given this environment, there still may be bumps along the way this year and we may continue to experience some quarter to quarter volatility. That said, we confidently stand behind our long term growth targets and intend to keep winning together in 2010, growing volume, share, and profits.
As we look ahead, we firmly believe that there is no better business to be in than the nonalcoholic, ready-to-drink beverage industry, and we remain intently focused on creating shareholder value. With that let me now turn the call over to Gary.

Our first quarter results are a clear indication that we have the right leadership",896,"As Muhtar indicated, we're off to a good start in 2010, delivering consistent, sustainable, and quality volume and profit growth in line with our long term growth targets. Our first quarter results are a clear indication that we have the right leadership in place with the right strategic plans and capabilities to achieve these goals.
One quick reminder and as highlighted during our last earnings call, our comparable results for this quarter reflect the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities, primarily bottlers, due to changes in accounting guidance as per FASB requirements. To facilitate comparisons, we will post details of all these adjustments by quarter on our Investor Relations website later this week.
As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.80, up 23% versus prior year. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income was up 9%. Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 7%, driven by a 3% increase in concentrate sales and a 6% positive currency impact, partially offset by geographic mix.
As anticipated and as we indicated in our last earnings call, we continue to see many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker rate than our developed markets, resulting in continued pressure on our geographic or country mix at a consolidated level. This is a natural outcome for a company like ours with such an extensive global footprint.
At the same time, we effectively executed our revenue growth management initiatives to realize positive pricing. This enabled us to grow global value share for the 11th consecutive quarter, while maintaining global volume share for the quarter. These results reflect our continued effort, focus and commitment to win in every market as we come out of this global crisis. Our objectives remain steadfast, strengthen the health of our brands and drive share gains.
We anticipate that our positive revenue strategies will be offset by geographic mix. Therefore, as we said in the last earnings call, we expect our price mix to be even for the full year. As we also said in that call, we would expect to see a return to positive price mix over the long term as the global consumer sentiment steadily improves.
As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 52% in the quarter to $1.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance and the cycling of a pension fund being of about $200 million in the prior year.
Now, let me explain some of the factors impacting our quarterly results and full year trends. Our comparable currency neutral cost of goods was down 3% for the quarter as a result of the shifts in mix. On a full-year basis, we would expect our cost of goods to grow at a more normalized, low single digit range.
Comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were down 1% in the quarter. This reflects the timing of marketing expenses, and it also reflects the continued benefits of our productivity initiatives which we've pursued on an ongoing basis for the past two-and-a-half years. We anticipate our full year operating expense leverage will come in the low-single digits.
Next, I want to call out two items related to North America, first related to the CCE transaction. Our integration planning has progressed quickly and in an orderly fashion under the leadership of Brian Kelley and his team. As Muhtar mentioned before, we're excited about the continued leadership both of Steve Cahillane and Sandy Douglas that they will bring to our North American business. As for the approval process for the transaction, we've not experienced any delays and still expect an early fourth quarter close.
Second and as part of our ongoing work to strengthen our economic profits in North America, we've made a strategic decision to exit the low-margin retail spring water segment of the water category. Accordingly, we have eliminated the retail spring and customer brand water volume from our reported volume for both 2010 and 2009. This change did not have any impact on either the company or North America's reported volume results this quarter.
Now, let me take a moment to provide our outlook on some of the other key factors we see impacting this year. As expected, we benefited form currency in the first quarter. We still believe currencies will have a slightly positive impact on our operating income for the full year with its benefit weighted towards the first half of the year. On productivity, we'll try to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of 2011.
And lastly, with regards to share repurchase, let me reaffirm that while we are out of the market until we close the transaction with CCE, we're still committed to repurchasing at least $1.5 billion of the company's stock in 2010.
In conclusion, while we're just beginning to emerge form the global recession and expect the recovery to be moderate as consumer outlooks only improves, our seasoned management team is clearly taking the right actions, executing the right strategies in this global environment to drive our business for the long term and build on our track record of success. We remain confident, and will continue gaining global share while enhancing the health of our brands in order to drive long term profitable growth and value for our shareholders.
Operator, we're now ready for questions.

One is that obviously we are getting significant growth from our emerging markets, and when those markets which are lower margin grow faster, you are going to get some negative pressure from geographic mix. At the same time, our pricing mix was actually positive in the quarter.
But the other impact that is totally timing and giving me a lot of confidence of where we'll come back even for the full year is that as I look at the different markets around the world and I look at the timing of gallon shipments of concentrate, well, while gallons and cases were pretty much in line for the quarter, within certain high margin countries, Japan, the U.S., South Africa for example, the gallons were behind cases.
This is a quarter where normally the bottlers would be stocking up getting ready for the summer season. Those are natural timings; those will reverse, and so that gives me a lot of confidence that as we look at the price mix, it's going to come back we think even for the full year.

Also, we have a tremendous business in Japan, tremendous partners in Japan, and we are, as you know busy trying to leverage the scale in Japan and trying to put together productivity measures in Japan that we can then refocus on further investments in our brands.
So I expect Japan to be remain challenged, but I think we see some improvements in the at-work market in Japan, in the vending channel in Japan, compared to lets say 8, 9, 10 months ago.
We are gaining share in Japan, typically in the very critical ready-to-drink coffee segment category. Sparkling beverages are very healthy in Japan. Coca-Cola Zero continues to do really well. Also, some new product introductions also continue to do very well. It's a very complex market. Coca-Cola Zero, as I said was up at about 24%. But you can look at Japan in the following mindset; Japan will remain challenged, but we expect that there will be some sequential improvements going forward.

You're right in pointing that out, and I think that we're also pleased with that. And that is the testimony to not only, again, work that's been done in this past quarter, but the work that we've been doing in our brands strengthening our brands, particularly sparkling brands, the investments that are going into sparkling brands for the last year-and-a-half. And again, our brand metrics for our sparkling brands are healthier than we've seen them in many, many years.
Coca-Cola Zero, again, had a very, very strong quarter in the United States. And again, still tremendous room to grow in the United States going forward. So I think packaging is working. Our 99-cent single-serve is working. The contourization, as is now, in more than 50% of the country and getting tremendous distribution coverage is working very well. So all those programs that we'd put into place last year and even at the end of 2008 are beginning to bear fruit. So that's why we see an improving landscape in the sparkling category in the United States and all brands in that category.
As far as still beverages are concerned, I think sports Powerade, again, cycling a very strong prior-year quarter, a double digits growth from last year, grew this year, which was very pleasing. We, I think, gained volume and value share in the juice and juice drinks category as expansion of Simply Orange in both packaging and cold channel led to another quarter of double-digit growth, which was very pleasing.
And again, we also made the strategic decision to exit the lower-margin retail spring water segment of the water category. And accordingly, we've eliminated the retail spring and customer brand water volume from our reported results for 2010 as well as 2009. And I can reiterate that this change did not impact either the company's or our North America's reported volume results this quarter.
And again, I think vitaminwater, we're very excited with the changes we've made. New product innovation of vitaminwater Zero as well as packaging, as well as the advertising. And we expect to deliver stronger results through the balance of the year with, again, that strong brand. Our energy brand NOS continued to grow very effectively in the quarter as well as also our Smartwater. So I think overall, those are the sort of important points that I'd like to make about our North American business that you asked Christine.

I think Russia, already after, as you said, a very difficult consumer environment in 2009 where we saw double digit declines for the whole PPG sector, is beginning to show again positive developments where we're almost even in the quarter in Russia, minus-1. And we importantly grew trademark Coca-Cola double digits in Russia, which as I said was pleasing for me.
So as we go into the summer, and Russia again is a very seasonal-dependent market, I believe that we will see sequential improvement in both the sentiments of the consumer in Russia, the spending of the consumer in Russia and also our business.

Let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. We once again delivered consistent, profitable and sustainable growth inspired by our 2020 Vision and also fueled by our innovation and global reach. 
Despite ongoing challenges and global economic conditions, we continued to invest in our business and build our brands, while generating strong and also steady cash flow. We are competing and winning around the world as one company with our global bottling partners, leveraging our unique scale, as well as the increased presence of our brands.
As we announced earlier this quarter, we are taking decisive actions to strategically advance our North America business and further strengthen our franchise system in Europe. We remain confident in our ability to execute our 2020 Vision, thus laying the foundation for consistent, long-term sustainable growth.
As I’ve mentioned on numerous occasions, we see tremendous growth opportunities for our system and for the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry over the next 10 years and beyond. This past quarter, despite the lingering effects of the global recession, we delivered solid 9% operating income growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Overall, global economic unit case volume grew a strong 3% with a significant number of international markets fueling this growth. And our growth in countries with a per capita of less than 150 was an exceptional 10%. 
Let me take a moment to share in more detail our performance across our international markets. In Eurasia and Africa, we saw broad-based growth of 11%. This increase was led by India, up a strong 29% and cycling 31%, making this our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in this fast-growing nation. And while sustaining this high-growth rate in India in the coming months will likely depend on weather patterns during the upcoming monsoon season, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent double-digit growth for the balance of this year.
We also saw double-digit growth in Turkey, Northwest Africa, Southern Eurasia and the Middle East. Notably, we are beginning to see sequential improvement in Russia, which was down 1% led by the strong performance of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 12% and gained share this quarter in Russia.
Latin America maintained its steady and consistent performance, up 4% overall, driven by strong 12% growth in Brazil. Our Latin Center unit was up double digits led by Columbia, which grew 19%, while our South Latin unit was up mid-single digits.
Mexico, impacted by unseasonably cold weather, was down 2%. But as the weather has improved, this trend has reversed with our business generating positive growth in the month of March. And despite these weather challenges in the quarter, we continue to gain total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage share in Mexico driven by both our sparkling and our still beverages.
Our Pacific Group continues to expand, up 5% in total and led double-digit growth across Korea, Indonesia and several other markets. Our volume performance in Japan was a sequential improvement on our performance in the last two quarters, down 3%. Despite ongoing economic headwinds, we are experiencing steady improvement in the critical Vending channel, as well as strong results in the Convenience Store channel.  This led to better performance for our Georgia Coffee business. 
Our Trademark Coca-Cola brands in Japan keep widening the gap against our primary competitor, led by Coca-Cola Zero, which was up 24% for the quarter. In fact, since 2005 we have grown Trademark Coca-Cola incremental unit case volume in Japan 5x more than our main competitor has grown its trademark brands over the same period. And our I LOHAS, our fast-growing eco-friendly natural mineral water brand launched last May, is building on its market share leadership. In less than a year, it has become the number one packaged water brand in Japan.
China unit case volume grew 6%, including double-digit growth in the latter half of the quarter. This performance comes on the heels of a strong fourth quarter and a great finish to 2009, which was led by growth across our portfolio, as well as new product launches.
Over the past six months, our volume grew a solid 16%. And while we may see volume swings from quarter-to-quarter, this 16% growth over the past six months was ahead of our primary international competitor. For perspective, our China business has generated more than a $100 million incremental unit cases this past six months and continues to be twice the size of our primary international competitor on an annual basis. And we are building momentum across our entire portfolio. 
We are advancing our Sparkling business in China behind strong innovations such as the launch of Spritea, which taps into the combined popularity of green tea and Sprite. We're expanding our winning Still beverage business through the ongoing growth of our industry-leading juice and juice drink beverages and our Minute Maid Pulpy Super Milky dairy brand. And we are kicking off an exciting new Yuan Ye tea portfolio following Yuan Ye jasmine tea. And as we have shared before, we are just getting started in China and remain resolute in our commitment to invest for solid long-term growth.
Now moving to Europe. Despite the continuation of difficult economic conditions in Europe, our unit case volume growth was even for the quarter. This was an improvement over our 2009 full year results with growth across France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and North-Central Europe. Further, our company-owned bottlers in Europe grew well ahead of the region, with Germany up mid-single digits and Nordic's up low-single digits as we build towards refranchising both of these operations.
In the United Kingdom, we were pleased that our Trademark Coca-Cola brands became the first to top the one billion-pound mark in annual U.K. grocery retail sales. We are excited about our recently announced increased investment Innocent, reflecting our belief in the long-term growth potential of the Smoothie business.
Lastly and in alignment with our 2020 Vision, we recently reorganized our Europe business from 10 business units to four, making it easier for us to do business with our bottlers, as well as partners, as we gain significant scale, speed and simplicity.
In total, these international performance results are a testament to our seasoned operating team, which is executing our 2020 Vision quickly and also with great discipline. I can assure you that our strategy and focus to build the long-term equity of our brands remains decisively clear. This focus is reflected in the volume and value share gains we continue to realize together with our bottling partners around the world.
As a system, we are pulling together to communicate with our consumers, invest in our brands and build for a better tomorrow.
Now let me briefly explain each of these actions.
First, communicating with our consumers. Last quarter, I highlighted some of the important global platforms we are leveraging in 2010 to communicate and connect with consumers around the world. We just concluded our successful Vancouver Olympics program, which helped improve Trademark Coca-Cola brand equity scores with teams in Canada. And these improvements are flowing to the bottom line as we have grown dollar share for Trademark Coca-Cola and system revenue in Canada to their highest levels in years.
Meanwhile, our FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour carries on with its journey all around the world. The Tour has now traveled to 27 international markets, engaging thousands of consumers and earning an average of $2 million of media value in each and every country visited. In addition, we are finding new and innovative ways to leverage our FIFA World Cup platform to more effectively communicate with consumers. 
For example, we launched POWERade's first-ever global marketing campaign, which includes an innovative online experience. A series of digital films highlight the functional benefits of POWERade and also showcase a never-ending football game played around the world. This campaign has already launched on YouTube in Brazil, Mexico, Italy, Spain and 16 more countries. 
We're also teaming up with customers around the world to bring the passion and the excitement of the FIFA World Cup to life for our consumers. A great example is the marketing program we developed together with Wal-Mart. By using a jointly produced global toolkit, we will drive incremental sales for Wal-Mart and our company, while making the excitement of the World Cup more affordable and accessible for everyday fans.
Finally, as the global partner of the 2010 World Exposition in Shanghai, we expect to host over 100 million visitors from China and around the world at our Coca-Cola Happiness Factory Pavilion, engaging consumers, customers and other key global stakeholders through an extensive marketing program that will be executed during this exciting 184-day event.
So these are just a few examples of how we are connecting directly with our consumers across many, many nations in a way that only our company, with our global footprint, can do.
Secondly, we are relentlessly focused on investing in our brands. 
Let me start with sparkling beverages, where I have already highlighted some of the many countries, where we experienced sparkling growth this quarter. Brand Coca-Cola grew in line with our worldwide volume. Coca-Cola unit case volume grew over 1 million unit cases in 24 different countries. 
We were very proud to see Diet Coke for the first time since its introduction, tie for the number two brand position amongst all sparkling brands in the United States, behind only Coca-Cola, as reported in Beverage Digest last month. As for Coca-Cola Zero, it is still driving growth for us in every operating group, increasing double digits for the 16th consecutive quarter in North America and 7% on a worldwide basis. 
Just like we shared in our recent investor event, we intend to keep growing Trademark Coca-Cola, the epicenter of our business in 2010 and well beyond. And we are building on our track record, successfully introducing cross-category innovations by launching several new beverages, including Spritea in China, which I mentioned earlier, as well as Fanta White, a new sparkling lactic drink, which will launch in Japan next week.
We are innovating and expanding our still beverages as well. We're launching new brand extensions across multiple markets, such as vitaminwater zero in North America and Minute Maid Nimble Fresh Lemonade in India. Both are gaining great momentum and traction. We're expanding our successful innovations across borders, such as our Pulpy juice drink innovation created under the Minute Maid trademark in the Pacific and now also available under the Del Valle Trademark in Latin America. Altogether, our Pulpy brands are now present in 12 countries. We also have plans in place to take Jugo, our juice and dairy innovation launched in Chile last year, into other markets in Latin America later this year.
We're leveraging best-in-class programs across borders, as in the case of vitaminwater, where we are implementing a fully integrated 360-degree summer program in almost all of our international markets. We are leveraging best practices from Canada, Great Britain, Japan and Mexico to ensure excellence, consistency and impact for this great brand.
Thirdly, we're building for a better tomorrow and are fully committed to growing in a sustainable and responsible way in partnership with our consumers, customers and communities. To the benefit of all our consumers, we're working in partnership with the First Lady of the United States on a program to end childhood obesity in a generation. We have announced our Clear on Calories commitment in support of this special effort. 
While I already highlighted an example on how we work in partnership with global customers, in the end, the proof is in the results. That is why we were particularly pleased to see our business with our top 10 global retail customers grow mid-single digits in volume and double digits in revenue in 2009, ahead of our total company growth.
Lastly, a great example of our efforts to support our communities is our launch of Odwalla's Haiti Hope Mango juice drink in the United States. 100% of the profits of this beverage will go to support the development of a sustainable fruit industry and thousands and thousands of families in Haiti. As we build these relationships for the future, stakeholders from around the world are recognizing our performance. 
In the past few weeks, we've been honored to receive several acknowledgments. Fortune magazine ranked us number 10 in their annual list of the World's Most Admired Companies. Number one overall in beverages and number one across multiple beverage industry attributes, including innovation, financial soundness and social responsibility. 
Paris Interactive ranked us number eight on their annual list of Most Admired U.S. Companies, as well as in the top five in Vision and Leadership, as well as Financial Performance. 
Corporate Social Responsibility magazine ranked their 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2010 and rated us at number eight, ahead of all other beverage companies. 
And just this week, Business Week moved us up in their annual ranking of the World's Most Innovative Companies, positioning us as the Most Innovative Consumer Goods Company in the world. 
Our eco-friendly, I LOHAS bottle was recognized by both the Asian Marketing Effectiveness Festival, where we won their Platinum Award and Japan's Ministry of Environment, which awarded us with their grand prize for global environment. 
And Wal-Mart named us their Supplier of the Year in China, while 7-Eleven Franchise System did the same in North America.
Staying in North America. Our volume results declined 2% for the quarter, consistent with our 2009 results. Our unit case volume for sparkling beverages declined 1% in the quarter in North America showing sequential improvement. Our Still beverages were down 2% for the quarter, although we were able to still hold value share. 
Importantly, our newest billion-dollar brand, Simply, grew 26% in the quarter, while strong POWERade activity, driven by effective NCAA March Madness programs, helped drive volume and value share gains in the Sports Drinks category. 
Now let me turn to our biggest news of the quarter and update you on the great progress we've made since announcing our intention to acquire CCE's North America business. As previously announced, we have appointed Brian Kelly to lead the integration of the Coca-Cola companies and CCE’s North American operations. Bryan's integration team, announced internally last week, consists of leaders from both the Coca-Cola Company and CCE whose operating credentials and knowledge of the North American market is second to none. I have the utmost confidence that this team will deliver on our integration goals.
Earlier today, we also announced our post-integration leadership team for North America. Steve Cahillane, currently President of the North American Business Unit for CCE will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of the new Coca-Cola Refreshments, once the company’s acquisition of CCE North America has been successfully concluded. 
Sandy Douglas will continue as President of Coca-Cola North America. Both Steve and Sandy, who’ve executed very effectively and in concert with each other for the past two years, will report directly to me. This will be the first time ever that our North American bottling, can, fountain and juice businesses will be produced, marketed and sold by an integrated 21st-century service organization. We're truly excited by this prospect.
And as I've said before, we're taking decisive action in North America from a position of strength. I am excited that both Steve and Sandy, who've been so instrumental in driving positive change in North America, have agreed to lead our efforts to capture the great opportunity that this important marketplace has to offer. 
Let me reiterate my fundamental view about our business in North America. Growing here is not optional. It is essential to the health and future of our entire global system. And if you look at the external forces shaping our 2020 Vision, especially changing demographics, North America is at the heart of many of these trends. 
The U.S. population is growing and will increase by over 30 million by 2020, outpacing the absolute population gains of fast-growing countries like Brazil, Egypt and Indonesia. And with over 30 million teens in 2020, the teen population of the United States is projected to be greater than that of Brazil, Mexico, Egypt and Vietnam.  Clearly, there is great opportunity in our North America business across our entire portfolio and particularly with Trademark Coca-Cola. 
Today, our favorite brand scores are higher than they've been in over a decade. We believe innovative marketing, merchandising, strong execution and clear communications will be the key to restoring Trademark Coca-Cola growth in North America, just like we were able to successfully bring back growth to Coke in Japan and the United Kingdom. 
The acquisition of CCE's North American business and the refranchising of our European operations are consistent with our 2020 Vision. This evolution in our business will give us the financial flexibility and marketing and distribution leadership required to accelerate our business in North America and Western Europe, while also strengthening the long-term health of our franchise systems. 
As we work to create the world's premier, low-cost and effective beverage manufacturing and distribution business, one with a fully empowered and centralized national sales organization, we are confident these actions will result in greater value for our shareholders. 
Let me close by saying that it is clear that consumers are not yet out of this crisis and still remain confused due to the extended economic headwinds around the world. Therefore, given this environment, there still may be bumps along the way this year and we may continue to experience some quarter-to-quarter volatility. That said, we confidently stand behind our long-term growth targets and intend to keep winning together in 2010 growing volume, share and profits.
As we look ahead, we firmly believe that there's no better business to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry. And we remain intently focused on creating shareholder value. With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,100171032,56667,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-20-2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar indicated, we're off to a good start in 2010, delivering consistent, sustainable and quality volume and profit growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our first quarter results are a clear indica",900,"Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar indicated, we're off to a good start in 2010, delivering consistent, sustainable and quality volume and profit growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our first quarter results are a clear indication that we have the right leadership in place with the right strategic plans and capabilities to achieve these goals. 
One quick reminder and it’s highlighted during our last earnings call, our comparable results for this quarter reflect the impact of the de-consolidation of certain entities, primarily Bottlers, due to changes in accounting guidance as per FASB requirements. To facilitate comparisons, we will post details of all of these adjustments by quarter on our Investor Relations website later this week.
As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.80, up 23%, versus prior year. For the quarter, comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 9%. Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 7%, driven by a 3% increase in Concentrate sales and a 6% positive currency impact, partially offset by geographic mix.
As anticipated and as we indicated in our last earnings call, we continue to see many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker rate than our developed markets, resulting in continued pressure on our geographic or country mix at a consolidated level. This is a natural outcome for a company like ours with such an extensive global footprint. 
At the same time, we effectively executed our revenue growth management initiatives to realize positive pricing. This enabled us to grow global value share for the 11th consecutive quarter, while maintaining global volume share for the quarter. These results reflect our continued effort, focus and commitment to win in every market as we come out of this global crisis. 
Our objectives remain steadfast: strengthen the health of our brands and drive share gains. We anticipate that our positive revenue strategies will be offset by geographic mix. Therefore, as we said in the last earnings call, we expect our price mix to be even for the full year. And as we also said in that call, we would expect to see a return to positive price mix over the long term as global consumer sentiment steadily improves.
As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 52% in the quarter to $1.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance and the cycling of a pension funding of about $200 million in the prior year.
Now let me explain some of the factors impacting our quarterly results and full year trends. Our comparable currency-neutral cost of goods was down 3% for the quarter as a result of the shifts in mix. On a full year basis, we would expect our cost of goods to grow in a more normalized, low-single digit range.
Comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were down 1% in the quarter. This reflects the timing of marketing expenses and it also reflects the continued benefits of our productivity initiatives, which we have pursued on an ongoing basis for the past 2.5 years. We anticipate our full year operating expense leverage will come in, in the low-single digits.
Next, I want to call out two items related to North America. First, related to the CCE transaction, our integration planning has progressed quickly and in an orderly fashion under the leadership of Brian Kelly in his team. As Muhtar mentioned before, we're excited about the continued leadership both from Steve Cahillane and Sandy Douglas that they will bring to our North American business. As for the approval process for the transaction, we have not experienced any delays and still expect a early fourth quarter close.
Second, and as part of our ongoing work to strengthen our economic profits in North America, we've made a strategic decision to exit the low-margin retail Spring Water segment of the Water category. Accordingly, we have eliminated the Retail Spring and Customer Brand Water volume from our reported volume for both 2010 and 2009. This change did not have any impact on either the company or North America's reported volume results this quarter.
Now let me take a moment to provide our outlook and some of the other key factors we see impacting this year. As expected, we benefited from currency in the first quarter. We still believe currencies will have a slightly positive impact on our operating income for the full year, with this benefit weighted toward the first half of the year.
On productivity. We’re on track to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of 2011. 
And lastly, with regard to share repurchase. Let me reaffirm that while we are out of the market until we close the transaction with CCE, we are still committed to repurchasing at least $1.5 billion of the company's stock in 2010. 
In conclusion, we're only just beginning to emerge from the global recession and expect the recovery to be moderate as consumer outlooks slowly improves. Our seasoned management team has clearly taken the right actions, executing the right strategies in this global environment to drive our business for the long-term and build on our track record of success. We remain confident and will continue gaining global share, while enhancing the health of our brands in order to drive long-term, profitable growth and value for our shareholders.

One is that, obviously, we're getting significant growth from our emerging markets. And when those markets, which are lower margins, grow faster, you're going to get some negative pressure from geographic mix. And at the same time, our pricing mix was actually positive in the quarter. But the other impact that is totally timing and giving me a lot of confidence on where we'll come back even for the full year, is that as I look at the different markets around the world and I look at the timing of gallon shipments of concentrate, while gallons and cases were pretty much in line for the quarter, within certain high margin countries, Japan, the U.S., South Africa, for example, the gallons were behind cases. And this is a quarter where normally the Bottlers would be stocking up, getting ready for the summer season. Those are natural timings. Those will reverse. And so that gives me a lot of confidence that as we look at the price mix, it's going to come back we think even for the full year."

So I expect Japan to be -- remain challenged, but I think we see some improvements in the at-work market in Japan, in the Vending channel in Japan, compared to let’s say eight, nine, 10 months ago. We're gaining share in Japan, particularly in the ready-to-drink coffee, very critical Ready-to-Drink Coffee segment -- category. And our sparkling beverages are very healthy in Japan. Coca-Cola's Zero continues to do really well, also some new product introductions also continue to do very well. It's a very complex market. Coca-Cola Zero, as I said, was up about 24%. But you can look at Japan in the following mindset: Japan will remain challenged, but we expect that there will be some sequential improvements going forward."

You're right in pointing that out and I think that we’re also pleased with that. And that is testimony to not only -- again, work that's been done in this past quarter, but the work that we've been doing in our brands and strengthening our brands, particularly sparkling brands. The investments that are going into the sparkling brand for the last year and a half, and again our brand metrics for our sparkling brands are healthier than we've seen them in many, many years. Coca-Cola Zero, again, had a very, very strong quarter in the United States. And again, still tremendous room to grow in the United States going forward. So I think packaging is working. Our $0.99 single-serve is working. The contourization as is now in more than 50% of the country and getting tremendous distribution coverage is working very well. So all those programs that we've put into place last year and even at the end of 2008 are beginning to bear fruit. So that's why we see an improving landscape in the Sparkling category in the United States and our brands in that category. As far as still beverages are concerned, I think Sports -- POWERade, again, cycling a very strong prior year quarter at more than double-digits growth from last year, grew this year, which was very pleasing. We, I think, gained volume and value share in the juice and juice drinks category as expansion of Simply Orange in both Packaging and Cold channel lead to another quarter of double-digit growth, which was very pleasing. And again, we also made the strategic decision to exit the lower margin Retail Spring Water segment of the Water category. And accordingly, we've eliminated the Retail Spring Customer Brand Water volume from our reported results for 2010, as well as 2009. And I can reiterate that this change does not impact either the Company’s or our North America's reported volumes results this quarter. And again, I think vitaminwater. We're very excited with the changes we've made: new product innovation of vitaminwater zero, as well as packaging, as well as the advertising. And we expect to deliver stronger results through the balance of the year, with again, that strong brand. Our energy brand, NOS, continued to grow very effectively in the quarter, as well as also our Smartwater.

All I can tell you is that our Foodservice business, our Fountain business, which is a great litmus test for consumer sentiment, we saw some improvement in the latter half of the quarter. But again, as I referenced to Christine's question, it's really important to understand that these packaging changes and also our Open Happiness campaign, our branding, our connection with the Olympics property in the quarter, all of that plays very well into our brands. And again, our brands are getting healthier. Our packaging, as I said, is working; 50% coverage in the entire United States on our contourization for two liter. The pricing of two liter, again, versus the single-serves are in a much better place than it was back 18 months ago. All of that is beginning to show -- the logic of all of that is beginning to pay dividends."

But I think really important to understand is about Germany -- what is happening in Germany has got nothing to do with this past quarter or this past year. This is -- Germany was not a market that needed to be fixed. Germany, as you know, it took us years to try and to ensure that we could put the right structure in Germany. We closed the deal finally and then in 2006. And we've been busy putting ourselves to work to get Germany right. So it's really important to understand that this is not a program that suddenly came into being last quarter or last year. We've been working on getting Germany right. Is Germany right? I'd say probably more than certainly 50% right. And I am confident that looking into the future, Germany is going to start yielding some good dividends as we move towards franchising Germany in the period that we've announced. But think of it along the same lines as what we're doing in the United States. These are long-term programs that we commit ourselves to fixing major markets. Germany was a big one, internationally. And now we see that it's on the way to repair and it's going to be -- it's finding the right home."

I think Russia already after, as you said, a very difficult consumer environment in 2009, where we saw double-digit declines for the whole CPG sector, is beginning to show again positive developments, where we're almost even in the quarter in Russia, minus one.

Let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. We once again delivered consistent, profitable and sustainable growth inspired by our 2020 Vision and also fueled by our innovation and global reach. 
Despite ongoing challenges and global economic conditions, we continued to invest in our business and build our brands, while generating strong and also steady cash flow. We are competing and winning around the world as one company with our global bottling partners, leveraging our unique scale, as well as the increased presence of our brands.
As we announced earlier this quarter, we are taking decisive actions to strategically advance our North America business and further strengthen our franchise system in Europe. We remain confident in our ability to execute our 2020 Vision, thus laying the foundation for consistent, long-term sustainable growth.
As I’ve mentioned on numerous occasions, we see tremendous growth opportunities for our system and for the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry over the next 10 years and beyond. This past quarter, despite the lingering effects of the global recession, we delivered solid 9% operating income growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Overall, global economic unit case volume grew a strong 3% with a significant number of international markets fueling this growth. And our growth in countries with a per capita of less than 150 was an exceptional 10%. 
Let me take a moment to share in more detail our performance across our international markets. In Eurasia and Africa, we saw broad-based growth of 11%. This increase was led by India, up a strong 29% and cycling 31%, making this our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in this fast-growing nation. And while sustaining this high growth rate in India in the coming months will likely depend on weather patterns during the upcoming monsoon season, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent double-digit growth for the balance of this year.
We also saw double-digit growth in Turkey, Northwest Africa, Southern Eurasia and the Middle East. Notably, we are beginning to see sequential improvement in Russia, which was down 1% led by the strong performance of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 12% and gained share this quarter in Russia.
Latin America maintained its steady and consistent performance, up 4% overall, driven by strong 12% growth in Brazil. Our Latin Center unit was up double digits led by Colombia, which grew 19%, while our South Latin unit was up mid-single digits.
Mexico, impacted by unseasonably cold weather, was down 2%. But as the weather has improved, this trend has reversed with our business generating positive growth in the month of March. And despite these weather challenges in the quarter, we continued to gain total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage share in Mexico driven by both our sparkling and our still beverages.
Our Pacific Group continued to expand, up 5% in total and led by double-digit growth across Korea, Indonesia and several other markets. Our volume performance in Japan was a sequential improvement on our performance in the last two quarters, down 3%. Despite ongoing economic headwinds, we are experiencing steady improvement in the critical Vending channel, as well as strong results in the Convenience Store channel.  This led to better performance for our Georgia Coffee business. 
Our Trademark Coca-Cola brands in Japan keep widening the gap against our primary competitor, led by Coca-Cola Zero, which was up 24% for the quarter. In fact, since 2005 we have grown Trademark Coca-Cola incremental unit case volume in Japan 5x more than our main competitor has grown its trademark brands over the same period. And our I LOHAS, our fast-growing eco-friendly natural mineral water brand launched last May, is building on its market share leadership. In less than a year, it has become the number one packaged water brand in Japan.
China unit case volume grew 6%, including double-digit growth in the latter half of the quarter. This performance comes on the heels of a strong fourth quarter and a great finish to 2009, which was led by -- across our portfolio, as well as new product launches.
Over the past six months, our volume grew a solid 16%. And while we may see volume swings from quarter-to-quarter, this 16% growth over the past six months was ahead of our primary international competitor. For perspective, our China business has generated more than 100 million incremental unit cases this past six months and continues to be twice the size of our primary international competitor on an annual basis. And we are building momentum across our entire portfolio. 
We are advancing our Sparkling business in China behind strong innovations such as the launch of Spritea, which taps into the combined popularity of green tea and Sprite. We're expanding our winning Still beverage business through the ongoing growth of our industry-leading juice and juice drink beverages and our Minute Maid Pulpy Super Milky dairy brand. And we are kicking off an exciting new Yuan Ye-led tea portfolio launching Yuan Ye jasmine tea. And as we have shared before, we are just getting started in China and remain resolute in our commitment to invest for solid long-term growth.
Now moving to Europe. Despite the continuation of difficult economic conditions in Europe, our unit case volume growth was even for the quarter. This was an improvement over our 2009 full year results with growth across France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and North Central Europe. Further, our company-owned bottlers in Europe grew well ahead of the region, with Germany up mid-single digits and Nordics up low-single digits as we build towards re-franchising both of these operations.
In the United Kingdom, we were pleased that our Trademark Coca-Cola brands became the first to top the GBP 1 billion mark in annual U.K. grocery retail sales. We are excited about our recently announced increased investment in Innocent, reflecting our belief in the long-term growth potential of the Smoothie business.
Lastly and in alignment with our 2020 Vision, we recently reorganized our Europe business from 10 business units to four, making it easier for us to do business with our bottlers, as well as partners, as we gain significant scale, speed and simplicity.
In total, these international performance results are a testament to our seasoned operating team, which is executing our 2020 Vision quickly and also with great discipline. I can assure you that our strategy and focus to build the long-term equity of our brands remains decisively clear. This focus is reflected in the volume and value share gains we continue to realize together with our bottling partners around the world.
As a system, we are pulling together to communicate with our consumers, invest in our brands and build for a better tomorrow.
Now let me briefly explain each of these actions.
First, communicating with our consumers. Last quarter, I highlighted some of the important global platforms we are leveraging in 2010 to communicate and connect with consumers around the world. We just concluded our successful Vancouver Olympics program, which helped improve Trademark Coca-Cola brand equity scores with teams in Canada. And these improvements are flowing to the bottom line as we have grown dollar share for Trademark Coca-Cola and system revenue in Canada to their highest levels in years.
Meanwhile, our FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour carries on with its journey all around the world. The Tour has now traveled to 27 international markets, engaging thousands of consumers and earning an average of $2 million of media value in each and every country visited. In addition, we are finding new and innovative ways to leverage our FIFA World Cup platform to more effectively communicate with consumers. 
For example, we launched POWERade's first-ever global marketing campaign, which includes an innovative online experience. A series of digital films highlight the functional benefits of POWERade and also showcase a never-ending football game played around the world. This campaign has already launched on YouTube in Brazil, Mexico, Italy, Spain and 16 more countries. 
We're also teaming up with customers around the world to bring the passion and the excitement of the FIFA World Cup to life for our consumers. A great example is the marketing program we developed together with Wal-Mart. By using a jointly produced global toolkit, we will drive incremental sales for Wal-Mart and our company, while making the excitement of the World Cup more affordable and accessible for everyday fans.
Finally, as the global partner of the 2010 World Exposition in Shanghai, we expect to host over 100 million visitors from China and around the world at our Coca-Cola Happiness Factory Pavilion, engaging consumers, customers and other key global stakeholders through an extensive marketing program that will be executed during this exciting 184-day event.
So these are just a few examples of how we are connecting directly with our consumers across many, many nations in a way that only our company, with our global footprint, can do.
Secondly, we are relentlessly focused on investing in our brands. 
Let me start with sparkling beverages, where I have already highlighted some of the many countries, where we experienced sparkling growth this quarter. Brand Coca-Cola grew in line with our worldwide volume. Coca-Cola unit case volume grew over 1 million unit cases in 24 different countries. 
We were very proud to see Diet Coke for the first time since its introduction, tie for the number two brand position amongst all sparkling brands in the United States, behind only Coca-Cola, as reported in Beverage Digest last month. As for Coca-Cola Zero, it is still driving growth for us in every operating group, increasing double digits for the 16th consecutive quarter in North America and 7% on a worldwide basis. 
Just like we shared in our recent investor event, we intend to keep growing Trademark Coca-Cola, the epicenter of our business in 2010 and well beyond. And we are building on our track record, successfully introducing cross-category innovations by launching several new beverages, including Spritea in China, which I mentioned earlier, as well as Fanta White, a new sparkling lactic drink, which will launch in Japan next week.
We are innovating and expanding our still beverages as well. We're launching new brand extensions across multiple markets, such as vitaminwater zero in North America and Minute Maid Nimble Fresh Lemonade in India. Both are gaining great momentum and traction. We're expanding our successful innovations across borders, such as our Pulpy juice drink innovation created under the Minute Maid trademark in the Pacific and now also available under the Del Valle Trademark in Latin America. Altogether, our Pulpy brands are now present in 12 countries. We also have plans in place to take Jugo, our juice and dairy innovation launched in Chile last year, into other markets in Latin America later this year.
We're leveraging best-in-class programs across borders, as in the case of vitaminwater, where we are implementing a fully integrated 360-degree summer program in almost all of our international markets. We are leveraging best practices from Canada, Great Britain, Japan and Mexico to ensure excellence, consistency and impact for this great brand.
Thirdly, we're building for a better tomorrow and are fully committed to growing in a sustainable and responsible way in partnership with our consumers, customers and communities. To the benefit of all our consumers, we're working in partnership with the First Lady of the United States on a program to end childhood obesity in a generation. We have announced our Clear on Calories commitment in support of this special effort. 
While I already highlighted an example on how we work in partnership with global customers, in the end, the proof is in the results. That is why we were particularly pleased to see our business with our top 10 global retail customers grow mid-single digits in volume and double digits in revenue in 2009, ahead of our total company growth.
Lastly, a great example of our efforts to support our communities is our launch of Odwalla's Haiti Hope Mango juice drink in the United States. 100% of the profits of this beverage will go to support the development of a sustainable fruit industry and thousands and thousands of families in Haiti. As we build these relationships for the future, stakeholders from around the world are recognizing our performance. 
In the past few weeks, we've been honored to receive several acknowledgments. Fortune magazine ranked us number 10 in their annual list of the World's Most Admired Companies. Number one overall in beverages and number one across multiple beverage industry attributes, including innovation, financial soundness and social responsibility. 
Paris Interactive ranked us number eight on their annual list of Most Admired U.S. Companies, as well as in the top five in Vision and Leadership, as well as Financial Performance. 
Corporate Social Responsibility magazine ranked their 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2010 and rated us at number eight, ahead of all other beverage companies. 
And just this week, Business Week moved us up in their annual ranking of the World's Most Innovative Companies, positioning us as the Most Innovative Consumer Goods Company in the world. 
Our eco-friendly, I LOHAS bottle was recognized by both the Asian Marketing Effectiveness Festival, where we won their Platinum Award and Japan's Ministry of Environment, which awarded us with their grand prize for global environment. 
And Wal-Mart named us their Supplier of the Year in China, while 7-Eleven Franchise System did the same in North America.
Staying in North America. Our volume results declined 2% for the quarter, consistent with our 2009 results. Our unit case volume for sparkling beverages declined 1% in the quarter in North America showing sequential improvement. Our Still beverages were down 2% for the quarter, although we were able to still hold value share. 
Importantly, our newest billion-dollar brand, Simply, grew 26% in the quarter, while strong POWERade activity, driven by effective NCAA March Madness programs, helped drive volume and value share gains in the Sports Drinks category. 
Now let me turn to our biggest news of the quarter and update you on the great progress we've made since announcing our intention to acquire CCE's North America business. As previously announced, we have appointed Brian Kelly to lead the integration of the Coca-Cola companies and CCE’s North American operations. Brian's integration team, announced internally last week, consists of leaders from both The Coca-Cola Company and CCE whose operating credentials and knowledge of the North American market is second to none. I have the utmost confidence that this team will deliver on our integration goals.
Earlier today, we also announced our post-integration leadership team for North America. Steve Cahillane, currently President of the North American Business Unit for CCE will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of the new Coca-Cola Refreshments once the company’s acquisition of CCE North America has been successfully concluded. 
Sandy Douglas will continue as President of Coca-Cola North America. Both Steve and Sandy, who’ve executed very effectively and in concert with each other for the past two years, will report directly to me. This will be the first time ever that our North American bottling, can, fountain and juice businesses will be produced, marketed and sold by an integrated 21st-century service organization. We're truly excited by this prospect.
And as I've said before, we're taking decisive action in North America from a position of strength. I am excited that both Steve and Sandy, who've been so instrumental in driving positive change in North America, have agreed to lead our efforts to capture the great opportunity that this important marketplace has to offer. 
Let me reiterate my fundamental view about our business in North America. Growing here is not optional. It is essential to the health and future of our entire global system. And if you look at the external forces shaping our 2020 Vision, especially changing demographics, North America is at the heart of many of these trends. 
The U.S. population is growing and will increase by over 30 million by 2020, outpacing the absolute population gains of fast-growing countries like Brazil, Egypt and Indonesia. And with over 30 million teens in 2020, the teen population of the United States is projected to be greater than that of Brazil, Mexico, Egypt and Vietnam.  Clearly, there is great opportunity in our North America business across our entire portfolio and particularly with Trademark Coca-Cola. 
Today, our favorite brand scores are higher than they've been in over a decade. We believe innovative marketing, merchandising, strong execution and clear communications will be the key to restoring Trademark Coca-Cola growth in North America, just like we were able to successfully bring back growth to Coke in Japan and the United Kingdom. 
The acquisition of CCE's North American business and the re-franchising of our European operations are consistent with our 2020 Vision. This evolution in our business will give us the financial flexibility and marketing and distribution leadership required to accelerate our business in North America and Western Europe, while also strengthening the long-term health of our franchise system. 
As we work to create the world's premier, low-cost and effective beverage manufacturing and distribution business, one with a fully empowered and centralized national sales organization, we are confident these actions will result in greater value for our shareholders. 
Let me close by saying that it is clear that consumers are not yet out of this crisis and still remain confused due to the extended economic headwinds around the world. Therefore, given this environment, there still may be bumps along the way this year and we may continue to experience some quarter-to-quarter volatility. That said, we confidently stand behind our long-term growth targets and intend to keep winning together in 2010 growing volume, share and profits.
As we look ahead, we firmly believe that there is no better business to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry. And we remain intently focused on creating shareholder value. With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,100171032,56902,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-20-2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar indicated, we're off to a good start in 2010, delivering consistent, sustainable and quality volume and profit growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our first quarter results are a clear in",901,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar indicated, we're off to a good start in 2010, delivering consistent, sustainable and quality volume and profit growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our first quarter results are a clear indication that we have the right leadership in place with the right strategic plans and capabilities to achieve these goals. 
One quick reminder, and as highlighted during our last earnings call, our comparable results for this quarter reflect the impact of the de-consolidation of certain entities, primarily Bottlers, due to changes in accounting guidance as per FASB requirements. To facilitate comparisons, we will post details of all of these adjustments by quarter on our Investor Relations website later this week.
As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.80, up 23%, versus prior year. For the quarter, comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 9%. Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 7%, driven by a 3% increase in Concentrate sales and a 6% positive currency impact, partially offset by geographic mix.
As anticipated and as we indicated in our last earnings call, we continue to see many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker rate than our developed markets, resulting in continued pressure on our geographic or country mix at a consolidated level. This is a natural outcome for a company like ours with such an extensive global footprint. 
At the same time, we effectively executed our revenue growth management initiatives to realize positive pricing. This enabled us to grow global value share for the 11th consecutive quarter, while maintaining global volume share for the quarter. These results reflect our continued effort, focus and commitment to win in every market as we come out of this global crisis. 
Our objectives remain steadfast: strengthen the health of our brands and drive share gains. We anticipate that our positive revenue strategies will be offset by geographic mix. Therefore, as we said in the last earnings call, we expect our price mix to be even for the full year. And as we also said in that call, we would expect to see a return to positive price mix over the long term as global consumer sentiment steadily improves.
As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 52% in the quarter to $1.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance and the cycling of a pension funding of about $200 million in the prior year.
Now let me explain some of the factors impacting our quarterly results and full year trends. Our comparable currency-neutral cost of goods was down 3% for the quarter as a result of the shifts in mix. On a full year basis, we would expect our cost of goods to grow in a more normalized, low-single digit range.
Comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were down 1% in the quarter. This reflects the timing of marketing expenses and it also reflects the continued benefits of our productivity initiatives, which we have pursued on an ongoing basis for the past 2.5 years. We anticipate our full year operating expense leverage will come in, in the low-single digits.
Next, I want to call out two items related to North America. First, related to the CCE transaction, our integration planning has progressed quickly and in an orderly fashion under the leadership of Brian Kelly in his team. As Muhtar mentioned before, we're excited about the continued leadership both from Steve Cahillane and Sandy Douglas that they will bring to our North American business. As for the approval process for the transaction, we have not experienced any delays and still expect a early fourth quarter close.
Second, and as part of our ongoing work to strengthen our economic profits in North America, we've made a strategic decision to exit the low-margin retail Spring Water segment of the Water category. Accordingly, we have eliminated the Retail Spring and Customer Brand Water volume from our reported volume for both 2010 and 2009. This change did not have any impact on either the company or North America's reported volume results this quarter.
Now let me take a moment to provide our outlook and some of the other key factors we see impacting this year. As expected, we benefited from currency in the first quarter. We still believe currencies will have a slightly positive impact on our operating income for the full year, with this benefit weighted toward the first half of the year.
On productivity. We’re on track to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of 2011. 
And lastly, with regard to share repurchase. Let me reaffirm that while we are out of the market until we close the transaction with CCE, we are still committed to repurchasing at least $1.5 billion of the company's stock in 2010. 
In conclusion, we're only just beginning to emerge from the global recession and expect the recovery to be moderate as consumer outlooks slowly improves. Our seasoned management team has clearly taken the right actions, executing the right strategies in this global environment to drive our business for the long-term and build on our track record of success. We remain confident and will continue gaining global share, while enhancing the health of our brands in order to drive long-term, profitable growth and value for our shareholders.

One is that, obviously, we're getting significant growth from our emerging markets. And when those markets, which are lower margins, grow faster, you're going to get some negative pressure from geographic mix. And at the same time, our pricing mix was actually positive in the quarter. But the other impact that is totally timing and giving me a lot of confidence on where we'll come back even for the full year, is that as I look at the different markets around the world and I look at the timing of gallon shipments of concentrate, while gallons and cases were pretty much in line for the quarter, within certain high margin countries, Japan, the U.S., South Africa, for example, the gallons were behind cases. And this is a quarter where normally the Bottlers would be stocking up, getting ready for the summer season. Those are natural timings. Those will reverse. And so that gives me a lot of confidence that as we look at the price mix, it's going to come back we think even for the full year."

So I expect Japan to be -- remain challenged, but I think we see some improvements in the at-work market in Japan, in the Vending channel in Japan, compared to let’s say eight, nine, 10 months ago. We're gaining share in Japan, particularly in the Ready-to-Drink Coffee, very critical Ready-to-Drink Coffee category. And our sparkling beverages are very healthy in Japan. Coca-Cola Zero continues to do really well, also some new product introductions also continue to do very well. It's a very complex market. Coca-Cola Zero, as I said, was up about 24%. But you can look at Japan in the following mindset: Japan will remain challenged, but we expect that there will be some sequential improvements going forward."

So it is 3% impact in the quarter on consolidated revenues, but then there's inter-company elimination, so it's actually 2% net of the eliminations, 2% on operating income and 0% at pretax income or net income. So you come back to exactly the same place. But it was about $115 million reduction in net revenue in the quarter from the de-consolidation of those Bottlers."

You're right in pointing that out and I think that we’re also pleased with that. And that is testimony to not only -- again, work that's been done in this past quarter, but the work that we've been doing in our brands and strengthening our brands, particularly sparkling brands. The investments that are going into the sparkling brand for the last year and a half, and again our brand metrics for our sparkling brands are healthier than we've seen them in many, many years. Coca-Cola Zero, again, had a very, very strong quarter in the United States. And again, still tremendous room to grow in the United States going forward. So I think packaging is working. Our $0.99 single-serve is working. The contourization as is now in more than 50% of the country and getting tremendous distribution coverage is working very well. So all those programs that we've put into place last year and even at the end of 2008 are beginning to bear fruit. So that's why we see an improving landscape in the Sparkling category in the United States and our brands in that category. As far as still beverages are concerned, I think Sports -- POWERade, again, cycling a very strong prior year quarter at more than double-digits growth from last year, grew this year, which was very pleasing. We, I think, gained volume and value share in the juice and juice drinks category as expansion of Simply Orange in both Packaging and Cold channel lead to another quarter of double-digit growth, which was very pleasing. And again, we also made the strategic decision to exit the lower margin Retail Spring Water segment of the Water category. And accordingly, we've eliminated the Retail Spring Customer Brand Water volume from our reported results for 2010, as well as 2009. And I can reiterate that this change does not impact either the Company’s or our North America's reported volumes results this quarter. And again, I think vitaminwater. We're very excited with the changes we've made: new product innovation of vitaminwater zero, as well as packaging, as well as the advertising. And we expect to deliver stronger results through the balance of the year, with again, that strong brand. Our energy brand, NOS, continued to grow very effectively in the quarter, as well as also our Smartwater. So I think overall, those are the sort of important point that I'd like to make about our North American business that you asked, Christine."

But again, as I referenced to Christine's question, it's really important to understand that these packaging changes and also our Open Happiness campaign, our branding, our connection with the Olympics property in the quarter, all of that plays very well into our brands. And again, our brands are getting healthier. Our packaging, as I said, is working; 50% coverage in the entire United States on our contourization for two liter. The pricing of two liter, again, versus the single-serves are in a much better place than it was back 18 months ago.

We closed the deal finally and then in 2006. And we've been busy putting ourselves to work to get Germany right. So it's really important to understand that this is not a program that suddenly came into being last quarter or last year. We've been working on getting Germany right. Is Germany right? I'd say probably more than certainly 50% right. And I am confident that looking into the future, Germany is going to start yielding some good dividends as we move towards franchising Germany in the period that we've announced. But think of it along the same lines as what we're doing in the United States. These are long-term programs that we commit ourselves to fixing major markets. Germany was a big one, internationally.

I think Russia already after, as you said, a very difficult consumer environment in 2009, where we saw double-digit declines for the whole CPG sector, is beginning to show again positive developments, where we're almost even in the quarter in Russia, minus one. And we grew -- importantly grew Trademark Coca-Cola double-digits in Russia, which, as I said, was pleasing for me.

Let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. We once again delivered consistent, profitable and sustainable growth inspired by our 2020 Vision and also fueled by our innovatio",2993,"Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. We once again delivered consistent, profitable and sustainable growth inspired by our 2020 Vision and also fueled by our innovation and global reach. 
Despite ongoing challenges in global economic conditions, we continue to invest in our business and build our brands, while generating strong and also steady cash flow. We are competing and winning around the world as one company with our global bottling partners, leveraging our unique scale as well as the increased presence of our brands.
As we announced earlier this quarter, we are taking decisive actions to strategically advance our North America business and further strengthen our franchise system in Europe. We remain confident in our ability to execute our 2020 Vision, thus laying the foundation for consistent, long-term sustainable growth.
As I’ve mentioned on numerous occasions, we see tremendous growth opportunities for our system and for the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry over the next 10 years and beyond. This past quarter, despite the lingering effects of the global recession, we delivered solid 9% operating income growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Overall, global economic unit case volume grew a strong 3% with a significant number of international markets fueling this growth. And our growth in countries with a per capita of less than 150 was an exceptional 10%. 
Let me take a moment to share in more detail our performance across our international markets. In Eurasia and Africa, we saw broad-based growth of 11%. This increase was led by India, up a strong 29% and cycling 31%, making this our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in this fast-growing nation. And while sustaining this high growth rate in India in the coming months will likely depend on weather patterns during the upcoming monsoon season, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent double-digit growth for the balance of this year.
We also saw double-digit growth in Turkey, Northwest Africa, Southern Eurasia and the Middle East. Notably, we are beginning to see sequential improvement in Russia, which was down 1% led by the strong performance of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 12% and gained share this quarter in Russia.
Latin America maintained its steady and consistent performance, up 4% overall, driven by strong 12% growth in Brazil. Our Latin Center unit was up double digits led by Colombia, which grew 19%, while our South Latin unit was up mid-single digits.
Mexico, impacted by unseasonably cold weather, was down 2%. But as the weather has improved, this trend has reversed with our business generating positive growth in the month of March. And despite these weather challenges in the quarter, we continued to gain total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage share in Mexico driven by both our sparkling and our still beverages.
Our Pacific Group continued to expand, up 5% in total and led by double-digit growth across Korea, Indonesia and several other markets. Our volume performance in Japan was a sequential improvement on our performance in the last two quarters, down 3%. Despite ongoing economic headwinds, we are experiencing steady improvement in the critical Vending channel, as well as strong results in the Convenience Store channel.  This led to better performance for our Georgia Coffee business. 
Our Trademark Coca-Cola brands in Japan keep widening the gap against our primary competitor, led by Coca-Cola Zero, which was up 24% for the quarter. In fact, since 2005 we have grown Trademark Coca-Cola incremental unit case volume in Japan 5x more than our main competitor has grown its trademark brands over the same period. And our I LOHAS, our fast-growing eco-friendly natural mineral water brand launched last May, is building on its market share leadership. In less than a year, it has become the number one packaged water brand in Japan.
China unit case volume grew 6%, including double-digit growth in the latter half of the quarter. This performance comes on the heels of a strong fourth quarter and a great finish to 2009, which was led by -- across our portfolio, as well as new product launches.
Over the past six months, our volume grew a solid 16%. And while we may see volume swings from quarter-to-quarter, this 16% growth over the past six months was ahead of our primary international competitor. For perspective, our China business has generated more than 100 million incremental unit cases this past six months and continues to be twice the size of our primary international competitor on an annual basis. And we are building momentum across our entire portfolio. 
We are advancing our Sparkling business in China behind strong innovations such as the launch of Spritea, which taps into the combined popularity of green tea and Sprite. We're expanding our winning Still beverage business through the ongoing growth of our industry-leading juice and juice drink beverages and our Minute Maid Pulpy Super Milky dairy brand. And we are kicking off an exciting new Yuan Ye-led tea portfolio launching Yuan Ye jasmine tea. And as we have shared before, we are just getting started in China and remain resolute in our commitment to invest for solid long-term growth.
Now moving to Europe. Despite the continuation of difficult economic conditions in Europe, our unit case volume growth was even for the quarter. This was an improvement over our 2009 full year results with growth across France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and North Central Europe. Further, our company-owned bottlers in Europe grew well ahead of the region, with Germany up mid-single digits and Nordics up low-single digits as we build towards re-franchising both of these operations.
In the United Kingdom, we were pleased that our Trademark Coca-Cola brands became the first to top the GBP 1 billion mark in annual U.K. grocery retail sales. We are excited about our recently announced increased investment in Innocent, reflecting our belief in the long-term growth potential of the Smoothie business.
Lastly and in alignment with our 2020 Vision, we recently reorganized our Europe business from 10 business units to four, making it easier for us to do business with our bottlers, as well as partners, as we gain significant scale, speed and simplicity.
In total, these international performance results are a testament to our seasoned operating team, which is executing our 2020 Vision quickly and also with great discipline. I can assure you that our strategy and focus to build the long-term equity of our brands remains decisively clear. This focus is reflected in the volume and value share gains we continue to realize together with our bottling partners around the world.
As a system, we are pulling together to communicate with our consumers, invest in our brands and build for a better tomorrow. Now let me briefly explain each of these actions.
First, communicating with our consumers. Last quarter, I highlighted some of the important global platforms we are leveraging in 2010 to communicate and connect with consumers around the world. We just concluded our successful Vancouver Olympics program, which helped improve Trademark Coca-Cola brand equity scores with teens in Canada. And these improvements are flowing to the bottom line as we have grown dollar share for Trademark Coca-Cola and system revenue in Canada to their highest levels in years.
Meanwhile, our FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour carries on with its journey all around the world. The Tour has now traveled to 27 international markets, engaging thousands of consumers and earning an average of $2 million of media value in each and every country visited. In addition, we are finding new and innovative ways to leverage our FIFA World Cup platform to more effectively communicate with consumers. 
For example, we launched POWERade's first-ever global marketing campaign, which includes an innovative online experience. A series of digital films highlight the functional benefits of POWERade and also showcase a never-ending football game played around the world. This campaign has already launched on YouTube in Brazil, Mexico, Italy, Spain and 16 more countries. 
We're also teaming up with customers around the world to bring the passion and the excitement of the FIFA World Cup to life for our consumers. A great example is the marketing program we developed together with Wal-Mart. By using a jointly produced global toolkit, we will drive incremental sales for Wal-Mart and our company while making the excitement of the World Cup more affordable and accessible for everyday fans.
Finally, as the global partner of the 2010 World Exposition in Shanghai, we expect to host over 100 million visitors from China and around the world at our Coca-Cola Happiness Factory pavilion, engaging consumers, customers and other key global stakeholders through an extensive marketing program that will be executed during this exciting 184-day event.
So these are just a few examples of how we are connecting directly with our consumers across many, many nations in a way that only our company, with our global footprint, can do.
Secondly, we are relentlessly focused on investing in our brands. Let me start with sparkling beverages, where I have already highlighted some of the many countries where we experienced sparkling growth this quarter. Brand Coca-Cola grew in line with our worldwide volume. Coca-Cola unit case volume grew over 1 million unit cases in 24 different countries. 
We were very proud to see Diet Coke for the first time since its introduction tie for the number two brand position amongst all sparkling brands in the United States, behind only Coca-Cola, as reported in Beverage Digest last month. As for Coca-Cola Zero, it is still driving growth for us in every operating group, increasing double digits for the 16th consecutive quarter in North America and 7% on a worldwide basis. 
Just like we shared in our recent investor event, we intend to keep growing Trademark Coca-Cola, the epicenter of our business, in 2010 and well beyond. And we're building on our track record, successfully introducing cross-category innovations by launching several new beverages including Spritea in China, which I mentioned earlier, as well as Fanta White, a new sparkling lactic drink, which will launch in Japan next week.
We are innovating and expanding our still beverages as well. We're launching new brand extensions across multiple markets, such as vitaminwater zero in North America and Minute Maid Nimble Fresh Lemonade in India. Both are gaining great momentum and traction. We're expanding our successful innovations across borders, such as our Pulpy juice drink innovation created under the Minute Maid trademark in the Pacific and now also available under the Del Valle Trademark in Latin America. Altogether, our Pulpy brands are now present in 12 countries. We also have plans in place to take Jugo, our juice and dairy innovation launched in Chile last year, into other markets in Latin America later this year.
We're leveraging best-in-class programs across borders, as in the case of vitaminwater, where we are implementing a fully integrated 360-degree summer program in almost all of our international markets. We are leveraging best practices from Canada, Great Britain, Japan and Mexico to ensure excellence, consistency and impact for this great brand.
Thirdly, we're building for a better tomorrow and are fully committed to growing in a sustainable and responsible way in partnership with our consumers, customers and communities. To the benefit of all our consumers, we're working in partnership with the First Lady of the United States on a program to end childhood obesity in a generation. We have announced our Clear on Calories commitment in support of this special effort. 
While I already highlighted an example of how we work in partnership with global customers, in the end the proof is in the results. That is why we were particularly pleased to see our business with our top 10 global retail customers grow mid-single digits in volume and double digits in revenue in 2009, ahead of our total company growth.
Lastly, a great example of our efforts to support our communities is our launch of Odwalla's Haiti Hope Mango juice drink in the United States. 100% of the profits of this beverage will go to support the development of a sustainable fruit industry and thousands and thousands of families in Haiti. As we build these relationships for the future, stakeholders from around the world are recognizing our performance. 
In the past few weeks, we've been honored to receive several acknowledgments. FORTUNE Magazine ranked us number 10 in their annual list of the World's Most Admired Companies; number one overall in beverages and number one across multiple beverage industry attributes including innovation, financial soundness and social responsibility. 
Harris Interactive ranked us number eight on their annual list of Most Admired U.S. Companies, as well as in the top five in vision and leadership, as well as financial performance. 
Corporate Social Responsibility Magazine (sic) [Corporate Responsibility Magazine] ranked their 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2010 and rated us at number eight, ahead of all other beverage companies. 
And just this week, BusinessWeek moved us up in their annual ranking of the World's Most Innovative Companies, positioning us as the Most Innovative Consumer Goods Company in the world. 
Our eco-friendly I LOHAS bottle was recognized by both the Asian Marketing Effectiveness Festival, where we won their Platinum Award and Japan's Ministry of Environment, which awarded us with their Grand Prize for Global Environment. 
And Wal-Mart named us their Supplier of the Year in China, while 7-Eleven's Franchise System did the same in North America.
Staying in North America, our volume results declined 2% for the quarter, consistent with our 2009 results. Our unit case volume for Sparkling beverages declined 1% in the quarter in North America, showing sequential improvement. Our Still beverages were down 2% for the quarter, although we were able to still hold value share. 
Importantly, our newest billion-dollar brand, Simply, grew 26% in the quarter, while strong POWERade activity, driven by effective NCAA March Madness programs helped drive volume and value share gains in the Sports Drinks category. 
Now let me turn to our biggest news of the quarter and update you on the great progress we've made since announcing our intention to acquire CCE's North America business. As previously announced, we have appointed Brian Kelly to lead the integration of The Coca-Cola Company's and CCE’s North American operations. Brian's integration team, announced internally last week, consists of leaders from both The Coca-Cola Company and CCE whose operating credentials and knowledge of the North American market is second to none. I have the utmost confidence that this team will deliver on our integration goals.
Earlier today, we also announced our post-integration leadership team for North America. Steve Cahillane, currently President of the North American Business Unit for CCE will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of the new Coca-Cola Refreshments once the company’s acquisition of CCE North America has been successfully concluded. 
Sandy Douglas will continue as President of Coca-Cola North America. Both Steve and Sandy, who’ve executed very effectively and in concert with each other for the past two years, will report directly to me. This will be the first time ever that our North American bottling, can, fountain and juice businesses will be produced, marketed and sold by an integrated 21st-century service organization. We're truly excited by this prospect.
And as I've said before, we're taking decisive action in North America from a position of strength. I am excited that both Steve and Sandy, who've been so instrumental in driving positive change in North America, have agreed to lead our efforts to capture the great opportunity that this important marketplace has to offer. 
Let me reiterate my fundamental view about our business in North America. Growing here is not optional. It is essential to the health and future of our entire global system. And if you look at the external forces shaping our 2020 Vision, especially changing demographics, North America is at the heart of many of these trends. 
The U.S. population is growing and will increase by over 30 million by 2020, outpacing the absolute population gains of fast-growing countries like Brazil, Egypt and Indonesia. And with over 30 million teens in 2020, the teen population of the United States is projected to be greater than that of Brazil, Mexico, Egypt and Vietnam.  Clearly, there is great opportunity in our North America business across our entire portfolio and particularly with Trademark Coca-Cola. 
Today, our favorite brand scores are higher than they've been in over a decade. We believe innovative marketing, merchandising, strong execution and clear communications will be the key to restoring Trademark Coca-Cola growth in North America, just like we were able to successfully bring back growth to Coke in Japan and the United Kingdom. 
The acquisition of CCE's North American business and the re-franchising of our European operations are consistent with our 2020 Vision. This evolution in our business will give us the financial flexibility and marketing and distribution leadership required to accelerate our business in North America and Western Europe, while also strengthening the long-term health of our franchise system. 
As we work to create the world's premier, low-cost and effective beverage manufacturing and distribution business, one with a fully empowered and centralized national sales organization, we are confident these actions will result in greater value for our shareholders. 
Let me close by saying that it is clear that consumers are not yet out of this crisis and still remain confused due to the extended economic headwinds around the world. Therefore, given this environment, there still may be bumps along the way this year and we may continue to experience some quarter-to-quarter volatility. That said, we confidently stand behind our long-term growth targets and intend to keep winning together in 2010 growing volume, share and profits.
As we look ahead, we firmly believe that there is no better business to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry. And we remain intently focused on creating shareholder value. With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,100171032,57569,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-20-2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar indicated, we're off to a good start in 2010, delivering consistent, sustainable and quality volume and profit growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our first quarter results are a clear in",904,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar indicated, we're off to a good start in 2010, delivering consistent, sustainable and quality volume and profit growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our first quarter results are a clear indication that we have the right leadership in place with the right strategic plans and capabilities to achieve these goals. 
One quick reminder, and as highlighted during our last earnings call, our comparable results for this quarter reflect the impact of the de-consolidation of certain entities, primarily bottlers, due to changes in our accounting guidance as per FASB requirements. To facilitate comparisons, we will post details of all of these adjustments by quarter on our Investor Relations website later this week.
As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.80, up 23% versus prior year. For the quarter, comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 9%. Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 7%, driven by a 3% increase in Concentrate sales and a 6% positive currency impact, partially offset by geographic mix.
As anticipated and as we indicated in our last earnings call, we continue to see many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker rate than our developed markets, resulting in continued pressure on our geographic or country mix at a consolidated level. This is a natural outcome for a company like ours with such an extensive global footprint. 
At the same time, we effectively executed our revenue growth management initiatives to realize positive pricing. This enabled us to grow global value share for the 11th consecutive quarter, while maintaining global volume share for the quarter. These results reflect our continued effort, focus and commitment to win in every market as we come out of this global crisis. Our objectives remain steadfast; strengthen the health of our brands and drive share gains. 
We anticipate that our positive revenue strategies will be offset by geographic mix. Therefore, as we said in the last earnings call, we expect our price mix to be even for the full year. And as we also said in that call, we would expect to see a return to positive price mix over the long term as global consumer sentiment steadily improves.
As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 52% in the quarter to $1.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance and the cycling of a pension funding of about $200 million in the prior year.
Now let me explain some of the factors impacting our quarterly results and full year trends. Our comparable currency-neutral cost of goods was down 3% for the quarter as a result of the shifts in mix. On a full year basis, we would expect our cost of goods to grow in a more normalized, low single-digit range.
Comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were down 1% in the quarter. This reflects the timing of marketing expenses and it also reflects the continued benefits of our productivity initiatives, which we have pursued on an ongoing basis for the past 2½  years. We anticipate our full year operating expense leverage will come in, in the low single digits.
Next, I want to call out two items related to North America. First, related to the CCE transaction, our integration planning has progressed quickly and in an orderly fashion under the leadership of Brian Kelly in his team. And as Muhtar mentioned before, we're excited about the continued leadership both from Steve Cahillane and Sandy Douglas that they will bring to our North American business. As for the approval process for the transaction, we have not experienced any delays and still expect a early fourth quarter close.
Second, and as part of our ongoing work to strengthen our economic profits in North America, we've made a strategic decision to exit the low-margin retail spring water segment of the water category. Accordingly, we have eliminated the retail spring and customer brand water volume from our reported volume for both 2010 and 2009. This change did not have any impact on either the company or North America's reported volume results this quarter.
Now let me take a moment to provide our outlook on some of the other key factors we see impacting this year. As expected, we benefited from currency in the first quarter. We still believe currencies will have a slightly positive impact on operating income for the full year, with this benefit weighted toward the first half of the year. On productivity, we’re on track to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of 2011. 
And lastly, with regard to share repurchase let me reaffirm that while we are out of the market until we close the transaction with CCE, we are still committed to repurchasing at least $1.5 billion of the company's stock in 2010. 
In conclusion, we're only just beginning to emerge from the global recession and expect the recovery to be moderate as consumer outlook slowly improves. Our seasoned management team has clearly taken the right actions, executing the right strategies in this global environment to drive our business for the long term and build on our track record of success. We remain confident and will continue gaining global share, while enhancing the health of our brands in order to drive long-term, profitable growth and value for our shareholders.

And that when those markets which are lower margin grow faster, you're going to get some negative pressure from geographic mix. And at the same time, our pricing mix was actually positive in the quarter. But the other impact that is totally timing and giving me a lot of confidence of where we'll come back even for the full year, is that as I look at the different markets around the world and I look at the timing of gallon shipments of concentrate, while gallons and cases were pretty much in line for the quarter, within certain high margin countries, Japan, the U.S., South Africa, for example, the gallons were behind cases. And this is a quarter where normally the bottlers would be stocking up, getting ready for the summer season. Those are natural timings. Those will reverse. And so that gives me a lot of confidence that as we look at the price mix, it's going to come back we think even for the full year."

We're gaining share in Japan, particularly in the ready-to-drink coffee, very critical ready-to-drink coffee category. And our Sparkling beverages are very healthy in Japan. Coca-Cola Zero continues to do really well. Also some new product introductions also continue to do very well. It's a very complex market. Coca-Cola Zero, as I said, was up about 24%. But you can look at Japan in the following mindset: Japan will remain challenged, but we expect that there will be some sequential improvements going forward."

And that is testimony to not only, again work that's been done in this past quarter, but the work that we've been doing in our brands and strengthening our brands, particularly the sparkling brands. The investments that are going into sparkling brands for the last year and a half, and again our brand metrics for our sparkling brands are healthier than we've seen them in many, many years. Coca-Cola Zero, again, had a very, very strong quarter in the United States. And again, still tremendous room to grow in the United States going forward. So I think packaging is working. Our $0.99 single-serve is working. The contourization that is now in more than 50% of the country and getting tremendous distribution coverage is working very well. So all those programs that we've put into place last year and even at the end of 2008 are beginning to bear fruit. So that's why we see an improving landscape in the sparkling category in the United States and our brands in that category. As far as still beverages are concerned, I think POWERade, again, cycling a very strong prior year quarter at double-digits growth from last year. Grew this year, which was very pleasing. We, I think, gained volume and value share in the juice and juice drinks category as expansion of Simply Orange in both packaging and cold channel lead to another quarter of double-digit growth, which was very pleasing. And again, we also made the strategic decision to exit the lower-margin retail spring water segment of the water category. And accordingly, we've eliminated the retail spring and customer brand water volume from our reported results for 2010, as well as 2009. And I can reiterate that this change does not impact either the company’s or our North America's reported volumes results this quarter. And again, I think vitaminwater, we're very excited with the changes we've made. New product innovation of vitaminwater zero, as well as packaging, as well as the advertising, and we expect to deliver stronger results through the balance of the year with again, that strong brand. Our energy brand, NOS, continued to grow very effectively in the quarter, as well as also our Smartwater. So I think overall, those are the sort of important points that I'd like to make about our North American business that you asked, Christine."

And particularly, as we see Mexico coming back some, we would expect to see very positive results we have Latin America through the remainder of this year. On Eurasia and Africa, there was a negative five points price mix there. It is primarily driven by geographic mix of higher growth in Northern Africa, for example, lower sales in South Africa. But as I mentioned, the Concentrates sale are behind cases in South Africa, which is what's driving that. I would expect that to reverse in the remainder of the year. And so a lot of that will start coming back."

Let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with our first quarter results.

Let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. We once again delivered consistent, profitable and sustainable growth inspired by our 2020 Vision and also fueled by our innovation and global reach. 
Despite ongoing challenges in global economic conditions, we continue to invest in our business and build our brands, while generating strong and also steady cash flow. We are competing and winning around the world as one company with our global bottling partners, leveraging our unique scale as well as the increased presence of our brands.
As we announced earlier this quarter, we are taking decisive actions to strategically advance our North America business and further strengthen our franchise system in Europe. We remain confident in our ability to execute our 2020 Vision, thus laying the foundation for consistent, long-term sustainable growth.
As I’ve mentioned on numerous occasions, we see tremendous growth opportunities for our system and for the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry over the next 10 years and beyond. This past quarter, despite the lingering effects of the global recession, we delivered solid 9% operating income growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Overall, global economic unit case volume grew a strong 3% with a significant number of international markets fueling this growth. And our growth in countries with a per capita of less than 150 was an exceptional 10%. 
Let me take a moment to share in more detail our performance across our international markets. In Eurasia and Africa, we saw broad-based growth of 11%. This increase was led by India, up a strong 29% and cycling 31%, making this our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in this fast-growing nation. And while sustaining this high growth rate in India in the coming months will likely depend on weather patterns during the upcoming monsoon season, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent double-digit growth for the balance of this year.
We also saw double-digit growth in Turkey, Northwest Africa, Southern Eurasia and the Middle East. Notably, we are beginning to see sequential improvement in Russia, which was down 1% led by the strong performance of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 12% and gained share this quarter in Russia.
Latin America maintained its steady and consistent performance, up 4% overall, driven by strong 12% growth in Brazil. Our Latin Center unit was up double digits led by Colombia, which grew 19%, while our South Latin unit was up mid-single digits.
Mexico, impacted by unseasonably cold weather, was down 2%. But as the weather has improved, this trend has reversed with our business generating positive growth in the month of March. And despite these weather challenges in the quarter, we continued to gain total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage share in Mexico driven by both our sparkling and our still beverages.
Our Pacific Group continued to expand, up 5% in total and led by double-digit growth across Korea, Indonesia and several other markets. Our volume performance in Japan was a sequential improvement on our performance in the last two quarters, down 3%. Despite ongoing economic headwinds, we are experiencing steady improvement in the critical Vending channel, as well as strong results in the Convenience Store channel.  This led to better performance for our Georgia Coffee business. 
Our Trademark Coca-Cola brands in Japan keep widening the gap against our primary competitor, led by Coca-Cola Zero, which was up 24% for the quarter. In fact, since 2005 we have grown Trademark Coca-Cola incremental unit case volume in Japan 5x more than our main competitor has grown its trademark brands over the same period. And our I LOHAS, our fast-growing eco-friendly natural mineral water brand launched last May, is building on its market share leadership. In less than a year, it has become the number one packaged water brand in Japan.
China unit case volume grew 6%, including double-digit growth in the latter half of the quarter. This performance comes on the heels of a strong fourth quarter and a great finish to 2009, which was led by growth across our portfolio, as well as new product launches.
Over the past six months, our volume grew a solid 16%. And while we may see volume swings from quarter-to-quarter, this 16% growth over the past six months was ahead of our primary international competitor. For perspective, our China business has generated more than 100 million incremental unit cases this past six months and continues to be twice the size of our primary international competitor on an annual basis. And we are building momentum across our entire portfolio. 
We are advancing our Sparkling business in China behind strong innovations such as the launch of Spritea, which taps into the combined popularity of green tea and Sprite. We're expanding our winning Still Beverage business through the ongoing growth of our industry-leading juice and juice drink beverages and our Minute Maid Pulpy Super Milky dairy brand. And we are kicking off an exciting new Yuan Ye-led tea portfolio launching Yuan Ye jasmine tea. And as we have shared before, we are just getting started in China and remain resolute in our commitment to invest for solid long-term growth.
Now moving to Europe. Despite the continuation of difficult economic conditions in Europe, our unit case volume growth was even for the quarter. This was an improvement over our 2009 full year results with growth across France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and North Central Europe. Further, our company-owned bottlers in Europe grew well ahead of the region, with Germany up mid-single digits and Nordics up low-single digits as we build towards re-franchising both of these operations.
In the United Kingdom, we were pleased that our Trademark Coca-Cola brands became the first to top the GBP 1 billion mark in annual U.K. grocery retail sales. We are excited about our recently announced increased investment in Innocent, reflecting our belief in the long-term growth potential of the Smoothie business.
Lastly and in alignment with our 2020 Vision, we recently reorganized our Europe business from 10 business units to four, making it easier for us to do business with our bottlers, as well as partners, as we gain significant scale, speed and simplicity.
In total, these international performance results are a testament to our seasoned operating team, which is executing our 2020 Vision quickly and also with great discipline. I can assure you that our strategy and focus to build the long-term equity of our brands remains decisively clear. This focus is reflected in the volume and value share gains we continue to realize together with our bottling partners around the world.
As a system, we are pulling together to communicate with our consumers, invest in our brands and build for a better tomorrow. Now let me briefly explain each of these actions.
First, communicating with our consumers. Last quarter, I highlighted some of the important global platforms we are leveraging in 2010 to communicate and connect with consumers around the world. We just concluded our successful Vancouver Olympics program, which helped improve Trademark Coca-Cola brand equity scores with teens in Canada. And these improvements are flowing to the bottom line as we have grown dollar share for Trademark Coca-Cola and system revenue in Canada to their highest levels in years.
Meanwhile, our FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour carries on with its journey all around the world. The Tour has now traveled to 27 international markets, engaging thousands of consumers and earning an average of $2 million of media value in each and every country visited. In addition, we are finding new and innovative ways to leverage our FIFA World Cup platform to more effectively communicate with consumers. 
For example, we launched POWERade's first-ever global marketing campaign, which includes an innovative online experience. A series of digital films highlight the functional benefits of POWERade and also showcase a never-ending football game played around the world. This campaign has already launched on YouTube in Brazil, Mexico, Italy, Spain and 16 more countries. 
We're also teaming up with customers around the world to bring the passion and the excitement of the FIFA World Cup to life for our consumers. A great example is the marketing program we developed together with Wal-Mart. By using a jointly produced global toolkit, we will drive incremental sales for Wal-Mart and our company while making the excitement of the World Cup more affordable and accessible for everyday fans.
Finally, as the global partner of the 2010 World Exposition in Shanghai, we expect to host over 100 million visitors from China and around the world at our Coca-Cola Happiness Factory pavilion, engaging consumers, customers and other key global stakeholders through an extensive marketing program that will be executed during this exciting 184-day event.
So these are just a few examples of how we are connecting directly with our consumers across many, many nations in a way that only our company, with our global footprint, can do.
Secondly, we are relentlessly focused on investing in our brands. Let me start with sparkling beverages, where I have already highlighted some of the many countries where we experienced sparkling growth this quarter. Brand Coca-Cola grew in line with our worldwide volume. Coca-Cola unit case volume grew over 1 million unit cases in 24 different countries. 
We were very proud to see Diet Coke for the first time since its introduction tie for the number two brand position amongst all sparkling brands in the United States, behind only Coca-Cola, as reported in Beverage Digest last month. As for Coca-Cola Zero, it is still driving growth for us in every operating group, increasing double digits for the 16th consecutive quarter in North America and 7% on a worldwide basis. 
Just like we shared in our recent investor event, we intend to keep growing Trademark Coca-Cola, the epicenter of our business, in 2010 and well beyond. And we're building on our track record, successfully introducing cross-category innovations by launching several new beverages including Spritea in China, which I mentioned earlier, as well as Fanta White, a new sparkling lactic drink, which will launch in Japan next week.
We are innovating and expanding our still beverages as well. We're launching new brand extensions across multiple markets, such as vitaminwater zero in North America and Minute Maid Nimble Fresh Lemonade in India. Both are gaining great momentum and traction. We're expanding our successful innovations across borders, such as our Pulpy juice drink innovation created under the Minute Maid trademark in the Pacific and now also available under the Del Valle Trademark in Latin America. Altogether, our Pulpy brands are now present in 12 countries. We also have plans in place to take Jugo, our juice and dairy innovation launched in Chile last year, into other markets in Latin America later this year.
We're leveraging best-in-class programs across borders, as in the case of vitaminwater, where we are implementing a fully integrated 360-degree summer program in almost all of our international markets. We are leveraging best practices from Canada, Great Britain, Japan and Mexico to ensure excellence, consistency and impact for this great brand.
Thirdly, we're building for a better tomorrow and are fully committed to growing in a sustainable and responsible way in partnership with our consumers, customers and communities. To the benefit of all our consumers, we're working in partnership with the First Lady of the United States on a program to end childhood obesity in a generation. We have announced our Clear on Calories commitment in support of this special effort. 
While I already highlighted an example of how we work in partnership with global customers, in the end the proof is in the results. That is why we were particularly pleased to see our business with our top 10 global retail customers grow mid-single digits in volume and double digits in revenue in 2009, ahead of our total company growth.
Lastly, a great example of our efforts to support our communities is our launch of Odwalla's Haiti Hope Mango juice drink in the United States. 100% of the profits of this beverage will go to support the development of a sustainable fruit industry and thousands and thousands of families in Haiti. As we build these relationships for the future, stakeholders from around the world are recognizing our performance. 
In the past few weeks, we've been honored to receive several acknowledgments. FORTUNE Magazine ranked us number 10 in their annual list of the World's Most Admired Companies; number one overall in beverages and number one across multiple beverage industry attributes including innovation, financial soundness and social responsibility. 
Harris Interactive ranked us number eight on their annual list of Most Admired U.S. Companies, as well as in the top five in vision and leadership, as well as financial performance. 
Corporate Social Responsibility Magazine (sic) [Corporate Responsibility Magazine] ranked their 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2010 and rated us at number eight, ahead of all other beverage companies. 
And just this week, BusinessWeek moved us up in their annual ranking of the World's Most Innovative Companies, positioning us as the Most Innovative Consumer Goods Company in the world. 
Our eco-friendly I LOHAS bottle was recognized by both the Asian Marketing Effectiveness Festival, where we won their Platinum Award and Japan's Ministry of Environment, which awarded us with their Grand Prize for Global Environment. 
And Wal-Mart named us their Supplier of the Year in China, while 7-Eleven's Franchise System did the same in North America.
Staying in North America, our volume results declined 2% for the quarter, consistent with our 2009 results. Our unit case volume for Sparkling beverages declined 1% in the quarter in North America, showing sequential improvement. Our Still beverages were down 2% for the quarter, although we were able to still hold value share. 
Importantly, our newest billion-dollar brand, Simply, grew 26% in the quarter, while strong POWERade activity, driven by effective NCAA March Madness programs helped drive volume and value share gains in the Sports Drinks category. 
Now let me turn to our biggest news of the quarter and update you on the great progress we've made since announcing our intention to acquire CCE's North America business. As previously announced, we have appointed Brian Kelly to lead the integration of The Coca-Cola Company's and CCE’s North American operations. Brian's integration team, announced internally last week, consists of leaders from both The Coca-Cola Company and CCE whose operating credentials and knowledge of the North American market is second to none. I have the utmost confidence that this team will deliver on our integration goals.
Earlier today, we also announced our post-integration leadership team for North America. Steve Cahillane, currently President of the North American Business Unit for CCE will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of the new Coca-Cola Refreshments once the company’s acquisition of CCE North America has been successfully concluded. 
Sandy Douglas will continue as President of Coca-Cola North America. Both Steve and Sandy, who’ve executed very effectively and in concert with each other for the past two years, will report directly to me. This will be the first time ever that our North American bottling, can, fountain and juice businesses will be produced, marketed and sold by an integrated 21st-century service organization. We're truly excited by this prospect.
And as I've said before, we're taking decisive action in North America from a position of strength. I am excited that both Steve and Sandy, who've been so instrumental in driving positive change in North America, have agreed to lead our efforts to capture the great opportunity that this important marketplace has to offer. 
Let me reiterate my fundamental view about our business in North America. Growing here is not optional. It is essential to the health and future of our entire global system. And if you look at the external forces shaping our 2020 Vision, especially changing demographics, North America is at the heart of many of these trends. 
The U.S. population is growing and will increase by over 30 million by 2020, outpacing the absolute population gains of fast-growing countries like Brazil, Egypt and Indonesia. And with over 30 million teens in 2020, the teen population of the United States is projected to be greater than that of Brazil, Mexico, Egypt and Vietnam.  Clearly, there is great opportunity in our North America business across our entire portfolio and particularly with Trademark Coca-Cola. 
Today, our favorite brand scores are higher than they've been in over a decade. We believe innovative marketing, merchandising, strong execution and clear communications will be the key to restoring Trademark Coca-Cola growth in North America, just like we were able to successfully bring back growth to Coke in Japan and the United Kingdom. 
The acquisition of CCE's North American business and the re-franchising of our European operations are consistent with our 2020 Vision. This evolution in our business will give us the financial flexibility and marketing and distribution leadership required to accelerate our business in North America and Western Europe, while also strengthening the long-term health of our franchise system. 
As we work to create the world's premier, low-cost and effective beverage manufacturing and distribution business, one with a fully empowered and centralized national sales organization, we are confident these actions will result in greater value for our shareholders. 
Let me close by saying that it is clear that consumers are not yet out of this crisis and still remain confused due to the extended economic headwinds around the world. Therefore, given this environment, there still may be bumps along the way this year and we may continue to experience some quarter-to-quarter volatility. That said, we confidently stand behind our long-term growth targets and intend to keep winning together in 2010 growing volume, share and profits.
As we look ahead, we firmly believe that there is no better business to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry. And we remain intently focused on creating shareholder value. With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary."
26642,100171032,58065,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-20-2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar indicated, we're off to a good start in 2010, delivering consistent, sustainable and quality volume and profit growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our first quarter results are a clear in",904,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar indicated, we're off to a good start in 2010, delivering consistent, sustainable and quality volume and profit growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our first quarter results are a clear indication that we have the right leadership in place with the right strategic plans and capabilities to achieve these goals. 
One quick reminder, and as highlighted during our last earnings call, our comparable results for this quarter reflect the impact of the de-consolidation of certain entities, primarily bottlers, due to changes in our accounting guidance as per FASB requirements. To facilitate comparisons, we will post details of all of these adjustments by quarter on our Investor Relations website later this week.
As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.80, up 23% versus prior year. For the quarter, comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 9%. Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 7%, driven by a 3% increase in Concentrate sales and a 6% positive currency impact, partially offset by geographic mix.
As anticipated and as we indicated in our last earnings call, we continue to see many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker rate than our developed markets, resulting in continued pressure on our geographic or country mix at a consolidated level. This is a natural outcome for a company like ours with such an extensive global footprint. 
At the same time, we effectively executed our revenue growth management initiatives to realize positive pricing. This enabled us to grow global value share for the 11th consecutive quarter, while maintaining global volume share for the quarter. These results reflect our continued effort, focus and commitment to win in every market as we come out of this global crisis. Our objectives remain steadfast; strengthen the health of our brands and drive share gains. 
We anticipate that our positive revenue strategies will be offset by geographic mix. Therefore, as we said in the last earnings call, we expect our price mix to be even for the full year. And as we also said in that call, we would expect to see a return to positive price mix over the long term as global consumer sentiment steadily improves.
As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 52% in the quarter to $1.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance and the cycling of a pension funding of about $200 million in the prior year.
Now let me explain some of the factors impacting our quarterly results and full year trends. Our comparable currency-neutral cost of goods was down 3% for the quarter as a result of the shifts in mix. On a full year basis, we would expect our cost of goods to grow in a more normalized, low single-digit range.
Comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were down 1% in the quarter. This reflects the timing of marketing expenses and it also reflects the continued benefits of our productivity initiatives, which we have pursued on an ongoing basis for the past 2½  years. We anticipate our full year operating expense leverage will come in, in the low single digits.
Next, I want to call out two items related to North America. First, related to the CCE transaction, our integration planning has progressed quickly and in an orderly fashion under the leadership of Brian Kelly in his team. And as Muhtar mentioned before, we're excited about the continued leadership both from Steve Cahillane and Sandy Douglas that they will bring to our North American business. As for the approval process for the transaction, we have not experienced any delays and still expect a early fourth quarter close.
Second, and as part of our ongoing work to strengthen our economic profits in North America, we've made a strategic decision to exit the low-margin retail spring water segment of the water category. Accordingly, we have eliminated the retail spring and customer brand water volume from our reported volume for both 2010 and 2009. This change did not have any impact on either the company or North America's reported volume results this quarter.
Now let me take a moment to provide our outlook on some of the other key factors we see impacting this year. As expected, we benefited from currency in the first quarter. We still believe currencies will have a slightly positive impact on operating income for the full year, with this benefit weighted toward the first half of the year. On productivity, we’re on track to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of 2011. 
And lastly, with regard to share repurchase let me reaffirm that while we are out of the market until we close the transaction with CCE, we are still committed to repurchasing at least $1.5 billion of the company's stock in 2010. 
In conclusion, we're only just beginning to emerge from the global recession and expect the recovery to be moderate as consumer outlook slowly improves. Our seasoned management team has clearly taken the right actions, executing the right strategies in this global environment to drive our business for the long term and build on our track record of success. We remain confident and will continue gaining global share, while enhancing the health of our brands in order to drive long-term, profitable growth and value for our shareholders.

And that when those markets which are lower margin grow faster, you're going to get some negative pressure from geographic mix. And at the same time, our pricing mix was actually positive in the quarter. But the other impact that is totally timing and giving me a lot of confidence of where we'll come back even for the full year, is that as I look at the different markets around the world and I look at the timing of gallon shipments of concentrate, while gallons and cases were pretty much in line for the quarter, within certain high margin countries, Japan, the U.S., South Africa, for example, the gallons were behind cases. And this is a quarter where normally the bottlers would be stocking up, getting ready for the summer season. Those are natural timings. Those will reverse. And so that gives me a lot of confidence that as we look at the price mix, it's going to come back we think even for the full year."

We're gaining share in Japan, particularly in the ready-to-drink coffee, very critical ready-to-drink coffee category. And our Sparkling beverages are very healthy in Japan. Coca-Cola Zero continues to do really well. Also some new product introductions also continue to do very well. It's a very complex market. Coca-Cola Zero, as I said, was up about 24%. But you can look at Japan in the following mindset: Japan will remain challenged, but we expect that there will be some sequential improvements going forward."

And that is testimony to not only, again work that's been done in this past quarter, but the work that we've been doing in our brands and strengthening our brands, particularly the sparkling brands. The investments that are going into sparkling brands for the last year and a half, and again our brand metrics for our sparkling brands are healthier than we've seen them in many, many years. Coca-Cola Zero, again, had a very, very strong quarter in the United States. And again, still tremendous room to grow in the United States going forward. So I think packaging is working. Our $0.99 single-serve is working. The contourization that is now in more than 50% of the country and getting tremendous distribution coverage is working very well. So all those programs that we've put into place last year and even at the end of 2008 are beginning to bear fruit. So that's why we see an improving landscape in the sparkling category in the United States and our brands in that category. As far as still beverages are concerned, I think POWERade, again, cycling a very strong prior year quarter at double-digits growth from last year. Grew this year, which was very pleasing. We, I think, gained volume and value share in the juice and juice drinks category as expansion of Simply Orange in both packaging and cold channel lead to another quarter of double-digit growth, which was very pleasing. And again, we also made the strategic decision to exit the lower-margin retail spring water segment of the water category. And accordingly, we've eliminated the retail spring and customer brand water volume from our reported results for 2010, as well as 2009. And I can reiterate that this change does not impact either the company’s or our North America's reported volumes results this quarter. And again, I think vitaminwater, we're very excited with the changes we've made. New product innovation of vitaminwater zero, as well as packaging, as well as the advertising, and we expect to deliver stronger results through the balance of the year with again, that strong brand. Our energy brand, NOS, continued to grow very effectively in the quarter, as well as also our Smartwater. So I think overall, those are the sort of important points that I'd like to make about our North American business that you asked, Christine."

But again, as I reference to Christine's question, it's really important to understand that these packaging changes and also our Open Happiness campaign, our branding, our connection with the Olympics property in the quarter, all of that played very well into our brands.

But I can reiterate one thing; our brands, our investment, our innovation platforms remain very healthy. And I would state that we would be disappointed if we would not continue to achieve double-digit growth on an annual basis in China going forward. And if you view our business in China over the past six months, our volume averaged at 16% growth over the last six months, very consistent with same prior year period.

And particularly, as we see Mexico coming back some, we would expect to see very positive results we have Latin America through the remainder of this year. On Eurasia and Africa, there was a negative five points price mix there. It is primarily driven by geographic mix of higher growth in Northern Africa, for example, lower sales in South Africa.

Working closely wi",3452,"Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am broadly pleased with our second quarter performance. We once again delivered a quarter of solid growth with consistent profitable results around the world. Working closely with our great bottling partners, we continue to advance our 2020 Vision and roadmap for winning together. The global equity of our brands is strong and growing stronger. Our Worldwide FIFA World Cup activation was a tremendous success, bringing Coca-Cola to billions of consumers across cities, across towns, villages and living rooms the world over. And consumers clearly continue to prefer our brand with brand Coca-Cola growing 5% for the quarter and 4% year-to-date. Additionally, we saw extensive share gains this quarter across key beverage categories including sparkling, packaged water, ready-to-drink juice and juice drinks as well as sports drinks. As a result, we gained volume and value share in global nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We also gained global volume and value share in both the sparkling and still beverage categories.
At the same time, the global economy remains uncertain due to deficit concerns in Europe, recent downward revision to China's economy, and continued weakness in consumer confidence in certain pockets of the world. This cloudy global economic picture, however, does not dampen the strong commitment we've made to invest in our global operations and our brands for long-term sustainable growth.
We're also encouraged by the real progress we are making in our plans to integrate CCE's North American Bottling business. This transaction remains on track to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Now turning to current performance results. This quarter, we delivered strong 15% operating income growth on a comparable basis. Again, on a comparable currency-neutral basis, our 11% operating income growth was well ahead of our long-term growth target despite the lingering effects of the global recession. We grew our quarterly volume a strong 5%, cycling 4%, bringing our year-to-date volume to 4% at the higher end of our long-term growth target. This was fueled by solid organic unit case volume growth across both North America as well as key international markets. 
We increased net revenue 7% on a comparable basis in the quarter with our comparable currency-neutral revenues coming in at 5% in line with our long-term growth target. And once again, we generated significant cash from our operations with cash flow up 18% year-to-date.
Now I will take a moment to share our performance in more detail across our markets, and I will start by reviewing our business in North America, which I am pleased to say is continuing to gain momentum. 
North America grew 2% this quarter, returning this region to positive growth. In fact, we gained both volume and value share across both sparkling and still beverages. Equally important to this growth is how it is being achieved in this critical market. First, we are focused on building strong value-creating brands led by brand Coca-Cola, which grew both volume and value share this quarter, while increasing our favorite brand score advantage versus our primary competitor among key consumer segments.
Second, we are focused on generating profitable growth by delivering a more sophisticated price package and channel architecture in the United States. For example, we forged strong gains in our highly profitable immediate consumption offerings. In previous calls, we have highlighted the success of our smaller single-serve packages and the critical role they play in generating millions of incremental transactions. We are clearly building on this momentum. 
Additionally, we have seen 4% year-to-date growth of our portion control offerings in the supermarket channel. The growth of these offerings that provide consumers a choice of packages below 12 ounces with 100 or fewer calories is driven by our new 90-calorie mini can. And the recent introduction of our innovative 2-liter contour package has helped trademark Coca-Cola enter nearly 4 million new households year-to-date.
Importantly, our still beverages in North America were up 7% for the quarter. We have now grown volume share for 10 of the last 12 quarters and value share for six of the last seven quarters. Across North America, we're expanding the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser. This summer, we're adding another 500 machines as part of our pilot tests, and early results show that our customers are very, very excited about Coca-Cola Freestyle and the greater choice of brands available to distribute in their outlets.
For the past two years, we have voiced strong confidence in our strategies in North America, and we told you that we return growth to our flagship market. What we are seeing today is not an aberration. We firmly believe that North America will be a growth market of great opportunity for the next 10 years and beyond. This market is driven by an extremely positive demographic profile -- the envy of the developed world. We are confident that the actions we're taking today will only strengthen our future in North America and that we are positioned to capture more than our fair share of the great value this important market has to offer. 
Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa, which saw broad-based growth of 10% in the second quarter and 11% year-to-date. This dynamic growth was led by India, up 22% in the quarter and a strong 24% year-to-date, despite cycling over 30% growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. India has now delivered eight consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Additionally, we gained volume and value share this quarter across most key beverage categories in India. We also saw double-digit growth for the quarter in Turkey and Southern Eurasia and high single-digit growth in the Middle East.
In Africa, we just recently announced our system's commitment to more than double our investment in our business to $12 billion through 2020. This past quarter, we saw double-digit growth in East and Central Africa and high single-digit growth in North and West Africa. This growth was led by the strong performance of both our sparkling as well as still portfolio and the immediate benefits, of course, of our FIFA World Cup activation programs across the entire continent of Africa.
Russia, importantly, also improved on its first quarter momentum, delivering 6% growth in the quarter, bringing volume growth up to 3% on a year-to-date basis. This improvement has been driven by the sustained strong performance of our sparkling brands and, in particular, brand Coca-Cola, which once again gained share, while growing a strong 19% in the second quarter.
Moving now to Latin America, where we continued our steady and consistent performance. For the quarter, we were up a solid 7%, supported by a strong FIFA World Cup activation program. We outperformed the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share across multiple key markets including Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. These great results were driven by a strong 13% growth in Brazil. And as expected, Mexico rebounded well from the unseasonable cold weather in quarter one, growing 5% in the second quarter cycling 6% from the same period prior year.
Our Pacific Group continued to expand, growing 6% in both quarter two and year-to-date, led by double-digit growth across Thailand, the Philippines and several other markets in this region. Our volume performance in Japan was the same as in quarter one, down 3% for the quarter, cycling positive 2% growth from last year. This result was a little better than expected as Japan continues to suffer from economic headwinds as well as unfavorable weather conditions. 
Despite these challenges, our brand portfolio continues to gain traction with our consumers. For example, Coca-Cola trademark in Japan grew 2% in quarter two, while our Georgia coffee brands showed positive growth in its core and most profitable vending channel.
Our I LOHAS single-serve water continues to grow double digits even after cycling last year's May launch. In fact, since the quarter one of 2008, immediate consumption of water volume as a percent of total water volume in Japan has improved by over 20 percentage points. This is a great example of how we are executing a strategy of focusing on profitable system volume. And we just launched Sokenbicha tea in an innovative double eco bottle, which is both a pint bottle as well as ultra-lightweight. Overall, we are encouraged by the improving trends observed in Japan during this past quarter and believe we are executing the right strategies, yet we remain cautious as we expect the economic headwinds in Japan to continue in the near term.
China also maintains its quarter one performance, growing 6% in quarter two, cycling 14% from prior year. We outperformed the industry this past quarter, growing both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Further, we are more than twice the size of our primary international competitor in China, and we once again widened our lead in terms of total unit cases sold. We saw sequential improvement over the course of the quarter with our strongest overall growth in June, including positive sparkling growth. 
We also captured value share in our sparkling beverages in the quarter. And we continued to grow our still portfolio this quarter with our innovative Minute Maid Pulpy brand up double digits and our overall still beverages up a strong 30%.
Clearly, with a consumer fundamental and our very strong position in China, we're just getting started in this region. We are working hard to build our business across all categories, and especially our sparkling beverages. Our system has committed to investing $2 billion in China through 2011, and we remain dedicated to growing in China for the long term.
A good proof point of our commitment to grow in this exciting region is our participation at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai. Our interactive pavilion has been rated as one of Expo's most popular attractions. And our presence in the Expo has already generated close to $17 million in ad value in the first month since its opening. We encourage all of you to visit our pavilion if you are in Shanghai in the coming months and experience firsthand how we are building brand equity in China for the long term.
Now moving to Europe. We've seen that consumers and customers are still pressured by the difficult economic conditions that have impacted this region. For both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, our volume rounded down to minus 1% with solid growth in France as well as growth in Germany and Iberia, offset by ongoing challenges in Southern and Eastern Europe. 
Our Beverage business in Europe is almost 4x the size of our primary international competitor, and this quarter we gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages across the continent of Europe. In Germany, it's sustaining momentum capture in volume and value share, while delivering its fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth.
Year-to-date, total volume in Germany is up 3%. The importantly brand Coca-Cola volume is up 4%. We are encouraged by how we continue to build brand preference for our consumers and drive value for our customers. Going forward, as we look at our total business in Europe, we remain cautiously optimistic despite difficult economic conditions.
These global results, despite difficult operating conditions in some regions, are a testament to our seasoned operating team and our global franchise partners who are executing our 2020 Vision in a disciplined, aligned and decisive manner. We are working as an effective and integrated business system in order to best serve each market's unique customer and consumer needs, and we are gaining market share despite a challenging global marketplace.
We recently concluded a brand equity analysis for Coca-Cola across our top 22 markets from 2007 to 2009, looking at multiple brand health metrics such as favorite brand and the number of weekly and monthly consumers. The results of this analysis show that when looking across all our top 22 markets as a whole, these key metrics improved between one and two points during this two-year time period. To see our brand equity scores trend upwards during a time of macroeconomic pressure demonstrates, clearly, our success in connecting closely with our consumers to build brand equity across the markets, which we proudly serve.
Looking ahead, we remain intensely focused on what critically matters to our business: communicating with our consumers and investing in our brands. Let me briefly update you on some of the ways we are doing this.
First, communicating with our consumers. Having just returned personally from South Africa, I can confirm that our 2010 FIFA World Cup program has been very, very effective. It is our best example of how we can collaborate as a global team with our bottling partners to create powerful and integrated programming to build our brands. We have leveraged one campaign throughout 160 markets and drove our most unified marketing communications effort yet, all by capitalizing on our global scale, while communicating locally relevant as well as compelling stories that meaningfully connect with consumers all over the world.
Our POWERade FIFA World Cup program was rated near the top of all World Cup campaign ads tested, surpassing norms on all key measures. Importantly, consumers are responding to our World Cup messaging. Our FIFA-inspired World Cup anthem, “Waving Flag,” has been a real hit, reaching the #1 position on music charts in 17 countries, moving more than 800,000 download purchases and amassing more than 87 million video views on YouTube. A survey conducted in the U.K. by Lightspeed found that when asked to name their favorite FIFA World Cup ad of the year, consumers rated Coca-Cola #1. And when we purchased a FIFA World Cup-related Tweet on Twitter, the results were absolutely phenomenal. On the first day after the Tweet went online, our ad received over 85 million impressions and a 6% engagement rate compared to the 0.02% rate usually seen with other web-based advertising. That translates into over 5.1 million people interacting with our FIFA World Cup ad in just a 24-hour span.
Our innovative use of online marketing and social media is not just limited to the FIFA World Cup campaign, however. Our “Happiness Machine” video showing hidden camera footage of smiling students interacting with a generous Coke vending machine has been viewed nearly 2.5 million times, again, on YouTube. This video was awarded CLIO's prestigious Gold Interactive Award at the 51st annual dinner held in New York City this past May. This once again reminds us that there's nothing as good as authentic Coca-Cola stories of happiness, inclusion and optimism. 
Secondly, we are relentlessly focused on investing in our brands. Let me start by saying that now more than ever, we truly have momentum behind our brands. Not only is our brand equity strong and getting stronger but we are also seeing this equity translate into solid results across both our sparkling and still brand offerings. 
Sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter with international sparkling beverage unit case volume up 4%. Importantly, for countries with per capita consumption under 150, our sparkling beverages grew 7% in the second quarter, underscoring our strength in these important growth markets.
As for Coke Zero, it continues to be one of the fastest-growing sparkling beverages in the world. In North America, Coke Zero delivered double-digit brand volume growth for the 17th consecutive quarter. And across our top 22 markets, Coke Zero's share of the sparkling category is more than 4x greater than the share of its primary competitor. We will keep placing the growth of our sparkling portfolio front and center in all of our 2010 plans.
We are expanding our still beverages as well with total still beverage unit case volume increasing 10% in the quarter led by continued growth in juice and juice drinks, teas and water brands.  In North America, POWERade is building on its 2009 momentum, growing high teens this past quarter, while once again, gaining share. Consumers are clearly responding to the category-leading innovations we have pioneered this past year, including the functional advantages provided in POWERade's ION4 formulation as well as the zero-calorie benefits of POWERade Zero. In fact, POWERade Zero continues to accelerate, up 60% this past quarter alone and representing 15% of our year-to-date POWERade trademark volume in this important market.
As for vitaminwater, we have a leading consumer engagement model that is continuing to build brand health. A great example of this is our Flavor Creator app on Facebook, which encouraged our consumers to design the newest vitaminwater flavor Connect. These types of innovations have helped make vitaminwater one of the most popular beverages on Facebook with more fans than any of our primary competitor's flagship brands. I should mention that our recent launch of vitaminwater zero is yielding positive results. In fact, our entire set of premium glacéau brands were up a combined 4% this past quarter in the United States. 
Across the globe, the expansion and increased availability of vitaminwater is driving solid results in multiple markets. Year-to-date, international vitaminwater volume has reached 7 million unit cases over the equivalent of the brand size in the United States for the same period back in 2004. So we anticipate continued global momentum for vitaminwater fueled by a 360-degree integrated marketing plan, which is now being executed in 15 international markets.
In addition to vitaminwater, we are expanding across other key still categories. In the juice category, we saw continued solid results across the globe. For example, in North America, we once again gained volume and value share in the juice and juice drinks category with our Chilled Juice business growing 10% in the quarter and our Simply trademark delivering another quarter of double-digit growth. And finally, in the water category, our Branded Water business in the United States return to growth with DASANI up 3% for the quarter. Also this quarter, we launched DASANI in both Singapore as well as Malaysia.
As we continue to grow and expand, we are fully committed to doing so in a sustainable manner, living positively and responsibly in partnership with our consumers, with our customers and with our communities. This is why we were pleased to see the Coca-Cola Company receive high honors at the 22nd Annual DuPont Awards for Packaging Innovation. This prestigious DuPont Award is the packaging industry's longest-running, independently judged global awards program. Leading international industry and sustainability experts judge entrants on their excellence and innovation, sustainability and cost waste reduction. Our PlantBottle packaging earned one of five gold awards out of more than 160 global entrants for its breakthrough packaging innovation.
Now let me update you on the significant progress we have made in planning for the proposed integration of CCE's North America operations and Coca-Cola North America. Our seasoned integration team is working hard to identify opportunities to operate more efficiently and to serve our customers more effectively. 
Our team is also building plans to ensure smooth operations from day one. Further, we have begun the important work of creating a business model and organizational structure that will support a new era of success in North America. We will provide further details of this model once the transaction closes. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter in line with the timeline originally provided, and we will provide updates as additional information becomes available.
Let me close by saying that despite ongoing global economic headwinds, we are confident in our system's ability to win together to achieve our 2020 Vision. And we remain intently focused on winning in 2010, growing volume, revenue, share and profit. Looking ahead, we have always said that there is no better consumer goods industry to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry. As more consumers come into the middle class in emerging markets and as consumers around the entire world search for new, innovative ways to engage with their favorite brands, we believe that there is no better system investing more in these markets and providing meaningful innovations than the Coca-Cola Company. After all, the Coca-Cola Company is present in 206 markets, providing over 1.6 billion servings of refreshment each day through a global franchise system that engages with more than 20 million customers each week.
Only the Coca-Cola Company has the world's greatest portfolio of beverage brands, starting with our namesake brand, which keeps growing stronger each and every day. And only the Coca-Cola Company is uniquely positioned to deliver quality results and returns both today and tomorrow. So while global economic pressures may continue in the short term, I can assure you that our company is doing all the right things to drive future, sustainable growth and additional long-term shareholder value. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gary."

These results reaffirm that we have the right leadership team in place with the right strategic plan, capabilities and execution to achieve our long-term goals.
As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $1.06, up 15% versus the prior year.  Our comparable operating income was up a strong 15%, bringing our year-to-date comparable growth to 16%. Currency had a positive impact on operating income of 4% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date.
For the quarter, our comparable gross profit was up 8%, bringing our year-to-date gross profit growth to 9%. Currency had a positive impact on gross profit of 2% in the quarter and four percentage points year-to-date.
Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 7% in the quarter, driven by 5% increase in concentrate sales and a 2% positive currency impact. Our total price mix for the quarter was even, in line with our expectations as our positive revenue growth management strategies offset the expected ongoing impact of geographic mix.
This improvement of our first quarter price-mix results was fully consistent with what we indicated in our last earnings call when we said that we expected our price mix to be even for the full year. As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 18% year-to-date to $4.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance and including the positive effect of currency.
Now let me go through some detail around our quarterly results and year-to-date trends.  Our comparable currency-neutral cost of goods was up 3% for the quarter and is now even year-to-date. As you may recall, on our last quarterly call, we said that we expected our cost of goods to grow in a low single-digit growth range for the full year, and we still believe this expectation is appropriate. Comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were up 1% in the quarter and are now even year-to-date.
Lastly, we captured five points of operating expense leverage in the quarter. As a reminder, when we speak of operating expense leverage, we’re referring to the percentage point difference between our gross profit growth and our operating income growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis. The percentage points captured this quarter were driven by our continued strong focus on cost management and the leveraging of our productivity initiatives. 
We also benefited from the favorable cycling of marketing expenses versus the prior year, and we do expect that this will reverse in the back half of the year. As such, we anticipate our full year 2010 operating expense leverage to be at low single-digits for the full year as we noted in our Q1 call.
As for our total marketing expenses, including both our direct and point-of-sale marketing, these continue to be positive in the quarter as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth.
Now let me build on Muhtar's earlier remarks regarding our pending transaction to acquire Coca-Cola Enterprises’ North American operations. We have now achieved a number of important milestones and are on track with the remaining ones for our anticipated fourth quarter closing.
First, on May 25, Coca-Cola Enterprises filed its Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- the company's first formal step toward seeking shareholder approval of the transaction. An amended Form S-4 was filed on July 8 to respond to the SEC's comments. The S-4 provides details on the transaction and the intended new CCE business. SEC must complete its review of the Form S-4 before the proxy statement that is contained within the S-4 can be sent to CCE's shareholders.
Second, on June 7, the Coca-Cola Company announced its agreement with Dr. Pepper Snapple for continued distribution of their brands after the transaction closes. Third, the transaction must receive antitrust clearance from the FTC as well as the Canadian Competition Bureau for our closing, and we submitted our request for antitrust approval on June 30. 
As for CCE, they are awaiting a response to their request to the IRS for a revenue ruling approving the proposed tax treatment, and in addition, CCE shareholders must vote to approve the transaction. And with regard to these last two items, if you have any questions, I'd refer you to CCE on those. 
But as Muhtar mentioned, we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter exactly in line with the timeline originally provided. We'll provide updates as [Audio Gap]. Finally, let me take a minute to provide our outlook on a few key factors we see in the back half of 2010. Despite the recent volatility in some key currencies, we once again benefited from currency in the second quarter. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter, when we said that we believed currencies would have a slightly positive impact on operating income on a full-year basis with this benefit weighted toward the first half of this year. As such, we would expect currency to have a low single-digit negative impact on operating income starting in the third quarter.
As a quick reminder, we are 100% covered on the euro for 2010 and will continue to execute our hedging strategies over multiple years as appropriate. Also want to remind you that, as highlighted in our previous call, our comparable results for this year reflect the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities, primarily bottling operations, due to new accounting guidance that became effective the first of this year for the FASB requirements. For the full year of 2009, these entities accounted for approximately 3% of our consolidated net revenue and approximately 2% of our consolidated operating income. In addition, we reflected these changes within our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules to provide a comparable income statement for external modeling purposes. At the end of this last quarter, we also posted a schedule in the Investor section of our website that takes into account this change in accounting guidance to assist you in adjusting the prior-year results.
On productivity, we're on track and on plan to deliver the $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of next year, 2011. And lastly, with regard to share repurchase, as we said in our last call we have to stay out of the market until the close of our transaction with Coca-Cola Enterprises. While you will see minimum cash outflow for treasury stock purchases in our results this quarter, note that these review to share withholding related to employee benefit plans.
As for our plans to repurchase common stock, we remain committed to repurchasing at least $1.5 billion of shares by the end of this year.
In conclusion, while this is good to see some parts of the world experiencing a slow but steady recovery, it's clear that many others are continuing to struggle through an extended global recession. Despite this challenging global environment, our results this quarter as well as our continued track record of success this past year is a testament to our seasoned management team, our sound growth strategies and our solid global brand portfolio. We are clearly executing the right actions to drive our business for the long term. We remain confident that we'll keep gaining global share and enhancing the health of our brands in order to drive long-term profitable growth, and importantly, value for our shareholders. Operators, we're now ready for your questions."

First, our volume in China grew 6% and importantly we gained volume and value share in the total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. And it is important to, I think, remember that our 6% growth was off of a volume base that is more than two times the size of our global competitor, therefore widening our lead in terms of total unit cases, actual unit cases sold in China. And during the quarter, again, we have a -- and China is a complex market -- we have a great portfolio in China. We grew our still beverages up by 30%, gaining again volume and value share. And in sparkling beverages, we saw sequential volume improvement through the quarter, and I think also in June, sparkling value share gains as well as in the quarter. So I expect to see continued sequential improvement in China. I think, as I said, China has had some very extraordinary weather in the first quarter as well as some parts, strong markets on the East Coast in the second quarter. We clearly expect China to be strong growth market for the company. I want to remind everyone of 26 quarters of, consecutive quarters of double-digit growth that we've had in China. Strong growth market, I think we all believe that China will be a strong growth market for the company for the next decade as well as beyond, and I can tell you that we will continue to do what is right for the business in China by investing for the long term, and also leading the industry in building strong brands across our entire portfolio, especially in sparkling beverages. And again, I just want to reiterate that we are investing $2 billion. We're in year two of that $2 billion investment. I was in China a couple of months ago at the opening of the Shanghai Expo. I'm going to be back again for the opening of our new plant in Inner Mongolia in China, bringing our total number of plants very close to 40. We have a wonderful template, both in terms of production as well as in terms of go-to-market. And I am confident that China, as I said, will continue to be a significant growth market for the company in the decade to come."

I think we are, our brands are getting stronger in the United States, significant strength in our brands. And therefore, I think we're seeing all of those culminate into results. And it is particularly pleasing that we're entering into our transaction that we intend to close in quarter four from a point of view of strength. That is really critically important that I want to reiterate. We delivered a solid quarter of volume profit and share growth while staying, again, absolutely focused on our long-term strategies. That is the key. And we remain confident that we do have the right strategies for our flagship market, working closer than ever before, and our strategic focus remains consistent on continuing to build healthy brands, healthy customer relationships and healthy system.

While we had extremely strong growth in our still brands, but just to see sparkling come back and be even in the quarter is great. But focus on brand Coke, brand Coca-Cola in North America was positive in growth this year and it's because of the initiatives we've been putting behind that flagship brand that's going to really lead to success, we think, in North America."

That is the belief that our people have at every level that they can generate growth out of this market because of the wonderful demographics, the strength of the brands, the spending power and also the consumption habits. And there will be bumps along the road. And of course, the consumer is still confused in the United States.

Our business in Japan had also unfavorable weather in that part of the world that also hit the East Coast of China. But overall, I think we are executing the right strategies and plans. We saw sequential improvement in our business in the quarter that just passed, but we remain cautious because we expect economic headwinds in Japan to continue in the near term as well as throughout 2010. As far as the vending channel is concerned, yes, there has been, I think we've seen the dip and there has been some improvement because of, again, factories that basically closed down during a period of time in the very depth of the recession are back, albeit not working on all shifts as they used to but certainly the export business is coming back. Trademark Georgia is positive in vending, I mentioned that. I think we see some really good still great green shoots in trademark Coca-Cola. And I mentioned our also, innovation in packaging is helping us in Japan. But I think across all consumer goods industries in Japan, the outlook remains -- we need to remain cautious, but we're absolutely implementing the right strategies to ensure that our business is actually more healthy in Japan.

And that's a really good thing if you think about it in that it means that our emerging markets are growing much faster -- which is what we would want to happen, what you would want to happen -- than the more developed markets, and because of that it's going to give us a negative geographic mix. That is accentuated in the Pacific, where you've got significant emerging markets, and so you've got the Philippines up strong double digits. You've got Thailand up strong double digits. You've got Indonesia up strong double digits. And then at a time when Japan is down three and Australia's actually down two, and you put those together and you've got significant geographic negative mix that is more than offsetting pricing, whereas for the total company we're able to balance that out as what we've always said from a total company, total global portfolio perspective we should be able to balance that out longer term, make it actually positive. But basically it's geographic mix in the Pacific. It, over time, will get smaller. If you remember that if you went back even five years ago, Japan was probably 20% of the total profit and it's now in single digits. And because of that it is getting smaller. Now we're working diligently on Japan because I really would love it to be bigger, obviously, but the geographic mix is the big thing. But one other thing I'd add in Japan is kind of back to one of the previous questions as well. On two of the bottlers in the Canto area we took management control of a year, two years ago, and they actually had a really good quarter and we're actually positive and it's giving, I think, all the bottlers in Japan something now to understand of what's actually possible with -- and so we're using that and best practices to really show what's possible in Japan, and I think longer term we have a positive view on Japan."

Let me begin by saying that I am broadly pleased with our second quarter performance. We once again delivered a quarter of solid growth with consistent profitable results around the world. Working closely with",3492,"Thank you Jackson and good morning everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am broadly pleased with our second quarter performance. We once again delivered a quarter of solid growth with consistent profitable results around the world. Working closely with our great bottling partners, we continue to advance our 2020 vision and road map for winning together.
The global equity of our brands is strong and growing stronger. Our worldwide FIFA World Cup activation was a tremendous success, bringing Coca-Cola to billions of consumers across cities, across towns, villages and living rooms the world over. And consumers clearly continue to prefer our brand with brand Coca-Cola growing 5% for the quarter and 4% year-to-date. Additionally, we saw extensive share gains this quarter across key beverage categories including sparkling, packaged water, ready-to-drink juice and juice drinks as well as sports drinks. As a result, we gained volume and value share in global non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We also gained global volume and value share in both the sparkling and still beverage categories.
At the same time, the global economy remains uncertain due to deficit concerns in Europe, recent downward revisions to China’s economy and continued weakness in consumer confidence in the certain pockets of the world.
This cloudy global economic picture however does not dampen the strong commitments we’ve made to invest in our global operations and our brands for long termed sustainable growth. We’re also encouraged by the real progress we’re making in our plans to integrate CCE’s North American bottling business. This transaction remains on track to be completed in the forth quarter of 2010. 
Now turning to current performance results. This quarter we delivered strong 15% operating income growth on that comparable basis. Again on a comparable, currency neutral basis, our 11% operating income growth was well ahead of our long term growth target despite the lingering effects of the global recession.
We grew our quarterly volume, a strong 5%, cycling 4%, bringing our year-to-date volume to 4% at the higher end of our long term growth target. This was fueled by solid organic unit case volume growth across both North America, as well as key international markets. We increased net revenues 7% on a comparable basis in the quarter with our comparable currency neutral revenues coming in at 5% in line with our long term growth target.
And once again, we have generated significant cash from our operations with cash flow up 18% year-to-date. Now I will take a moment to share our performance in more detail across our markets and I will start by reviewing our business in North America which I’m pleased to say is continuing to gain momentum. 
North America grew 2% this quarter, returning this region to positive growth. In fact, we gained both volume and value share across both sparkling and still beverages. Equally important to this growth is how it is been achieved in this critical market. First, we are focused on building strong value creating brands led by brand Coca-Cola which grew both volume and value share this quarter while increasing our favorite brand score advantage versus our primary competitive among key consumer segment. Second, we are focused on generating profitable growth by delivering a more sophisticated price, package and channel architecture in the United States. 
For example, we forged strong gains in our highly profitable immediate consumption offerings. In previous calls, we have highlighted the success of our smaller single-serve packages and the role, the critical role they play in generating millions of incremental transactions. We are clearly building on this momentum. Additionally, we have seen 4% year-to-date growth of our portion control offerings in the supermarket channel. The growth of these offerings that provide consumers a choice of packages below 12 ounces with 100 or fewer calories is driven by our new 90-calorie mini can. And the recent introduction of our innovative 2 liter contour package has helped Trademark Coca-Cola enter nearly four million new households’ year-to-date.
Importantly, our still beverages in North America were up 7% for the quarter. We have now grown volume share for 10 of the last 12 quarters and value share for 6 of the last 7 quarters.
Across North America we are expanding the footprints of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle Fountain dispenser. This summer, we are adding another 500 machines as part of our pilot test and early results show that our customers are very, very excited about Coca-Cola Freestyle and the greater choice of brands available to distribute in their outlooks. 
For the past two years, we have voiced strong confidence in our strategies in North America and we told you that we would return growth to our flagship market. What we are seeing today is not an [admiration]. We firmly believe that North America will be a growth market of great opportunities for the next ten years and beyond. This market is driven by an extremely positive demographic profile, the envy of a developed world.
We are confident that the actions we are taking today will only strengthen our future in North America and that we are positioned to capture more than our fair share of the great value, this important market has to offer.
Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa which saw broad based growth of 10% in the second quarter and 11% year-to-date. This dynamic growth was led by India, up 22% in the quarter and a strong 24% year-to-date despite cycling over 30% growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. 
India has now delivered 8 consecutive quarters of double digit growth. Additionally, we gained volume and value share this quarter across most key beverage categories in India. We also saw double digit growth for the quarter in Turkey and Southern Eurasia and high single digit growth in the Middle East. In Africa, we just recently announced our systems commitment to more than double our investment in our business to 12 billion through 2020. This past quarter, we saw double digit growth in Eastern and Central Africa and high single digit growth in North and West Africa. 
This growth was led by the strong performance of both our sparkling as well as still portfolio and the immediate benefits of course of our FIFA World Cup activation programs across the entire continent of Africa. Russia importantly also improved on this first quarter momentum, delivering 6% growth in the quarter, bringing volume growth up to 3% on a year-to-date basis. This improvement has been driven by the sustained strong performance of our sparkling brands and in particular brand Coca-Cola which once again gained share while growing a strong 19% in the second quarter.
Moving now to Latin America, where we continued our steady and consistent performance. For the quarter, we were up a solid 7%, supported by a strong FIFA World Cup activation program. We outperformed the industry, gaining non alcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share across multiple key markets including Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. These great results were driven by a strong 13% growth in Brazil and as expected, Mexico rebounded well from the unseasonable cold weather in quarter one, growing 5% in the second quarter, cycling 6% from the same period prior year.
Our Pacific Group continued to expand, growing 6% in both quarter two and year-to-date led by double digit growth across Thailand, the Philippines and several other markets in this region. Our volume performance in Japan was the same as in quarter one, down 3% for the quarter, cycling positive 2% growth from last year. This result was a little better than expected as Japan continues to suffer from economic headwinds as well as unfavorable weather conditions. 
Despite these challenges, our brand portfolio continues to gain traction with our consumers. For example, Coca-Cola trademark in Japan grew 2% in quarter two, while our Georgia Coffee brand showed positive growth in its core and most profitable vending channel. Our [ILO house] single-serve water continues to grow double-digit even as the cycling last year’s May launch. In fact, since the quarter one of 2008, immediate consumption water volume as a percent of total water volume in Japan has improved by over 20 percentage points.
This is a great example of how we are executing a strategy of focusing on profitable system volume. And we just launched Sokenbicha tea in an innovative double eco bottle which is both a plant bottle as well as ultra light weight.
Overall, we are encouraged by the improving trends observed in Japan during this past quarter and believe we are executing the right strategies. Yet, we remain cautious as we expect the economic headwinds in Japan to continue in the near-term.
China also maintains its quarter one performance growing 6% in quarter two, cycling 14% from prior year. We outperformed the industry this past quarter, growing both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages.
Further, we are more than twice the size of our primary international competitor in China and we once again widened our lead in terms of total unit cases sold. We saw sequential improvement over the course of the quarter with our strongest overall growth in June including positive sparkling growth. We also captured value share in our sparkling beverages in the quarter. And we continue to grow our still portfolio this quarter with our innovative Minute Maid Pulpy brand, up double digits and our overall still beverage is up a strong 30%. 
Clearly, with the consumer fundamentals and our very strong position in China, we’re just getting started in this region. We are working hard to build our business across all categories and especially our sparkling beverages. Our system has committed to investing $2 billion in China through 2011 and we remain dedicated to growing in China for the long term.
A good prove point of our commitment to grow in this exciting region is our participation as the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai. Our interactive pavilion has been rated as one of the Expo’s most popular attractions and our presence in the Expo has already generated close to $17 million in ad value in the first month since its opening. We encourage all of you to visit our pavilion if you’re in Shanghai in the coming months and experience first hand, how we are building brand equity in China for the long term.
Now moving to Europe, we’ve seen that consumers and customers are still pressured by the difficult economic conditions that have impacted this region. For both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, our volume rounded down to minus 1% with solid growth in France, as well as growth in Germany and Iberia, offset by ongoing challenges in Southern and Eastern Europe. 
Our beverage business in Europe is almost four times the size of our primary international competitors, and this quarter we gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages across the continent of Europe. And Germany is sustaining momentum capturing volume and value share while delivering its fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Year-to-date, total volume in Germany is up 3%, and importantly, brand Coca-Cola volume is up 4%. We are encouraged by how we continue to build brand preference for our consumers and drive value for our customers. 
Going forward, as we look at our total business in Europe, we remain cautiously optimistic despite difficult economic conditions. These global results, despite difficult operating conditions in some regions are a testament to our seasoned operating team and our global franchise partners for executing our 2020 vision in a disciplined, aligned and decisive manner. We are working as an effective and integrated business system in order to best serve each market’s unique customer and consumer needs and we are gaining market share despite a challenging global marketplace. 
We recently concluded a brand equity analysis for Coca-Cola across our top 22 markets from 2007 to 2009 looking at multiple brand health metrics such as favorite brand and the number of weekly and monthly consumers. The results of this analysis show that when looking across all our top 22 markets as a whole, these key metrics improve between one and two points during this two-year time period. To see our brand equity scores trend, brand equity scores trend upwards during a time of macroeconomic pressures, demonstrates clearly our success in connecting closely with our consumers to build brand equity across the markets which we proudly serve.
Looking ahead, we remained intently focused on what critically matters to our business, communicating with our consumers and investing in our brands.
Let me briefly update you on some of the ways we’re doing this. First, communicating with our consumers. Having just returned personally from South Africa, I can confirm that our 2010 FIFA World Cup program has been very, very effective. It is our best example of how we can collaborate as a global team with our bottling partners to create powerful and integrated programming to build our brands. We have leveraged one campaign throughout 116 markets and drove our most unified marketing communications effort yet. All by capitalizing on our global scale while communicating locally relevant, as well as compelling stories that meaningfully connect with consumers all over the world.
Our Powerade’s FIFA World Cup program was rated near the top of all World Cup campaign as tested, surpassing norms on all key measures. Importantly, consumers are responding to our World Cup messaging. Our FIFA inspired World Cup anthem Waving Flag has been a real hit, reaching the number one position on the music charts in 17 countries, moving more than 800,000 download purchases and amassing more than 87 million video views on YouTube.
A survey conducted in the UK by Lightspeed, found that when asked to name their favorite FIFA World Cup ad of the year, consumers rated Coca-Cola, Number One. And when we purchased a FIFA World Cup related tweet on Twitter, the results were absolutely phenomenal. In the first day, after the tweet went online, our ads received over 85 million impressions and a 6% engagement rate, compared to the 0.02% rate usually seen with other web based advertising. That translates into over 5.1 million people interacting with our FIFA World Cup ad in just a 24 hour span.
Our innovative use of online marketing and social media is not just limited to the FIFA World Cup campaign however. Our “Happiness Machine” video showing hidden camera footage of smiling students interacting with a generous Coke vending machine has been viewed nearly 2.5 million times again on YouTube. This video was awarded CLIO’s Prestigious Gold Interactive Award at the 51st annual dinner held in New York City this past May. This once again reminds us that there is nothing as good as authentic Coca-Cola stories of happiness, inclusion and optimism.
Secondly, we are relentlessly focused on investing in our brands. Let me start by saying that now more than ever, we truly have momentum behind our brands. Not only is our brand equity strong and getting stronger, but we are also seeing this equity translate into solid results across both our sparkling and still brand offerings. 
Sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter with international sparkling beverages case volume up 4%. Importantly for countries with per capita consumption under 150, our sparkling beverages grew 7% in the second quarter, underscoring our strength in these important gross markets.
As for Coke Zero, it continues to be one of the fastest growing sparkling beverages in the world. In North America, Coke Zero delivered double-digit brand volume growth for the 17th consecutive quarter and across our top 22 markets, Coke Zero’s share of the sparkling category is more than four times greater than the share of its primary competitor. We will keep placing the growth of our sparkling portfolio front and center in all of our 2010 plans.
We are expanding our still beverages as well, with total still beverage unit case volume increasing 10% in the quarter, led by continued growth in juice and juice drinks, teas and water brands. In North America, Powerade is building on its 2009 momentum, growing high teens this past quarter, while once again gaining share. Consumers are clearly responding to the category leading innovations we have pioneered this past year, including the functional advantages provided in the Powerade’s Ion4 formulation as well as the Zero calorie benefits of Powerade Zero. In fact, Powerade Zero continues to accelerate up 60% this past quarter alone and representing 15% of our year-to-date Powerade trademark volume in this important market.
As for vitaminwater, we have a leading consumer engagement model that is building, continuing to build brand health. A great example of this is our flavor creator app on Facebook which encourage our consumers to design the newest vitaminwater flavor connect. These types of innovations have helped make vitaminwater one of the most popular beverages on Facebook with more fans than any of our primary competitor’s flagship brands.
I should mention that our recent launch of vitaminwater zero is yielding positive results. In fact, our entire set of premium Glaxo brands were up a combined 4% this past quarter in the United States. 
Across the globe, the expansion and increased availability of vitaminwater is driving solid results in multiple markets. Year-to-date, international vitaminwater volume has reached 7 million unit cases or the equivalent of the brand size in the United States for the same period back in 2004. Though we anticipate continued global momentum for vitaminwater fuelled by a 360 degree integrated marketing plan which is now being executed in 15 international markets. In addition to vitaminwater, we are expanding across other key still categories. 
In the juice category, we saw continuous solid results across the globe. For example, in North America, we once again gained volume and value share in the juice and juice drinks category with our chilled juice business growing 10% in the quarter and are simply trademarked delivering another quarter of double-digits growth. And finally, in the water category, our branded water business in the United States returned to growth with Dasani up 3% for the quarter. Also, this quarter, we launched Dasani in both Singapore as well as Malaysia.
As we continue to grow and expand, we are fully committed to doing so in a sustainable manner living positively and responsibly in partnership with our consumers, with our customers and with our communities. This is why we were pleased to see the Coca-Cola Company receive high honors at the 22nd Annual DuPont Awards for packaging innovation. This prestigious DuPont award is the packaging industry’s longest running independently judged global awards program, leading international industry and sustainability experts, judge entrance on their excellent and innovation sustainability and cost waste reduction. Our PlantBottle packaging earned one of five gold awards out of more than 160 global entrants for its breakthrough packaging innovation.
Now, let me update you on the significant progress we have made in planning with a proposed integration of CCE’s North America operations and Coca-Cola North America. Our integration, seasoned integration team is working hard to identify opportunities to operate more efficiently and to serve our customers more effectively. Our team also building plans to ensure smooth operations from day one. Further, we have begun the important work of creating a business model, an organizational structure that will support a new era of success in North America. We will provide further details on this model once the transaction closes. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter, in line with the time-line originally provided and we will provide updates as additional information becomes available.
Let me close by saying that despite ongoing global economic headwinds, we are confident in our system’s ability to win together to achieve our 2020 vision. And we remain intently focused on winning in 2010, growing volume, revenue, share and profits. Looking ahead, we have always said that there is no better consumer goods industry to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry. 
As more consumers come into the middle class and emerging markets, and as consumers around the entire world search for new innovative ways to engage with their favorite brand, we believe that there is no better system investing more in these markets and providing meaningful innovations than the Coca-Cola Company. After all, the Coca-Cola Company is present in 206 markets, providing over 1.6 billion servings of refreshments each day through a global franchise system that engages with more than 20 million customers each week.
Only the Coca-Cola Company has the world’s greatest portfolio of beverage brands starting with our namesake brand, which keeps growing stronger each and everyday. And only the Coca-Cola Company is uniquely positioned to deliver quality results and returns both today and tomorrow. So while global economic pressures may continue in the short term, I can assure you that our company is doing all the right things to drive future sustainable growth and additional long-term shareowner value.

26642,108728799,68185,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you Muhtar and good morning everyone. As Muhtar said, we delivered another quarter of consistent, sustainable and quality growth, gaining volume and value share both globally and across our key markets, with volume and profit results coming in ahead",1289,"Thank you Muhtar and good morning everyone. As Muhtar said, we delivered another quarter of consistent, sustainable and quality growth, gaining volume and value share both globally and across our key markets, with volume and profit results coming in ahead of our long term growth targets. These results reaffirm that we have the right leadership team in place with the right strategic plan, capabilities and executions to achieve our long term goals.
As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $1.6, up 15% versus the prior year. Our comparable operating income was up a strong 15%, bringing our year-to-date comparable growth to 16%. Currency had a positive impact on operating income of 4% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date.
For the quarter, our comparable gross profit was up 8%, bringing our year-to-date gross profit growth to 9%. Currency had a positive impact on gross profit of 2% in quarter and 4 percentage points year-to-date. 
Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 7% in the quarter, driven by 5% increase in concentrate sales and a 2% positive currency impact. Our total price mix for the quarter was even, in line with our expectations as our positive revenue growth management strategies, all except the expected ongoing impact of geographic mix. This improvement of our first quarter price mix results was fully consistent with what we indicated in our last earnings call when we said that we expected our price mix to be even for the full year. As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 18% year-to-date to $4.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance and including the positive effect of currency.
Now let me go through some detail around our quarterly results and year-to-date trends. Our comparable currency neutral costs of goods was up 3% for the quarter and is now even year-to-date. As you may now recall on our last quarterly call, we said that we expected our cost of goods to grow in a low single-digit growth range for the full year and we still believe this expectation is appropriate. Comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 1% in the quarter and are net even year-to-date.
Lastly, we captured five points of operating expense leverage in the quarter. As a reminder, when we speak of operating expense leverage, we are referring to the point difference, percentage point difference between our gross profit growth and our operating income growth on a comparable currency neutral basis. The percentage points captured this quarter were driven by our continued strong focus on cost management and the leveraging of our productivity initiatives.
We also benefited from the favorable cycling of marketing expenses versus the prior year and we do expect that this will reverse in the back half of the year. As such, we anticipate our full year 2010 operating expense leverage to be at low single digits for the full year as we noted in our Q1 call. As for our total marketing expenses including both our direct and point of sale marketing, these continue to be positive in the quarter as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long term growth.
Now let me build on Muhtar’s earlier remarks regarding our pending transaction to acquire Coca-Cola Enterprise’s North American operation. We have now achieved a number of important milestones and are on track with the remaining ones for our anticipated fourth quarter closing.
First, On May 25th, Coca-Cola Enterprises filed its Form S4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company’s first formal step towards seeking shareholder approval of the transaction. And amended Form-S4 was filed on July 8th to respond to the SEC’s comments. The S4 provides details on the transaction and the [intended] new CCE business. The SEC must complete its review of the form S4 before the proxy statement that is contained within the S4 can be sent to CCE shareholders.
Second on June 7th, the Coca-Cola Company announced disagreement with Dr Pepper Snapple for continued distribution of their brands after the transaction closes. Third, the transaction must receive antitrust clearance from the FTC as well as the Canadian Competition Bureau prior to closing and we submitted our request for antitrust approval on June 30th.
As for CCE, they are awaiting a response to their request to the RAF for a revenue ruling approving to propose tax treatment and in addition, CCE shareholders must vote to approve the transaction. And with regard to these last two items, if you have any questions, I’d refer you to CCE on those. But as Muhtar mentioned, we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter exactly in line with the timeline originally provided. We’ll provide update on that.
Finally, let me take a minute to provide how our outlook on a few key factors we see in the back half of 2010. Despite the recent volatility and some key currencies, we once again benefited from currency in the second quarter. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter when we said that we believe the currencies would have a slightly positive impact on operating income on a full year basis with this benefit weighted towards the first half of this year. As such, we would expect currency to have a low single digit negative impact on operating income starting in the third quarter.
As a quick reminder, we are 100% covered on the Euro 2010 and will continue to execute our hedging strategies over multiple years as appropriate. Also, want to remind you that as highlighted in our previous calls, our comparable results for this year reflect the impact of the deconsolidation, certain entities, primarily bottling operations due to new accounting guidance that became effective, the first of this year for the FASB requirements. For the full year 2009, these entities accounted for approximately 3% of our consolidated net revenue and approximately 2% of our consolidated operating income. In addition, we reflected these changes within our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules for about a comparable income statement for external modeling purposes. 
At the end of the last quarter, we also posted a schedule in the investor section of our website that takes into account this change and accounting guidance to assist you in adjusting the prior year results.
On productivity, we are on track and on plan to deliver the $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of next year 2011. And lastly, with regard to share repurchase as we said in our last call, we have to stay out of the market until the close of our transaction with Coca-Cola Enterprises while you will see minimal cash outflow for treasury stock purchases in our results this quarter. Note that these review the share withholding related to employee benefit plans. As for our plans to repurchased common stock, we remain committed to repurchasing at least $1.5 billion of shares by the end of this year. 
In conclusion, while this is good to see some parts of the world experiencing a slow but steady recovery, it’s clear that many others are continuing to struggle through an extended global recession. Despite this challenging global environment, our results this quarter as well as our continued track record of success this past year is a testament to our seasoned management team, our sound growth strategies and our solid global brand portfolio, we are clearly executing the right actions to drive our business for the long term. 
We remain confident that we’ll keep gaining global share and enhancing the health of our brands in order to drive long term profitable growth and importantly value for our shareholders.
Operator, we are now ready for your questions.

And during the quarter again, and China is a complex market. We have a great portfolio in China. We grew our still beverages up by 30% gaining again volume and value share. And in sparkling beverages, we saw a sequential volume improvement through the quarter and I think also in June, sparkling value share gains as well as in the quarter. 
So I expect to see continued sequential improvement in China. I think as I said China has had some very extraordinary weather in the first quarter, as well as some part in the strong markets on the East Coast in the second quarter. We clearly expect China to be a strong growth market for the company. I want to remind everyone of 26 quarters of, consecutive quarters of double digit growth that we’ve had in China, a strong growth market, I think we all believe that China will be a strong growth market for the company for the next decade as well as beyond. And I can tell you that we will continue to do what is right for the business in China by investing for the long term and also leading the industry in building strong brands across our entire portfolio, especially in sparkling beverages. 
And again, I just want to reiterate that we are investing $2 billion. We’re in year two of that $2 billion investment. I was in China a couple of months ago at the opening of the Shanghai Expo. I’m going to be back again for the opening of our new plant in Inner Mongolia or in China, bring our total number of plants very close to 40. We have a wonderful template above in terms of production as well as in terms of go-to-market, and I am confident that China as I said will continue to be a significant growth market for the company in the decades to come.

I think, our brands are getting stronger in the United States, a significant strength in our brands are up, and therefore, I think we’re seeing all of those culminate into results. 
And it is particularly pleasing this that we are entering into our transaction that we intend to close in quarter four from a point of view of strength. That is really critically important that I want to reiterate. We delivered a solid quarter of volume, profit and share growth while staying again absolutely focused on our long term strategies. That is the key and we remain confident that we do have the right strategies for our flagship market, working closer than ever before, and our strategic focus remains consistent on continuing to build healthy brands, healthy customer relationships and healthy systems. And I think that we have all those and although they are getting stronger and therefore as I said, we’re confident that the actions we’re taking, have been taking in the last two years and taking today will only strengthen our future in North America, and that we are best positioned to capture the greatest value here in this market.

That is the belief that our people have at every level that they can generate growth out of this market because of the wonderful demographics that the strength of the brands, the spending power and also the consumption habits. And that there will be bumps along the road and of course, the consumer is still confused in the United States.

As far as the vending channel is concerned, yes, there has been, I think, we have seen the dip and there has been some improvement because its again, factories that basically close down during a period of time in the very depth of the recession are back albeit not working as on all shift that they used to but certainly, the export business coming back trademark Georgia is positive in vending, I mentioned that.

And that’s a really good thing if you think about it and that it means that our emerging markets are growing much faster which is what we would want to happen, what you would want to happen than the more developed markets, and because of that, they just want to give us a negative geographic mix. That is accentuated in the Pacific where you’ve got significant emerging markets. And so you have got the Philippines up, strong double-digit, you’ve got Thailand up strong double-digit, you’ve got Indonesia up strong double-digits. And then at a time when Japan is down three and Australia is actually down two, and you put those together and you’ve got significant geographic negative mix that is more than offsetting pricing whereas for total company, we’re able to balance that out as what we always said from a total company, total global portfolio perspective. We should be able to balance that out longer term, make it actually positive. 
But basically, as geographic mix in the Pacific, it over time will get smaller. If you remember that if you went back even five years ago, Japan was probably 20% of the total profit, it’s now in single digits. And because of that, it is getting smaller. Now, we were working diligently on Japan so and I really would love it to be bigger obviously. But the geographic mix is the big thing. But one other thing I had in Japan is kind of back to one of the previous questions as well. On two of the bottlers in the Canto area, we took management control a year to two years ago and they actually had a really good quarter and we are actually positive and it’s just giving I think all the bottlers in Japan something now to understand what’s actually possible with. 
And so we’re using that in best practices to really show what’s possible in Japan and I think a longer time we have positive view on Japan.

Is it safe to say, is it just simply a re-acceleration of China or is it something where you are going to say look, for the foreseeable future, expect sort of minimal organic top line growth and minimal profit growth from Pacific. It’s a longer term engine of growth, but shorter term, not so much.

Working closely wi",3453,"Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I am broadly pleased with our second quarter performance. We once again delivered a quarter of solid growth with consistent profitable results around the world. Working closely with our great bottling partners, we continue to advance our 2020 Vision and roadmap for winning together. The global equity of our brands is strong and growing stronger. Our Worldwide FIFA World Cup activation was a tremendous success, bringing Coca-Cola to billions of consumers across cities, across towns, villages and living rooms the world over. And consumers clearly continue to prefer our brand with brand Coca-Cola growing 5% for the quarter and 4% year-to-date. Additionally, we saw extensive share gains this quarter across key beverage categories including sparkling, packaged water, ready-to-drink juice and juice drinks as well as sports drinks. As a result, we gained volume and value share in global nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We also gained global volume and value share in both the sparkling and still beverage categories.
At the same time, the global economy remains uncertain due to deficit concerns in Europe, recent downward revisions to China's economy and continued weakness in consumer confidence in certain pockets of the world. This cloudy global economic picture, however, does not dampen the strong commitment we've made to invest in our global operations and our brands for long-term sustainable growth.
We're also encouraged by the real progress we are making in our plans to integrate CCE's North American Bottling business. This transaction remains on track to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Now turning to current performance results. This quarter, we delivered strong 15% operating income growth on a comparable basis. Again, on a comparable currency-neutral basis, our 11% operating income growth was well ahead of our long-term growth target despite the lingering effects of the global recession. We grew our quarterly volume a strong 5%, cycling 4%, bringing our year-to-date volume to 4% at the higher end of our long-term growth target. This was fueled by solid organic unit case volume growth across both North America as well as key international markets. 
We increased net revenue 7% on a comparable basis in the quarter with our comparable currency-neutral revenues coming in at 5%, in line with our long-term growth target. And once again, we generated significant cash from our operations with cash flow up 18% year-to-date.
Now I will take a moment to share our performance in more detail across our markets, and I will start by reviewing our business in North America, which I am pleased to say is continuing to gain momentum. 
North America grew 2% this quarter, returning this region to positive growth. In fact, we gained both volume and value share across both sparkling and still beverages. Equally important to this growth is how it is being achieved in this critical market. First, we are focused on building strong value-creating brands led by brand Coca-Cola, which grew both volume and value share this quarter, while increasing our favorite brand score advantage versus our primary competitor among key consumer segments.
Second, we are focused on generating profitable growth by delivering a more sophisticated price package and channel architecture in the United States. For example, we forged strong gains in our highly profitable immediate consumption offerings. In previous calls, we have highlighted the success of our smaller single-serve packages and the critical role they play in generating millions of incremental transactions. We are clearly building on this momentum. 
Additionally, we have seen 4% year-to-date growth of our portion control offerings in the supermarket channel. The growth of these offerings that provide consumers a choice of packages below 12 ounces with 100 or fewer calories is driven by our new 90-calorie mini can. And the recent introduction of our innovative 2-liter contour package has helped trademark Coca-Cola enter nearly 4 million new households year-to-date.
Importantly, our still beverages in North America were up 7% for the quarter. We have now grown volume share for 10 of the last 12 quarters and value share for six of the last seven quarters. Across North America, we're expanding the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser. This summer, we're adding another 500 machines as part of our pilot tests, and early results show that our customers are very, very excited about Coca-Cola Freestyle and the greater choice of brands available to distribute in their outlets.
For the past two years, we have voiced strong confidence in our strategies in North America, and we told you that we return growth to our flagship market. What we are seeing today is not an aberration. We firmly believe that North America will be a growth market of great opportunity for the next 10 years and beyond. This market is driven by an extremely positive demographic profile -- the envy of the developed world. We are confident that the actions we're taking today will only strengthen our future in North America and that we are positioned to capture more than our fair share of the great value this important market has to offer. 
Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa, which saw broad-based growth of 10% in the second quarter and 11% year-to-date. This dynamic growth was led by India, up 22% in the quarter and a strong 24% year-to-date, despite cycling over 30% growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. India has now delivered eight consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Additionally, we gained volume and value share this quarter across most key beverage categories in India. We also saw double-digit growth for the quarter in Turkey and Southern Eurasia and high single-digit growth in the Middle East.
In Africa, we just recently announced our system's commitment to more than double our investment in our business to $12 billion through 2020. This past quarter, we saw double-digit growth in East and Central Africa and high single-digit growth in North and West Africa. This growth was led by the strong performance of both our sparkling as well as still portfolio and the immediate benefits, of course, of our FIFA World Cup activation programs across the entire continent of Africa.
Russia, importantly, also improved on its first quarter momentum, delivering 6% growth in the quarter, bringing volume growth up to 3% on a year-to-date basis. This improvement has been driven by the sustained strong performance of our sparkling brands and, in particular, brand Coca-Cola, which once again gained share, while growing a strong 19% in the second quarter.
Moving now to Latin America, where we continued our steady and consistent performance. For the quarter, we were up a solid 7%, supported by a strong FIFA World Cup activation program. We outperformed the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share across multiple key markets including Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. These great results were driven by a strong 13% growth in Brazil. And as expected, Mexico rebounded well from the unseasonable cold weather in quarter one, growing 5% in the second quarter cycling 6% from the same period prior year.
Our Pacific Group continued to expand, growing 6% in both quarter two and year-to-date, led by double-digit growth across Thailand, the Philippines and several other markets in this region. Our volume performance in Japan was the same as in quarter one, down 3% for the quarter, cycling positive 2% growth from last year. This result was a little better than expected as Japan continues to suffer from economic headwinds as well as unfavorable weather conditions. 
Despite these challenges, our brand portfolio continues to gain traction with our consumers. For example, Coca-Cola trademark in Japan grew 2% in quarter two, while our Georgia coffee brands showed positive growth in its core and most profitable vending channel.
Our I LOHAS single-serve water continues to grow double digits even after cycling last year's May launch. In fact, since the quarter one of 2008, immediate consumption of water volume as a percent of total water volume in Japan has improved by over 20 percentage points. This is a great example of how we are executing a strategy of focusing on profitable system volume. And we just launched Sokenbicha tea in an innovative double eco bottle, which is both a pint bottle as well as ultra-lightweight. Overall, we are encouraged by the improving trends observed in Japan during this past quarter and believe we are executing the right strategies, yet we remain cautious as we expect the economic headwinds in Japan to continue in the near term.
China also maintains its quarter one performance, growing 6% in quarter two, cycling 14% from prior year. We outperformed the industry this past quarter, growing both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Further, we are more than twice the size of our primary international competitor in China, and we once again widened our lead in terms of total unit cases sold. We saw sequential improvement over the course of the quarter with our strongest overall growth in June, including positive sparkling growth. 
We also captured value share in our sparkling beverages in the quarter. And we continued to grow our still portfolio this quarter with our innovative Minute Maid Pulpy brand up double digits and our overall still beverages up a strong 30%.
Clearly, with a consumer fundamental and our very strong position in China, we're just getting started in this region. We are working hard to build our business across all categories, and especially our sparkling beverages. Our system has committed to investing $2 billion in China through 2011, and we remain dedicated to growing in China for the long term.
A good proof point of our commitment to grow in this exciting region is our participation at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai. Our interactive pavilion has been rated as one of Expo's most popular attractions. And our presence in the Expo has already generated close to $17 million in ad value in the first month since its opening. We encourage all of you to visit our pavilion if you are in Shanghai in the coming months and experience firsthand how we are building brand equity in China for the long term.
Now moving to Europe. We've seen that consumers and customers are still pressured by the difficult economic conditions that have impacted this region. For both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, our volume rounded down to minus 1% with solid growth in France as well as growth in Germany and Iberia, offset by ongoing challenges in Southern and Eastern Europe. 
Our Beverage business in Europe is almost 4x the size of our primary international competitor, and this quarter we gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages across the continent of Europe. In Germany, it's sustaining momentum capture in volume and value share, while delivering its fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth.
Year-to-date, total volume in Germany is up 3%. The importantly brand Coca-Cola volume is up 4%. We are encouraged by how we continue to build brand preference for our consumers and drive value for our customers. Going forward, as we look at our total business in Europe, we remain cautiously optimistic despite difficult economic conditions.
These global results, despite difficult operating conditions in some regions, are a testament to our seasoned operating team and our global franchise partners who are executing our 2020 Vision in a disciplined, aligned and decisive manner. We are working as an effective and integrated business system in order to best serve each market's unique customer and consumer needs, and we are gaining market share despite a challenging global marketplace.
We recently concluded a brand equity analysis for Coca-Cola across our top 22 markets from 2007 to 2009, looking at multiple brand health metrics such as favorite brand and the number of weekly and monthly consumers. The results of this analysis show that when looking across all our top 22 markets as a whole, these key metrics improved between one and two points during this two-year time period. To see our brand equity scores trend upwards during a time of macroeconomic pressure demonstrates, clearly, our success in connecting closely with our consumers to build brand equity across the markets, which we proudly serve.
Looking ahead, we remain intensely focused on what critically matters to our business: communicating with our consumers and investing in our brands. Let me briefly update you on some of the ways we are doing this.
First, communicating with our consumers. Having just returned personally from South Africa, I can confirm that our 2010 FIFA World Cup program has been very, very effective. It is our best example of how we can collaborate as a global team with our bottling partners to create powerful and integrated programming to build our brands. We have leveraged one campaign throughout 160 markets and drove our most unified marketing communications effort yet, all by capitalizing on our global scale, while communicating locally relevant as well as compelling stories that meaningfully connect with consumers all over the world.
Our POWERade FIFA World Cup program was rated near the top of all World Cup campaign ads tested, surpassing norms on all key measures. Importantly, consumers are responding to our World Cup messaging. Our FIFA-inspired World Cup anthem, “Waving Flag,” has been a real hit, reaching the #1 position on music charts in 17 countries, moving more than 800,000 download purchases and amassing more than 87 million video views on YouTube. A survey conducted in the U.K. by Lightspeed found that when asked to name their favorite FIFA World Cup ad of the year, consumers rated Coca-Cola #1. And when we purchased a FIFA World Cup-related Tweet on Twitter, the results were absolutely phenomenal. On the first day after the Tweet went online, our ad received over 85 million impressions and a 6% engagement rate compared to the 0.02% rate usually seen with other web-based advertising. That translates into over 5.1 million people interacting with our FIFA World Cup ad in just a 24-hour span.
Our innovative use of online marketing and social media is not just limited to the FIFA World Cup campaign, however. Our “Happiness Machine” video showing hidden camera footage of smiling students interacting with a generous Coke vending machine has been viewed nearly 2.5 million times, again, on YouTube. This video was awarded CLIO's prestigious Gold Interactive Award at the 51st annual dinner held in New York City this past May. This once again reminds us that there's nothing as good as authentic Coca-Cola stories of happiness, inclusion and optimism. 
Secondly, we are relentlessly focused on investing in our brands. Let me start by saying that now more than ever, we truly have momentum behind our brands. Not only is our brand equity strong and getting stronger but we are also seeing this equity translate into solid results across both our sparkling and still brand offerings. 
Sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter with international sparkling beverage unit case volume up 4%. Importantly, for countries with per capita consumption under 150, our sparkling beverages grew 7% in the second quarter, underscoring our strength in these important growth markets.
As for Coke Zero, it continues to be one of the fastest-growing sparkling beverages in the world. In North America, Coke Zero delivered double-digit brand volume growth for the 17th consecutive quarter. And across our top 22 markets, Coke Zero's share of the sparkling category is more than 4x greater than the share of its primary competitor. We will keep placing the growth of our sparkling portfolio front and center in all of our 2010 plans.
We are expanding our still beverages as well with total still beverage unit case volume increasing 10% in the quarter led by continued growth in juice and juice drinks, teas and water brands. In North America, POWERade is building on its 2009 momentum, growing high teens this past quarter, while once again, gaining share. Consumers are clearly responding to the category-leading innovations we have pioneered this past year, including the functional advantages provided in POWERade's ION4 formulation as well as the zero-calorie benefits of POWERade Zero. In fact, POWERade Zero continues to accelerate, up 60% this past quarter alone and representing 15% of our year-to-date POWERade trademark volume in this important market.
As for vitaminwater, we have a leading consumer engagement model that is continuing to build brand health. A great example of this is our Flavor Creator app on Facebook, which encouraged our consumers to design the newest vitaminwater flavor Connect. These types of innovations have helped make vitaminwater one of the most popular beverages on Facebook with more fans than any of our primary competitors’ flagship brands. I should mention that our recent launch of vitaminwater zero is yielding positive results. In fact, our entire set of premium glacéau brands were up a combined 4% this past quarter in the United States. 
Across the globe, the expansion and increased availability of vitaminwater is driving solid results in multiple markets. Year-to-date, international vitaminwater volume has reached 7 million unit cases over the equivalent of the brand size in the United States for the same period back in 2004. So we anticipate continued global momentum for vitaminwater fueled by a 360-degree integrated marketing plan, which is now being executed in 15 international markets.
In addition to vitaminwater, we are expanding across other key still categories. In the juice category, we saw continued solid results across the globe. For example, in North America, we once again gained volume and value share in the juice and juice drinks category with our Chilled Juice business growing 10% in the quarter and our Simply trademark delivering another quarter of double-digit growth. And finally, in the water category, our Branded Water business in the United States returned to growth with DASANI up 3% for the quarter. Also this quarter, we launched DASANI in both Singapore as well as Malaysia.
As we continue to grow and expand, we are fully committed to doing so in a sustainable manner, living positively and responsibly in partnership with our consumers, with our customers and with our communities. This is why we were pleased to see the Coca-Cola Company receive high honors at the 22nd Annual DuPont Awards for Packaging Innovation. This prestigious DuPont Award is the packaging industry's longest-running, independently judged global awards program. Leading international industry and sustainability experts judge entrants on their excellence and innovation, sustainability and cost waste reduction. Our PlantBottle packaging earned one of five gold awards out of more than 160 global entrants for its breakthrough packaging innovation.
Now let me update you on the significant progress we have made in planning for the proposed integration of CCE's North America operations and Coca-Cola North America. Our seasoned integration team is working hard to identify opportunities to operate more efficiently and to serve our customers more effectively. 
Our team is also building plans to ensure smooth operations from day one. Further, we have begun the important work of creating a business model and organizational structure that will support a new era of success in North America. We will provide further details of this model once the transaction closes. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter, in line with the time line originally provided, and we will provide updates as additional information becomes available.
Let me close by saying that despite ongoing global economic headwinds, we are confident in our system's ability to win together to achieve our 2020 Vision. And we remain intently focused on winning in 2010, growing volume, revenue, share and profit. Looking ahead, we have always said that there is no better consumer goods industry to be in than the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry. As more consumers come into the middle class in emerging markets and as consumers around the entire world search for new, innovative ways to engage with their favorite brands, we believe that there is no better system investing more in these markets and providing meaningful innovations than the Coca-Cola Company. After all, the Coca-Cola Company is present in 206 markets, providing over 1.6 billion servings of refreshment each day through a global franchise system that engages with more than 20 million customers each week.
Only the Coca-Cola Company has the world's greatest portfolio of beverage brands, starting with our namesake brand, which keeps growing stronger each and every day. And only the Coca-Cola Company is uniquely positioned to deliver quality results and returns both today and tomorrow. So while global economic pressures may continue in the short term, I can assure you that our company is doing all the right things to drive future, sustainable growth and additional long-term shareholder value. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gary."
26642,108728799,69987,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, we delivered another quarter of consistent, sustainable and quality growth, gaining volume and value share both globally and across our key markets with volume and profit results coming in ahead",1272,"Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, we delivered another quarter of consistent, sustainable and quality growth, gaining volume and value share both globally and across our key markets with volume and profit results coming in ahead of our long-term growth targets. These results reaffirm that we have the right leadership team in place with the right strategic plan, capabilities and execution to achieve our long-term goals.
As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $1.06, up 15% versus the prior year.  Our comparable operating income was up a strong 15%, bringing our year-to-date comparable growth to 16%. Currency had a positive impact on operating income of 4% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date.
For the quarter, our comparable gross profit was up 8%, bringing our year-to-date gross profit growth to 9%. Currency had a positive impact on gross profit of 2% in the quarter and four percentage points year-to-date.
Further, our business delivered comparable net revenue growth of 7% in the quarter, driven by 5% increase in concentrate sales and a 2% positive currency impact. Our total price mix for the quarter was even, in line with our expectations as our positive revenue growth management strategies offset the expected ongoing impact of geographic mix.
This improvement of our first quarter price-mix results was fully consistent with what we indicated in our last earnings call when we said that we expected our price mix to be even for the full year. As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 18% year-to-date to $4.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance and including the positive effect of currency.
Now let me go through some detail around our quarterly results and year-to-date trends.  Our comparable currency-neutral cost of goods was up 3% for the quarter and is now even year-to-date. As you may recall, on our last quarterly call, we said that we expected our cost of goods to grow in a low single-digit growth range for the full year, and we still believe this expectation is appropriate. Comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were up 1% in the quarter and are now even year-to-date.
Lastly, we captured five points of operating expense leverage in the quarter. As a reminder, when we speak of operating expense leverage, we’re referring to the percentage point difference between our gross profit growth and our operating income growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis. The percentage points captured this quarter were driven by our continued strong focus on cost management and the leveraging of our productivity initiatives. 
We also benefited from the favorable cycling of marketing expenses versus the prior year, and we do expect that this will reverse in the back half of the year. As such, we anticipate our full year 2010 operating expense leverage to be at low single-digits for the full year as we noted in our Q1 call.
As for our total marketing expenses, including both our direct and point-of-sale marketing, these continue to be positive in the quarter as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth.
Now let me build on Muhtar's earlier remarks regarding our pending transaction to acquire Coca-Cola Enterprises’ North American operations. We have now achieved a number of important milestones and are on track with the remaining ones for our anticipated fourth quarter closing.
First, on May 25, Coca-Cola Enterprises filed its Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- the company's first formal step toward seeking shareholder approval of the transaction. An amended Form S-4 was filed on July 8 to respond to the SEC's comments. The S-4 provides details on the transaction and the intended new CCE business. SEC must complete its review of the Form S-4 before the proxy statement that is contained within the S-4 can be sent to CCE's shareholders.
Second, on June 7, the Coca-Cola Company announced its agreement with Dr. Pepper Snapple for continued distribution of their brands after the transaction closes. Third, the transaction must receive antitrust clearance from the FTC as well as the Canadian Competition Bureau for our closing, and we submitted our request for antitrust approval on June 30. 
As for CCE, they are awaiting a response to their request to the IRS for a revenue ruling approving the proposed tax treatment, and in addition, CCE shareholders must vote to approve the transaction. And with regard to these last two items, if you have any questions, I'd refer you to CCE on those. 
But as Muhtar mentioned, we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter exactly in line with the timeline originally provided. We'll provide updates as [audio gap]. Finally, let me take a minute to provide our outlook on a few key factors we see in the back half of 2010. Despite the recent volatility in some key currencies, we once again benefited from currency in the second quarter. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter, when we said that we believed currencies would have a slightly positive impact on operating income on a full-year basis with this benefit weighted toward the first half of this year. As such, we would expect currency to have a low single-digit negative impact on operating income starting in the third quarter.
As a quick reminder, we are 100% covered on the euro for 2010 and will continue to execute our hedging strategies over multiple years as appropriate. Also want to remind you that, as highlighted in our previous call, our comparable results for this year reflect the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities, primarily bottling operations, due to new accounting guidance that became effective the first of this year for the FASB requirements. For the full year of 2009, these entities accounted for approximately 3% of our consolidated net revenue and approximately 2% of our consolidated operating income. In addition, we reflected these changes within our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules to provide a comparable income statement for external modeling purposes. At the end of this last quarter, we also posted a schedule in the Investor section of our website that takes into account this change in accounting guidance to assist you in adjusting the prior-year results.
On productivity, we're on track and on plan to deliver the $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of next year, 2011. And lastly, with regard to share repurchase, as we said in our last call we have to stay out of the market until the close of our transaction with Coca-Cola Enterprises. While you will see minimum cash outflow for treasury stock purchases in our results this quarter, note that these review to share withholding related to employee benefit plans.
As for our plans to repurchase common stock, we remain committed to repurchasing at least $1.5 billion of shares by the end of this year.
In conclusion, while this is good to see some parts of the world experiencing a slow but steady recovery, it's clear that many others are continuing to struggle through an extended global recession. Despite this challenging global environment, our results this quarter as well as our continued track record of success this past year is a testament to our seasoned management team, our sound growth strategies and our solid global brand portfolio. We are clearly executing the right actions to drive our business for the long term. We remain confident that we'll keep gaining global share and enhancing the health of our brands in order to drive long-term profitable growth, and importantly, value for our shareholders. Operators, we're now ready for your questions."

First, our volume in China grew 6% and importantly we gained volume and value share in the total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. And it is important to, I think, remember that our 6% growth was off of a volume base that is more than two times the size of our global competitor, therefore widening our lead in terms of total unit cases, actual unit cases sold in China. And during the quarter, again, we have a -- and China is a complex market -- we have a great portfolio in China. We grew our still beverages up by 30%, gaining again volume and value share. And in sparkling beverages, we saw sequential volume improvement through the quarter, and I think also in June, sparkling value share gains as well as in the quarter. So I expect to see continued sequential improvement in China. I think, as I said, China has had some very extraordinary weather in the first quarter as well as some parts, strong markets on the East Coast in the second quarter. We clearly expect China to be strong growth market for the company. I want to remind everyone of 26 quarters of, consecutive quarters of double-digit growth that we've had in China. Strong growth market, I think we all believe that China will be a strong growth market for the company for the next decade as well as beyond, and I can tell you that we will continue to do what is right for the business in China by investing for the long term, and also leading the industry in building strong brands across our entire portfolio, especially in sparkling beverages. And again, I just want to reiterate that we are investing $2 billion. We're in year two of that $2 billion investment. I was in China a couple of months ago at the opening of the Shanghai Expo. I'm going to be back again for the opening of our new plant in Inner Mongolia in China, bringing our total number of plants very close to 40. We have a wonderful template, both in terms of production as well as in terms of go-to-market. And I am confident that China, as I said, will continue to be a significant growth market for the company in the decade to come."

I think we are, our brands are getting stronger in the United States, significant strength in our brands. And therefore, I think we're seeing all of those culminate into results. And it is particularly pleasing that we're entering into our transaction that we intend to close in quarter four from a point of view of strength. That is really critically important that I want to reiterate. We delivered a solid quarter of volume profit and share growth while staying, again, absolutely focused on our long-term strategies. That is the key. And we remain confident that we do have the right strategies for our flagship market, working closer than ever before, and our strategic focus remains consistent on continuing to build healthy brands, healthy customer relationships and healthy system.

That is the belief that our people have at every level that they can generate growth out of this market because of the wonderful demographics, the strength of the brands, the spending power and also the consumption habits.

We saw sequential improvement in our business in the quarter that just passed, but we remain cautious because we expect economic headwinds in Japan to continue in the near term as well as throughout 2010. As far as the vending channel is concerned, yes, there has been, I think we've seen the dip and there has been some improvement because of, again, factories that basically closed down during a period of time in the very depth of the recession are back, albeit not working on all shifts as they used to but certainly the export business is coming back. Trademark Georgia is positive in vending, I mentioned that. I think we see some really good still great green shoots in trademark Coca-Cola.

Remember, we've always said that we're going to have negative geographic price mix. And that's a really good thing",375,"I'd say it's a couple of things and this is where if I just start on total company first and then drill down to the specifics, specifically. Remember, we've always said that we're going to have negative geographic price mix. And that's a really good thing if you think about it in that it means that our emerging markets are growing much faster -- which is what we would want to happen, what you would want to happen -- than the more developed markets, and because of that it's going to give us a negative geographic mix. That is accentuated in the Pacific, where you've got significant emerging markets, and so you've got the Philippines up strong double digits. You've got Thailand up strong double digits. You've got Indonesia up strong double digits. And then at a time when Japan is down three and Australia's actually down two, and you put those together and you've got significant geographic negative mix that is more than offsetting pricing, whereas for the total company we're able to balance that out as what we've always said from a total company, total global portfolio perspective we should be able to balance that out longer term, make it actually positive. But basically it's geographic mix in the Pacific. It, over time, will get smaller. If you remember that if you went back even five years ago, Japan was probably 20% of the total profit and it's now in single digits. And because of that it is getting smaller. Now we're working diligently on Japan because I really would love it to be bigger, obviously, but the geographic mix is the big thing. But one other thing I'd add in Japan is kind of back to one of the previous questions as well. On two of the bottlers in the Canto area we took management control of a year, two years ago, and they actually had a really good quarter and we're actually positive and it's giving, I think, all the bottlers in Japan something now to understand of what's actually possible with -- and so we're using that and best practices to really show what's possible in Japan, and I think longer term we have a positive view on Japan."

First, let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our third quarter performance.

First, let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. We successfully completed our acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises North America business and the sale of our Norway-Sweden bottling operations to CCE on plan and in-line with our commitments. And we close this transaction on the heels of executing a strong quarter.
We continue to build on our momentum, delivering solid volume, revenue and profit growth this quarter with our results exceeding all of our long-term targets and generating sustainable value for our shareholders. This quarter, once again, underscores how we are advancing our 2020 Vision from a position of strength as we enter a new era of growth for The Coca-Cola Company. Together, in close alignment with our global bottling partners, we are executing with excellence around the world. Our strategies, our brands, our marketing, our innovation, our partnerships and our people are defining new growth opportunities today and shaping our system's vision for this decade.
Our brand equity is growing stronger around the world as evidenced by a measurable increase in consumer preference for our brands this quarter, as well as 4% global growth for our flagship brand, Coca-Cola, on a year-to-date basis. We are now intensely focused on driving a fast and seamless integration in our North America operations. And this evolution of our franchise system is an important milestone in realizing our 2020 Vision, strengthening our commitment to best serve our customers and our consumers and facilitating our ability to achieve sustainable and profitable growth in our flagship market.
Turning to our current results, this quarter's comparable currency neutral operating income growth was 14% ahead of our long-term growth target. We grew our quarterly volume a solid 5% also ahead of our long-term growth target, fueled by organic unit case volume growth across both North America and our international operations. We increased net revenues a healthy 8% on a comparable currency neutral basis in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date comparable currency neutral revenues to 5%. This is in line with our long-term growth target. And once again, we generated significant cash from our operations, with cash flow up 15% year-to-date.
Now I will share our performance results in more detail across our markets starting with our flagship market. North America volume grew 2% this quarter, the second consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. On a year-to-date basis, our North America business is now up 1%. These results are due to the continued successful execution of our well-defined brand pack and price strategy focused on driving profitable growth. Our sparkling beverages in North America grew volume and value share both against a total category, as well as versus our primary competitor. And to be clear, when we speak about share swing gains versus our primary competitor in North America, we refer to our performance across all channels, not just measured channels, which represent less than 40% of our North America business. 
Brand Coca-Cola health measures keep improving as we increase our favorite brand's core versus our primary competitor amongst the most critical consumer segments. At the same time, Coca-Cola Zero delivered double-digit volume growth for the 18th consecutive quarter. Brand Sprite had a second consecutive quarter of positive growth and is now positive on a year-to-date basis and Fanta had its strongest quarter of the year growing 4%. We further extended the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser, which is on track to be in 15 markets by the end of this year, providing a greater choice of brands to our customers and our consumers. This all reaffirms our confidence that we are executing the right strategies with our bottling partners to drive growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio.
Turning to North America still beverages, these also continue to accelerate up a strong 8% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. We have now grown volume share for 11 of the past 13 quarters and value share for 12 of the last 13 quarters. Our North America juice and juice drink business delivered positive growth for the quarter, led once again by double-digit growth from our Simply trademark. Our North America energy portfolio also accelerated this quarter, up 15%, including double-digit growth by NOS. 
In the North America tea category, our Gold Peak brand delivered double-digit growth in both its a bottled can and food service delivery forms. I also would like to highlight how our North America still beverage portfolio works in concert to generate value. First, our glacéau brands were up mid-single digits this quarter in North America, continuing a year-long trend of sequential improvement. Secondly, POWERade was up over 30% in the quarter, outperforming the North America sports drink category while gaining share against our primary competitor for the eighth consecutive quarter. This performance is not a new turn of events or simply due to price discounting, but rather the result of implementing a clear, consistent and competitively sustainable strategy focused on innovation, consumer engagement as well as brand building.
In fact, since acquiring glacéau, in mid-2007, our joint glacéau and POWERade businesses have gained more than seven points of volume share swing against our primary competitors combined, sports drink and functional hydration offerings. This is the power of valuable brands and strong system execution working together in the marketplace.
Now as we begin to benefit from our acquisition of CCE's North America business, we have an important opportunity to take our execution across our entire North America portfolio to the next level. As we have consistently said, we have the right long-term strategies in place in our flagship market and we are confident that we are well-positioned for the next era of winning.
Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa, an operating group consisting of nine business units, with 89 countries spanning from Africa through the Middle East and India, up to Russia. This group grew 12% volume in the third quarter with strong performance across both sparkling and still beverages. Year-to-date growth now stands at 11%. All nine business units in Eurasia and Africa grew this quarter, with countries representing more than half of the group's volume, increasing by double digits. This broad-based growth was led by Russia, up 30%, this quarter and 13% year-to-date. We outgrew our primary international competitor in Russia this quarter. Importantly, this high-quality growth was led by the strong performance of our core sparkling brands, which drove almost half of this quarter's absolute volume growth. In fact, brand Coca-Cola, the single largest non-alcoholic RTD brand in Russia was up 34% this past quarter, gaining both volume and value share. 
We're also making steady progress in the Russia juice market, the integration of our Multon juice business, which began this past quarter is advancing as planned. And this quarter, we also acquired Nidan, a leading juice brand in Russia. This transaction will enable us to further expand our juice offerings in this important market. We also grew double digits this quarter in Turkey, Southern Eurasia, complementing high single-digit growth in the Middle East. India, meanwhile, achieved its 17th consecutive quarter of growth despite facing record rainfall during this summer's monsoon season and cycling 37% growth in the comparable 2009 period.
Importantly, India captured share in both sparkling and still beverages. And on a year-to-date basis, we have grown trademark Coca-Cola 18% in India while our Maaza juice brand is up 24%, demonstrating the broad base strength of our portfolio in this critical market. Our commitment to India is unwavering. Last month, we announced plans to invest up to $120 million in the new plant in Southern India and we are excited about the significant and sustainable opportunities this region has to offer over the long term.
Another continent we're excited about and keep investing in heavily is Africa. Over the past 10 years, our system has invested more than $5 billion in the African continent and we plan to invest in another $12 billion as a system in the next decade. As for this quarter's performance in Africa, we saw double-digit growth in East and Central Africa and mid-single-digit growth in North and West Africa. South Africa delivered 6% unit case volume growth, benefiting both from the momentum generated by our FIFA World Cup activation program, as well as our ongoing work to improve our route to market and small store activation capabilities in this key market.
Moving to our Pacific Group, overall volume growth was up 11% in the third quarter bringing our year-to-date volume growth to 8%. These results were supported by a return to double-digit growth in China, up 12% in the third quarter. China captured volume and value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. Our sparkling beverages grew high single digits in China, led by the strong performance of both brand Coca-Cola and Sprite, with Sprite remaining the number one sparkling brand in China for the 14th consecutive quarter. Our still beverages in China were up a strong double digits led by the continued momentum of our Minute Maid Pulpy brands. We are one of only a few true multi-category beverage players in Russia (sic) [China], twice as large and growing faster than our primary international competitor. And while we are pleased to report such good results this quarter, our focus in China is primarily on building our business with great brands across multiple categories to drive strong performance over time. The measure of our success in this country will be how we grow our total business between now and 2020. We are confident we have the right strategies in place to deliver sustainable double-digit growth in China over the long term.
We were also pleased to see Japan return to growth, up a very strong 11% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date. While this quarter's volume growth was our highest in Japan in over a decade, we recognized that along with the rest of the beverage industry, our business benefited from record high temperatures this summer. With that said, our brand portfolio gained further traction with the Japanese consumer. For example, Coca-Cola trademark was up 11% this quarter, a third consecutive quarter of positive growth, driven by effective and exciting summer marketing programs and successful FIFA World Cup activation. And our water business in Japan also drove profitable growth with this summer's launch of a I LOHAS MIKAN, a new Mandarin orange flavored water, extending the presence of our industry leading and eco-friendly single-serve I LOHAS brand. Despite the success we have so far had in Japan this year, it is important to point out that economic headwinds remain challenging for the time being.
As for the Philippines, we delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with Coca-Cola trademark growing 12% and still beverages up 20% supported by strong gains in tea, juices and juice drinks, as well as water. We also announced our commitment to increase our investments in this critical country by $1 billion over five years as we remain focused on investing ahead of demand.
Moving now to Latin America, for the quarter, volume grew a steady 4%, gaining share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Despite adverse weather conditions in Mexico, Colombia and most of Central America, brand Coca-Cola was also up 4% for the quarter. Brazil delivered very strong results with volume up 13% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. This also marked the third consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in total non-alcoholic beverages. Mexico volume was even for the quarter, cycling 9% growth from last year and impacted by heavy rain during the summer season. Mexico has now gained total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume share for 14 of the last 15 quarters and value share for 15 consecutive quarters. We are confident that Mexico will return to normalized growth over the balance of the year. Lastly, our South Latin region, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered solid mid-single-digit growth.
Moving to Europe, we still see customers and consumers pressured by the difficult economic conditions, impacting various countries in this geography. For the quarter, our volume was slightly positive, rounding to even versus the prior year. Our performance of sparkling beverages in Europe was lead by trademark Coca-Cola, which is up 1% for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Our still beverages in Europe saw positive growth across categories, including double-digit growth in energy and tea, as well as positive results in both sports drinks and juice and juice drinks. Importantly, our still beverages gained both volume and value share in Europe this past quarter.
We were pleased to realize low- to mid-single-digit growth this quarter across most of our Western European markets, including France, the Nordics and Great Britain. These encouraging results were offset by ongoing economic challenges in south and eastern Europe. In Spain, despite the ongoing economic crisis, our business once again improved its share trends capturing total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage share this quarter. Our Nordics business grew a solid 6% in the quarter, Norway and Sweden have now transitioned to CCE's ownership. The move of these bottling operations is consistent with the principles we have always shared regarding our Bottling Investments Group. That is to sell our selected company-owned bottling operations at fair value and at the right time to strategically and financially aligned bottling partners. As we have said many times before, we will only sell a bottling operation when it is a successful as sustainable business. The Norway and Sweden operations are just that. So on behalf of our company, I'd like to personally thank all of our Coca-Cola Associates in Norway and Sweden for their great efforts. They are the foundation upon which a strong business was built, and we look forward to partnering with them now that they have joined a new CCU organization.
As for Germany, our remaining European bottling operation has sustained its momentum, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of positive volume growth.
You've heard me say time and time again that we always put our brands first in everything that we do across each and every one of our operating groups. As a result, our sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter with international sparkling beverage volume up 4%. As for Coca-Cola Zero, it continues to be one of the fastest growing global sparkling beverages in the world. Earlier, I referenced Coke Zero's uninterrupted strength of success in the North America market. This momentum extends around the world, with the brand up 6% in international markets on a year-to-date basis.
We are also successfully expanding our still beverage portfolio with total still beverage unit case volume increasing by 11% in the quarter, lead by double-digit growth in sports drinks and water as well as high single-digit growth in juices and juice drinks. I mentioned before how POWERade has been the growth leader of the sports drink category in North America. But this brand's success story is also a global one. POWERade has almost doubled its global share since 2000 and this momentum extended into the third quarter, supported by the flawless execution of POWERade's global FIFA World Cup campaign across 34 markets.
In summary, the sound results across our operations and the balanced growth across our sparkling and still beverages are a testament to our seasoned operating team and global franchise partners. Together, we are executing our 2020 Vision in a disciplined, aligned and decisive manner. We are growing our business while holding a more than three to one volume and value share advantage internationally over our primary global competitor. And while we grow our business, the strength of our flagship brand is only getting stronger. This past quarter alone, Coca-Cola was named South Africa's top brand by the Sunday Times and Coca-Cola retained its number one ranking in Interbrand's rankings of the Best Global Brands for the 11th consecutive year.
Despite these recognitions, we can assure you that we are not content. In fact, we remain constructively discontent. We realize and appreciate that many near-term challenges remain with our consumers and customers around the world. So as we further build our business momentum across the world, we are also committed to building a better tomorrow. One way we are doing this is by delivering on our promise to be the global leader in sustainable water use and the industry leader in packaging energy and climate protection.
This past quarter, our PlantBottle package and newly designed PET plastic bottle made partially from plants won a Greener Package Award, reaffirming our position as a sustainable packaging leader and representing yet another step in our journey to create the bottle of the future.
Since making its debut in Denmark in December 2009, our PlantBottle package has rolled out in a variety of sizes across our sparkling and still beverage portfolio. By the end of this year, we will have 2.5 billion PlantBottle packages in the market and we expect to double this number in 2011. The presence of this packages this year alone is equivalent to eliminating almost 30,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide CO2 and approximately 70,000 barrels of oil. So our commitment to lead in climate protection is one we have worked on diligently for years. We made a public commitment in 2008 that we would place an additional 100,000 HFC-free coolers in the marketplace by the end of 2010. I am pleased to report that together with our bottling partners, we have fulfilled this commitment five months ahead of schedule, having placed our 100,000 incremental HFC-free unit in the marketplace of his past quarter, bringing our total number of HFC-free units the marketplace to 220,000 units.
Another way we are building a better tomorrow is by partnering with our communities. A great example of this is our recent launch of Project Nurture in Kenya. This is a mango and passion fruit and juice sourcing partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Through this creative initiative we are helping develop local food sourcing farms to support our expanding juice businesses around the world. Equally important, we are improving the incomes of more than 50,000 fruit farmers in Kenya and Uganda. 
We're also building for a better tomorrow by putting our people first. In fact, I spend as much time developing a our management team and talent as I do, leading our business. Our people are the absolute key competitive advantage and enabler to achieving our 2020 Vision. The real opportunity in developing our people is finding leaders with a global mindset and experience who can effectively lead a multinational, multicultural, multilingual team of associates and bottling partners. To do this, we have a consistent set of criteria we apply when it comes to Talent Management, seeking leaders with a breadth of experience and perspective who can think beyond their geography and also operate in different and dynamic environments.
In the end, our reputation attracts and retains talent but we cannot rely on this as our only strategy. Just as we continue to focus on building our brands, we're also investing in our brand as a 21st century employer, which is why I was pleased to see us receive such a high-ranking on Universum's Second Annual Survey to identify the World's Most Attractive Employers. The 2010 survey was based on data from nearly 130,000 college students all around the world. The Coca-Cola Company moved up five spots since 2009 to number eight in the world according to the survey business students, number two amongst consumer goods companies and the only beverage company ranked in the top 20.
Let me close by saying that we are confident in our system's stability to win together, aligned and focused on executing against our consistent growth strategies to achieve our 2020 Vision. Despite facing extended economic headwinds, we're on course to deliver on our commitment to grow volume, revenue, share and profits in 2010. The integration of our North America business is fully underway and well on track. We have created the right operational structure, which will accelerate our ability to make agile, strategic decisions to build on our strong momentum in this marketplace.
As we look ahead, we see a world that is yearning not just for the beverages provided by The Coca-Cola Company, but also for the values and ideals that our brand represents. Values and ideals like community, like fun, happiness and the hope for a better tomorrow. This is what inspires a strong and unyielding belief in the growth of our company and our system as well as the long-term value it can create for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary."

As Muhtar said, we once again delivered a quarter of consistent quality volume and profit growth. Our volume revenue and profit results all came in ahead of our long-term growth targets this quarter, reaffirming that our highly capable leadership team is executing the right strategic plans with our bottling partners to achieve our sustainable long-term goals. These results demonstrate that we are building on our 2010 momentum and advancing our 2020 Vision.
As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.92, up 12% versus the prior year. For the quarter, our business delivered strong comparable net revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, driven by a 7% increase in concentrate sale and 1% positive price mix impact. Our comparable operating income was up a strong 14%, bringing our year-to-date comparable growth to 15%, while currency had a minimal impact on operating income this quarter. We've had a 4% positive impact year-to-date. Further, our comparable gross profit increased 10%, with year-to-date gross profit up 9%. Again, currency had a minimal impact on gross profit in the quarter but has had a 2% positive impact year-to-date. As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 15% year-to-date, the $7.2 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance, including the effects of currency.
Now let me go through some detail around our quarterly results and year-to-date performance. Our sequential improvement in price mix was in line with our expectations with the ongoing impact of geographic mix more than offset by our positive global revenue growth management strategies. This improvement brings our year-to-date price mix results to even versus the prior year, fully consistent with our expectations shared in previous earnings calls. As we've communicated before, we expect our price mix to remain even for the full year. Our comparable currency neutral cost of goods was up 3% for the quarter and is now up 1% year-to-date, fully in line with our communications in previous quarterly calls, when we said that we expected our cost of goods to grow at a low single-digit range for the full year.
Comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 8% in the quarter and up 3% year-to-date, reflecting increased levels of marketing spend, driven by the cycling of low marketing expenses are the same period last year, which we anticipated and also outlined for you in our last quarterly call.
As for our total marketing spend, including both our direct and point-of-sale marketing, this continues to be positive on a year-to-date basis as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth. For this quarter, we captured four percentage points of operating expense leverage. This was a little better than our expectation for the full year that I mentioned last quarter and was driven by greater top line profit growth, continued strong focus on cost management and the benefits of our productivity initiatives. Importantly, this underscores the unique strength of our global system, a system able to simultaneously run highly effective and efficient operations while driving solid top line results. Going forward, we now expect our full year 2010 operating expense leverage to come in at the low- to mid-single-digit range.  Lastly, the lowering of our year-to-date effective tax rate from 23.2% to 23% benefited our earnings per share by a little less than $0.01.
Now let me take the minute to highlight a few additional factors we see in the fourth quarter of this year. First, I want to remind you that as highlighted in our previous quarterly calls, our comparable results for 2010 reflect the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities primarily bottling operations due to new accounting guidance that became effective the beginning of this year as per FASB requirements. We've now reflected the appropriate changes within our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules to provide a comparable income statement for external modeling purposes and have posted a schedule in the Investors section of our website that takes into account this change in accounting guidance to assist you in adjusting prior year results.
Secondly, as per my earlier remarks, currency had a minimal impact on our comparable results this quarter. As such and as we've communicated in our prior quarterly calls, we believe that currency will have a slightly positive impact on operating income on the full year basis with this benefit weighted toward the first half of 2010. We expect currency to have a minimal to low single-digit negative impact on operating income in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward, while we don't expect to see a repeat of the currency volatility we saw in early 2009, and earlier this year, we would expect some further volatility going forward as economies emerge from the global recession differently. Please note that we routinely monitor our exposure to currency, actively hedge hard currencies such as the euro and yen, and proactively balance our coverage as appropriate. We'll keep doing so in this environment in line with our long-term hedging strategies and we'll keep you updated on our hedging activities. Importantly, we will keep managing and investing in our business at the local market level and in local currencies to drive long-term growth and increase the consumption of our brands. 
On productivity, we're well on track and on plan to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of 2011. Lastly, with regards to our share repurchase program, we were out of the market pending the close of our transaction with Coca-Cola Enterprises. With this transaction now closed, we're in the process of reentering the market and now expect to repurchase approximately $2 billion of shares by the end of 2010.
While on the subject of CCE, let me share a few items regarding the transaction. First, the deal closed on October 2, 2010, which was the first day of our fourth quarter. While this transaction was structured as primarily cashless, under the terms of the deal, we agreed to make a cash payment to CCE in the event that the actual debt assumed upon acquisition was less than the previously agreed upon amount. Therefore, in anticipation of closing the transaction, a cash consideration of $1.3 billion was paid to CCE, substantially related to the debt level assumed. This payment was made on October 1, the last day of our third quarter. Concurrently and as expected, we also received about $900 million in cash from CCE for the sale of our Norway and Sweden bottling operations, both of these transactions are reflected in the quarter's cash flow statement and the balance sheet.
As for the recurring results, we report today these were not impacted by the CCE transaction. When we report our fourth quarter and full year results, these will be the first to fully reflect the incorporation of CCE's North American business as well as the divestiture of our Norway and Sweden bottling operations.
Secondly, when we announced our fourth quarter and full-year results, we will continue to detail our results by our five existing geographic operating groups, with the North American operating group fully incorporating our newly constituted Coca-Cola Refreshments and Coca-Cola North America organizations.
Finally, with regard to synergies, as we have announced previously and reiterated in our earnings release today, we continue to expect synergies up at least $350 million per year based in over the next four years. We know that many of you are looking for additional modeling information regarding our newly integrated North American business. Please note that before the end of this year, we intend to share with you further details regarding our capital and debt structure plans, as well as the impact of other items regarding the modeling of our new North American operations. 
In conclusion, we delivered strong volume growth and high-quality profit growth through the first three quarters of this year. Both our operating income and earnings per share growth rates are ahead of our long-term growth targets on an ongoing currency neutral basis. Our revenue growth have sequentially improved over the course of the year and is now fully in line with our long-term growth targets.  All of this is a testament to our seasoned management team's ability to effectively manage and execute our strategies within a challenging market environment. Together with our global bottling partners, we are maintaining our disciplined investment strategies and executing the right actions to drive our business for both today and tomorrow. As such, we remain confident that we will keep enhancing the health of our brands and importantly, drive long-term profitable growth and value for our shareholders.

Volume grew 2%, second consecutive quarter of positive and as I highlight, organic growth. Year-to-date volume growth was 1% and I think if you sort of dig double click and dig down for the quarter, total sparkling was even trademark and then for the year to date, when you look at like trademark Coca-Cola on a year-to-date basis is even versus minus three for the same three quarters of prior years. So one of the things that is continuing to drive this is our success in our brand price pack channel architecture that we have talked about for a number of quarters that we're implementing. I think another one is our continued strength in our brands. We continue to invest in our brands and it's paying off. Coca-Cola remains the number one favorite brand and has widened that lead over its nearest competitor. Ratio is now 1.6:1 versus 1.4:1 in year-to-date 2008, for example. Favorite brand scores are again up, Coke Zero, favorite band scores continue to grow at a significant rate. So all of that is paying off and I think its important that we have a strategic focused that is consistent on building powerful brands creating the value with our customer relationships and also a high-performing system that is capable of working together to serve our customers and consumers. And I'm happy also to point out that in the third quarter, as the industry returned to more rational pricing, CCNA, our North American operation in U.S. Coca-Cola USA gained value share in total NARTD, and volume and value share in the sparkling as well as still categories. So when you look back at, say, some of the media reports back in the middle of 2008, say June, July 2008, one of the priorities I outlined at that time, if you look into the clippings and go back into recent history, I said it is to stabilize and return to sustainable growth on North American operations. I think that in no way I would declaring [ph] victory, we're in the process of stabilizing, as you can see from the numbers and we're cautiously confident that even in the depths of the most severe crisis that we've recently had in the last couple of years in North America, and the U.S. consumers still confused by the way, that we are -- our investments are paying off, our alignment with our bottling partners is paying off. And now I think we can accelerate that with this historic transaction. So I'm particularly pleased that as we've gone into the quarter, as we've gone into this transaction, at the end of this past quarter that we go into that transaction from a point of strength, from a position of strength. And as I said, the transaction will further enable us to accelerate our momentum, I believe."

And I think we're excited what the future offers in the Philippines. As far as transactions are concerned, at the end of the day, you've got to remember that consumers don't buy unit cases, they buy by transactions packages at certain price points. And I think it's really that's why it's so important for us to track the consumer behavior patterns of consumption in different channels on a transaction basis, and I think that we're certainly seeing the benefit of tracking that metric in the United States, especially as we have offered more choices as part of our brand price pack channel architecture in the United States that's working well and you will continue to see a focus on that metric as we widen it across the world."

But again, you'll see some volatility in Russia play out over the next three years. But I think a more gradual return to a high single-digit and double-digit growth rates. As far as Mexico is concerned, you asked the question, I think during this quarter, Mexico in certain regions of northern South America, the northern part of South America suffered from very unusual high rainfalls, which were in fact in some cases in Mexico, particularly the severe area of [ph] distribution over some prolonged periods. And of course, also this past quarter again remind you that Mexico was piping 9% growth. In the prior year, I've said and I think in the call earlier that Mexico, we believe that Mexico will return to more normalized rates of growth that we've seen in the past periods over the last two or three years. And I think Japan certainly benefited from the extraordinarily positive weather, lack of rainfall and also very high sustained temperatures during the key summer months, July, August. I think that Japan, but again, not all of the growth was related to that. Some of the programs were really getting traction especially in the Kanto region in Tony [ph] as well as Coca-Cola bottlers Tokyo and also some of the other outline like Coca-Cola Central Japan. And therefore, I think Japan, we should see Japan despite the very challenging consumer landscape deflationary environment should return to more of an even 1% to 2% growth rate normalized over the coming period."

All I can tell you, Judy, is that I think in this past quarter, net revenues for the quarter increased 2%, which reflected a 2% increase in concentrated sales and a positive price mix, which sort of rounded to even, which was partially offset by the consolidation of certain entities due to a change in our accounting guidance. And I'll have Gary comment on this to. But I think it's really important that price mix will gradually strengthen I believe in the United States as sparkling and still, both sparkling and still portfolios grow. And as we get traction in terms of a more nimble and faster system in the United States as we transform our business and reap the benefits of successful integration. But it's really important to note that it is personally very pleasing for me that we can lead into this transaction with two consecutive quarters of growth and also importantly, this growth is balanced and that you've got like trademark Coca-Cola year-to-date on an even basis compared to say minus three for the first three quarters of prior year, and Coke Zero is still doing very well in double-digit growth. And so I think -- and then our still beverage strategy is really working very well with total still beverages up 8% on a year-to-date basis up 5% and that's a derivative of our success in both the juice segment as well as sports drinks, as I mentioned energy, tea, all working together, coming together to generate this balanced growth in the United States. And I think, again, you can expect the price mix to gradually strengthen, but it's really important that we continue to invest in our brands and in our infrastructure in North America. And that's effective marketing is paying dividends. The strength of our brands, are paying dividends and especially in this third quarter, this past third quarter where there was price rationalization in the industry that we could still generate 2% organic growth was particularly encouraging.

So this is one of those examples where North America went down over a long period of time and it's going to take us some time to really get it back, but I'm really optimistic and confident because of where we're starting from right now."

It's really important that, that'd be understood well. To the tune of, if you take marketing and total of CapEx of the bottling system combined in 2009 numbers around North of $2.5 billion, this year it'll be getting close to maybe another sort of 10% higher than that in total. I'm talking about marketing, as well as CapEx investments in route to market production, efficiency, IT, marketing, brands, all of that. So again, I said before we have to really capitalize on this current economic crisis and that's what you've seen us doing all around the world, including in the United States. And we continue to invest in our brands and our system, and that's paying off. That's paying off when you look at the whole world, when we again globally gained total value share and held volume share in the quarter and that's the 13th consecutive quarter of value share gain globally. So you're seeing that paying off. And as Gary said, most of these investments, a lot of these investments are coming up from the system. We generate as a system north of $20 billion of cash annually, $20 billion. And that's when we announced $5 billion in Mexico for the next five years, $6 billion in Brazil for the next five years, $3 billion in China over '09, '10 and '11. These are system investment numbers that are driving our business because you've heard me say before, critically important to judge the appetite of our bottling system for more territory and investments. And that is at an all-time high. And our brands at an all-time high in terms of their current metrics around the world, including here in the United States."

First, let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. We successfully completed our acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises North America business and the sale of our Norway",3438,"Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. First, let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. We successfully completed our acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises North America business and the sale of our Norway-Sweden bottling operations to CCE on plan and in-line with our commitments. And we close this transaction on the heels of executing a strong quarter.
We continue to build on our momentum, delivering solid volume, revenue and profit growth this quarter with our results exceeding all of our long-term targets and generating sustainable value for our shareholders. This quarter, once again, underscores how we are advancing our 2020 Vision from a position of strength as we enter a new era of growth for The Coca-Cola Company. Together, in close alignment with our global bottling partners, we are executing with excellence around the world. Our strategies, our brands, our marketing, our innovation, our partnerships and our people are defining new growth opportunities today and shaping our system's vision for this decade.
Our brand equity is growing stronger around the world as evidenced by a measurable increase in consumer preference for our brands this quarter, as well as 4% global growth for our flagship brand, Coca-Cola, on a year-to-date basis. We are now intensely focused on driving a fast and seamless integration in our North America operations. And this evolution of our franchise system is an important milestone in realizing our 2020 Vision, strengthening our commitment to best serve our customers and our consumers and facilitating our ability to achieve sustainable and profitable growth in our flagship market.
Turning to our current results. This quarter's comparable currency neutral operating income growth was 14% ahead of our long-term growth target. We grew our quarterly volume a solid 5%, also ahead of our long-term growth target, fueled by organic unit case volume growth across both North America and our international operations. We increased net revenues a healthy 8% on a comparable currency neutral basis in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date comparable currency neutral revenues to 5%. This is in line with our long-term growth target. And once again, we generated significant cash from our operations, with cash flow up 15% year-to-date.
Now I will share our performance results in more detail across our markets starting with our flagship market. North America volume grew 2% this quarter, the second consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. On a year-to-date basis, our North America business is now up 1%. These results are due to the continued successful execution of our well-defined brand, pack and price strategy focused on driving profitable growth. Our sparkling beverages in North America grew volume and value share both against a total category, as well as versus our primary competitor. And to be clear, when we speak about share swing gains versus our primary competitor in North America, we refer to our performance across all channels, not just measured channels, which represent less than 40% of our North America business. 
Brand Coca-Cola health measures keep improving as we increase our favorite brand score versus our primary competitor amongst the most critical consumer segments. At the same time, Coca-Cola Zero delivered double-digit volume growth for the 18th consecutive quarter. Brand Sprite had a second consecutive quarter of positive growth and is now positive on a year-to-date basis. And Fanta had its strongest quarter of the year, growing 4%. We further extended the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser, which is on track to be in 15 markets by the end of this year, providing a greater choice of brands to our customers and our consumers. This all reaffirms our confidence that we are executing the right strategies with our bottling partners to drive growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio.
Turning to North America still beverages, these also continue to accelerate, up a strong 8% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. We have now grown volume share for 11 of the past 13 quarters and value share for 12 of the last 13 quarters. Our North America juice and juice drink business delivered positive growth for the quarter, led once again by double-digit growth from our Simply trademark. Our North America energy portfolio also accelerated this quarter, up 15%, including double-digit growth by NOS. 
In the North America tea category, our Gold Peak brand delivered double-digit growth in both its bottled can and food service delivery forms. I also would like to highlight how our North America still beverage portfolio works in concert to generate value. First, our glacéau brands were up mid-single digit this quarter in North America, continuing a year-long trend of sequential improvement. Secondly, POWERade was up over 30% in the quarter, outperforming the North America sports drink category while gaining share against our primary competitor for the eighth consecutive quarter. This performance is not a new turn of events or simply due to price discounting, but rather the result of implementing a clear, consistent and competitively sustainable strategy focused on innovation, consumer engagement as well as brand building.
In fact, since acquiring glacéau, in mid-2007, our joint glacéau and POWERade businesses have gained more than seven points of volume share swing against our primary competitors' combined sports drink and functional hydration offerings. This is the power of valuable brands and strong system execution working together in the marketplace.
Now as we begin to benefit from our acquisition of CCE's North America business, we have an important opportunity to take our execution across our entire North America portfolio to the next level. As we have consistently said, we have the right long-term strategies in place in our flagship market and we are confident that we are well-positioned for the next era of winning.
Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa, an operating group consisting of nine business units, with 89 countries spanning from Africa through the Middle East and India, up to Russia. This group grew 12% volume in the third quarter with strong performance across both sparkling and still beverages. Year-to-date growth now stands at 11%. All nine business units in Eurasia and Africa grew this quarter, with countries representing more than half of the group's volume, increasing by double digits. This broad-based growth was led by Russia, up 30% this quarter and 13% year-to-date. We outgrew our primary international competitor in Russia this quarter. Importantly, this high-quality growth was led by the strong performance of our core sparkling brand, which drove almost half of this quarter's absolute volume growth. In fact, brand Coca-Cola, the single largest non-alcoholic RTD brand in Russia, was up 34% this past quarter, gaining both volume and value share. 
We're also making steady progress in the Russia juice market. The integration of our Multon juice business, which began this past quarter, is advancing as planned. And this quarter, we also acquired Nidan, a leading juice brand in Russia. This transaction will enable us to further expand our juice offerings in this important market. We also grew double digits this quarter in Turkey, Southern Eurasia, complementing high single-digit growth in the Middle East. India, meanwhile, achieved its 17th consecutive quarter of growth despite facing record rainfall during this summer's monsoon season, and cycling 37% growth in the comparable 2009 period.
Importantly, India captured share in both sparkling and still beverages. And on a year-to-date basis, we have grown trademark Coca-Cola 18% in India while our Maaza juice brand is up 24%, demonstrating the broad base strength of our portfolio in this critical market. Our commitment to India is unwavering. Last month, we announced plans to invest up to $120 million in a new plant in Southern India and we are excited about the significant and sustainable opportunities this region has to offer over the long term.
Another continent we're excited about and keep investing in heavily is Africa. Over the past 10 years, our system has invested more than $5 billion in the African continent, and we plan to invest in another $12 billion as a system in the next decade. As for this quarter's performance in Africa, we saw double-digit growth in East and Central Africa and mid-single-digit growth in North and West Africa. South Africa delivered 6% unit case volume growth, benefiting both from the momentum generated by our FIFA World Cup activation program, as well as our ongoing work to improve our route-to-market and small-store-activation capabilities in this key market.
Moving to our Pacific Group, overall volume growth was up 11% in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date volume growth to 8%. These results were supported by a return to double-digit growth in China, up 12% in the third quarter. China captured volume and value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. Our sparkling beverages grew high single digits in China, led by the strong performance of both brand Coca-Cola and Sprite, with Sprite remaining the number one sparkling brand in China for the 14th consecutive quarter. Our still beverages in China were up a strong double digits, led by the continued momentum of our Minute Maid Pulpy brands. 
We are one of only a few true multi-category beverage players in Russia (sic) [China], twice as large and growing faster than our primary international competitor. And while we are pleased to report such good results this quarter, our focus in China is primarily on building our business with great brands across multiple categories to drive strong performance over time. The measure of our success in this country will be how we grow our total business between now and 2020. We are confident we have the right strategies in place to deliver sustainable double-digit growth in China over the long term.
We were also pleased to see Japan return to growth, up a very strong 11% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date. While this quarter's volume growth was our highest in Japan in over a decade, we recognize that, along with the rest of the beverage industry, our business benefited from record high temperatures this summer. With that said, our brand portfolio gained further traction with the Japanese consumer. For example, Coca-Cola trademark was up 11% this quarter, a third consecutive quarter of positive growth, driven by effective and exciting summer marketing programs and successful FIFA World Cup activation. And our water business in Japan also drove profitable growth with this summer's launch of a I LOHAS MIKAN, a new Mandarin orange flavored water, extending the presence of our industry leading and eco-friendly single-serve I LOHAS brand. Despite the success we have so far had in Japan this year, it is important to point out that economic headwinds remain challenging for the time being.
As for the Philippines, we delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with Coca-Cola trademark growing 12% and still beverages up 20%, supported by strong gains in tea, juices and juice drinks, as well as water. We also announced our commitment to increase our investments in this critical country by $1 billion over five years as we remain focused on investing ahead of demand.
Moving now to Latin America. For the quarter, volume grew a steady 4%, gaining share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Despite adverse weather conditions in Mexico, Colombia and most of Central America. Brand Coca-Cola was also up 4% for the quarter. Brazil delivered very strong results with volume up 13% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. This also marked the third consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in total non-alcoholic beverages. Mexico volume was even for the quarter, cycling 9% growth from last year and impacted by heavy rain during the summer season. Mexico has now gained total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume share for 14 of the last 15 quarters and value share for 15 consecutive quarters. We are confident that Mexico will return to normalized growth over the balance of the year. Lastly, our South Latin region, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered solid mid-single-digit growth.
Moving to Europe, we still see customers and consumers pressured by the difficult economic conditions impacting various countries in this geography. For the quarter, our volume was slightly positive, rounding to even versus the prior year. Our performance of sparkling beverages in Europe was lead by trademark Coca-Cola, which is up 1% for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Our still beverages in Europe saw positive growth across categories, including double-digit growth in energy and tea, as well as positive results in both sports drinks and juice and juice drinks. Importantly, our still beverages gained both volume and value share in Europe this past quarter.
We were pleased to realize low- to mid-single-digit growth this quarter across most of our Western European markets, including France, the Nordics and Great Britain. These encouraging results were offset by ongoing economic challenges in south and eastern Europe. In Spain, despite the ongoing economic crisis, our business once again improved its share trends capturing total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage share this quarter. Our Nordics business grew a solid 6% in the quarter. Norway and Sweden have now transitioned to CCE's ownership. 
The move of these bottling operations is consistent with the principles we have always shared regarding our Bottling Investments Group. That is to sell our selected company-owned bottling operations at fair value and at the right time to strategically and financially aligned bottling partners. As we have said many times before, we will only sell a bottling operation when it is a successful and sustainable business. The Norway and Sweden operations are just that. So on behalf of our company, I'd like to personally thank all of our Coca-Cola associates in Norway and Sweden for their great efforts. They are the foundation upon which a strong business was built, and we look forward to partnering with them now that they have joined a new CCE organization.
As for Germany, our remaining European bottling operation, it sustained its momentum, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of positive volume growth.
You've heard me say time and time again that we always put our brands first in everything that we do across each and every one of our operating groups. As a result, our sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter with international sparkling beverage volume up 4%. As for Coca-Cola Zero, it continues to be one of the fastest-growing global sparkling beverages in the world. Earlier, I referenced Coke Zero's uninterrupted sting of success in the North America market. This momentum extends around the world, with the brand up 6% in international markets on a year-to-date basis.
We are also successfully expanding our still beverage portfolio with total still beverage unit case volume increasing by 11% in the quarter, lead by double-digit growth in sports drinks and water as well as high single-digit growth in juices and juice drinks. I mentioned before how POWERade has been the growth leader of the sports drink category in North America. But this brand's success story is also a global one. POWERade has almost doubled its global share since 2000 and this momentum extended into the third quarter, supported by the flawless execution of POWERade's global FIFA World Cup campaign across 34 markets.
In summary, the sound results across our operations and the balanced growth across our sparkling and still beverages are a testament to our seasoned operating team and global franchise partners. Together, we are executing our 2020 Vision in a disciplined, aligned and decisive manner. We are growing our business while holding a more than three-to-one volume and value share advantage internationally over our primary global competitor. And while we grow our business, the strength of our flagship brand is only getting stronger. This past quarter alone, Coca-Cola was named South Africa's top brand by the Sunday Times, and Coca-Cola retained its number one ranking in Interbrand's rankings of the Best Global Brands for the 11th consecutive year.
Despite these recognitions, we can assure you that we are not content. In fact, we remain constructively discontent. We realize and appreciate that many near-term challenges remain with our consumers and customers around the world. So as we further build our business momentum across the world, we are also committed to building a better tomorrow. One way we are doing this is by delivering on our promise to be the global leader in sustainable water use and the industry leader in packaging, energy and climate protection.
This past quarter, our PlantBottle package and new, redesigned PET plastic bottle made partially from plants won a Greener Package Award, reaffirming our position as a sustainable packaging leader and representing yet another step in our journey to create the bottle of the future.
Since making its debut in Denmark in December 2009, our PlantBottle package has rolled out in a variety of sizes across our sparkling and still beverage portfolio. By the end of this year, we will have 2.5 billion PlantBottle packages in the market and we expect to double this number in 2011. The presence of these packages this year alone is equivalent to eliminating almost 30,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, CO2, and approximately 70,000 barrels of oil. So our commitment to lead in climate protection is one we have worked on diligently for years. We made a public commitment in 2008 that we would place an additional 100,000 HFC-free coolers in the marketplace by the end of 2010. I am pleased to report that, together with our bottling partners, we have fulfilled this commitment five months ahead of schedule, having placed our 100,000th incremental HFC-free unit in the marketplace this past quarter, bringing our total number of HFC-free coolers in the marketplace to 220,000 units.
Another way we are building a better tomorrow is by partnering with our communities. A great example of this is our recent launch of Project Nurture in Kenya. This is a mango and passion fruit and juice sourcing partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Through this creative initiative we are helping develop local food sourcing farms to support our expanding juice businesses around the world. Equally important, we are improving the incomes of more than 50,000 fruit farmers in Kenya and Uganda. 
We're also building for a better tomorrow by putting our people first. In fact, I spend as much time developing our management team and talent as I do leading our business. Our people are the absolute key competitive advantage and enabler to achieving our 2020 Vision. The real opportunity in developing our people is finding leaders with a global mindset and experience who can effectively lead a multinational, multicultural, multilingual team of associates and bottling partners. To do this, we have a consistent set of criteria we apply when it comes to talent management, seeking leaders with a breadth of experience and perspective who can think beyond their geography and also operate in different and dynamic environments.
In the end, our reputation attracts and retains talent, but we cannot rely on this as our only strategy. Just as we continue to focus on building our brands, we're also investing in our brand as a 21st century employer. Which is why I was pleased to see us receive such a high-ranking on Universum's Second Annual Survey to identify the World's Most Attractive Employers. The 2010 survey was based on data from nearly 130,000 college students all around the world. The Coca-Cola Company moved up five spots since 2009 to number eight in the world according to the surveyed business students, number two amongst consumer goods companies and the only beverage company ranked in the top 20.
Let me close by saying that we are confident in our system's stability to win together, aligned and focused on executing against our consistent growth strategies to achieve our 2020 Vision. Despite facing extended economic headwinds, we're on course to deliver on our commitment to grow volume, revenue, share and profits in 2010. The integration of our North America business is fully underway and well on track. We have created the right operational structure, which will accelerate our ability to make agile, strategic decisions to build on our strong momentum in this marketplace.
As we look ahead, we see a world that is yearning not just for the beverages provided by The Coca-Cola Company, but also for the values and ideals that our brand represents. Values and ideals like community, like fun, happiness and the hope for a better tomorrow. This is what inspires a strong and unyielding belief in the growth of our company and our system as well as the long-term value it can create for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary."

As Muhtar said, we once again delivered a quarter of consistent quality volume and profit growth.

As Muhtar said, we once again delivered a quarter of consistent quality volume and profit growth. Our volume revenue and profit results all came in ahead of our long-term growth targets this quarter, reaffirming that our highly capable leadership team is executing the right strategic plans with our bottling partners to achieve our sustainable long-term goals. These results demonstrate that we are building on our 2010 momentum and advancing our 2020 Vision.
As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.92, up 12% versus the prior year. For the quarter, our business delivered strong comparable net revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, driven by a 7% increase in concentrate sale and 1% positive price mix impact. Our comparable operating income was up a strong 14%, bringing our year-to-date comparable growth to 15%. While currency had a minimal impact on operating income this quarter, we've had a 4% positive impact year-to-date. Further, our comparable gross profit increased 10%, with year-to-date gross profit up 9%. Again, currency had a minimal impact on gross profit in the quarter but has had a 2% positive impact year-to-date. As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 15% year-to-date, to $7.2 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance, including the effects of currency.
Now let me go through some detail around our quarterly results and year-to-date performance. Our sequential improvement in price mix was in line with our expectations, with the ongoing impact of geographic mix more than offset by our positive global revenue growth management strategies. This improvement brings our year-to-date price mix results to even versus the prior year, fully consistent with our expectations shared in previous earnings calls. As we've communicated before, we expect our price mix to remain even for the full year. Our comparable currency neutral cost of goods was up 3% for the quarter and is now up 1% year-to-date, fully in line with our communications in previous quarterly calls, when we said that we expected our cost of goods to grow in a low single-digit range for the full year.
Comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 8% in the quarter and up 3% year-to-date, reflecting increased levels of marketing spend, driven by the cycling of low marketing expenses during the same period last year, which we anticipated and also outlined for you in our last quarterly call.
As for our total marketing spend, including both our direct and point-of-sale marketing, this continues to be positive on a year-to-date basis as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth. For this quarter, we captured four percentage points of operating expense leverage. This was a little better than our expectation for the full year that I mentioned last quarter and was driven by greater top line profit growth, continued strong focus on cost management and the benefits of our productivity initiatives. Importantly, this underscores the unique strength of our global system, a system able to simultaneously run highly effective and efficient operations while driving solid top line results. Going forward, we now expect our full year 2010 operating expense leverage to come in at the low- to mid-single-digit range.  Lastly, the lowering of our year-to-date effective tax rate from 23.2% to 23% benefited our earnings per share by a little less than $0.01.
Now let me take the minute to highlight a few additional factors we see in the fourth quarter of this year. First, I want to remind you that, as highlighted in our previous quarterly calls, our comparable results for 2010 reflect the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities, primarily bottling operations, due to new accounting guidance that became effective the beginning of this year as per FASB requirements. We've now reflected the appropriate changes within our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules to provide a comparable income statement for external modeling purposes and have posted a schedule in the Investors section of our website that takes into account this change in accounting guidance to assist you in adjusting prior year results.
Secondly, as per my earlier remarks, currency had a minimal impact on our comparable results this quarter. As such and as we've communicated in our prior quarterly calls, we believe that currency will have a slightly positive impact on operating income on a full year basis, with this benefit weighted toward the first half of 2010. We expect currency to have a minimal to low single-digit negative impact on operating income in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward, while we don't expect to see a repeat of the currency volatility we saw in early 2009, and earlier this year, we would expect some further volatility going forward as economies emerge from the global recession differently. Please note that we routinely monitor our exposure to currency, actively hedge hard currencies such as the euro and yen, and proactively balance our coverage as appropriate. We'll keep doing so in this environment in line with our long-term hedging strategies and we'll keep you updated on our hedging activities. Importantly, we will keep managing and investing in our business at the local market level and in local currencies to drive long-term growth and increase the consumption of our brands. 
On productivity, we're well on track and on plan to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of 2011. Lastly, with regards to our share repurchase program, we were out of the market pending the close of our transaction with Coca-Cola Enterprises. With this transaction now closed, we're in the process of reentering the market and now expect to repurchase approximately $2 billion of shares by the end of 2010.
While on the subject of CCE, let me share a few items regarding the transaction. First, the deal closed on October 2, 2010, which was the first day of our fourth quarter. While this transaction was structured as primarily cashless, under the terms of the deal, we agreed to make a cash payment to CCE in the event that the actual debt assumed upon acquisition was less than the previously agreed upon amount. Therefore, in anticipation of closing the transaction, a cash consideration of $1.3 billion was paid to CCE, substantially related to the debt level assumed. This payment was made on October 1, the last day of our third quarter. Concurrently and as expected, we also received about $900 million in cash from CCE for the sale of our Norway and Sweden bottling operations. Both of these transactions are reflected in the quarter's cash flow statement and the balance sheet.
As for the recurring results we report today, these were not impacted by the CCE transaction. When we report our fourth quarter and full year results, these will be the first to fully reflect the incorporation of CCE's North American business as well as the divestiture of our Norway and Sweden bottling operations.
Secondly, when we announce our fourth quarter and full-year results, we will continue to detail our results by our five existing geographic operating groups, with the North American operating group fully incorporating our newly constituted Coca-Cola Refreshments and Coca-Cola North America organizations.
Finally, with regard to synergies, as we have announced previously and reiterated in our earnings release today, we continue to expect synergies up at least $350 million per year, phased in over the next four years. We know that many of you are looking for additional modeling information regarding our newly integrated North American business. Please note that before the end of this year, we intend to share with you further details regarding our capital and debt structure plans, as well as the impact of other items regarding the modeling of our new North American operations. 
In conclusion, we delivered strong volume growth and high-quality profit growth through the first three quarters of this year. Both our operating income and earnings per share growth rates are ahead of our long-term growth targets on an ongoing currency neutral basis. Our revenue growth has sequentially improved over the course of the year and is now fully in line with our long-term growth targets.  All of this is a testament to our seasoned management team's ability to effectively manage and execute our strategies within a challenging market environment. Together with our global bottling partners, we are maintaining our disciplined investment strategies and executing the right actions to drive our business for both today and tomorrow. As such, we remain confident that we will keep enhancing the health of our brands and, importantly, drive long-term profitable growth and value for our shareholders.

Volume grew 2%, second consecutive quarter of positive and, I highlight, organic growth and year-to-date volume growth was 1%. And I think if you sort of double click and dig down for the quarter, total sparkling was even trademark. And then for the year to date, when you look at like trademark Coca-Cola on the year-to-date basis is even versus -3 for the same three quarters of prior years. So one of the things that is continuing to drive this is our success in our brand price pack channel architecture, that we have talked about for a number of quarters, that we're implementing. I think another one is our continued strength in our brands. We continue to invest in our brands and it's paying off. Coca-Cola remains the number one favorite brand and has widened that lead over its nearest competitor. Ratio is now 1.6:1 versus 1.4:1 in year-to-date 2008, for example. Favorite brand scores are again up, Coke Zero favorite band scores continue to grow at a significant rate. So all of that is paying off. And I think its important that we have a strategic focus that is consistent on building powerful brands, creating the value with our customer relationships, and also a high-performing system that is capable of working together to serve our customers and consumers. And I'm happy also to point out that in the third quarter, as the industry returned to more rational pricing, CCNA, our North American operation in U.S. Coca-Cola USA, gained value share in total NARTD and volume and value share in the sparkling as well as still categories. So when you look back at, say, some of the media reports back in the middle of 2008, say June, July 2008, one of the priorities I outlined at that time, if you look into the clippings and go back into recent history, I said it is to stabilize and return to sustainable growth on North American operations. I think that in no way are we declaring victory, we're in the process of stabilizing, as you can see from the numbers. And we're cautiously confident that even in the depths of the most severe crisis that we've recently had in the last couple of years in North America, and the U.S. consumer is still confused by the way, that we are -- our investments are paying off, our alignment with our bottling partners is paying off. And now I think we can accelerate that with this historic transaction. So I'm particularly pleased that, as we've gone into this transaction, at the end of this past quarter, that we go into that transaction from a point of strength, from a position of strength. And as I said, the transaction will further enable us to accelerate our momentum, I believe."

We believe in the future of the Philippines consumer as well as the Philippines in total as a country. And I think we're excited what the future offers in the Philippines. As far as transactions are concerned, at the end of the day, you've got to remember that consumers don't buy unit cases, they buy transactions, packages at certain price points. And I think it's really -- that's why it's so important for us to track the consumer behavior patterns of consumption in different channels on a transaction basis. And I think that we're certainly seeing the benefit of tracking that metric in the United States, especially as we have offered more choices as part of our brand price pack channel architecture in the United States.

They'll go into the crisis quicker and deeper, and they'll come out of the crisis quicker and deeper, and we're seeing an exact play of that happening. And I think that Russia over the next sort of three-year period, they will normalize to growth rates of sort of double digits, I think, as we move forward. But again, you'll see some volatility in Russia play out over the next three years. But I think a more gradual return to a high single-digit and double-digit growth rate. As far as Mexico is concerned, you asked the question, I think during this quarter, Mexico and certain regions of northern South America, the northern part of South America suffered from very unusual high rainfalls, which were in fact in some cases in Mexico, particularly, severe enough to disrupt distribution over some prolonged period. And of course, also this past quarter again, remind you, that Mexico was typing 9% growth in the prior year. I've said I think in the call earlier, that we believe that Mexico will return to more normalized rate of growth that we've seen in the past periods over the last two, three years. And I think Japan certainly benefited from the extraordinarily positive weather, lack of rainfall and also very high sustained temperatures during the key summer months, July, August. I think that Japan -- but again, not all of the growth was related to that. Some of the programs, we're really getting traction, especially in the Kanto region in Tomei, as well as Coca-Cola Bottlers Tokyo and also some of the other outlying, like Coca-Cola Central Japan. And therefore, I think Japan, we should see Japan, despite the very challenging consumer landscape deflationary environment, should return to more of an even 1% to 2% growth rate normalized over the coming period."

All I can tell you, Judy, is that I think in this past quarter, net revenues for the quarter increased 2%, which reflected a 2% increase in our concentrated sales and a positive price mix, which sort of rounded to even, which was partially offset by a deconsolidation of certain entities due to a change in our accounting guidance. And I'll have Gary comment on this too. But I think it's really important that price mix will gradually strengthen, I believe, in the United States as both sparkling and still portfolios grow, and as we get traction in terms of a more nimble and faster system in the United States as we transform our business and reap the benefits of successful integration. But it's really important to note that -- it is personally very pleasing for me that we can lead into this transaction with two consecutive quarters of growth and also, importantly, this growth is balanced. And that you've got like trademark Coca-Cola year-to-date on an even basis compared to say -3 for the first three quarters of prior year, and Coke Zero is still doing very well in double-digit growth. And so I think -- and then our still beverage strategy is really working very well, with total still beverages up 8%, on a year-to-date basis up 5%. And that's a derivative of our success in both the juice segment as well as sports drink, as I mentioned, energy, tea, all working together, coming together to generate this balanced growth in the United States. And I think, again, you can expect the price mix to gradually strengthen, but it's really important that we continue to invest in our brands and in our infrastructure in North America. And that's effective marketing is paying dividends. The strength of our brands are paying dividends. And especially in this third quarter, this past third quarter where there was price rationalization in the industry, that we could still generate 2% organic growth was particularly encouraging.

And I think it's one of the things, together with I think very successful marketing programs, that is driving those brand preference scores. So this is one of those examples where North America went down over a long period of time and it's going to take us some time to really get it back, but I'm really optimistic and confident because of where we're starting from right now."

We grew our quarterly volume a solid 5%, also ahead of our long-term growth target, fueled by organic unit case volume growth across both North America and our international operations. We increased net revenues a healthy 8% on a comparable currency neutral basis in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date comparable currency neutral revenues to 5%. This is in line with our long-term growth target. And once again, we generated significant cash from our operations, with cash flow up 15% year-to-date.
Now I will share our performance results in more detail across our markets starting with our flagship market. North America volume grew 2% this quarter, the second consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. On a year-to-date basis, our North America business is now up 1%. These results are due to the continued successful execution of our well-defined brand, pack and price strategy focused on driving profitable growth. Our sparkling beverages in North America grew volume and value share both against a total category, as well as versus our primary competitor. And to be clear, when we speak about share swing gains versus our primary competitor in North America, we refer to our performance across all channels, not just measured channels, which represent less than 40% of our North America business. 
Brand Coca-Cola health measures keep improving as we increase our favorite brand score versus our primary competitor amongst the most critical consumer segments. At the same time, Coca-Cola Zero delivered double-digit volume growth for the 18th consecutive quarter. Brand Sprite had a second consecutive quarter of positive growth and is now positive on a year-to-date basis. And Fanta had its strongest quarter of the year, growing 4%. We further extended the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser, which is on track to be in 15 markets by the end of this year, providing a greater choice of brands to our customers and our consumers. This all reaffirms our confidence that we are executing the right strategies with our bottling partners to drive growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio.
Turning to North America still beverages, these also continue to accelerate, up a strong 8% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. We have now grown volume share for 11 of the past 13 quarters and value share for 12 of the last 13 quarters. Our North America juice and juice drink business delivered positive growth for the quarter, led once again by double-digit growth from our Simply trademark. Our North America energy portfolio also accelerated this quarter, up 15%, including double-digit growth by NOS. 
In the North America tea category, our Gold Peak brand delivered double-digit growth in both its bottled can and food service delivery forms. I also would like to highlight how our North America still beverage portfolio works in concert to generate value. First, our glacéau brands were up mid-single digit this quarter in North America, continuing a year-long trend of sequential improvement. Secondly, POWERade was up over 30% in the quarter, outperforming the North America sports drink category while gaining share against our primary competitor for the eighth consecutive quarter. This performance is not a new turn of events or simply due to price discounting, but rather the result of implementing a clear, consistent and competitively sustainable strategy focused on innovation, consumer engagement as well as brand building.
In fact, since acquiring glacéau, in mid-2007, our joint glacéau and POWERade businesses have gained more than seven points of volume share swing against our primary competitors' combined sports drink and functional hydration offerings. This is the power of valuable brands and strong system execution working together in the marketplace.
Now as we begin to benefit from our acquisition of CCE's North America business, we have an important opportunity to take our execution across our entire North America portfolio to the next level. As we have consistently said, we have the right long-term strategies in place in our flagship market and we are confident that we are well-positioned for the next era of winning.
Now let me turn to Eurasia and Africa, an operating group consisting of nine business units, with 89 countries spanning from Africa through the Middle East and India, up to Russia. This group grew 12% volume in the third quarter with strong performance across both sparkling and still beverages. Year-to-date growth now stands at 11%. All nine business units in Eurasia and Africa grew this quarter, with countries representing more than half of the group's volume, increasing by double digits. This broad-based growth was led by Russia, up 30% this quarter and 13% year-to-date. We outgrew our primary international competitor in Russia this quarter. Importantly, this high-quality growth was led by the strong performance of our core sparkling brand, which drove almost half of this quarter's absolute volume growth. In fact, brand Coca-Cola, the single largest non-alcoholic RTD brand in Russia, was up 34% this past quarter, gaining both volume and value share. 
We're also making steady progress in the Russia juice market. The integration of our Multon juice business, which began this past quarter, is advancing as planned. And this quarter, we also acquired Nidan, a leading juice brand in Russia. This transaction will enable us to further expand our juice offerings in this important market. We also grew double digits this quarter in Turkey, Southern Eurasia, complementing high single-digit growth in the Middle East. India, meanwhile, achieved its 17th consecutive quarter of growth despite facing record rainfall during this summer's monsoon season, and cycling 37% growth in the comparable 2009 period.
Importantly, India captured share in both sparkling and still beverages. And on a year-to-date basis, we have grown trademark Coca-Cola 18% in India while our Maaza juice brand is up 24%, demonstrating the broad base strength of our portfolio in this critical market. Our commitment to India is unwavering. Last month, we announced plans to invest up to $120 million in a new plant in Southern India and we are excited about the significant and sustainable opportunities this region has to offer over the long term.
Another continent we're excited about and keep investing in heavily is Africa. Over the past 10 years, our system has invested more than $5 billion in the African continent, and we plan to invest in another $12 billion as a system in the next decade. As for this quarter's performance in Africa, we saw double-digit growth in East and Central Africa and mid-single-digit growth in North and West Africa. South Africa delivered 6% unit case volume growth, benefiting both from the momentum generated by our FIFA World Cup activation program, as well as our ongoing work to improve our route-to-market and small-store-activation capabilities in this key market.
Moving to our Pacific Group, overall volume growth was up 11% in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date volume growth to 8%. These results were supported by a return to double-digit growth in China, up 12% in the third quarter. China captured volume and value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. Our sparkling beverages grew high single digits in China, led by the strong performance of both brand Coca-Cola and Sprite, with Sprite remaining the number one sparkling brand in China for the 14th consecutive quarter. Our still beverages in China were up a strong double digits, led by the continued momentum of our Minute Maid Pulpy brands. 
We are one of only a few true multi-category beverage players in Russia (sic) [China], twice as large and growing faster than our primary international competitor. And while we are pleased to report such good results this quarter, our focus in China is primarily on building our business with great brands across multiple categories to drive strong performance over time. The measure of our success in this country will be how we grow our total business between now and 2020. We are confident we have the right strategies in place to deliver sustainable double-digit growth in China over the long term.
We were also pleased to see Japan return to growth, up a very strong 11% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date. While this quarter's volume growth was our highest in Japan in over a decade, we recognize that, along with the rest of the beverage industry, our business benefited from record high temperatures this summer. With that said, our brand portfolio gained further traction with the Japanese consumer. For example, Coca-Cola trademark was up 11% this quarter, a third consecutive quarter of positive growth, driven by effective and exciting summer marketing programs and successful FIFA World Cup activation. And our water business in Japan also drove profitable growth with this summer's launch of a I LOHAS MIKAN, a new Mandarin orange flavored water, extending the presence of our industry leading and eco-friendly single-serve I LOHAS brand. Despite the success we have so far had in Japan this year, it is important to point out that economic headwinds remain challenging for the time being.
As for the Philippines, we delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with Coca-Cola trademark growing 12% and still beverages up 20%, supported by strong gains in tea, juices and juice drinks, as well as water. We also announced our commitment to increase our investments in this critical country by $1 billion over five years as we remain focused on investing ahead of demand.
Moving now to Latin America. For the quarter, volume grew a steady 4%, gaining share in total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Despite adverse weather conditions in Mexico, Colombia and most of Central America. Brand Coca-Cola was also up 4% for the quarter. Brazil delivered very strong results with volume up 13% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. This also marked the third consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in total non-alcoholic beverages. Mexico volume was even for the quarter, cycling 9% growth from last year and impacted by heavy rain during the summer season. Mexico has now gained total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume share for 14 of the last 15 quarters and value share for 15 consecutive quarters. We are confident that Mexico will return to normalized growth over the balance of the year. Lastly, our South Latin region, which includes Argentina and Chile, delivered solid mid-single-digit growth.
Moving to Europe, we still see customers and consumers pressured by the difficult economic conditions impacting various countries in this geography. For the quarter, our volume was slightly positive, rounding to even versus the prior year. Our performance of sparkling beverages in Europe was lead by trademark Coca-Cola, which is up 1% for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Our still beverages in Europe saw positive growth across categories, including double-digit growth in energy and tea, as well as positive results in both sports drinks and juice and juice drinks. Importantly, our still beverages gained both volume and value share in Europe this past quarter.
We were pleased to realize low- to mid-single-digit growth this quarter across most of our Western European markets, including France, the Nordics and Great Britain. These encouraging results were offset by ongoing economic challenges in south and eastern Europe. In Spain, despite the ongoing economic crisis, our business once again improved its share trends capturing total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage share this quarter. Our Nordics business grew a solid 6% in the quarter. Norway and Sweden have now transitioned to CCE's ownership. 
The move of these bottling operations is consistent with the principles we have always shared regarding our Bottling Investments Group. That is to sell our selected company-owned bottling operations at fair value and at the right time to strategically and financially aligned bottling partners. As we have said many times before, we will only sell a bottling operation when it is a successful and sustainable business. The Norway and Sweden operations are just that. So on behalf of our company, I'd like to personally thank all of our Coca-Cola associates in Norway and Sweden for their great efforts. They are the foundation upon which a strong business was built, and we look forward to partnering with them now that they have joined a new CCE organization.
As for Germany, our remaining European bottling operation, it sustained its momentum, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of positive volume growth.
You've heard me say time and time again that we always put our brands first in everything that we do across each and every one of our operating groups. As a result, our sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter with international sparkling beverage volume up 4%. As for Coca-Cola Zero, it continues to be one of the fastest-growing global sparkling beverages in the world. Earlier, I referenced Coke Zero's uninterrupted string of success in the North America market. This momentum extends around the world, with the brand up 6% in international markets on a year-to-date basis.
We are also successfully expanding our still beverage portfolio with total still beverage unit case volume increasing by 11% in the quarter, lead by double-digit growth in sports drinks and water as well as high single-digit growth in juices and juice drinks. I mentioned before how POWERade has been the growth leader of the sports drink category in North America. But this brand's success story is also a global one. POWERade has almost doubled its global share since 2000 and this momentum extended into the third quarter, supported by the flawless execution of POWERade's global FIFA World Cup campaign across 34 markets.
In summary, the sound results across our operations and the balanced growth across our sparkling and still beverages are a testament to our seasoned operating team and global franchise partners. Together, we are executing our 2020 Vision in a disciplined, aligned and decisive manner. We are growing our business while holding a more than three-to-one volume and value share advantage internationally over our primary global competitor. And while we grow our business, the strength of our flagship brand is only getting stronger. This past quarter alone, Coca-Cola was named South Africa's top brand by the Sunday Times, and Coca-Cola retained its number one ranking in Interbrand's rankings of the Best Global Brands for the 11th consecutive year.
Despite these recognitions, we can assure you that we are not content. In fact, we remain constructively discontent. We realize and appreciate that many near-term challenges remain with our consumers and customers around the world. So as we further build our business momentum across the world, we are also committed to building a better tomorrow. One way we are doing this is by delivering on our promise to be the global leader in sustainable water use and the industry leader in packaging, energy and climate protection.
This past quarter, our PlantBottle package and new, redesigned PET plastic bottle made partially from plants won a Greener Package Award, reaffirming our position as a sustainable packaging leader and representing yet another step in our journey to create the bottle of the future.
Since making its debut in Denmark in December 2009, our PlantBottle package has rolled out in a variety of sizes across our sparkling and still beverage portfolio. By the end of this year, we will have 2.5 billion PlantBottle packages in the market and we expect to double this number in 2011. The presence of these packages this year alone is equivalent to eliminating almost 30,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, CO2, and approximately 70,000 barrels of oil. So our commitment to lead in climate protection is one we have worked on diligently for years. We made a public commitment in 2008 that we would place an additional 100,000 HFC-free coolers in the marketplace by the end of 2010. I am pleased to report that, together with our bottling partners, we have fulfilled this commitment five months ahead of schedule, having placed our 100,000th incremental HFC-free unit in the marketplace this past quarter, bringing our total number of HFC-free coolers in the marketplace to 220,000 units.
Another way we are building a better tomorrow is by partnering with our communities. A great example of this is our recent launch of Project Nurture in Kenya. This is a mango and passion fruit and juice sourcing partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Through this creative initiative we are helping develop local food sourcing farms to support our expanding juice businesses around the world. Equally important, we are improving the incomes of more than 50,000 fruit farmers in Kenya and Uganda. 
We're also building for a better tomorrow by putting our people first. In fact, I spend as much time developing our management team and talent as I do leading our business. Our people are the absolute key competitive advantage and enabler to achieving our 2020 Vision. The real opportunity in developing our people is finding leaders with a global mindset and experience who can effectively lead a multinational, multicultural, multilingual team of associates and bottling partners. To do this, we have a consistent set of criteria we apply when it comes to talent management, seeking leaders with a breadth of experience and perspective who can think beyond their geography and also operate in different and dynamic environments.
In the end, our reputation attracts and retains talent, but we cannot rely on this as our only strategy. Just as we continue to focus on building our brands, we're also investing in our brand as a 21st century employer. Which is why I was pleased to see us receive such a high-ranking on Universum's Second Annual Survey to identify the World's Most Attractive Employers. The 2010 survey was based on data from nearly 130,000 college students all around the world. The Coca-Cola Company moved up five spots since 2009 to number eight in the world according to the surveyed business students, number two amongst consumer goods companies and the only beverage company ranked in the top 20.
Let me close by saying that we are confident in our system's stability to win together, aligned and focused on executing against our consistent growth strategies to achieve our 2020 Vision. Despite facing extended economic headwinds, we're on course to deliver on our commitment to grow volume, revenue, share and profits in 2010. The integration of our North America business is fully underway and well on track. We have created the right operational structure, which will accelerate our ability to make agile, strategic decisions to build on our strong momentum in this marketplace.
As we look ahead, we see a world that is yearning not just for the beverages provided by The Coca-Cola Company, but also for the values and ideals that our brand represents. Values and ideals like community, like fun, happiness and the hope for a better tomorrow. This is what inspires a strong and unyielding belief in the growth of our company and our system as well as the long-term value it can create for our shareholders. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary."

As Muhtar said, we once again delivered a quarter of consistent quality volume and profit growth.

As Muhtar said, we once again delivered a quarter of consistent quality volume and profit growth. Our volume revenue and profit results all came in ahead of our long-term growth targets this quarter, reaffirming that our highly capable leadership team is executing the right strategic plans with our bottling partners to achieve our sustainable long-term goals. These results demonstrate that we are building on our 2010 momentum and advancing our 2020 Vision.
As outlined in our release, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.92, up 12% versus the prior year. For the quarter, our business delivered strong comparable net revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, driven by a 7% increase in concentrate sale and 1% positive price mix impact. Our comparable operating income was up a strong 14%, bringing our year-to-date comparable growth to 15%. While currency had a minimal impact on operating income this quarter, we've had a 4% positive impact year-to-date. Further, our comparable gross profit increased 10%, with year-to-date gross profit up 9%. Again, currency had a minimal impact on gross profit in the quarter but has had a 2% positive impact year-to-date. As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 15% year-to-date, to $7.2 billion. This growth was primarily driven by our improved performance, including the effects of currency.
Now let me go through some detail around our quarterly results and year-to-date performance. Our sequential improvement in price mix was in line with our expectations, with the ongoing impact of geographic mix more than offset by our positive global revenue growth management strategies. This improvement brings our year-to-date price mix results to even versus the prior year, fully consistent with our expectations shared in previous earnings calls. As we've communicated before, we expect our price mix to remain even for the full year. Our comparable currency neutral cost of goods was up 3% for the quarter and is now up 1% year-to-date, fully in line with our communications in previous quarterly calls, when we said that we expected our cost of goods to grow in a low single-digit range for the full year.
Comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 8% in the quarter and up 3% year-to-date, reflecting increased levels of marketing spend, driven by the cycling of low marketing expenses during the same period last year, which we anticipated and also outlined for you in our last quarterly call.
As for our total marketing spend, including both our direct and point-of-sale marketing, this continues to be positive on a year-to-date basis as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth. For this quarter, we captured four percentage points of operating expense leverage. This was a little better than our expectation for the full year that I mentioned last quarter and was driven by greater top line profit growth, continued strong focus on cost management and the benefits of our productivity initiatives. Importantly, this underscores the unique strength of our global system, a system able to simultaneously run highly effective and efficient operations while driving solid top line results. Going forward, we now expect our full year 2010 operating expense leverage to come in at the low- to mid-single-digit range.  Lastly, the lowering of our year-to-date effective tax rate from 23.2% to 23% benefited our earnings per share by a little less than $0.01.
Now let me take the minute to highlight a few additional factors we see in the fourth quarter of this year. First, I want to remind you that, as highlighted in our previous quarterly calls, our comparable results for 2010 reflect the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities, primarily bottling operations, due to new accounting guidance that became effective the beginning of this year as per FASB requirements. We've now reflected the appropriate changes within our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules to provide a comparable income statement for external modeling purposes and have posted a schedule in the Investors section of our website that takes into account this change in accounting guidance to assist you in adjusting prior year results.
Secondly, as per my earlier remarks, currency had a minimal impact on our comparable results this quarter. As such and as we've communicated in our prior quarterly calls, we believe that currency will have a slightly positive impact on operating income on a full year basis, with this benefit weighted toward the first half of 2010. We expect currency to have a minimal to low single-digit negative impact on operating income in the fourth quarter. 
Looking forward, while we don't expect to see a repeat of the currency volatility we saw in early 2009, and earlier this year, we would expect some further volatility going forward as economies emerge from the global recession differently. Please note that we routinely monitor our exposure to currency, actively hedge hard currencies such as the euro and yen, and proactively balance our coverage as appropriate. We'll keep doing so in this environment in line with our long-term hedging strategies and we'll keep you updated on our hedging activities. Importantly, we will keep managing and investing in our business at the local market level and in local currencies to drive long-term growth and increase the consumption of our brands. 
On productivity, we're well on track and on plan to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end of 2011. Lastly, with regards to our share repurchase program, we were out of the market pending the close of our transaction with Coca-Cola Enterprises. With this transaction now closed, we're in the process of reentering the market and now expect to repurchase approximately $2 billion of shares by the end of 2010.
While on the subject of CCE, let me share a few items regarding the transaction. First, the deal closed on October 2, 2010, which was the first day of our fourth quarter. While this transaction was structured as primarily cashless, under the terms of the deal, we agreed to make a cash payment to CCE in the event that the actual debt assumed upon acquisition was less than the previously agreed upon amount. Therefore, in anticipation of closing the transaction, a cash consideration of $1.3 billion was paid to CCE, substantially related to the debt level assumed. This payment was made on October 1, the last day of our third quarter. Concurrently and as expected, we also received about $900 million in cash from CCE for the sale of our Norway and Sweden bottling operations. Both of these transactions are reflected in the quarter's cash flow statement and the balance sheet.
As for the recurring results we report today, these were not impacted by the CCE transaction. When we report our fourth quarter and full year results, these will be the first to fully reflect the incorporation of CCE's North American business as well as the divestiture of our Norway and Sweden bottling operations.
Secondly, when we announce our fourth quarter and full-year results, we will continue to detail our results by our five existing geographic operating groups, with the North American operating group fully incorporating our newly constituted Coca-Cola Refreshments and Coca-Cola North America organizations.
Finally, with regard to synergies, as we have announced previously and reiterated in our earnings release today, we continue to expect synergies up at least $350 million per year, phased in over the next four years. We know that many of you are looking for additional modeling information regarding our newly integrated North American business. Please note that before the end of this year, we intend to share with you further details regarding our capital and debt structure plans, as well as the impact of other items regarding the modeling of our new North American operations. 
In conclusion, we delivered strong volume growth and high-quality profit growth through the first three quarters of this year. Both our operating income and earnings per share growth rates are ahead of our long-term growth targets on an ongoing currency neutral basis. Our revenue growth has sequentially improved over the course of the year and is now fully in line with our long-term growth targets.  All of this is a testament to our seasoned management team's ability to effectively manage and execute our strategies within a challenging market environment. Together with our global bottling partners, we are maintaining our disciplined investment strategies and executing the right actions to drive our business for both today and tomorrow. As such, we remain confident that we will keep enhancing the health of our brands and, importantly, drive long-term profitable growth and value for our shareholders.

Volume grew 2%, second consecutive quarter of positive and, I highlight, organic growth and year-to-date volume growth was 1%. And I think if you sort of double click and dig down for the quarter, total sparkling was even trademark. And then for the year to date, when you look at like trademark Coca-Cola on the year-to-date basis is even versus -3 for the same three quarters of prior years. So one of the things that is continuing to drive this is our success in our brand price pack channel architecture, that we have talked about for a number of quarters, that we're implementing. I think another one is our continued strength in our brands. We continue to invest in our brands and it's paying off. Coca-Cola remains the number one favorite brand and has widened that lead over its nearest competitor. Ratio is now 1.6:1 versus 1.4:1 in year-to-date 2008, for example. Favorite brand scores are again up, Coke Zero favorite band scores continue to grow at a significant rate. So all of that is paying off. And I think its important that we have a strategic focus that is consistent on building powerful brands, creating the value with our customer relationships, and also a high-performing system that is capable of working together to serve our customers and consumers. And I'm happy also to point out that in the third quarter, as the industry returned to more rational pricing, CCNA, our North American operation in U.S. Coca-Cola USA, gained value share in total NARTD and volume and value share in the sparkling as well as still categories. So when you look back at, say, some of the media reports back in the middle of 2008, say June, July 2008, one of the priorities I outlined at that time, if you look into the clippings and go back into recent history, I said it is to stabilize and return to sustainable growth on North American operations. I think that in no way are we declaring victory, we're in the process of stabilizing, as you can see from the numbers. And we're cautiously confident that even in the depths of the most severe crisis that we've recently had in the last couple of years in North America, and the U.S. consumer is still confused by the way, that we are -- our investments are paying off, our alignment with our bottling partners is paying off. And now I think we can accelerate that with this historic transaction. So I'm particularly pleased that, as we've gone into this transaction, at the end of this past quarter, that we go into that transaction from a point of strength, from a position of strength. And as I said, the transaction will further enable us to accelerate our momentum, I believe."

The BIG team, Bottling Investment Group team, led by Irial and his associates, I think have done a good job in stabilizing the business first in the Philippines, and now we're returning it to sustainable growth. Coca-Cola grew 12% in the quarter due to an emphasis on multi-serve packages to protect our Coke with meals, Heartland, and I think our still beverages grew 20%. We've also recently announced our commitment to the Philippines to increase our investments to the tune of about $1 billion over the next five years, and I think that again tells you that we believe in the future of the Philippines. We believe in the future of the Philippines consumer as well as the Philippines in total as a country. And I think we're excited what the future offers in the Philippines. As far as transactions are concerned, at the end of the day, you've got to remember that consumers don't buy unit cases, they buy transactions, packages at certain price points. And I think it's really -- that's why it's so important for us to track the consumer behavior patterns of consumption in different channels on a transaction basis. And I think that we're certainly seeing the benefit of tracking that metric in the United States, especially as we have offered more choices as part of our brand price pack channel architecture in the United States. That's working well, and you will continue to see a focus on that metric as we widen it across the world."

But again, you'll see some volatility in Russia play out over the next three years. But I think a more gradual return to a high single-digit and double-digit growth rate. As far as Mexico is concerned, you asked the question, I think during this quarter, Mexico and certain regions of northern South America, the northern part of South America suffered from very unusual high rainfalls, which were in fact in some cases in Mexico, particularly, severe enough to disrupt distribution over some prolonged period. And of course, also this past quarter again, remind you, that Mexico was typing 9% growth in the prior year. I've said I think in the call earlier, that we believe that Mexico will return to more normalized rate of growth that we've seen in the past periods over the last two, three years. And I think Japan certainly benefited from the extraordinarily positive weather, lack of rainfall and also very high sustained temperatures during the key summer months, July, August. I think that Japan -- but again, not all of the growth was related to that. Some of the programs, we're really getting traction, especially in the Kanto region in Tomei, as well as Coca-Cola Bottlers Tokyo and also some of the other outlying, like Coca-Cola Central Japan. And therefore, I think Japan, we should see Japan, despite the very challenging consumer landscape deflationary environment, should return to more of an even 1% to 2% growth rate normalized over the coming period."

And I'll have Gary comment on this too. But I think it's really important that price mix will gradually strengthen, I believe, in the United States as both sparkling and still portfolios grow, and as we get traction in terms of a more nimble and faster system in the United States as we transform our business and reap the benefits of successful integration. But it's really important to note that -- it is personally very pleasing for me that we can lead into this transaction with two consecutive quarters of growth and also, importantly, this growth is balanced. And that you've got like trademark Coca-Cola year-to-date on an even basis compared to say -3 for the first three quarters of prior year, and Coke Zero is still doing very well in double-digit growth. And so I think -- and then our still beverage strategy is really working very well, with total still beverages up 8%, on a year-to-date basis up 5%. And that's a derivative of our success in both the juice segment as well as sports drink, as I mentioned, energy, tea, all working together, coming together to generate this balanced growth in the United States. And I think, again, you can expect the price mix to gradually strengthen, but it's really important that we continue to invest in our brands and in our infrastructure in North America. And that's effective marketing is paying dividends. The strength of our brands are paying dividends.

We're just continuing to execute, and I think you're seeing a lot of volatility and international markets on both currency and on commodities. Commodity's somewhat driven by vagaries in the weather but also driven by volatility in currencies, as you know, because commodities are priced in U.S. dollars. So we're looking at all of that. And we've seen this movie before, and we'll certainly take appropriate measures to make sure that our business remains in health. So with that, in closing, I'd like to just say that we had a strong third quarter and we remain on course to grow volume, revenue, share and profits in 2010. The integration of our North America business is on track and our new operational structure in North America will accelerate our ability to build on our momentum in this marketplace. So as we look ahead we see tremendous opportunity for The Coca-Cola Company in all of our markets and geographies. We remain intently focused on working with our capable system partners to build our brand, execute our strategic priorities and drive long-term sustainable growth and value for our shareholders.

First, let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. We successfully completed our acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises, North America business, and the sale of our Norway Sweden bottling operations to CCE, on plan and in line with our commitments and we close this transaction on the heels of executing a strong quarter.
We continue to build on our momentum, delivering solid volume revenue and profit growth this quarter with our results exceeding all of our long-term targets and generating sustainable value for our shareowners.
This quarter, once again underscores how we are advancing our 2020 vision from a position of strength as we enter a new era of growth for the Coca-Cola Company. Together in close alignment with our global bottling partners, we are executing with excellence around the world. Our strategies, our brands, our marketing, our innovation, our partnerships and our people are defining new growth opportunities today, and shaping our system vision for this decade.
Our brand equity is growing stronger around the world as evidenced by a measurable increase in consumer preference for our brands this quarter as well as more potent global growth for our flagship brand Coca-Cola on a year-to-date basis.
We are now intensely focused on driving a fast and seamless integration in our North America operations, and this evolution of our franchise system is an important milestone in realizing our 2020 vision, strengthening our commitments to best serve our customers and our consumers and facilitating our ability to achieve sustainable and profitable growth in our flagship market.
Turning to our current results, this quarter’s comparable currency neutral operating income growth was 14% ahead of our long-term growth target. We grew our quarterly volume a solid 5% also ahead of our long-term growth target fueled by organic unit case volume growth across both North America and our international operations.
We increase net revenues a healthy 8% on a comparable currency neutral basis in the quarter bringing our year-to-date comparable currency neutral revenues to 5%. This is in line with our long-term growth target. And once again we generated significant cash from our operations with cash flow up 15% year-to-date.
Now, I will share our performance results in more detail across our market starting with our flagship market. North America volume grew 2% this quarter, the second consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. On a year-to-date basis, our North America business is now up 1%. These results are due to the continued successful execution of our well-defined brand pack and price strategy focus on driving profitable growth.
Our sparkling beverages in North America grew volume and value share, both against the total category as well as versus our primary competitor. And to be clear, when we speak about share swing gains versus our primary competitor in North America, we refer to our performance across all channels, not just measured channels, which represents less than 40% of our North America business.
Brand Coca-Cola health measures keep improving as we increased our favorite brand score versus our primary competitor amongst the most critical consumer segments. At the same time, Coca-Cola Zero delivered double-digit volume growth for the 18th consecutive quarter. Band Sprite had the second consecutive quarter of positive growth, and is now positive on a year-to-date basis and Fanta had its strongest quarter of the year growing 4%.
We further extended the footprint of our innovative Coca-Cola Freestyle Fountain Dispenser, which is on track to be in 15 markets by the end of this year providing a greater choice of brands to our customers and our consumers. This all reaffirms our confidence that we are executing the right strategies with our bottling partners to drive growth across our entire North America sparkling beverage portfolio.
Turning to North America still beverages, these also continue to accelerate up a strong 8% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. We have now grown volume share for 11 of the past 13 quarters and value share for 12 of the last 13 quarters.
Our North America juice and juice drink business delivered positive growth for the quarter, led once again by double-digit growth from our Simply trademark. Our North America energy portfolio also accelerated this quarter up 15% including double-digit growth by NOS.
In the North America tea category, our Gold Peak brand delivered double-digit growth in both its bottle can and food service delivery forms. I also would like to highlight how our North America still beverage portfolio works in concert to generate value. First our Glaceau brands were up mid-single digit this quarter in North America continuing a yearlong trend of sequential improvement. Secondly, Powerade was up over 30% in the quarter outperforming the North America sports drink category while gaining share against our primary competitor for the eighth consecutive quarter.
This performance is not a new turn of events or simply due to price discounting, but rather the results of implementing a clear, consistent and competitively sustainable strategy focused on innovation, consumer engagement as well as brand building.
In fact, since acquiring Glaceau in mid-2007, our joint Glaceau and Powerade businesses have gained more than seven points of volume share swing against our primary competitors combined sports drink and functional hydration offerings. This is the power of valuable brands and strong system execution working together in the marketplace.
Now, as we begin to benefit from our acquisition of CCE’s North America business, we have an important opportunity to take our execution across our entire North America portfolio to the next level. As we have consistently said, we have the right long-term strategy in place in our flagship market, and we are confident that we are well positioned for the next era of winning.
Now, let me turn to Eurasia and Africa, an operating group consisting of nine business units with 89 countries spanning from Africa through the Middle East and India up to Russia. This group grew 12% volume in the third quarter with strong performance across both sparkling and still beverages. Year-to-date growth now stands at 11%. All nine business units in Eurasia and Africa grew this quarter with countries representing more than half of the group’s volume increasing by double digits.
This broad-base growth was led by Russia up 30% this quarter and 13% year-to-date. We outgrew our primary international competitor in Russia this quarter. Importantly, this high quality growth was led by the strong performance of our core sparkling brand, which drove almost half of this quarter’s absolute volume growth. In fact, brand Coca-Cola, the single largest nonalcoholic RTD brand in Russia was up 34% this past quarter, gaining both volume and value share.
We are also making steady progress in the Russia juice market, the integration of our Multon juice business, which began this past quarter, is advancing as planned. And this quarter we also acquired Nidan a leading juice brand in Russia. This transaction will enable us to further expand our juice offerings in this important market.
We also grew double digits this quarter in Turkey, Southern Eurasia complementing high single-digit growth in the Middle East. India meanwhile achieved its 17th consecutive quarter of growth despite facing record rainfall during this summer’s monsoon season and cycling 37% growth in the comparable 2009 period. Importantly, India captured share in both sparkling and still beverages. And on a year-to-date basis we have grown Trademark Coca-Cola 18% in India while our Maaza juice brand is up 24% demonstrating the broad-base strength of our portfolio in this critical market.
Our commitment to India is unwavering. Last month, we announced plans to invest up to $120 million in a new plant in southern India and we are excited about the significant and sustainable opportunities this region has to offer over the long term.
Another continent we are excited about and keep investing in heavily is Africa. Over the past 10 years, our system has invested more than $5 billion in the African continent and we plan to invest another $12 billion as a system in the next decade. As for this quarter’s performance in Africa, we saw double-digit growth in east and central Africa and mid-single-digit growth in north and West Africa.
South Africa delivered 6% unit case volume growth benefiting both from the momentum generated by our FIFA World Cup activation programs as well as our ongoing work to improve our relative market and small store activation capabilities in this key markets.
Moving to our Pacific group, overall volume growth was up 11% in the third quarter bringing our year-to-date volume growth to 8%. These results were supported by a return to double-digit growth in China up 12% in the third quarter. China captured volume and value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages.
Our sparkling beverages grew high single digits in China led by the strong performance of both brand Coca-Cola and Sprite with Sprite remaining the number one sparkling brand in China for the 14th consecutive quarter. Our still beverages in China were up as strong double digits led by the continued momentum of our Minute Maid Pulpy brand.
We are one of only a few true multi-category beverage players in Russia, twice as large and growing faster than our primary international competitor. And while we are pleased to report such good results this quarter, our focus in China is primarily on building our business with great brands across multiple categories to drive strong performance over time.
The measure of our success in this country will be how we grow our total business between now and 2020. We are confident we have the right strategies in place to deliver sustainable double-digit growth in China over the long term.
We were also pleased to see Japan return to growth up a very strong 11% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date. While this quarter’s volume growth was our highest in Japan in over a decade, we recognize that along with the rest of the beverage industry our business benefited from record high temperatures this summer. That said, our brand portfolio gained further traction with the Japanese consumer.
For example, Coca-Cola Trademark was up 11% this quarter, a third consecutive quarter of positive growth driven by effective and exciting summer marketing program and successful FIFA World Cup activation. And our water business in Japan also drove profitable growth with this summer’s launch of I LOHAS Mikan, a new mandarin orange flavored water extending the presence of our industry leading and eco-friendly single served I LOHAS brand.
Despite the success we have so far had in Japan this year, it is important to point out that economic headwinds remain challenging for the time being. As for the Philippines, we delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with Coca-Cola Trademark growing 12% and still beverages up 20% supported by strong gains in tea, juices and juice drinks as well as water.
We also announce our commitment to increase our investments in this critical country by $1 billion over five years as we remain focused on investing ahead of demand. Moving now to Latin America where the quarter volume grew a steady 4% gaining share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, despite adverse weather conditions in Mexico, Columbia and most of Central America. Brand Coca-Cola was also up 4% for the quarter.
Brazil delivered very strong results with volume of 13% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. This also marked the third consecutive quarter that Brazil has gained volume and value share in total nonalcoholic beverages.
Mexico volume was even for the quarter cycling 9% growth from last year and impacted by heavy rain during the summer season. Mexico has now gained total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume share for 14 of the last 15 quarters and value share for 15 consecutive quarters. We are confident that Mexico will return to normalized growth over the balance of the year. Lastly, our Latin, South Latin region which includes Argentina and Chile delivered solid mid-single-digit growth.
Moving to Europe, we still see customers and consumers pressured by the difficult economic conditions impacting various countries in this geography. For the quarter, our volume was slightly positive rounding to even versus the prior year. Our performance in sparkling beverages in Europe was led by Trademark Coca-Cola which is up 1% for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.
Our still beverages in Europe saw a positive growth across categories including double-digit growth in energy and tea as well as positive results in both sports drinks and juice and juice drinks. Importantly, our still beverages gained both volume and value share in Europe this past quarter.
We were pleased to realize low to mid-single-digit growth this quarter across most of our Western European markets including France, the Nordics and Great Britain. These encouraging results were offset by ongoing economic challenges in South and Eastern Europe.
In Spain, despite the ongoing economic crisis, our business once again improved its share trends capturing total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage share this quarter. Our Nordics business grew a solid 6% in the quarter. Norway and Sweden have now transitioned to CCE’s ownership.
The move of these bottling operations is consistent with the principles we have always shared regarding our bottling investments group. That is to sell our selected company-owned bottling operations at fair value and at the right time to strategically and financially align bottling partners. As we have said many times before, we will only sell our bottling operation when it is a successful and sustainable business.
The Norway and Sweden operations are just that. So, on behalf of our company, I would like to personally thank all of our Coca-Cola associates in Norway and Sweden for their great efforts. They are the foundation upon which a strong business was built and we look forward to partnering with them now that they have joined a new CCE organization.
As for Germany, our remaining European bottling operation, it sustained its momentum delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of positive volume growth.
You have heard me say time and time again that we always put our brands first in everything that we do, across each and every one of our operating groups. As a result, our sparkling beverages grew 3% in the quarter with international sparkling beverage volume up 4%.
As for Coca-Cola Zero, it continues to be one of the fastest growing global sparkling beverages in the world. Earlier, I referenced Coke Zero’s uninterrupted string of success in the North America market. This momentum extends around the world with the brand of 6% in international markets on a year-to-date basis.
We are also successfully expanding our still beverage portfolio with total still beverage unit case volume increasing by 11% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in sports drinks and water as well as high single-digit growth in juices and juice drinks.
I mentioned before how Powerade has been the growth leader of the sports drink category in North America, but this brand success story is also a global one. Powerade has almost doubled its global share since 2000, and this momentum extended into the third quarter supported by the flawless execution of Powerade global FIFA World Cup campaign across 34 markets.
In summary, the sound results across our operations and the balanced growth across our sparkling and still beverages are a testament to our seasoned operating team and global franchise partners. Together, we are executing our 2020 vision in a disciplined, aligned and decisive manner. We are growing our business while holding a more than three to one volume and value share advantage internationally over our primary global competitor.
And while we grow our business, the strength of our flagship brand is only getting stronger. This past quarter alone, Coca-Cola was named South Africa’s top brand by the Sunday Times. And Coca-Cola retained its number one ranking in inter-brands rankings of the best global brands for the 11th consecutive year.
Despite these recognitions, we can assure you that we are not content, in fact we remain constructively discontent. We realize and appreciate that many near-term challenges remain with our consumers and customers around the world.
So as we build, further build our business momentum across the world, we are also committed to building a better tomorrow. When we are doing this is by delivering on our promise to be the global leader in sustainable water use and the industry leader in packaging energy and climate protection.

This past quarter, our PlantBottle package, a newly designed PET plastic bottle made partially from plants, won a Greener Package Award reaffirming our position as a sustainable packaging leader and representing yet another step in our journey to create the bottle of the future.
Since making its debut in Denmark in December 2009, our PlantBottle package has rolled out in a variety of sizes across our sparkling and still beverage portfolio. By the end of this year, we will have 2.5 billion PlantBottle packages in the market and we expect to double this number in 2011.
The presence of these packages this year alone is equivalent to eliminating almost 30,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, CO2, and approximately 70,000 barrels of oil. So, our commitment to lead in climate protection is one we have worked on diligently for years. We made a public commitment in 2008 that we would place an additional 100,000 HFC-free coolers in the marketplace by the end of 2010.
I am pleased to report that together with our bottling partners, we have fulfilled this commitment five months ahead of schedule having placed our 100,000 incremental HFC-free unit in the marketplace this past quarter bringing our total number of HFC-free coolers in the marketplace to 220,000 units.
Another way we are building a better tomorrow is by partnering with our communities. A great example of this is our recent launch of Project Nurture in Kenya. This is a mango and passion fruit and juice sourcing partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Through this creative initiative, we are helping develop local fruit sourcing farms to support our expanding juice businesses around the world.
Equally important, we are improving the incomes of more than 50,000 fruit farmers in Kenya and Uganda. We are also building for a better tomorrow by putting up people first. In fact, I spend as much time developing our management team and talent as I do leading our business. Our people are the absolute key competitive advantage and an enabler to achieving our 2020 vision.
The real opportunity in developing our people is finding leaders with a global mindset and experience who can effectively lead a multinational, multicultural, multilingual team of associates and bottling partners. To do this, we have a consistent set of criteria we apply when it comes to talent management seeking leaders with a breadth of experience and perspective who can think beyond their geography and also operate in different and dynamic environments.
And then, our reputation attracts and retains talent, but we cannot rely on this as our only strategy. Just as we continue to focus on building our brands, we are also investing in our brand as a 21st century employer, which is why I was pleased to see us receive such a high ranking on Universum’s second annual survey to identify the world’s most attractive employers. The 2010 survey was based on data from nearly 130,000 college students all around the world.
The Coca-Cola Company moved up five spots since 2009 to number eight in the world according to the surveyed business students, number two amongst consumer goods companies and only the beverage company ranked in the top 20.
Let me close by saying that we are confident in our systems ability to win together, align and focus on executing against our consistent growth strategies to achieve our 2020 vision.
Despite facing extended economic headwind, we are on course to deliver on our commitment to grow volume, revenue, share and profits in 2010. The integration of our North America business is fully underway and well on track. We have created the right operational structure, which will accelerate our ability to make agile, strategic decisions to build on our strong momentum in this marketplace.
As we look ahead, we see a world that is yearning not just for the beverages provided by The Coca-Cola Company, but also for the values and ideals that our brands represent, values and ideals like community, like fun, happiness and the hope for a better tomorrow. This is what inspires the strong and unyielding belief in the growth of our company and our system as well as the long-term value it can create for our shareowners.
So with that, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary.

As Muhtar said, we once again delivered a quarter of consistent quality, volume and profit growth.

As Muhtar said, we once again delivered a quarter of consistent quality, volume and profit growth. Our volume revenue and profit results all came in ahead of our long-term growth targets this quarter, reaffirming that our highly capable leadership team is executing the right strategic plans with our bottling partners to achieve our sustainable long-term goals.
These results demonstrate that we are building on our 2010 momentum and advancing our 2020 vision. As outlined in our released, we reported comparable earnings per share of $0.92, up 12% versus the prior year. For the quarter, our business delivered strong comparable net revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, driven by a 7% increase in concentrate sales and a 1% positive price mix impact. Our comparable operating income was up a strong 14%, bringing our year-to-date comparable growth to 15%, while currency had a minimal impact on operating income this quarter, it’s had a 4% positive  impact year-to-date. Further our comparable gross profit increased 10% with year-to-date gross profit up 9%, again currency had a minimal impact on gross profit in the quarter but has had a 2% positive impact year-to-date. 
As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 15% year-to-date to $7.2 billion, this growth was primarily driven by our improved performance including the effects of currency. 
Now let me go through some detail around our quarterly results and year-to-date performance. Our sequential improvement in price mix was in line with our expectations with the ongoing impact of geographic mix more than offset by our positive global revenue growth, management strategies. This improvement brings our year-to-date price mix results to even versus a prior year fully consistent with our expectations shared in previous earnings calls. As we communicated before, we expect our price mix to remain even for the full year. 
Our comparable currency neutral costs of goods was up 3% for the quarter and is now up 1% year-to-date fully in lined with our communications in previous quarterly calls when we said that we expected our cost of goods to grow in a low single-digit range for the full year.
Comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 8% in the quarter and up 3% year-to-date reflecting increased levels of marketing expand driven by the cycling of low marketing expenses during the same period last year, which we anticipated and also out lined for you in our last quarterly call.
As far our total market expand including both our direct and point-of-sale marketing, this continuous to be positive on a year-to-date basis as we remain committed to investing in our brands for long-term growth. For this quarter we captured 4% points of operating expense leverage, this was a little better than our expectation for the full year that I mentioned last quarter and was driven by greater top line profit growth continued strong focus on cost management and the benefits of our productivity initiatives.
Importantly this underscores the unique strength of our global system a system able to simultaneously run highly effective and efficient operations while driving solid top line results. Going forward, we now expect our full year 2010 operating expense leverage to command at the low to mid-single-digit range. Lastly the lowering of our year-to-date effective tax rate from 23.2 to 23% benefited our earnings per share by little less than a penny.
Now let me take a minute to highlight a few additional factors we see in the fourth quarter of this year. First I want to remind you that has highlighted in our previous quarterly calls, our comparable result for 2010 reflect the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities primarily bottling operations due to new accounting guidance that became effective the beginning of this year as far past the requirements.
We’ve now reflected the appropriate changes within our GAAP and non-GAAP schedules to provide a comparable income statement for external modeling purposes and it posted to schedule in the investor section of our website that takes into account, this change in accounting guidance to this year and adjusting prior year results.
Secondly as per my earlier remarks, currency had a minimal impact on our comparable results this quarter. As thought and as we communicated in our prior quarterly call, we believe that currency will have a slightly positive impact on operating income on a full year basis with this benefit weighted toward the first half of 2010.
We expect currency to have a minimal to low single-digit negative impact on operating income in the fourth quarter. Looking-forward what we don’t expect to see a repeat of the currency volatility, we saw in early 2009 and earlier this year, we would expect some further volatility going forward as economics are merged from the global recession differently.
Please note that we routinely monitor our exposure to currency actively hedge odd currency such as the Euro and Yen and proactively balance our coverage as appropriate, we’ll keep doing so in this environment in line with our long-term hedging strategies and we’ll keep you updated on our hedging activities. Importantly we will keep managing and investing in our business at the local market level and in local currencies to drive long-term growth and increase the consumption of our brands.
On productivity we are well on track, and on plan to deliver $500 million in annual savings from our initiatives by the end 2011, lastly with regard to our share repurchase program, we were out of the market depending the close of our transaction with Coca-Cola enterprises. With this transaction of close we are in a profit of reentering the market and now expect to repurchase approximately $2 billion of share by the end of 2010.
Well, on the subject to CCE, let me share a few items regarding the transactions. First the deal closed on October 2, 2010 which was the first day of our fourth quarter ,while this transaction was structured as primarily cash list under terms of the deal we agree to make a cash payment to CCE in the advance that the actual debt assumed upon acquisition was less than the previously agreed upon amount.
Therefore, in anticipation of closing the transaction, a cash consideration of $1.3 billion was paid to CCE substantially related to the debt level assumed. This payment was made on October 1st, the last day of our third quarter. Concurrently and as expected we also received about $900 million in cash from CCE for the sale of our Norway and Sweden bottling operations. Both of these transactions are reflected in the quarter’s cash flow statement and balance sheet.
As for the recurring result we report today, these were not impacted by the CCE transaction. When we report our fourth quarter and full-year results, these will be the first fully reflecting corporation of CCE’s North American business as well as the divesture of our Norway and Sweden bottling operations.
Secondly, when we announced our fourth quarter and full-year result, we will continue to detail our results by our five existing geographic operating groups with the North American operating group fully incorporating our newly constituted Coca-Cola refreshments and Coca-Cola North America Organizations.
Finally with regard to synergies, as we have announced previously and reiterated in our earnings release today, we continue to expect synergies of at least $350 million per year phased in over the next four years. We know that many of you are looking for additional modeling information regarding our newly integrated North America business, please note that before the end of this year, we intend to share with you further details regarding our capital and debt structure plans, as well as the impact of other items regarding the modeling of our new North American operations.
In conclusion, we delivered strong volume growth and [Inaudible] profit growth through the first three quarters of this year, both our operating income and earnings per share growth rates are ahead of our long-term growth targets on an ongoing currency neutral basis. Our revenue growth has sequentially improved over the course of the year and is now fully in line with our long-term growth targets.
All of this is a testament to our seasoned management team’s ability to effectively manage and execute our strategies within a challenging market environment. Together with our global bottling partners, we are maintaining our disciplined investment strategies and executing the right actions to drive our business for both today and tomorrow. As such, we remain confident that we will keep enhancing the health of our brands and importantly drive long-term profitable growth and value for our shareowners.

I think you are right in pointing out that we had a good quarter in North America; volume grew 2%, second consecutive quarter positive and I highlight organic growth, and year-to-date volume growth was 1%. I think, if you sort of dig double click and dig down for the quarters, total sparkling was even Trademark and then for the year-to-date when you look at, like Trademark Coca Cola on a year-to-date basis is even versus minus three for the same three quarters the prior year.
So, one of the things that is continuing to drive this is our success in our brand price pack channel architecture that we have talked about for a number of quarters that we are implementing. I think another one is our continued strength in our brands. We continue to invest in our brands and it’s paying off, Coca-Cola remains the number one favorite brand and has widened that lead over its nearest competitor, ratio is now 1.6 to 1 versus 1.4 in a year-to-date 2008 for example.
Favorite brand scores are again up. Coke Zero favorite brand scores continue to grow at a significant rate. So all of that is paying off and I think it’s important that we have a strategic focus that is consistent on building powerful brands, creating the value with our customer relationships and also a high performance system that is capable of working together to serve our customers and consumers.
And I am happy also to point out that in the third quarter as the industry returned to more rational pricing, CCNA, our North American Operation, Coca-Cola USA gained valued share in total NARTD and volume and value share in the sparkling as well as still categories.
So, when you look back at say some of the media reports back in the middle of 2008, say June, July, 2008, one of the priorities I outlined at that time, if you look into the clippings and go back into recent history, I said it is to stabilize and return to a sustainable growth our North American Operations.
I think that, in no way are we declaring victory, we are in the process of stabilizing as you can see from the numbers. And we are cautiously confident that even in the depth of the most severe crisis that we’ve recently had in the last couple of years in North America and the US consumer is still confused by the way that we are - our investments are paying off, our alignment with our bottling partners is paying off. And now I think we can accelerate that with this historic transaction.
So, I am particularly pleased that as we have gone into this transaction at the end of this quarter, this past quarter, that we go into that transaction from a point of strength, from a position of strength. And as I said the transaction will further enable us to accelerate our momentum, I believe.

The BIG team, Bottling Investment Group team, led by Ariel [ph] and his associates, I think have done a good job in stabilizing the business first in the Philippines and now we’ve been returning it to sustainable growth.
Coca Cola grew 12% in the quarter due to [Inaudible] on multi-serve packages to protect Diet [ph] Coke with [Inaudible] and I think our still beverages grew 20%. We have also recently announced our commitment to the Philippines to increase our investments to the tune of about $1 billion over the next five years. And I think that again tells you that we believe in the future of the Philippines. We believe in the future of the Philippines consumer as well as the Philippines in total as a country. And I think we are excited what the future offers in the Philippines.
As far as transactions are concerned, at the end of the day you’ve got to remember that consumers don’t buy unit cases, they buy transactions, packages at certain price points. And I think it’s really - that’s why it’s so important for us to track the consumer behavior patterns of consumption in different channels on a transaction basis. And I think that we are certainly seeing the benefit of tracking that metric in the United States, especially as we have offered more choices as part of our brand price pack channel architecture in the United States that’s working well. And you will continue to see a focus on that metric as we widen it across the world.

You’ve heard we say about Russia and Ukraine, particularly in the past that these markets are linked to more, we should try to think of these are being more volatile markets though go into the crisis quicker, deeper and they’ll come out of the crisis quicker and deeper. We are seeing an exact play of that happening.
And I think that Russia over the next sort of three-year period they will normalize to growth rates of sort of double digits I think as we move forward. But again, you’ll see some volatility in Russia play out over the next three years. But I think a more gradual return to a high single digit and double-digit growth rate.
As far as Mexico is concerned, you ask the question. I think, during this quarter Mexico and certain regions of Northern South America, the northern part of South America, suffered from very unusual high rainfalls which were, in fact in some cases in Mexico particularly severe enough to disrupt distribution over some prolong periods.
And of course also this past quarter, again to remind you that Mexico was typing 9% growth. In the prior year, I’ve said and I think in the call earlier that Mexico, we believe that Mexico will return to a more normalized rate of growth that we have seen in the past periods over the last two, three years.
And I think Japan certainly benefited from the extraordinarily positive weather, lack of rainfall and also very high sustained temperatures during the key summer months, July, August. I think that Japan, but again not all of the growth was related to that, some of the programs we are really getting traction, especially in the Kanto region, in Tomei [ph] as well as Coca-Cola bottlers Tokyo and also some of the other outline like Coca-Cola central Japan.
And therefore I think Japan we should see Japan, despite the very challenging consumer landscape deflationary environment should return to more of an even to 1% to 2% growth rate normalize over the coming period.

But I think it’s really important that price mix will gradually strengthen, I believe, in the United States as sparkling and still - both our sparkling and still portfolios grow, and as we get traction in terms of a more nimble and faster system in the United States as we transform our business and reap the benefits of successful integration.
But it’s really important to note that it is personally very pleasing for me that we can lead in to this transaction with two consecutive quarters of growth. And also importantly this growth is balanced and that you’ve got like Trademark Coca-Cola year-to-date on an even basis compared to say minus three for the first three quarters of prior year, and Coke Zero still doing very well in double-digit growth.
And so I think and then our still beverage strategy is really working very well. The total still beverage is up 8% on a year-to-date basis up 5% and that’s driven our success in both the juice segment as well as sports drinks. As I mentioned, energy, tea, all working together, coming together to generate this balance growth in the United States.
And I think, again you can expect the price mix to gradually strengthen, but it’s really important that we continue to invest in our brands and in our infrastructure in North America and that’s effective, our marketing is paying dividend. The strength of our brands are paying dividends, and especially in this third quarter, this past third quarter were there was price rationalization in the industry that we can still generate 2% organic growth was particularly encouraging.

And I think it’s one of the things together with I think very successful marketing programs is driving those brand preference score.
So, this is one of those examples where North America went down over a long period of time and it’s going to take us some time to really get it back, but I’m really optimistic and confident because of where we are starting from right now.

And we expect a little bit in the fourth quarter it looks like, but it’s not going to be major. Relative to CapEx, most of those investments we talk - when we talk about investments in all those countries, it’s really system investments as our sales and the bottlers, and much of that is actually bottler investment.
We’ll go through later this year and talk about CapEx for next year. But I would expect CapEx for this year to be pretty much in line with what we had talked about earlier in the year. And CapEx for next year will go through as we pull all of our plans together for 2011, which you and I can see significant changes.

And I think it has, again helped our brands on a sustainable basis in South Africa. The sparkling category showing recovery with improvements in the new 1.25 liter returnable glass bottle and also as I said the FIFA World Cup programs, I think Fanta is performing well after we made some, again pack changes. Activities in general have yielded good results, and consumers still trading down to more affordable options. We see that, especially in juices and waters, and we still see some heavy discounting going on.
But I would say overall the consumer psyche is beginning to recover from the hard economic conditions of 2009. As you would recall that last year GDP shrank by about 2 - between 2% to 2.5%. If I recall in 2010, GDP is estimated to be at around plus 4%. And we are benefitting from that also.

And while it’s two points ahead in the quarter gallons versus cases, it’s right at exactly the same year-to-date, and I would expect fourth quarter to be right in line as well.
And what you’re seeing is just the seasonality of the business. And as the business was accelerating in the third quarter, the bottlers are obviously just ordering more and more concentrate, because they had been behind in ordering up this first two quarters.
So I don’t think there’s anything unusual in that at all. And I think, as I said, it’s come back in line year-to-date and I would expect it to stay in line in the fourth quarter.

It’s really important that be understood well. I mean, to the two notes, if you take marketing and total CapEx of the bottling system combined in 2009, numbers around north of 2.5 billion. This year it will be getting close to maybe another sort of 10% higher than that in total. I’m talking about marketing as well as CapEx investments en route to market production efficiency, IT, marketing, brands, all of that.
So again, I’ve said before, we cannot, we have to really capitalize on this current economic crisis and that’s what you’ve seen us doing all around the world including in the United States, and continue to invest in our brands in our system and that’s paying off.
When you look at the whole world when we, again globally gained total value share and held volume share in the quarter as the 13th consecutive quarter of value share gain globally. So you’re seeing that paying off. And as Gary said, most of these investments, a lot of these investments are coming from the system. We generate as a system north of $20 billion of cash, annually $20 billion.
And that’s what, when we announce $5 billion in Mexico for the next five years, $6 billion in Brazil for the next five years, $3 billion in China over ‘09, ‘10 and ‘11. These are system investment numbers that are driving our business, because you heard me say before critically important to judge the appetite of our bottling system for more territory and investments. And that is at an all-time high, and our brands are at an all-time high in terms of their current metrics around the world, including here in the United States.
