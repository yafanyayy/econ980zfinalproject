We've got a lot of ground to cover this mornin",902,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Obviously, this is a very exciting day for all of us at R.R. Donnelley and Bowne & Company. We look forward to sharing with you why we are so excited during this call. We've got a lot of ground to cover this morning. So I will underscore some performance metrics for Q4 and full year 2009, talk specifically about some of the actions that we took during the year to prepare R.R. Donnelley for future growth, and then turn it over to Miles. After he takes you through the financial highlights, I will return with some comments about our definitive agreement to acquire Bowne, and then open it up for questions.
It is no exaggeration to say that as 2009 began, the world was in the midst of the worst financial crisis in 80 years. There were concerns about the solvency of large companies and a number of industries about overall liquidity, and about whether or not we were seeing a persistent structural change in consumer's buying habits. The goal for many organizations could be summed up in a single word, ""Survive"". Thanks to our employees' hard work, R.R. Donnelley did much more than that.
For Q4, we again posted sequential revenue growth as our sales increased 4.9% over the third quarter. Our ongoing attention to financial discipline and tight costs control helped us to post non-GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.46 for the quarter and $1.60 for the full year.
A year ago, we told you that even in the midst of the worst economic environment in the lifetime, we would, at a minimum, maintain our financial strength and flexibility. We delivered, generating $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, up $400 million from 2008. We reduced our debt by $800 million, and improved our favorable debt maturity schedule. We continue to pursue a balanced use of capital. And our Board maintains our dividend at $1.04 per share.
For investors, these actions, in combination with the results of our continued pursuit of operational excellence, resulted in a total shareholder return of 78% from the year-end 2008. The economic crisis confronted R.R. Donnelley with a challenge of determining the right balance between making drastic reductions in our workforce and platform and staying the course in order to be ready to take full advantage when economic conditions improve. We struck that balance during 2009. During 2010, we intend to capitalize on significant actions that we took to prepare R.R. Donnelley for future growth.
Let me share four examples with you. First, we made acquisitions, opened new facilities, or invested in new businesses in Latin America, North America, Europe, and Asia. For example, in January of 2009, we announced the acquisition of another printer's assets to expand our existing platform in Latin America. The work we did to quickly make this operation an integral part of our platform helped us achieve a double-digit EBIT increase in Chile. This is indicative of the discipline we apply to integrating acquisitions, a subject which I will return to shortly.
Second, we invested in online content creation community called Helium. We already create a lot of content for our customers through design, copywriting, translation services, photography, and more. But when we got involved early in the life cycle of communication programs, we are able to create efficiencies for our customers, and in turn, create service revenue for us. The investment in Helium is another great example of how we incubate concepts and expand our product and service offering to deliver value to our current and future customers.
A third example of solidifying our foundation for organic growth is what we did to continue building out our leading digital platform and to make advances with our supporting digital technologies. We're using our proprietary ProteusJet variable colored digital print capabilities to produce TransPromo statements, direct response marketing programs, and short-run consumer and education books. We're also blending digital content with traditional media. This provides marketers with the ability to use digitally printed covers on catalogs to direct the recipients to special sales items that are individually matched to their previous shopping habits.
Many of the orders that we receive for content that were produced digitally come through our exclusive CustomPoint portal, which we enhanced with new capabilities during 2009. In the past two years, the number of clients choosing CustomPoint has increased by 40%, and the number of orders placed through the system has risen by 42%. We have more than 1 million registered business users on this system today. Simply put, R.R. Donnelley is at the forefront of opening up new opportunities for our customers, with leading edge digital technology.
Fourth, we established important strategic alliances that will enable us to continue to offer customers leading proprietary technologies. As we've talked about before, our independent R&D has resulted in significant leaps forward for digital printing. Now, in collaboration with Muller Martini, we are integrating their SigmaLine with our ProteusJet digital presses to create a unique inline digital book production capability. In addition, we announced a joint technology development initiative with HP.
These initiatives as well as many others that we have undertaken will position R.R. Donnelley as a leading collaborative provider of integrated communications solutions. If you hear R.R. Donnelley and you think only printer, we invite you to think again. With that, I will turn it over to Miles.

We were extremely pleased with the performance of our employees as they persevered through the economic storm, staying focused on earning new customers and taking care of our existing customers.

We were extremely pleased with the performance of our employees as they persevered through the economic storm, staying focused on earning new customers and taking care of our existing customers. By serving our customers well and executing our business plans, we drove record free cash flow or operating cash flow less CapEx that benefited all of our stakeholders. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.46. And on a full year basis, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.60.
As expected, we continue to see sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, with revenue of approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of 4.9% over the third quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, revenue declined 7.6%. Lower paper prices accounted for approximately 133 basis points of the decline, while foreign exchange rates positively impacted revenue by 164 basis points. Excluding these items, our year-over-year revenue decline in the quarter was approximately 7.9%, primarily due to lower volumes as well as continued price pressure. Our comparable second quarter decline was 15.6%, and our third quarter decline was 11.3%. So we are encouraged with the direction that our revenue trends are taking. The improvement is due in part to the continued stabilization in demand as well as easier comparisons to the prior year as we had started to feel the impact of the recession at the end of the third quarter of 2008.
GAAP income from continuing operations was $28.5 million in the quarter, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $892.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Included in these amounts are $17.5 million of restructuring and $131.1 million of non-cash impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $10.7 million of restructuring and $1.1 billion of non-cash impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2008. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our earnings release.
We generated $319.5 million in non-GAAP EBITDA or 12.4% of sales. The increase in incentive compensation expense negatively impacted our EBITDA margin by 237 basis points. The decrease from fourth quarter of 2008 equates to a decremental margin of approximately 37% on our reported sales results, and only 9% excluding the impact of the increase in incentive compensation expense.
As we have discussed in our previous calls, there are many factors that's determined in margin impact of a given revenue change, factors such as changes in pricing, duration and severity of revenue change, product mix, foreign exchange, changes in commodity prices and the resulting byproduct impact, bad debt and LIFO provisions, benefit plan expenses, and incentive compensation expense to name just a few. On a normalized basis, we would expect an incremental or decremental EBITDA margin in the range of the high 20s to mid 30s.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 21.1%. That was the lower than the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 30.8% in the same period last year, due to a change in the mix of earnings across tax jurisdictions.
Now, we'll discuss our operating results by segment. Sales in our US print and related services segment declined 10.9% to $1.9 billion in the quarter. The trend in paper prices continues as lower paper prices contributed approximately 173 basis points of the decline. Additionally, we are still experiencing lower volume in most product offerings as well as continued price pressure. We are pleased to see growth, however, in our financial print offering and stabilized revenue from our logistics services.
Our international segments reported sales were $659.5 million, and grew 3.4% from the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding FX, however, sales declined 3.8% from the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower volume and pricing in Europe as well as lower volume in our business process outsourcing unit. On a positive note, we saw improvement in our global turnkey and Asian financial print offerings, both of which experienced revenue growth, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily driven by improved volume.
Our non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $14.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2008 to $36.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Driving this improvement were favorable LIFO inventory and bad debt provisions, our cost take out efforts, and the suspension of the company 401-K match in 2009. Partially offsetting these reductions was higher incentive compensation expense.
Capital spending was $62.1 million in the quarter, $22.2 million less than the fourth quarter of 2008. We effectively managed our CapEx all year long, spending only $195 million. And we'll continue with the same prudent approach in 2010.
We generated over $1.4 billion in operating cash flow, and over $1.2 billion in free cash flow or operating cash flow less CapEx. Based on this performance, our full year results reflect a more normal of incentive compensation expense, which negatively impacted our non-GAAP operating margins by 98 basis points as we had no incentive compensation expense in 2008.
Our net available liquidity as of December 31st, 2009 was $1.9 billion, over $100 million more than we had at the end of 2008. The financing actions that we took in 2009, including the first quarter issuance of $400 million of tenure notes, our third quarter tender for $640 million of near term notes, and the issuance of $350 million of seven-year notes greatly improved our near term flexibility and our already favorable debt maturity profile.
During the year, we reduced our total debt by over $800 million and reduced our net debt by nearly $1 billion. Our remaining debt is 99% fixed at an average interest rate of 6.7%. We are still targeting a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0 times to 2.5 times on a sustainable basis, recognizing that there are certain circumstances we may be at or above the high end of that ratio.
In 2009, we contributed $22 million to our pension plans. We recognized $5 million of pension income. In 2010, we again expect to contribute about $20 million to the plans, but our 2010 expense is expected to be $32 million, a year-over-year increase of $37 million in expense that is substantially driven by the lower discount rates on our plan liabilities under GAAP at December 31st, 2009. We expect our required contributions in 2011 and beyond to increase. And we may decide in 2010 to make additional non-required contributions to the plans. We'll continue to evaluate the most opportune time to fund our pension and obligations.
In terms of what we're projecting for 2010, let me share with you some of the key expectations and guidance, all of which exclude the impact of the Bowne acquisition. We expect year-over-year revenue growth in the low single digits. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 6.5% to 7%. The decrease from 2009 is primarily driven by non-cash increases and pension and post-retirement benefits expense and our LIFO inventory provision.
We expect depreciation and amortization expense of $560 million. Interest expense is projected to be approximately $220 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate will be in the range of 31% to 33%, although this estimate could be significantly impacted by business trends affecting different countries in which we do business or by changing the tax law. We expect a fully diluted share base of approximately 210 million shares. Our CapEx will be approximately $200 million. Our projected corporate expenses will be in the range of $220 million to $240 million. And finally, we expect our free cash flow or cash flow less - operating cash flow less CapEx to be in the range of $600 million $650 million for the year, and to be more heavily weighted towards the back half of the year.
Negatively impacting our year-over-year comparison are the cash tax benefits that we realized in the first quarter of 2009 related to the decline in value and reorganization of certain entities within our international segment, the 2009 increase in cash for lower working capital, and the fact that no bonus payments were made in 2009 related to the 2008 plan year. In aggregate, these items drive approximately $685 million of the expected year-over-year change in free cash flow.
Before I turn the call back to Tom, I'd like to announce some organizational changes that we're making in our corporate (inaudible) function. Janet Halpin, has most recently served as our head of internal audit, will be assuming the responsibility for treasury, filling the role made vacant when Dan Leib moved to his current role as Group CFO last summer. With this change, I'm also pleased to announce that Mike King [ph], who recently - or currently heads our corporate planning function replaced Janet as the new head of internal audit. Both Janet and Mike have been key members of the team over the last few years, and I'm pleased to have them in their new roles.
And with that, I'll return you to Tom.

As most of you know, there's a lot going on in our industry right now. When the dust settles, we believe that we will still have the only true end-to-end capability to prepare, produce, deliver, and process communications for our customers across so many product and service lines. Our extensive and unmatched product and service offering positions at R.R. Donnelley to expand by providing both additional product and services to the long run industry's traditional publishing and retailing clients, and complete communication solutions to clients within the significant number of industries that we serve.
I mentioned earlier our success in integrating prior acquisitions. In our industry, there is no management team that has more experience at quickly realizing value from acquisitions. And we believe that our acquisition of Bowne represents another superb opportunity to do just that. We have constantly said that we evaluate acquisition candidates based on their ability to bring us new and enhanced customer relationships, extend our product and service offering in areas in which our customers have demonstrated firm demand, and/or our ability to impact their cost structure.
The acquisition of Bowne satisfies these strategic imperatives, and will be accretive to non-GAAP earnings within the first 12 months following the acquisition date. Combining Bowne's respective resources with R.R. Donnelley's will help us to bring an even broader mix of products and services to both organizations' customers. It will also accelerate the creative use of technology across our platform. When the combination is completed and we bring the organizations together, we will draw on our industry - on our history of selecting best-of-the-best solutions to enable customers to benefit from the combined resources and expertise of both organizations.
This reference to best-of-the-best is not just acquisition speak. For example, I talked earlier about the success being driven by our proprietary CustomPoint system. CustomPoint combines the elements that we drew from the great ideas of people who came to R.R. Donnelley from pre-acquisitions as well as from previous R.R. Donnelley capabilities and new creative development. We believe that the acquisition of Bowne will deliver exceptional value.
And now, operator, let's open it up for questions.

Look, Miles went through with you here pretty - in detail our strong cash flow that we have. You combine that with the liquid currency that we have in our common stock and our access to capital markets. We have ample financial flexibility to continue to make the right strategic investments. But I would hope is that this management team has proved to everybody on the call or over the years that we recognize all the different constituents that are part or R.R. Donnelley from, obviously, customers being first, equity, bond investors, employees, and that we will do the right thing by everyone as we go through.
So you know we don't comment on acquisitions, but that's all say on that part. The exciting part this morning for us, though, is on getting together with Bowne. Again, I think from our standpoint, I mean the - Bowne is filled with just a number of experienced employees. They have a great reputation for serving clients. We need to have that in our minds before we can proceed to talk about any strategic initiatives that we're going - that we're looking at.
And when you - as you've talked about technology, if you just go back in time, if people have a chance, to go back and look at the announcements that we made in 2009 along the technology front, and you'll see that a number of them were made in the financial area as far as what we're looking to do with the introduction of the apps for broker dealers and financial advisors, the enhancements that we did to venue, the right content, share content solution that we did. On and on, we went throughout 2009 to get us ready. Because again, to your point and others' points, this is an area that we look at that is growing.
We talked to you at great length about content management, document management, content distribution, document distribution. We believe this is the future. What takes place at Bowne and R.R. Donnelley covers these points. We don't look at content as just numbers or data. And we don't look at distribution as just limited to being physical. So it's a digital world. It's a virtual world as well that we're coming to. The technology that's developed in this area by both of our groups is transferable across all of our products and services, which is something that, again, makes us excited when you think about magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, statements.
This innovation takes place by us by Bowne to make it easier for customers. And quite frankly, it's ahead - further ahead than any other product or services lines that we go ahead and have. Everyone's talking about the electronic reader and what's taking place in that marketplace. But understand, what our two groups deal with on an everyday basis, from privacy, to speed, to accuracy, to ease of access, any device, this information and data has got to be on. It helps us again, from a technology standpoint, with other products and services. Is it going to happen tomorrow? No. But is it going to happen in the near future? We believe so.
So you take that, you take the digital infrastructure and distribution capabilities that Bowne has that they assist their customers with in compressing their costs and improving their return on investment combined to what we've got going on. And again, I think you'll see that the creation for us to develop solutions that address the changing regulatory landscape, as you called it, for document management, from creation, to filing, to distribution, to storage, those are all going to be important parts of what's going to play, not only in this particular product line that we talked about, but it's going to take place in other product lines as well. Bowne has a global footprint and have customers that they both serve physically and virtually throughout the globe. So we're excited by it, and looking forward to getting started.

Understand, we’ve done - the group that you have before you, the R.R. Donnelley that I talked about, we’ve done a number of integrations of printing companies. You can go back to properties that some of you may remember on the phone from George Rise, NorthKey Graphics [ph], Meredith/Burda, Alden Press, More Wallace, Banta, Perry Judd, VonHof [ph], I can go on and on to talk to you about some the things that we do. And we all know as we do these that there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty for people that work in these areas at both of our companies. And it’s our responsibility to eliminate that uncertainty as quickly as possible so that - excuse me, so that everyone continues to focus on bringing value to the customer.
Again, this is the most crucial time between announcing and closing for an integration to be successful, and for the combined company to hit the ground running upon closing. Dave, (inaudible), and I started the integration process basically last night and appreciate all the things that we’ve started to get rolling. We’re going to do everything within the limit of the law to accomplish everything we need to do by closing, while at the same time, individuals are going to have to continue to do their day job. No one can take their eye off of what they’re currently doing, which is again serving customers at what we think is at a highest level. So we’ll look at everything that one normally looks at. You’ll look at benefits. You’ll look at public company costs, real estates, supply chain, and we’ll get together and make one-and-one equal three.

We told you in the past we’re trying to live between two and two-and-a-half times. We paid down $1 billion worth of debt last year, net debt. I mean that for us is significant in a year when, again, we didn’t know if we were going to be able to recommend to our Board whether or not we’re going to able to keep the dividend. We didn’t know whether customers were going to go out of business. We didn’t know if the American consumers specifically were going to just stop buying things.
The great thing now is that people are starting to brand again. People are starting to you - banks, credits starting to open up again, and all that stuff. It is good and good printed. Unemployment is a significant headwind and we’re not blind to that. But we will do what we believe is right for our shareholders, for our bond holders. We will do - we will make the decisions that we’ve done over the last six years together. And again, hopefully we've built up some equity with the people on the phone today that say, “Okay, we’ve managed this business through some of the toughest times anyone has ever seen. And at the same time, we’ve been able to deliver for you."" And we look - that we’re going to continue to keep that. There’s going to be - there’s no brain surgery going on here. There’s no physics going on here. We’re going to continue to manage the business as we have and go from there.

At year-end 2009, we have $10 billion of it if we have a drop in the bucket of what’s out there. So again, our sales force, our operational people are charged with going ahead and making sure that we can bring profitable work on to this platform. There's no excuse, if we have, for you. And we give up - we have the resources, the financial strength, and the flexibility to go to our customers to assist them in lowering their costs and improving their return on investment.
Our print management program that we put in place has started to get some pretty good winds behind it. We think that’s going to grow in 2010. The states, from a textbook standpoint, from an adoption standpoint, Texas, I believe adopted literature. Florida adopted math. That’s significant given the fact that most of the states in the United States are running out to deficit. We do believe educational spending at some point in time is going to have to come back. I don't care what anybody says about all these nice electronic devices. If our country can't feed children on a daily basis, give them paper and pencils, I have a hard time believing in the near future that we’re going to get ahead and give them electronic devices to learn from.
So there're going to have updates there. Automobile industry is starting to feel better about it, so that’s great for us. The financial institutions are starting to prospect again from a direct mail standpoint. Credit card solicitations are going up. The candidate, the acquisition, us and Bowne, I mean both organizations, you in particular on the phone are starting to see more deals take place, more capital markets activity starting to take place. People are starting to feel a little bit stronger about things. Retail inserts, even though newspapers are getting beat up pretty good, there’s still a good distribution network there with newspapers for retail inserts in addition to dropping them off at the back stores in addition to putting them into your mail boxes, so.
Again, I think if you go across, I could go on about statements, electronic presentment, collateral material, the pharmaceutical industry. Each one of those verticals is starting to see signs of life, which again we need to translate into the top line and bottom line for our company.

Then on the margin question, operating margins, we’re looking at for 2010 to be in the 6.5% to 7% range.

If it was just long-run printing, I could tell you that R.R. Donnelley maybe in a little bit more - would not have done as well as it did in 2009. The fact that we have transactional products that we can bring to market, the fact that we have relationships from the chief marketing officer, through procurement, through the CFO, to the CEO, and they see that we’re a trusted partner, this is all starting to pay dividends for us.

Good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, our employees continue to implement our One RR Donnelley approach as we delivered our industry-leading product and service offering to our customers while working together to control our cost. As a result, we posted GAAP EPS of $0.25 a share, up 257% from the same quarter in 2009 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.33 a share, up 38% from Q1 last year.
As we have continually demonstrated, we did not suddenly acquire financial discipline and a focus on generating cash flow during challenging economic times. These qualities are baked into everything we do at RR Donnelley and are clearly reflected in the more than $4 billion in free cash flow or operating cash flow less CapEx that we have generated between 2004 and 2009 and continue to be reflected in the $600 million to $650 million that we expect to generate in 2010.
As we have consistently promised, our focus is on maximizing liquidity and driving operational excellence, and as reflected by our ongoing performance, we continue to deliver upon that promise.
Miles would take you through the quarter in more detail, but before he does, I'm going to put our performance and prospects into context by briefly discussing the following: First, where we believe RR Donnelley will be positioned as the industry begins to settle; and second, what we are doing to continue implementing our digital strategy.
Both of these topics are important in understanding the strengths, capabilities and opportunities that we continue to leverage and the direction that we have charted in this fast-changing environment. I'll start with how RR Donnelley is positioned to continue to be the industry leader.
We hold the following distinct advantages relative to our competition, each of which influence our customer relationships, our research and new product development efforts, our investment/acquisition strategy and our structure. One distinct advantage is our ability to help our customers achieve their two most important goals: cost-compression and enhanced ROI. 
Let me share an example. Penguin Group USA just awarded us an agreement to produce digital books on demand, including adult and young readers trade hardcover, trade paperback, mass-market paperback books, bound galleys and advanced reader copies. By utilizing our ever-expanding digital platform, we are making shorter runs more affordable and driving waste and obsolescence out of the publisher's supply-chain. 
In addition to lowering costs, RR Donnelley's innovation can also enhance ROI as publishers can reopen their backlist to create incremental revenue.
With RR Donnelley, effective no title is out-of-print. These types of solution that deliver cost compression and increased ROI are replicated across our entire global platform.
Another distinct advantage is the diversity of our product and service offerings, our customer base and our geographic reach. This is important for several reasons: We participate in virtually every industry vertical segment, from consumer package goods, to retail, to healthcare, to financial services, to publishing and on and on. Our extensive reach means that we are involved in all of the fastest recovering segments, including medical services, packaged goods, entertainment, investment services, brokerage services, electronics, food services and others. Unlike most of our competitors who only serve one or two industry verticals with one or two products, our unmatched product and service offering and industry vertical exposure uniquely positions us to deliver integrated communicative solutions for our clients around the world, which brings me to my next point, our geographic diversity.
Our geographic diversity enables us to leverage our client relationships internationally and create differentiated solutions that utilize the capabilities of our integrated global platform. As they awarded RR Donnelley with their renewed and expanded multimillion dollar contract, Thomas Nelson Inc. told us that our responsive customer service model makes it easy to do business with RR Donnelley, whether a publication is produced down the road or around the world. Simply stated, our global platform enables us to deliver the optimum mix of cycle time and cost benefits for our customers.
Our comprehensive product and service offering not only provides an opportunity for our customers to reduce their total cost of ownership by consolidating their supply chain, it also means that it is rare for us to be excluded from servicing any client in any industry vertical. As an example, even if a customer were to award a portion of its traditional long-run print to a competitor, RR Donnelley can maintain a relationship with that customer by providing transactional printing, fulfillment and distribution, digital services, BPO capabilities and much more.
A third advantage is that because of our close customer relationships, we continue to have direct access to the key decision makers in our customer's organizations. If you can find a positive in the global economic crisis, it is in the fact that it creates a much more open and receptive audience for us to talk about our ability to compress costs and increased ROI for our clients. 
We continue to develop and expand our sea level relationships based on our ability to complete consultative assessments of our customer's communications activities, identify specific value-added recommendations utilizing our expansive product and service offering and implement a very efficient and effective operating model using our broad portfolio of web-enabled tools to serve those customers.
Together, these advantages create the key difference between what RR Donnelley was nearly a decade ago, a leading provider of printing services, and what RR Donnelley is today, the leading global provider of integrated communications solutions.
Now I will address what RR Donnelley is doing with regard to our digital platform and more broadly, what we are doing to take advantage of the opportunities being created by digital technologies. This is not just a single initiative as we are simultaneously pursuing our digital strategy across a number of fronts. For example, one front involves a seamless integration of digital technologies into our operations. Our platform includes more than 1,000 proprietary and commercial digital printing units. Now there's a tendency to think that digital equals short run. Digital units are frequently used in projects that enabled the creation of short-run content, but not always. For instance, the USPS presented information last month about intelligent mails biggest test to date, successfully processing, delivering and tracking the hundreds of millions of U.S. Census Bureau forms sents to households this year.
The Intelligent Mail Height-Modulated Barcode is used to sort and track letters and flats. It greatly expands mailer's visibility into the mail system. In describing the census, the USPS said we could view the entire process from individual pieces, the assembled loads, trucks from the printer and then throughout our system. That is the kind of result that can be achieved by our digital capabilities, including those on conventional long-run printing assets that have been retrofitted with RR Donnelley's high-speed, high-quality digital color capabilities.
Another front involves employing digital technologies on our platform to create entirely new interfaces between print and electronic communications. For example, our photography and pre-media professionals are capturing 360-degree rotating images that are deployed to websites. Imagine that you're working on a home repair project and you want to see what it should look like when it is finished. You point your smart mobile device at the using care guide that RR Donnelley produced, kitted with other materials and packaged with the device. Your device sees and recognizes a dimensional code that we printed and it pops that rotating image we photographed. That's an end-to-end digitally enabled solution.
A third front involves using digital technology to help contain SG&A by allowing our customers to self-surf through web tools such as our proprietary CustomPoint system, which again saw a sequential growth in the number of orders it accepted. Even against the traditionally strong fourth quarter, during Q1, we saw a 2 1/2% sequential increase in the volume of orders placed to us through this unique portal.
On the forefront, we are using digital technologies to help customers expand the power and reach of their brands. For example, our DigiMag product enables publishers to complement their printed magazines with digital versions. As you saw, we were just awarded an agreement by Hanley Wood to create all of the DigiMag versions of their B2B publications. DigiMag also allows published to leverage other content channels by making publications available to their mobile consumers. These online communications complement print, such as magazines, book, direct mail and commercial printing that we provide. 
As customers expand their communications mix, we expand a number of ways that they can choose RR Donnelley as their provider. Customers that modify their marketing mix do not have to shift away from RR Donnelley. We can simply utilize other capabilities within our integrated platform to meet their communication needs.
Another front involves helping our customers bring their own digital innovations to market. For example, consumers are evaluating an array of devices that put all kinds of apps into the palms of their hands. If they make a decision to buy one of these popular units, there is a really good chance that they are going to wind up touching some of our work. 
Our global print, packaging and supply chain management professionals are hard at work designing, printing, sourcing, packing out and fulfilling some of the most popular devices. When you received that product from your online order or pick up the box from the store, you're handling a great representation of our work.
RR Donnelley's digital strategy encompasses virtually every aspect of our business and is even influencing direction that we are taking in our hiring, training and development of human resources. For example, we are continuing to attract top talent from top campuses nationwide and bringing these young people into comprehensive and specially designed development programs.
We're giving them a thorough grounding in our global capabilities and through there energy and passion, they're giving us a deeper understanding of how RR Donnelley can support customers as the customers exploit the fast-changing communication possibilities associated with social networking.
As marketers use these sites to gather microdata about their customers and prospects, we are using our digital capabilities to help use those data in results-producing communications. And with that, I will turn it over to Miles."

We are happy to report that our first quarter 2010 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.33 exceeded our first quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share of $0.24 by 38%. Several key factors, which I will discuss in greater detail, contribut",1251,"Thanks, Tom. We are happy to report that our first quarter 2010 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.33 exceeded our first quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share of $0.24 by 38%. Several key factors, which I will discuss in greater detail, contributed to our improvement over last year.
I told you that during our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call that we expected full year 2010 sales growth over 2009 to be a percentage in the low single-digits. Although our first quarter revenue declined slightly on a year-over-year basis, the decline was in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect low single-digit percentage growth for the full year.
Compared to the first quarter of 2009, revenue declined 1.6%. The favorable foreign exchange rate impact of approximately 202 basis points was largely offset by lower paper sales for the quarter. The lower paper sales were due to both lower paper prices and a relative increase in the amount of customer-supplied paper.
Excluding the impact of both foreign exchange and paper, revenue declined by approximately 2%. This decrease was due to continued price erosion and slightly lower volume. The reported revenue decline of 1.6% compares to a 7.6% decline in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 14.0% decline in the third quarter of 2009 and a 19.4% decline in the second quarter of 2009, as demand has continued to stabilize and we are now overlapping past quarters during which we felt the full impact of the recession.
GAAP income from operations was $145.8 million in the quarter, $58.4 million higher than income from operations in the first quarter of 2009. Included in these amounts are $15.5 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $2.0 million of acquisition-related expenses in the first quarter of 2010, compared to $54.2 million of restructuring and impairment charges in the first quarter of 2009.
A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our earnings release. 
In spite of the revenue decline we experienced in the quarter, we were able to generate $301.9 million in non-GAAP EBITDA, $12.3 million more than we generated in the first quarter of 2009. Driving the year-over-year improvement were our ongoing efforts to reduce costs and increase productivity, a higher recovery on print-related by-products due mainly to favorable pricing and a more favorable product mix.
Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were continued pricing pressure and higher incentive compensation and benefits-related expenses, including a $10.2 million increase in the non-cash pension and post-retirement benefits expense. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact the year-over-year earnings comparisons as the negative impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation was mitigated by the favorable impact of other currencies.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 35.6% and was lower than the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 37.1% in the same period last year due to a more favorable domestic manufacturing deduction in 2010 and a change in the mix of income across tax jurisdictions, partially offset by a one-time charge of $3.3 million associated with the enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Now we'll discuss our operating results by segment. Sales of our U.S. Print and Related Services segment declined 3.7% to $1.8 billion in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see paper prices trend lower, especially impacting our magazine, catalog and retail insert offerings. Lower paper prices and the mix of customer-supplied paper contributed approximately 214 basis points to the overall U.S. sales decline of 3.7%. Overall volume in this segment was essentially flat as volume declines in our book and directory and magazine catalog and retail insert offerings were offset by volume increases in our variable print, logistics services, pre-media and financial print offerings. We are still though experiencing price pressure across this segment.
Our International segment's reported sales were $578.3 million and grew 5.5% from the first quarter of 2009. Excluding FX however, sales were 3.5% lower than the first quarter of 2009 as price erosion in Europe and Asia and volume declines in Latin America more than offset the favorable trend of our increased volume in our Global Turnkey and Asia products and service offerings.
Our non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses of $49.6 million increased by $9.3 million from the first quarter of 2009. We indicated last year that our non-cash pension and post-retirement's benefits expense would be significantly higher in 2010. And in the first quarter, this expense was $10.8 million higher than the first quarter of 2009, accounting for more than the total increase of corporate expenses.
Capital spending was $39.9 million in the quarter, $15 million less than the first quarter of 2009. For the full year, we expect to spend roughly the same amount on capital expenditures in 2010 as in 2009, about $200 million.
Our first quarter 2010 operating cash flow of $76 million was lower than the first quarter of 2009 as several one-time benefits favorably impacted our operating cash flow last year. In addition, this year's first quarter operating cash flow was negatively impacted by expenditures of $74.7 million related to our restructuring programs, of which $57.5 million was related to last year's termination of the significant long-term customer contract in the International segment. We continue to expect operating cash flow less CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million for the full year. 
We continue to maintain a favorable debt-maturity profile. As of March 31, 2010, our debt was $3.3 billion, of which $326 million matures on May 15. In addition, we expected to pay approximately $481 million for the Bowne acquisition and anticipate funding these obligations through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt securities.
As of March 31, 2010, our debt is 99% fixed at an average interest rate of 6.7%. We are still targeting a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0x to 2.5x on a sustainable basis recognizing that under certain circumstances, we may be at or above the high end of that range.
With one quarter successfully under our belt, we have revised some of our full year expectations since our last earnings call. Let me share with you some of these key expectations, all of which exclude the impact of the Bowne acquisition. We continue to expect year-over-year percentage revenue growth in the low single digits. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 7.0% to 7.2%, an increase of 50 basis points to the low end and 20 basis points to the high end of our previously communicated range.
We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $555 million, $5 million lower than previously estimated. Interest expense is now projected to be approximately $210 million, a reduction of $10 million from our previous guidance.
Our non-GAAP tax rate will be in the range of 30% to 32%, 100 basis points lower than previously communicated. This estimate could be impacted by business trends affecting different countries in which we do business or by changes in tax law.
We expect a fully diluted share base of approximately 210 million shares, our CapEx will be approximately $200 million. And finally, as both Tom and I have mentioned earlier, we continue to expect our free cash flow or operating cash flow less CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $615 million for the year and to be more heavily weighted towards the back half of the year.
And with that, I'll return you to Tom."

Before we open it up for questions, I like to make a few brief comments. First, earlier as I identified some of RR Donnelley's unique competitive differentiators, I would be remising that specifically mentioning the resilience, innovation and deep commitment of all of our people. They are the difference makers. 
Second, we continue to work towards the closing of our acquisition of Bowne & Co. Under the guidance of our Legal departments, we are planning the integration work that will allow us to hit the ground running when we come together. The people who are working with are confirming what we believe as we considered acquiring Bowne, that the acquisition will bring RR Donnelley some very talented people who will be a terrific fit with our customer-first culture.
We also believe that the customer-centric focus that has held Bowne forged strong relationships with many of their customers and that this will open the door to additional opportunities to present and sell the broader RR Donnelley product and service offering once the combination is complete.
Third, we are thrilled that the judges at the International Print Exhibition, IPEX, have found fit to award Donnelley the IPEX 2010 Champions in Print Award. The IPEX judges broke with tradition and gave their most recent award not to an individual but to the printing group that they cited as having made one of the most positive impacts on the industry and which has been a shining example of pioneering innovation.
We are proud to stand as a 2010 winner, along with such prior individual winners as Dr. John Warnock and Dr. Charles Geschke, founders of Adobe, as well as J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series.
Finally, we look at the balance of the year with what I would call tempered enthusiasm. The foundation that we built is proving to be solidly in line with what our customers are looking for and we continue to have confidence in our employees' ability to execute our strategy. And now, operator, with that, we will take questions."

We're not contingent just upon ad pages, which is a great thing for us. Our multi-product offering is the perfect solution for companies that are looking to implement their integrated marketing plan. Companies with their integrated marketing plan are looking to use conventional print, digital print and electronic means, as they're looking to secure prospects or increase customer spend. If you look at what we built, and if you go -- I'll spend two seconds going by products. I mean, you think about books. Consumer spending for new and backlist titles is going to increase if the economy goes well. We know the states have budget deficits in the United States. Hopefully, they can get that back underway. Once they do, adoptions will get better. The state of Florida are starting to have more adoptions in certain subject matters. Our state imprinting, that's going to expand. There'll be increased consumer spending, which means that there'll be more line items per document. Our BPO operation, there'll be more transactions taking place. As I think about catalogers, catalogers are going to start to test more, increasing the number of pieces that are mailed. Hopefully, their response rates with consumers go up. Obviously, branding, commercial printing, more merchandising. Hopefully, there'll be either new store openings or stores that are remodeled, which will again, will impact us. There'll be more hiring of employees, which will again mean more printed communication material. Direct mail, where there'll be increased consumer spending, and not for profits will look for more donations. There'll be more testing. There'll be more rollouts of different formats. Even when you think about directories and start-ups of new businesses that are going to take place, again, as the economy starts to improve, that's going to help us. As you go through financial printing and services, what we just talked about with Bowne, obviously, there's going to be more capital markets activity. There'll be more M&A activity. Labels, consumer-packaged goods, different products, they all have labels. We do all those stuff. Logistics, there'll be an increased volume in co-pay or co-mail distribution. Magazines? Yes. Ad pages go up, page counts will go up. That's a good day for everybody. There'll be probably more start-ups that will take place in B2Bs. The premier that we talked about, there'll be more photography taking place, more page layouts that will take place than what happened before. And obviously, with print fulfillment services, there'll be more of these electronic devices that are taking place, which we're involved in. If you think about office supplies, retail inserts, translation services, all of them get impacted by a better economy, which, as we look around, and I know we make it tough for you because you have no one that you can go ahead and put us in a box with, and say, ""I'm going to compare you against this person."" There's no one else that has this. And the level of interest that we're seeing, by our customers, because we have these solutions, is by far the most we've ever seen. We've got companies now that are truly, because of the crisis that they've gone through, are looking for ways to do things that take things off their plate that aren't their core competence. Again, the multiple product offering that we've got allows for cost compression, increase the return on investments and it's companies of all sizes. So as we sit here today, I mean, we give you our 90-day report card that I call it, 4x a year, and this is one of the report cards that we're very, very proud of and excited about what the future can hold, given where we're starting to see some things. Now on the flip side, I'll tell you, if the economy doesn't rebound or doesn't grow maybe as quickly as we thought it would, we still got ability here to take costs down and manage costs. I mean, if anything, I think we've proved to you over the years is that we know how to manage costs and we know how to go ahead and either dial it up or dial it down, with no impact to our customers. So I know, probably a long-winded answer for you, but that's, again, to drive home the point that we're not limited to ad pages. We're not limited to just one segment of communications, and that we participate in every one of these industry verticals is a great thing for us here at RR Donnelley, for our customers and for our stakeholders."

We're enthusiastic about what we think we can do this year, given the platform we built. But we also know, we've got high unemployment out there, we've got countries that have over extended themselves, and sooner or later, you got to pay it back. And again, I think if you look -- whether you're managing a company or a country, you've got to continue to be a good fiduciary of your balance sheet and make sure that you don't put yourself in a situation where you're going to have to take away things from people, you're going to have to reduce your services or you're going to have to compromise something that people, whether it's people in the country or whether it's customers, don't expect you to do.

But we made very difficult decisions in here in 2009 that are paying -- reaping the benefits from, from a cost standpoint, now in 2010. So that's obviously one of the drivers there. I would tell you, as well as that, that again, our top line -- we're talking about single-digit growth on the top line, low single-digit growth. I mean, for somebody like us, when you have a base of $10 billion and offsetting a 1% to 2% price decline, if you're able to catch your cost structure in line, that would -- some people may perceive as a small increase is pretty significant, and that should flow through the P&L in a very positive way. But again, Dan, as you get to know us, you'll see that we manage all aspects of costs everyday, and try to, as best we can, make sure that we don't -- as we manage those costs, we don't go ahead and jeopardize any one part of what we're trying to do here, from an operational efficiency standpoint."

I mean, that's something where if we can have more customers serve themselves, in essence, should be that, that's a help, from a technology standpoint. What we've been able to do, from a digital standpoint, that is also a key driver for us. I mean, we're one of the few people, if anybody, who has -- the transaction that we did with Muller Martini last year is not an insignificant transaction, as you think about costs for us in the digital landscape. We should be able to, as a result of that, be advantaged by having that technology on board with us for many different reasons. So again, as we go about trying to show customers what we can do by compressing their costs, we've got to make sure that our costs are also in line, or we're not going to be able to do that."

And the great thing for us, the fortunate thing for us is we did not just start to create a digital platform. This was part of our plan that was started nearly six years ago. We have the scale and digital infrastructure around the globe to serve customers' needs, whether they are in publishing or in the corporate world. Again, you've seen some of the announcements that we've made this week with Penguin on the book publishing side, Hanley Wood on the magazine side. We've got others in place on what I call, the Fortune 1000 side. So again, the digital error for us is going to develop new products that's going to make integrated communications critical to companies' success. So companies aren't going to do away with print. I mean, one of the things that I would hope I can drive home today is print is going to be a part of whatever that integrated communication spend is going to be. Whether it's via the net, cell phone, Blackberry, iPad, Kindle, whatever it may be, there's print that is going to be associated with it. So again, for us, as we look at it, we're excited that our infrastructure is there. We're excited that, again, from a conventional print standpoint, we've still got that great equipment with us, and we're going to be able to assist companies to do whatever they need to do. If they need to change from doing a retail insert, they want to then do a direct mail piece, bang, we can do it for them. They don't have to go some place else. And trust me, companies want to reduce their supply base because they need to go ahead and improve their margins. We talked to you a lot today about cash flow. Let's spend two seconds on CapEx. I mean, CapEx, for us, as you've gone through the years, I think it's been a concern for some you over the years. Look and see what we've done, going back, over the years. 2009 and 2010 are pretty similar amounts. And as we sit here today, I mean, we don't see why that amount, going into the future, shouldn't be consistent as well. Obviously, we could grow through acquisitions or there could be something else that takes place. But as we sit here today, we think the numbers that we're talking to you about, from a capital expenditures standpoint, don't have to change, as a result of us getting new business. That's a great business model. The business model where you got to go buy new equipment because you brought on a new customer, as most of you know, that's not a good business model. So we're excited about what digital is going to bring with conventional print, and again, we think we've got more than a head start on many, many people."

The great thing for us, as we sit here, we've got people we would never considered competitors, probably over the years, that are now coming into the marketplace, that are seeing the advantages that are here that we can have. So I think, from the standpoint of having others join and trying to do some of the things we do, it should shine a light on us because of our capabilities and because of how well we do it. Again, I know we don't make it easier for you, as far as some competitors are, but there is no one that does this product and service offering the way we do it, or have them that we do. So if you want to look at individual products, there's hundreds of competitors within each of one of those individual products. They may have good days on certain products, but those good days come and go. And what else is there to sustain their ongoing effectiveness? So with the platform that we built, no matter what price is, and we know we've got to overcome price every single day, and you've got to do that by making sure that you've got a low-cost platform that can go ahead and meet your customers' needs at the same time. So the old saying that, a rising tide lifts all ships, yes, there's some truth to that. But how much will they benefit from it? Where will that take them? I mean look, we're one of the few ones that, as we sit here today, we're still working on solutions for the USPS with them, with our customers. Obviously, they're going through some interesting times. How can we go ahead and make sure that we can pass along cost savings to our customers, which people who don't have the scale really can't work towards that? So we may be end up benefiting them. They may have to come to us to help them benefit from that, so..."

Good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, our employees continue to implement our One RR Donnelley approach as we delivered our industry-leading product and service offering to our customers while working together to control our cost. As a result, we posted GAAP EPS of $0.25 a share, up 257% from the same quarter in 2009 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.33 a share, up 38% from Q1 last year.
As we have continually demonstrated, we did not suddenly acquire financial discipline and a focus on generating cash flow during challenging economic times. These qualities are baked into everything we do at RR Donnelley and are clearly reflected in the more than $4 billion in free cash flow or operating cash flow less CapEx that we have generated between 2004 and 2009 and continue to be reflected in the $600 million to $650 million that we expect to generate in 2010.
As we have consistently promised, our focus is on maximizing liquidity and driving operational excellence, and as reflected by our ongoing performance, we continue to deliver upon that promise.
Miles would take you through the quarter in more detail, but before he does, I'm going to put our performance and prospects into context by briefly discussing the following: First, where we believe RR Donnelley will be positioned as the industry begins to settle; and second, what we are doing to continue implementing our digital strategy.
Both of these topics are important in understanding the strengths, capabilities and opportunities that we continue to leverage and the direction that we have charted in this fast-changing environment. I'll start with how RR Donnelley is positioned to continue to be the industry leader.
We hold the following distinct advantages relative to our competition, each of which influence our customer relationships, our research and new product development efforts, our investment/acquisition strategy and our structure. One distinct advantage is our ability to help our customers achieve two of their most important goals: cost-compression and enhanced ROI. 
Let me share an example. Penguin Group USA just awarded us an agreement to produce digital books on demand, including adult and young readers trade hardcover, trade paperback, mass-market paperback books, bound galleys and advanced reader copies. By utilizing our ever-expanding digital platform, we are making shorter runs more affordable and driving waste and obsolescence out of the publisher's supply-chain. 
In addition to lowering costs, RR Donnelley's innovation can also enhance ROI as publishers can reopen their backlist to create incremental revenue.
With RR Donnelley, effective no title is out-of-print. These types of solutions that deliver cost compression and increased ROI are replicated across our entire global platform.
Another distinct advantage is the diversity of our product and service offerings, our customer base and our geographic reach. This is important for several reasons: We participate in virtually every industry vertical segment, from consumer package goods, to retail, to healthcare, to financial services, to publishing and on and on. Our extensive reach means that we are involved in all of the fastest recovering segments, including medical services, packaged goods, entertainment, investment services, brokerage services, electronics, food services and others. Unlike most of our competitors who only serve one or two industry verticals with one or two products, our unmatched product and service offering and industry vertical exposure uniquely position us to deliver integrated communicative solutions for our clients around the world, which brings me to my next point: our geographic diversity.
Our geographic diversity enables us to leverage our client relationships internationally and create differentiated solutions that utilize the capabilities of our integrated global platform. As they awarded RR Donnelley with a renewed and expanded multimillion-dollar contract, Thomas Nelson Inc. told us that our responsive customer service model makes it easy to do business with RR Donnelley, whether a publication is produced down the road or around the world. Simply stated, our global platform enables us to deliver the optimum mix of cycle time and cost benefits for our customers.
Our comprehensive product and service offering not only provides an opportunity for our customers to reduce their total cost of ownership by consolidating their supply chain, it also means that it is rare for us to be excluded from servicing any client in any industry vertical. As an example, even if a customer were to award a portion of its traditional long-run print to a competitor, RR Donnelley can maintain a relationship with that customer by providing transactional printing, fulfillment and distribution, digital services, BPO capabilities and much more.
A third advantage is that because of our close customer relationships, we continue to have direct access to the key decision makers in our customers' organizations. If you can find a positive in the global economic crisis, it is in the fact that it creates a much more open and receptive audience for us to talk about our ability to compress costs and increase ROI for our clients.
We continue to develop and expand our C-level relationships based on our ability to complete consultative assessments of our customers’ communications activities, identify specific value-added recommendations utilizing our expansive product and service offering and implement a very efficient and effective operating model using our broad portfolio of web-enabled tools to serve those customers.
Together, these advantages create the key difference between what RR Donnelley was nearly a decade ago, a leading provider of printing services, and what RR Donnelley is today, the leading global provider of integrated communications solutions.
Now I will address what RR Donnelley is doing with regard to our digital platform and more broadly, what we are doing to take advantage of the opportunities being created by digital technologies. This is not just a single initiative as we are simultaneously pursuing our digital strategy across a number of fronts. For example, one front involves a seamless integration of digital technologies into our operations. Our platform includes more than 1,000 proprietary and commercial digital printing units. Now there's a tendency to think that digital equals short run. Digital units are frequently used in projects that enabled the creation of short-run content, but not always. For instance, the USPS presented information last month about intelligent mails biggest test to date, successfully processing, delivering and tracking the hundreds of millions of U.S. Census Bureau forms sents to households this year.
The Intelligent Mail Height-Modulated Barcode is used to sort and track letters and flats. It greatly expands mailer's visibility into the mail system. In describing the census, the USPS said we could view the entire process from individual pieces, the assembled loads, trucks from the printer and then throughout our system. That is the kind of result that can be achieved by our digital capabilities, including those on conventional long-run printing assets that have been retrofitted with RR Donnelley's high-speed, high-quality digital color capabilities.
Another front involves employing digital technologies on our platform to create entirely new interfaces between print and electronic communications. For example, our photography and pre-media professionals are capturing 360-degree rotating images that are deployed to websites. Imagine that you're working on a home repair project and you want to see what it should look like when it is finished. You point your smart mobile device at the using care guide that RR Donnelley produced, kitted with other materials and packaged with the device. Your device sees and recognizes a dimensional code that we printed and it pops that rotating image we photographed. That's an end-to-end digitally enabled solution.
A third front involves using digital technology to help contain SG&A by allowing our customers to self-surf through web tools such as our proprietary CustomPoint system, which again saw a sequential growth in the number of orders it accepted. Even against the traditionally strong fourth quarter, during Q1, we saw a 2 1/2% sequential increase in the volume of orders placed to us through this unique portal.
On the forefront, we are using digital technologies to help customers expand the power and reach of their brands. For example, our DigiMag product enables publishers to complement their printed magazines with digital versions. As you saw, we were just awarded an agreement by Hanley Wood to create all of the DigiMag versions of their B2B publications. DigiMag also allows published to leverage other content channels by making publications available to their mobile consumers. These online communications complement print, such as magazines, book, direct mail and commercial printing that we provide. 
As customers expand their communications mix, we expand a number of ways that they can choose RR Donnelley as their provider. Customers that modify their marketing mix do not have to shift away from RR Donnelley. We can simply utilize other capabilities within our integrated platform to meet their communication needs.
Another front involves helping our customers bring their own digital innovations to market. For example, consumers are evaluating an array of devices that put all kinds of apps into the palms of their hands. If they make a decision to buy one of these popular units, there is a really good chance that they are going to wind up touching some of our work. 
Our global print, packaging and supply chain management professionals are hard at work designing, printing, sourcing, packing out and fulfilling some of the most popular devices. When you received that product from your online order or pick up the box from the store, you're handling a great representation of our work.
RR Donnelley's digital strategy encompasses virtually every aspect of our business and is even influencing direction that we are taking in our hiring, training and development of human resources. For example, we are continuing to attract top talent from top campuses nationwide and bringing these young people into comprehensive and specially designed development programs.
We're giving them a thorough grounding in our global capabilities and through there energy and passion, they're giving us a deeper understanding of how RR Donnelley can support customers as the customers exploit the fast-changing communication possibilities associated with social networking.
As marketers use these sites to gather microdata about their customers and prospects, we are using our digital capabilities to help use those data in results-producing communications. And with that, I will turn it over to Miles."

We are happy to report that our first quarter 2010 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.33 exceeded our first quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share of $0.24 by 38%. Several key factors, which I will discuss in greater detail, contribut",1249,"Thanks, Tom. We are happy to report that our first quarter 2010 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.33 exceeded our first quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share of $0.24 by 38%. Several key factors, which I will discuss in greater detail, contributed to our improvement over last year.
I told you that during our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call that we expected full year 2010 sales growth over 2009 to be a percentage in the low single-digits. Although our first quarter revenue declined slightly on a year-over-year basis, the decline was in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect low single-digit percentage growth for the full year.
Compared to the first quarter of 2009, revenue declined 1.6%. The favorable foreign exchange rate impact of approximately 202 basis points was largely offset by lower paper sales for the quarter. The lower paper sales were due to both lower paper prices and a relative increase in the amount of customer-supplied paper.
Excluding the impact of both foreign exchange and paper, revenue declined by approximately 2%. This decrease was due to continued price erosion and slightly lower volume. The reported revenue decline of 1.6% compares to a 7.6% decline in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 14.0% decline in the third quarter of 2009 and a 19.4% decline in the second quarter of 2009, as demand has continued to stabilize and we are now overlapping past quarters during which we felt the full impact of the recession.
GAAP income from operations was $145.8 million in the quarter, $58.4 million higher than income from operations in the first quarter 2009. Included in these amounts are $15.5 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $2.0 million of acquisition-related expenses in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $54.2 million of restructuring and impairment charges in the first quarter of 2009.
A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our earnings release. 
In spite of the revenue decline we experienced in the quarter, we were able to generate $301.9 million in non-GAAP EBITDA, $12.3 million more than we generated in the first quarter of 2009. Driving the year-over-year improvement were our ongoing efforts to reduce costs and increase productivity, a higher recovery on print-related byproducts due mainly to favorable pricing and a more favorable product mix.
Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were continued pricing pressure and higher incentive compensation and benefits-related expenses, including a $10.2 million increase in the non-cash pension and post-retirement benefits expense. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact year-over-year earnings comparisons, as the negative impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation was mitigated by the favorable impact of other currencies.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 35.6% and was lower than the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 37.1% in the same period last year due to a more favorable domestic manufacturing deduction in 2010 and a change in the mix of income across tax jurisdictions, partially offset by a one-time charge of $3.3 million associated with the enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Now we'll discuss our operating results by segment. Sales of our U.S. Print and Related Services segment declined 3.7% to $1.8 billion in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see paper prices trend lower, especially impacting our magazine, catalog and retail insert offerings. Lower paper prices and the mix of customer-supplied paper contributed approximately 214 basis points to the overall U.S. sales decline of 3.7%. Overall volume in this segment was essentially flat as volume declines in our book and directory and magazine catalog and retail insert offerings were offset by volume increases in our variable print, logistics services, pre-media and financial print offerings. We are still, though, experiencing price pressure across this segment.
Our International segment's reported sales were $578.3 million and grew 5.5% from the first quarter of 2009. `Excluding FX, however, sales were 3.5% lower than the first quarter of 2009 as price erosion in Europe and Asia and volume declines in Latin America more than offset the favorable trend of our increased volume in our Global Turnkey and Asia products and service offerings.
Our non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses of $49.6 million increased by $9.3 million from the first quarter of 2009. We indicated last year that our non-cash pension and post-retirements benefits expense would be significantly higher in 2010. And in the first quarter, this expense was $10.8 million higher than the first quarter of 2009, accounting for more than the total increase of corporate expenses.
Capital spending was $39.9 million in the quarter, $15 million less than the first quarter of 2009. For the full year, we expect to spend roughly the same amount on capital expenditures in 2010 as in 2009, about $200 million.
Our first quarter 2010 operating cash flow of $76 million was lower than the first quarter of 2009 as several one-time benefits favorably impacted our operating cash flow last year. In addition, this year's first quarter operating cash flow was negatively impacted by expenditures of $74.7 million related to our restructuring programs, of which $57.5 million was related to last year's termination of the significant long-term customer contract in the International segment. We continue to expect operating cash flow less CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million for the full year. 
We continue to maintain a favorable debt-maturity profile. As of March 31, 2010, our debt was $3.3 billion, of which $326 million matures on May 15. In addition, we expected to pay approximately $481 million for the Bowne acquisition and anticipate funding these obligations through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt securities.
As of March 31, 2010, our debt is 99% fixed at an average interest rate of 6.7%. We are still targeting a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0x to 2.5x on a sustainable basis recognizing that under certain circumstances, we may be at or above the high end of that range.
With one quarter successfully under our belt, we have revised some of our full year expectations since our last earnings call. Let me share with you some of these key expectations, all of which exclude the impact of the Bowne acquisition. We continue to expect year-over-year percentage revenue growth in the low single digits. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 7.0% to 7.2%, an increase of 50 basis points to the low end and 20 basis points to the high end of our previously communicated range.
We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $555 million, $5 million lower than previously estimated. Interest expense is now projected to be approximately $210 million, a reduction of $10 million from our previous guidance.
Our non-GAAP tax rate will be in the range of 30% to 32%, 100 basis points lower than previously communicated. This estimate could be impacted by business trends affecting different countries in which we do business or by changes in tax law.
We expect a fully diluted share base of approximately 210 million shares, our CapEx will be approximately $200 million. And finally, as both Tom and I have mentioned earlier, we continue to expect our free cash flow or operating cash flow less CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $615 million for the year and to be more heavily weighted towards the back half of the year.
And with that, I'll return you to Tom."

Before we open it up for questions, I like to make a few brief comments. First, earlier as I identified some of RR Donnelley's unique competitive differentiators, I would be remising that specifically mentioning the resilience, innovation and deep commitment of all of our people. They are the difference makers. 
Second, we continue to work towards the closing of our acquisition of Bowne & Co. Under the guidance of our Legal departments, we are planning the integration work that will allow us to hit the ground running when we come together. The people who are working with are confirming what we believe as we considered acquiring Bowne, that the acquisition will bring RR Donnelley some very talented people who will be a terrific fit with our customer-first culture.
We also believe that the customer-centric focus that has held Bowne forged strong relationships with many of their customers and that this will open the door to additional opportunities to present and sell the broader RR Donnelley product and service offering once the combination is complete.
Third, we are thrilled that the judges at the International Print Exhibition, IPEX, have found fit to award Donnelley the IPEX 2010 Champions in Print Award. The IPEX judges broke with tradition and gave their most recent award not to an individual but to the printing group that they cited as having made one of the most positive impacts on the industry and which has been a shining example of pioneering innovation.
We are proud to stand as a 2010 winner, along with such prior individual winners as Dr. John Warnock and Dr. Charles Geschke, founders of Adobe, as well as J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series.
Finally, we look at the balance of the year with what I would call tempered enthusiasm. The foundation that we built is proving to be solidly in line with what our customers are looking for and we continue to have confidence in our employees' ability to execute our strategy. And now, operator, with that, we will take questions."

Consumer spending for new and backlist titles is going to increase if the economy goes well. We know the states have budget deficits in the United States. Hopefully, they can get that back underway. Once they do, adoptions will get better. The state of Florida are starting to have more adoptions in certain subject matters. Our state imprinting, that's going to expand. There'll be increased consumer spending, which means that there'll be more line items per document. Our BPO operation, there'll be more transactions taking place. As I think about catalogers, catalogers are going to start to test more, increasing the number of pieces that are mailed. Hopefully, their response rates with consumers go up. Obviously, branding, commercial printing, more merchandising. Hopefully, there'll be either new store openings or stores that are remodeled, which will again, will impact us. There'll be more hiring of employees, which will again mean more printed communication material. Direct mail, where there'll be increased consumer spending, and not-for=profits will look for more donations. There'll be more testing. There'll be more rollouts of different formats. Even when you think about directories and the start-ups of new businesses that are going to take place, again, as the economy starts to improve, that's going to help us. As you go through financial printing and services, what we just talked about with Bowne, obviously, there's going to be more capital markets activity. There'll be more M&A activity. Labels, consumer-packaged goods, different products, they all have labels. We do all this stuff. Logistics, there'll be an increased volume in Co-Pal or Co-Mail distribution. Magazines? Yes. Ad pages go up, page counts will go up. That's a good day for everybody. There'll be probably more start-ups that will take place in B2Bs. The premier that we talked about, there'll be more photography taking place, more page layouts that will take place than what happened before. And obviously, with print fulfillment services, there'll be more of these electronic devices that are taking place, which we're involved in. If you think about office supplies, retail inserts, translation services, all of them get impacted by a better economy, which, as we look around, and I know we make it tough for you because you have no one that you can go ahead and put us in a box with, and say, ""I'm going to compare you against this person."" There's no one else that has this. And the level of interest that we're seeing by our customers because we have these solutions is by far the most we've ever seen. We've got companies now that are truly, because of the crisis that they've gone through, are looking for ways to do things that take things off their plate that aren't their core competence. Again, the multiple product offering that we've got allows for cost compression, increase the return on investments and it's companies of all sizes. So as we sit here today, I mean, we give you our 90-day report card that I call it, 4x a year, and this is one of the report cards that we're very, very proud of and excited about what the future can hold, given where we're starting to see some things. Now on the flip side, I'll tell you, if the economy doesn't rebound or doesn't grow maybe as quickly as we'd thought it would, we've still got ability here to take costs down and manage costs. I mean, if anything, I think we've proved to you over the years is that we know how to manage costs and we know how to go ahead and either dial it up or dial it down with no impact to our customers. So I know probably a long-winded answer for you, but that's, again, to drive home the point that we're not limited to ad pages. We're not limited to just one segment of communications, and that we participate in every one of these industry verticals is a great thing for us here at RR Donnelley, for our customers and for our stakeholders."

And again, there's crazy things that are occurring in the world today from a sovereign risk standpoint, but I think, where we see things, we -- our comment about tempered enthusiasm, I think, is well placed. I mean, you look at what the capital markets have reacted this week, you look at the way certain countries have their own fiscal deficits, again, we're excited. We're enthusiastic about what we think we can do this year, given the platform we built. But we also know we've got high unemployment out there, we've got countries that have overextended themselves, and sooner or later, you got to pay it back. And again, I think if you look -- whether you're managing a company or a country, you've got to continue to be a good fiduciary of your balance sheet and make sure that you don't put yourself in a situation to where you're going to have to take away things from people, you're going to have to reduce your services or you're going to have to compromise something that people, whether it's people in the country or whether it's customers, don't expect you to do.

But we made very difficult decisions in here in 2009 that are paying -- reaping the benefits from, from a cost standpoint, now in 2010. So that's obviously one of the drivers there. I would tell you, as well as that, that again, our top line -- we're talking about single-digit growth on the top line, low single-digit growth. I mean, for somebody like us, when you have a base of $10 billion and offsetting a 1% to 2% price decline, if you're able to catch your cost structure in line, that would -- some people may perceive as a small increase is pretty significant, and that should flow through the P&L in a very positive way. But again, Dan, as you get to know us, you'll see that we manage all aspects of costs everyday, and try to, as best we can, make sure that we don't -- as we manage those costs, we don't go ahead and jeopardize any one part of what we're trying to do here, from an operational efficiency standpoint."

What we've been able to do, from a digital standpoint, that is also a key driver for us. I mean, we're one of the few people, if anybody, who has -- the transaction that we did with Muller Martini last year is not an insignificant transaction, as you think about costs for us in the digital landscape. We should be able to, as a result of that, be advantaged by having that technology on board with us for many different reasons. So again, as we go about trying to show customers what we can do by compressing their costs, we've got to make sure that our costs are also in line, or we're not going to be able to do that."

And the great thing for us, the fortunate thing for us is we did not just start to create a digital platform. This was part of our plan that was started nearly six years ago. We have the scale and digital infrastructure around the globe to serve customers' needs, whether they are in publishing or in the corporate world. Again, you've seen some of the announcements that we've made this week with Penguin on the book publishing side, Hanley Wood on the magazine side. We've got others in place on what I call, the Fortune 1000 side. So again, the digital error for us is going to develop new products that's going to make integrated communications critical to companies' success. So companies aren't going to do away with print. I mean, one of the things that I would hope I can drive home today is print is going to be a part of whatever that integrated communication spend is going to be. Whether it's via the net, cell phone, Blackberry, iPad, Kindle, whatever it may be, there's print that is going to be associated with it. So again, for us, as we look at it, we're excited that our infrastructure is there. We're excited that, again, from a conventional print standpoint, we've still got that great equipment with us, and we're going to be able to assist companies to do whatever they need to do. If they need to change from doing a retail insert, they want to then do a direct mail piece, bang, we can do it for them. They don't have to go some place else. And trust me, companies want to reduce their supply base because they need to go ahead and improve their margins. We talked to you a lot today about cash flow. Let's spend two seconds on CapEx. I mean, CapEx, for us, as you've gone through the years, I think it's been a concern for some you over the years. Look and see what we've done, going back, over the years. 2009 and 2010 are pretty similar amounts. And as we sit here today, I mean, we don't see why that amount, going into the future, shouldn't be consistent as well. Obviously, we could grow through acquisitions or there could be something else that takes place. But as we sit here today, we think the numbers that we're talking to you about, from a capital expenditures standpoint, don't have to change, as a result of us getting new business. That's a great business model. The business model where you got to go buy new equipment because you brought on a new customer, as most of you know, that's not a good business model. So we're excited about what digital is going to bring with conventional print, and again, we think we've got more than a head start on many, many people."

So I think, from the standpoint of having others join and trying to do some of the things we do, it should shine a light on us because of our capabilities and because of how well we do it. Again, I know we don't make it easier for you, as far as some competitors are, but there is no one that does this product and service offering the way we do it, or have them that we do. So if you want to look at individual products, there's hundreds of competitors within each of one of those individual products. They may have good days on certain products, but those good days come and go. And what else is there to sustain their ongoing effectiveness? So with the platform that we built, no matter what price is, and we know we've got to overcome price every single day, and you've got to do that by making sure that you've got a low-cost platform that can go ahead and meet your customers' needs at the same time. So the old saying that, a rising tide lifts all ships, yes, there's some truth to that. But how much will they benefit from it? Where will that take them? I mean look, we're one of the few ones that, as we sit here today, we're still working on solutions for the USPS with them, with our customers. Obviously, they're going through some interesting times. How can we go ahead and make sure that we can pass along cost savings to our customers, which people who don't have the scale really can't work towards that? So we may be end up benefiting them. They may have to come to us to help them benefit from that, so..."

91797,109055330,72112,"R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. One of the themes that we have consistently communicated is the importance of a disciplined approach to taking cost out of our business, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. We told you that we we",1649,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. One of the themes that we have consistently communicated is the importance of a disciplined approach to taking cost out of our business, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. We told you that we were working very deliberately to strike the right balance between reducing cost and ensuring that we would be ready to benefit immediately when general economic conditions improved.
The importance of maintaining this discipline was illustrated during 2009, when we responded to the fast-changing economic environment by taking out significant costs particularly during the first half of the year. We did not, however, compromise our ability to take advantage of fresh revenue opportunities that emerged in 2010. 
The effectiveness of this approach is reflected by our Q2 results. Q2 revenues were up 2.2% versus the same quarter a year ago. However, GAAP EPS of $0.42 more than tripled from the same quarter in 2009, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.47 were up more than 27% from Q2 last year. Miles will walk you through the numbers in more detail in a few moments but before he does, I will briefly address three topics. 
First, I'll discuss benefits that we are seeing from our One RR Donnelley strategy; second, I'll point out some examples of initiatives that are creating new revenue opportunities; and third, I'll highlight some important achievements during the quarter that reflect our employees' continuing commitment to excellence.
Let's begin with our One RR Donnelley strategy, which we see as having three important dimensions. The first dimension refers to the way that we approach our customers. During the second quarter, we were awarded customer contracts whose aggregate value approached $2 billion. These long-term agreements won on four continents reflect the unique breadth, depth and geographic reach of our product and service offering. Many of these agreements are for multiple product and service lines that draw on several RR Donnelley capabilities. In essence, the One RR Donnelley strategy means that we, as the leading global provider of integrated communications solutions, are uniquely able to provide differentiated services to our customers. Let me share a few examples.
We have an extensive pre-media offering which grew out of our traditional relationships with catalogers and publishers. However, as One RR Donnelley, we are applying our unique pre-media technologies to traditional segments that we serve. ShareStream is our online workflow management system used as designers and others create and collaborate on materials that can be both printed and published on the Internet. We recently won all of a major healthcare institution's extensive forms and labels products because we applied ShareStream to the complex task of managing the hospital's documents, which number in the thousands. The before and after solution for the document review and approval workflow that our sales team created is striking. We did not earn this business just by bidding against other printers. We earned it by providing an expanded service offering that saves our customers remarkable amounts of expensive cycle time. The key is that this value-added service is not confined to a traditional silo or niche. It's expanding into applications across our platform.
Another example, we are a leader in using digital imaging to help our customers talk to their customers in a one-to-one voice. You most frequently see this kind of personalization in direct response and TransPromo communications. But we're expanding our offering by bringing it into the catalogers' world. In short, this digital imaging solution lets a cataloger tailor offers based on their customers' prior purchases. Now when you receive a catalog, choose what to buy and place your order, that information can wind up shaking a unique offer you'll receive when your next catalog arrives. In the past, the number of options for personalizing catalogs was less extensive than those available for conventional direct mail. One RR Donnelley is narrowing that gap. 
The second dimension of our One RR Donnelley strategy is technology development and utilization. Here's an example of what we mean by applying a One RR Donnelley approach to emerging technologies. Quick response or two-dimensional barcodes are creating links between printed and online content. Download a free app, point your smartphone at a printed 2D barcode and you're immediately taken to the appropriate web or mobile Internet site. In essence, these codes make print instantly interactive. 
We believe that we are positioned to help the broadest range of customers apply this emerging interactive technology across the broadest range of applications, including product packaging, in-store signage, direct mailing, magazines, catalogs, [ph] (22:11) directed of in industrial labels and many, many more.
Earlier this week, we officially opened a new research and development center, which features expanded engineering, printed electronics, inks and materials labs. Our own in-house technological and material innovation are supplemented by our external activities such as our sponsorship arrangement with the MIT Media Labs. This sponsorship gives us special access to the latest in a range of innovations. As our internal and external R&D functions continue to develop new products and services, we will add them to our industry-leading platform and sell them into the industry's broadest range of applications. We do not believe that any other company in our industry can take advantage of as many ways to benefit from innovations as RR Donnelley can.
The third dimension of our One RR Donnelley strategy is performance consistency across our global platform. Whether we are sourcing components and packaging them with the hottest consumer electronics in Europe, producing guides in China that are being distributed at the Shanghai World Expo, managing over 35,000 rail moves a year through our logistics operations, or designing, photographing, printing and distributing the supplements you take with you shopping on Sunday afternoon, our facilities are applying common standards for safety, quality, service, sustainability and more. This performance consistency ensures that our brand is associated with excellence around the world, enables us to maximize our leverage advantages in every aspect of our business. One RR Donnelley is not merely a slogan. It makes a crucial difference.
The second topic I'll touch on is the increasing number of initiatives that are creating new revenue opportunities. Let me use RR Donnelley's innovative ProteusJet system as an example. A recent PrintWeek article highlighting our proprietary ProteusJet digital printing unit said, ""RR Donnelley has been ahead of the curve in all aspects of digital printing."" One of the factors that we see as unique is our ability to apply R&D innovations to multiple applications across multiple customer segments, each of which can lead to new revenue opportunities. 
For example, we began by using ProteusJet to drive enhanced TransPromo value for the telecom, financial services and other customers for whom we print and mail billing statements. 
Next, we moved it into the book-publishing world. We have integrated our ProteusJet digital presses with in-line binding equipment for exceptionally efficient digital book production. This is how publishers open up their backlist to create new revenue. It will allow us to help them to get at the fundamental supply chain inefficiencies that tend to prevent publishers from matching the most efficient production method to consumer demand. 
Just a few weeks ago, we announced another first involving ProteusJet. It is the first high-resolution high-speed digital web offset press combination. This modular installation enables digital color imaging across the full width of the press to give direct marketers exceptional design and production flexibility. Again, our One RR Donnelley strategy continues to drive innovative solutions for our customers and provide new incremental revenue streams in areas as diverse as financial services, publishing, fundraising, telecommunications, retailing and more.
Finally, before I turn it over to Miles, I want to highlight some important achievements during the quarter that reflect our employees' continuing commitment to excellence. Though we talk a great deal about technology, ours is still a business rooted in craftsmanship and service. Working to accurately bring our customers' brands to life in their communications, even as they present us with an endless series of time-sensitive deadlines is an everyday challenge for our employees. They consistently rise to that challenge, as illustrated by the awards that we received. 
Our performance continues to be recognized by our customers. For example, AT&T Advertising Solutions recognized our employees' efforts with its Gold Supplier Quality Alliance Award and Best Buy named our Lancaster, Pennsylvania operations as its top-performing print facility. 
Fewer than 2% of printed samples that producers submit for judging are recognized with Sappi North American Printer of the Year silver awards. Yet, RR Donnelley took home several that were earned across different segments of our platform. Out of the silver award winners in each of the 10 finalist categories, one is selected to receive recognition with a gold award. RR Donnelley's craftsmanship was recognized with two of those gold North American awards. No other company received multiple gold honors. 
Our people make a qualitative difference for our customers. We believe that these important recognitions reflect the fact that as we take out cost, we do not compromise our ability to deliver the quality and innovative services that differentiates RR Donnelley from our competitors. 
Similarly, we do not take shortcuts with regard to sustainability. During the quarter, another of our facilities earned the ISO 14001 environmental certification, and we continue to pursue a number of important sustainability initiatives. 
Most important, we never compromise employee safety. A number of facilities achieved important safety milestones during the quarter, including our operations in Dongguan province in China, which reached 10 million consecutive working hours without a day away injury. Our experience is that safety is the first and most important measure of operational excellence. The formula we continue to follow, our One RR Donnelley strategy, which we believe is resulting in an expanding range of new revenue opportunities, plus our company's commitment to performance excellence, equate to results that we are very, very proud of. Miles?"

Our second quarter results showed substantial improvement as GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.42 exceeded our second quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share by $0.30. And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.47 exceeded second q",1452,"Thanks, Tom. Our second quarter results showed substantial improvement as GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.42 exceeded our second quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share by $0.30. And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.47 exceeded second quarter 2009 by $0.10. Top line growth, a favorable tax rate and a few other key factors, all of which I will discuss in greater detail, contributed to this improvement.
We are pleased to report that we achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 2.2% in the second quarter. The first quarter with positive revenue growth since the second quarter of 2008. Furthermore, June has been our fourth consecutive month of year-over-year top line growth. And while comparables become more challenging, we are optimistic that we will continue to achieve positive revenue growth in the back half of the year. 
Increased volume in most of our operating units was the primary driver of our 2.2% sales increase over the second quarter of 2009. Similar to the first quarter, lower paper sales did a lower paper prices and the mix of paper used by our customers negatively impacted sales growth. The unfavorable impact in the second quarter was approximately 109 basis points.
GAAP income from operations was $175.3 million in the quarter, $40.3 million higher than in the second quarter of 2009. Included in these amounts were $10.7 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $3.3 million of acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $48.2 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $1.4 million of acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter of 2009. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our earnings release.
Non-GAAP income improved as well. We generated $189.3 million in non-GAAP income from operations, $4.7 million more than we generated in the second quarter of 2009. In addition to volume growth, an increased recovery on print-related by-products and lower depreciation and amortization expenses were only partially offset by price erosion and higher incentive compensation and benefits-related expenses, including a $10 million increase in pension and post-retirement benefits expense. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact our year-over-year earnings comparison. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.2% and was significantly lower than the comparable rate of 37.5% in the same period last year, primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in Latin America in the second quarter of this year. 
Now I'll discuss our operating results by segment. Year-over-year sales in our U.S. Print and Related Services segment improved 1.6% to $1.8 billion in the quarter, including an unfavorable impact of approximately 130 basis points related to lower paper prices and the mix of paper used by our customers. We saw revenue growth in seven of the nine reporting units, with the exceptions being Magazine Catalog and Retail Inserts and Office Products. 
Within the Magazine Catalog and Retail Inserts Reporting unit, the majority of the revenue decline was due to lower paper sales and work mix, as unit volume was essentially flat. Most product offerings continued to be impacted by price erosion, in line with historical trends although we expect these operations to benefit from our One RR Donnelley focus and the growing momentum behind the enterprise selling initiatives that Tom discussed earlier.
Our International segment's reported sales were $599.3 million and grew 4.3% from the second quarter of 2009. The segment sales growth was driven by higher volume from all reporting units except Canada and Business Process Outsourcing units. 
The volume decline in Business Process Outsourcing was due to the decision we made last year to terminate a significant long-term customer contract, enabling us to exit from certain unprofitable operations in this area. Continued price erosion partially offset the volume growth in the second quarter. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact the year-over-year revenue comparison.
Our non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses of $42.9 million increased by $19.2 million from the second quarter of 2009. Pension and other benefits-related expenses, including healthcare as well as our non-cash LIFO inventory provision, increased year-over-year, partially offset by a favorable reduction in our workers' compensation expense. 
Capital spending was $54.6 million in the quarter, $17.4 million more than in the second quarter of 2009. This year-over-year increase supports the several digital initiatives and new customer wins and renewals that we have announced and will continue to announce going forward. As such, we are revising our full year capital spending guidance to a range of $200 million to $225 million.
Interest expense in the quarter was almost $53 million and was $7 million favorable to the second quarter of 2009. Our May 2010 debt maturity and August 2009 tenders were the primary drivers of the year-over-year decrease in net interest expense. 
We continue to maintain and improve upon our already favorable debt maturity profile. In the quarter, we issued $400 million of 7 5/8% senior notes due June 2020, on which the first interest payment is due in December of this year. The proceeds from the offering were used in part to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility that were drawn to repay the May 2010 maturity. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding a portion of the purchase price of the Bowne acquisition, which we expect to close later this year.
As of June 30, 2010, our debt was $3.4 billion, with the next scheduled maturity of $159 million not due until January of 2012. Our total debt is approximately 82% fixed at an average interest rate of 7.4%. We are still targeting a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0x to 2.5x on a sustainable basis, recognizing that under certain circumstances, we maybe at or above the high end of that range. 
Based on our second quarter results and our view for the second half, we are refining our full year guidance. Let me share with you some of these key expectations, all of which exclude the impact of the Bowne acquisition.
We expect year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 1%. Compared to our previous guidance of low single-digit growth, this change is solely a reflection of the revised impact of expected foreign exchange rates on our top line. For the full year, we now expect foreign exchange rates to have a slightly negative year-over-year impact on revenue. Our previous guidance assumed foreign exchange rates consistent with the rates we saw early in 2010, which would have had positive year-over-year impact on revenue. However, this revised assumption should not have a material impact on earnings. In fact, we now expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 7.3% to 7.5%, an increase of 30 basis points from our previously communicated range. And while we're not providing details on how this revenue and margin guidance will specifically impact each of the third and fourth quarters, I would like to remind everybody that the third quarter year-over-year comparison will be impacted by a few items that favorably impacted the third quarter of 2009 and are not going to repeat again this year.
First, we recognized a $13.1 million benefit in the third quarter of last year related to a reduction on our LIFO inventory provision. This year, we expect a $3 million expense in the third quarter related to LIFO. So the expected year-over-year unfavorable swing is $16.1 million. 
The second item is related to a fee we received for a contract transition in the third quarter of 2009. The fee amounted to $12.5 million, with operating margin of essentially 100%. Together, these two items negatively impact the third quarter year-over-year earnings comparison by $28.6 million. 
We expect full year depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $540 million, $15 million lower than previously estimated. Interest expense is now projected to be approximately $225 million, an increase of $15 million from our previous guidance. The increase is primarily due to the recent $400 million bond offering. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate will be in the range of 29% to 31%, 100 basis points lower than previously communicated, largely due to the valuation allowance release recognized in the second quarter. This estimate could continue to be impacted by business trends affecting different countries in which we do business or by changes in tax laws. 
We continue to expect the fully diluted share base of approximately 210 million shares. As I noted earlier, our CapEx will be in the range of $200 million to $225 million. And finally, we continue to expect our free cash flow or operating cash flow less CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. And with that, I'll return you to Tom."

We will also continue to manage cost with discipline and relentlessly pursue each customer opportunity. What tempers our enthusiasm about what we control is that which we do not control. I think Fed Chairman Bernanke put it well when he said recently that these are unusually uncertain times. So we will continue to focus on maintaining the liquidity that gives us maximum flexibility to take advantage of the emerging opportunities. And with that, operator, we'd like to open it up for questions."

One, I don't think I know our One RR Donnelley strategy is really resonating with customers. The product and platform that we've got today is nothing near what -- go back 10 years ago with what Donnelly had. And Donnelly's customer profile back then was publishers, catalogers, retailers, capital markets, financial, compliance, directories. Today, our customer profile is what I've just said, plus it's the Fortune 1000, plus it's government, education, healthcare, medium, large, small businesses. We have about 65,000 customers that spend anywhere between a few hundred dollars with us on an annual basis to a few hundred million dollars with us on an annual basis. So as a result of that, the value creation that we bring to our customers is the ability to continue to compress their costs by leveraging all of their purchases and improving their return on investment. And in order to bring this value proposition to customers, which we don't believe anybody else can, you need to have that supply chain scale. And you need to have the expertise to meet the customers' needs. We have all that. And again, if somebody wanted to try and replicate that right now and compete at the scale that we're at, they're going to have to spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe even billions of dollars, in order to go ahead and build the platform that we've built. The resources that we have, as you know, we've got the financial strength. We've proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that we can integrate strategic acquisitions seamlessly. We've got proprietary technology. I've talked to you about geographic. We've got a great workforce. We've got procurement leverage. We're now really hitting our stride on the consultative sales organization. And we've got the ability to demonstrate to adapt to changing times. So our organic growth that you saw this quarter, we're very excited about. We're very excited about what we can still do with our existing customers, as well as what we can do with prospecting in customers. And we think we've still got a lot of value that we can bring to our stakeholders."

And again, that's sort of where when you talk -- what we saw last year was -- I would say that I don't think anyone really had experienced in the business field what was going on in the first half of last year. And that's sort of where when I talk about the tempered enthusiasm that we've sort of coined the phrase. You've got significant high corporate earnings right now. You've got leverage that's lower. Companies that are flush with cash. You've got inflation at almost zero. Interest rates are basically zero. And normally, we would say, ""Hey, this is the perfect environment for growth."" But unfortunately, the lack of clarity over taxes, ordinary income, capital gains, dividends and the uncertainty that happened that we feel surrounding public policies, whether it's still around healthcare, financial service companies might outweigh what the above tailwinds that I just mentioned that we have. That is why going to the back half of the year, we're optimistic about 2010 but at the same time, we want to be realistic. Last year, the U.S. consumer -- and even though we're a global company, the key for us is still the U.S. consumer. How much less discretionary income are they going to have as a result of taking into account the increases in taxes and healthcare? Are lenders going to be willing to lend? Right now, we're seeing companies brand themselves. We're seeing companies compete for new customers. We're seeing companies want to stay in front of their customers via multi-channel approaches. This is something that wasn't happening last year. This is great news. If the U.S. consumer continues to respond, so will these companies, we believe, our customers in the back half of the year. If the U.S. customer pulls back or goes into hiding because they're having less discretionary income, then I think that is going to impact the back half of the year. With all that said, we're still going to stick to our plan which we believe is working very, very well. As I said earlier, it's resonating with our customers every day. And we've got organic growth this year in spite of year-over-year lower paper prices and with the impact of foreign exchanges.

And we won't spend money unless we know that our customers are going to have a use for it. So that's sort of part one to that. Technology from us again brings opportunity. It's clear that's the complexity and volatility have become permanent, not only in our industries but in other industries. And our job is to keep it simple for our customers. Technology can be both a positive and a negative when you talk about print. You're going to be impacted no matter what, it just depends on which way. Us having the ability to be innovative and as I talked about on the call, ProteusJet being one of the ways that we're going about this. We can do runs now or we can do jobs for customers as low as one, go to 50, go to 100, we can go to up to millions. So what this technology's enabled us to do, we become channel-agnostic, if you want to look at it that way, to whether or not we're getting the digital files in, we can go ahead and put that back over the Internet. We can go ahead and put it into hardcopy. Not a lot of people can do that. So technology for us, again, we look at it as it's going to make the supply chain more efficient. Technology is not going to kill print. It's going to evolve print, which again, John and Dan like to point to the television, whatever it was, 60, 70 years ago. That was going to kill magazines, books, directories. If anything, it became more of a product offering there. The Internet was going to kill catalogs. If I look around right now, we know that the good catalogers know that they have to print. We've got to mitigate their cost as they do that for them but they know if they don't put things in the mail, they're not going to be as successful. We continue to look at print that way. Print's not going to go away. We're going to evolve it. We're going to help evolve it. Our customers are going to evolve it and it's going to be here. So it's exciting times from that standpoint. We've got to continue to stay ahead. We've got to continue to help our customers, help them reduce their costs and get a bigger return on their investment. And I think as you've seen in this front half of the year, we've been able to do that."

So I would tell you, again, sort of the same theme to the earlier answers that I gave was that I think everyone is proceeding with caution. Everyone is looking to make sure that they don't get caught. Inventory levels, where they're at, I think we'll start seeing our banks starting to lend to not only consumers but small businesses. Where does that come into play? Leverage is down. Are we going to continue to bring leverage down in the United States? That's one of the areas we continue to watch. Europe continues to be a battlefield in what we're doing. They're more stable. Latin America, some parts are going well, some parts are under pressure. And Asia for us is still performing well.

People take what comes in the mail to them and then that drives them to go order online or do things there. So I think again, as we talk about Fin Reg and talk about some of these other policies that are out there, if we start to see lending start to pick up a little bit more, I think that will be good for everybody. If unemployment comes down, that will be great. And if the U.S. consumer has this discretionary income, I think again, that will help all of us in every single industry vertical. Magazine pages are up slightly but again, it's not anywhere near where they were. We're having good days because we're with good titles, good publishers. But again, I think when you look at what is that industry going to be down the road, I think everyone's still looking to see how things shape out and how things come back. Will it come back to the levels that it was earlier in the decade or late in the decade, I should say? I think that, that's a tough call to say. But again, if it does, we're ready for it.

Donnelley & Sons Company","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. One of the themes that we have consistently communicated is the importance of a disciplined approach to taking cost out of our business, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. We told you that we we",1650,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. One of the themes that we have consistently communicated is the importance of a disciplined approach to taking cost out of our business, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. We told you that we were working very deliberately to strike the right balance between reducing cost and ensuring that we would be ready to benefit immediately when general economic conditions improved.
The importance of maintaining this discipline was illustrated during 2009, when we responded to the fast-changing economic environment by taking out significant costs particularly during the first half of the year. We did not, however, compromise our ability to take advantage of fresh revenue opportunities that emerged in 2010. 
The effectiveness of this approach is reflected by our Q2 results. Q2 revenues were up 2.2% versus the same quarter a year ago. However, GAAP EPS of $0.42 more than tripled from the same quarter in 2009, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.47 were up more than 27% from Q2 last year. Miles will walk you through the numbers in more detail in a few moments but before he does, I will briefly address three topics. 
First, I'll discuss benefits that we are seeing from our One RR Donnelley strategy; second, I'll point out some examples of initiatives that are creating new revenue opportunities; and third, I'll highlight some important achievements during the quarter that reflect our employees' continuing commitment to excellence.
Let's begin with our One RR Donnelley strategy, which we see as having three important dimensions. The first dimension refers to the way that we approach our customers. During the second quarter, we were awarded customer contracts whose aggregate value approached $2 billion. These long-term agreements won on four continents reflect the unique breadth, depth and geographic reach of our product and service offering. Many of these agreements are for multiple product and service lines that draw on several RR Donnelley capabilities. In essence, the One RR Donnelley strategy means that we, as the leading global provider of integrated communications solutions, are uniquely able to provide differentiated services to our customers. Let me share a few examples.
We have an extensive pre-media offering which grew out of our traditional relationships with catalogers and publishers. However, as One RR Donnelley, we are applying our unique pre-media technologies to traditional segments that we serve. ShareStream is our online workflow management system used as designers and others create and collaborate on materials that can be both printed and published on the Internet. We recently won all of a major healthcare institution's extensive forms and labels products because we applied ShareStream to the complex task of managing the hospital's documents, which number in the thousands. The before and after solution for the document review and approval workflow that our sales team created is striking. We did not earn this business just by bidding against other printers. We earned it by providing an expanded service offering that saves our customers remarkable amounts of expensive cycle time. The key is that this value-added service is not confined to a traditional silo or niche. It's expanding into applications across our platform.
Another example, we are a leader in using digital imaging to help our customers talk to their customers in a one-to-one voice. You most frequently see this kind of personalization in direct response and TransPromo communications. But we're expanding our offering by bringing it into the catalogers' world. In short, this digital imaging solution lets a cataloger tailor offers based on their customers' prior purchases. Now when you receive a catalog, choose what to buy and place your order, that information can wind up shaking a unique offer you'll receive when your next catalog arrives. In the past, the number of options for personalizing catalogs was less extensive than those available for conventional direct mail. One RR Donnelley is narrowing that gap. 
The second dimension of our One RR Donnelley strategy is technology development and utilization. Here's an example of what we mean by applying a One RR Donnelley approach to emerging technologies. Quick response or two-dimensional barcodes are creating links between printed and online content. Download a free app, point your Smart phone at a printed 2D barcode and you're immediately taken to the appropriate Web or mobile Internet site. In essence, these codes make print instantly interactive. 
We believe that we are positioned to help the broadest range of customers apply this emerging interactive technology across the broadest range of applications, including product packaging, in-store signage, direct mailing, magazines, catalogs, directed of an industrial [ph] (22:11) labels and many, many more.
Earlier this week, we officially opened a new research and development center, which features expanded engineering, printed electronics, inks and materials labs. Our own in-house technological and material innovation are supplemented by our external activities such as our sponsorship arrangement with the MIT Media Labs. This sponsorship gives us special access to the latest in a range of innovations. As our internal and external R&D functions continue to develop new products and services, we will add them to our industry-leading platform and sell them into the industry's broadest range of applications. We do not believe that any other company in our industry can take advantage of as many ways to benefit from innovations as RR Donnelley can.
The third dimension of our One RR Donnelley strategy is performance consistency across our global platform. Whether we are sourcing components and packaging them with the hottest consumer electronics in Europe, producing guides in China that are being distributed at the Shanghai World Expo, managing over 35,000 rail moves a year through our logistics operations or designing, photographing, printing and distributing the supplements you take with you shopping on Sunday afternoon, our facilities are applying common standards for safety, quality, service, sustainability and more. This performance consistency ensures that our brand is associated with excellence around the world, enables us to maximize our leverage advantages in every aspect of our business. One RR Donnelley is not merely a slogan. It makes a crucial difference.
The second topic I'll touch on is the increasing number of initiatives that are creating new revenue opportunities. Let me use RR Donnelley's innovative ProteusJet system as an example. A recent PrintWeek article highlighting our proprietary ProteusJet digital printing unit said, ""RR Donnelley has been ahead of the curve in all aspects of digital printing."" One of the factors that we see as unique is our ability to apply R&D innovations to multiple applications across multiple customer segments, each of which can lead to new revenue opportunities. 
For example, we began by using ProteusJet to drive enhanced TransPromo value for the telecom, financial services and other customers for whom we print and mail billing statements. 
Next, we moved it into the book-publishing world. We have integrated our ProteusJet digital presses with in-line binding equipment for exceptionally efficient digital book production. This is how publishers open up their backlist to create new revenue. It will allow us to help them to get at the fundamental supply chain inefficiencies that tend to prevent publishers from matching the most efficient production method to consumer demand. 
Just a few weeks ago, we announced another first involving ProteusJet. It is the first high-resolution high-speed digital web offset press combination. This modular installation enables digital color imaging across the full width of the press to give direct marketers exceptional design and production flexibility. Again, our One RR Donnelley strategy continues to drive innovative solutions for our customers and provide new incremental revenue streams in areas as diverse as financial services, publishing, fundraising, telecommunications, retailing and more.
Finally, before I turn it over to Miles, I want to highlight some important achievements during the quarter that reflect our employees' continuing commitment to excellence. Though we talk a great deal about technology, ours is still a business rooted in craftsmanship and service. Working to accurately bring our customers' brands to life in their communications, even as they present us with an endless series of time-sensitive deadlines is an everyday challenge for our employees. They consistently rise to that challenge, as illustrated by the awards that we received. 
Our performance continues to be recognized by our customers. For example, AT&T Advertising Solutions recognized our employees' efforts with its Gold Supplier Quality Alliance Award and Best Buy named our Lancaster, Pennsylvania operations as its top-performing print facility. 
Fewer than 2% of printed samples that producers submit for judging are recognized with Sappi North American Printer of the Year silver awards. Yet, RR Donnelley took home several that were earned across different segments of our platform. Out of the silver award winners in each of the 10 finalist categories, one is selected to receive recognition with a gold award. RR Donnelley's craftsmanship was recognized with two of those gold North American awards. No other company received multiple gold honors. 
Our people make a qualitative difference for our customers. We believe that these important recognitions reflect the fact that as we take out cost, we do not compromise our ability to deliver the quality and innovative services that differentiates RR Donnelley from our competitors. 
Similarly, we do not take shortcuts with regard to sustainability. During the quarter, another of our facilities earned the ISO 14001 environmental certification, and we continue to pursue a number of important sustainability initiatives. 
Most important, we never compromise employee safety. A number of facilities achieved important safety milestones during the quarter, including our operations in Dongguan province in China, which reached 10 million consecutive working hours without a day away injury. Our experience is that safety is the first and most important measure of operational excellence. The formula we continue to follow, our One RR Donnelley strategy, which we believe is resulting in an expanding range of new revenue opportunities, plus our company's commitment to performance excellence, equate to results that we are very, very proud of.

Our second quarter results showed substantial improvement as GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.42 exceeded our second quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share by $0.30. And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.47 exceeded second q",1452,"Thanks, Tom. Our second quarter results showed substantial improvement as GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.42 exceeded our second quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share by $0.30. And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.47 exceeded second quarter 2009 by $0.10. Top line growth, a favorable tax rate and a few other key factors, all of which I will discuss in greater detail, contributed to this improvement.
We are pleased to report that we achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 2.2% in the second quarter. The first quarter with positive revenue growth since the second quarter of 2008. Furthermore, June has been our fourth consecutive month of year-over-year top line growth. And while comparables become more challenging, we are optimistic that we will continue to achieve positive revenue growth in the back half of the year. 
Increased volume in most of our operating units was the primary driver of our 2.2% sales increase over the second quarter of 2009. Similar to the first quarter, lower paper sales did a lower paper prices and the mix of paper used by our customers negatively impacted sales growth. The unfavorable impact in the second quarter was approximately 109 basis points.
GAAP income from operations was $175.3 million in the quarter, $40.3 million higher than in the second quarter of 2009. Included in these amounts were $10.7 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $3.3 million of acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $48.2 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $1.4 million of acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter of 2009. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our earnings release.
Non-GAAP income improved as well. We generated $189.3 million in non-GAAP income from operations, $4.7 million more than we generated in the second quarter of 2009. In addition to volume growth, an increased recovery on print-related by-products and lower depreciation and amortization expenses were only partially offset by price erosion and higher incentive compensation and benefits-related expenses, including a $10 million increase in pension and post-retirement benefits expense. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact our year-over-year earnings comparison. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.2% and was significantly lower than the comparable rate of 37.5% in the same period last year, primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in Latin America in the second quarter of this year. 
Now I'll discuss our operating results by segment. Year-over-year sales in our U.S. Print and Related Services segment improved 1.6% to $1.8 billion in the quarter, including an unfavorable impact of approximately 130 basis points related to lower paper prices and the mix of paper used by our customers. We saw revenue growth in seven of the nine reporting units, with the exceptions being Magazine Catalog and Retail Inserts and Office Products. 
Within the Magazine Catalog and Retail Inserts Reporting unit, the majority of the revenue decline was due to lower paper sales and work mix, as unit volume was essentially flat. Most product offerings continued to be impacted by price erosion, in line with historical trends although we expect these operations to benefit from our One RR Donnelley focus and the growing momentum behind the enterprise selling initiatives that Tom discussed earlier.
Our International segment's reported sales were $599.3 million and grew 4.3% from the second quarter of 2009. The segment sales growth was driven by higher volume from all reporting units except Canada and Business Process Outsourcing units. 
The volume decline in Business Process Outsourcing was due to the decision we made last year to terminate a significant long-term customer contract, enabling us to exit from certain unprofitable operations in this area. Continued price erosion partially offset the volume growth in the second quarter. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact the year-over-year revenue comparison.
Our non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses of $42.9 million increased by $19.2 million from the second quarter of 2009. Pension and other benefits-related expenses, including healthcare as well as our non-cash LIFO inventory provision, increased year-over-year, partially offset by a favorable reduction in our workers' compensation expense. 
Capital spending was $54.6 million in the quarter, $17.4 million more than in the second quarter of 2009. This year-over-year increase supports the several digital initiatives and new customer wins and renewals that we have announced and will continue to announce going forward. As such, we are revising our full year capital spending guidance to a range of $200 million to $225 million.
Interest expense in the quarter was almost $53 million and was $7 million favorable to the second quarter of 2009. Our May 2010 debt maturity and August 2009 tenders were the primary drivers of the year-over-year decrease in net interest expense. 
We continue to maintain and improve upon our already favorable debt maturity profile. In the quarter, we issued $400 million of 7 5/8% senior notes due June 2020, on which the first interest payment is due in December of this year. The proceeds from the offering were used in part to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility that were drawn to repay the May 2010 maturity. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding a portion of the purchase price of the Bowne acquisition, which we expect to close later this year.
As of June 30, 2010, our debt was $3.4 billion, with the next scheduled maturity of $159 million not due until January of 2012. Our total debt is approximately 82% fixed at an average interest rate of 7.4%. We are still targeting a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0x to 2.5x on a sustainable basis, recognizing that under certain circumstances, we maybe at or above the high end of that range. 
Based on our second quarter results and our view for the second half, we are refining our full year guidance. Let me share with you some of these key expectations, all of which exclude the impact of the Bowne acquisition.
We expect year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 1%. Compared to our previous guidance of low single-digit growth, this change is solely a reflection of the revised impact of expected foreign exchange rates on our top line. For the full year, we now expect foreign exchange rates to have a slightly negative year-over-year impact on revenue. Our previous guidance assumed foreign exchange rates consistent with the rates we saw early in 2010, which would have had positive year-over-year impact on revenue. However, this revised assumption should not have a material impact on earnings. In fact, we now expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 7.3% to 7.5%, an increase of 30 basis points from our previously communicated range. And while we're not providing details on how this revenue and margin guidance will specifically impact each of the third and fourth quarters, I would like to remind everybody that the third quarter year-over-year comparison will be impacted by a few items that favorably impacted the third quarter of 2009 and are not going to repeat again this year.
First, we recognized a $13.1 million benefit in the third quarter of last year related to a reduction on our LIFO inventory provision. This year, we expect a $3 million expense in the third quarter related to LIFO. So the expected year-over-year unfavorable swing is $16.1 million. 
The second item is related to a fee we received for a contract transition in the third quarter of 2009. The fee amounted to $12.5 million, with operating margin of essentially 100%. Together, these two items negatively impact the third quarter year-over-year earnings comparison by $28.6 million. 
We expect full year depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $540 million, $15 million lower than previously estimated. Interest expense is now projected to be approximately $225 million, an increase of $15 million from our previous guidance. The increase is primarily due to the recent $400 million bond offering. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate will be in the range of 29% to 31%, 100 basis points lower than previously communicated, largely due to the valuation allowance release recognized in the second quarter. This estimate could continue to be impacted by business trends affecting different countries in which we do business or by changes in tax laws. 
We continue to expect the fully diluted share base of approximately 210 million shares. As I noted earlier, our CapEx will be in the range of $200 million to $225 million. And finally, we continue to expect our free cash flow or operating cash flow less CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. And with that, I'll return you to Tom."

One, I don't think I know our One RR Donnelley strategy is really resonating with customers. The product and platform that we've got today is nothing near what -- go back 10 years ago with what Donnelly had. And Donnelly's customer profile back then was publishers, catalogers, retailers, capital markets, financial, compliance, directories. Today, our customer profile is what I've just said, plus it's the Fortune 1000, plus it's government, education, healthcare, medium, large, small businesses. We have about 65,000 customers that spend anywhere between a few hundred dollars with us on an annual basis to a few hundred million dollars with us on an annual basis. So as a result of that, the value creation that we bring to our customers is the ability to continue to compress their costs by leveraging all of their purchases and improving their return on investment. And in order to bring this value proposition to customers, which we don't believe anybody else can, you need to have that supply chain scale. And you need to have the expertise to meet the customers' needs. We have all that. And again, if somebody wanted to try and replicate that right now and compete at the scale that we're at, they're going to have to spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe even billions of dollars, in order to go ahead and build the platform that we've built. The resources that we have, as you know, we've got the financial strength. We've proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that we can integrate strategic acquisitions seamlessly. We've got proprietary technology. I've talked to you about geographic. We've got a great workforce. We've got procurement leverage. We're now really hitting our stride on the consultative sales organization. And we've got the ability to demonstrate to adapt to changing times.

And again, that's sort of where when you talk -- what we saw last year was -- I would say that I don't think anyone really had experienced in the business field what was going on in the first half of last year. And that's sort of where when I talk about the tempered enthusiasm that we've sort of coined the phrase. You've got significant higher corporate earnings right now. You've got leverage that's lower. You got companies that are flush with cash. You've got inflation at almost zero. Interest rates are basically zero. And normally, we would say, ""Hey, this is the perfect environment for growth."" But unfortunately, the lack of clarity over taxes, ordinary income, capital gains, dividends and the uncertainty that happened that we feel surrounding public policies, whether it's still around healthcare, financial service companies might outweigh what the above tailwinds that I just mentioned that we have. That is why going into the back half of the year, we're optimistic about 2010 but at the same time, we want to be realistic. Last year, the U.S. consumer -- and even though we're a global company, the key for us is still the U.S. consumer. How much less discretionary income are they going to have as a result of taking into account the increases in taxes and healthcare? Are lenders going to be willing to lend? Right now, we're seeing companies brand themselves. We're seeing companies compete for new customers. We're seeing companies want to stay in front of their customers via multi-channel approaches. This is something that wasn't happening last year. This is great news. If the U.S. consumer continues to respond, so will these companies, we believe, our customers in the back half of the year. If the U.S. customer pulls back or goes into hiding because they're having less discretionary income, then I think that is going to impact the back half of the year. With all that said, we're still going to stick to our plan which we believe is working very, very well. As I said earlier, it's resonating with our customers every day. And we've got organic growth this year in spite of year-over-year lower paper prices and with the impact of foreign exchanges. So we think we've sized ourselves correctly and are looking forward to what these next couple of months are going to bring in 2010."

We are seeing companies spend dollars on communications. We have multi-channel approaches, whether it's digital, Internet, hardcopy, we get the ability to sit there and be sort of at the lead of what's taking place. Back-to-school's coming up. Obviously, the holiday season's coming up. Tough to say where things are going to go again because the acceleration of change is just so quick. But we're optimistic about what we think could take place in the back half of the year. And again to us, to me, it's the U.S. consumer that's going to drive the global efforts that are going to take place. So if U.S. consumers are there, unemployment is still high, but we seem to be plowing through this particular quarter, despite what the unemployment numbers are, we'll see."

So I would tell you it's the ability by having the scale with our other products and services, the transactional print, the long-run print, the tonnage print, however you want to phrase it, with what we're able to move. I think I talked about over 35,000 logistics moves on an annual basis we have. We touch, we believe, more than 50% of the standard mail still in this country from the last numbers that we saw.

We continue to assist the Post Office in their efforts to reduce costs Co-pal, Co-tray [ph] (54:30), other ways that we've brought technology in for the Postal Service. Jack Potter, again, the interesting thing there for the United States Postal Service is it's the only government agency that is being asked to be run with the P&L. So it's unique from that's standpoint in D.C. We need a postal service in this country that can maintain rates that are fair to all delivery categories, keep the service level high. Reward those like RR Donnelley who helped perform considerable cost avoidance, for only the United States Postal Service but obviously, that should roll through to the citizens of the United States. Operate efficiently and just make sure they have the latest technology. So I think this being a midterm election, the debate that will take place as it relates to the rate increase, the exigent rate increase over the price cap is going to be very, very interesting. We think it's going to be highly debated. There's the opportunity where we understand that USPS and Postal Regulatory Commission believes that they've overpaid into the Civil Service retirement system $50 billion, which look, it's got to come from someplace. So if you move it from there, it should help the USPS with their cost structure. But obviously, it's going to hurt someplace else. So I mean that is going to be a long debate. But again, this is an opportunity for us because of our scale here, because of how we can penetrate into the postal system, we look at that in 2011 as a way we've got to mitigate those costs for our customers.

It's clear that's the complexity and volatility have become permanent, not only in our industries but in other industries. And our job is to keep it simple for our customers. Technology can be both a positive and a negative when you talk about print. You're going to be impacted no matter what, it just depends on which way. Us having the ability to be innovative and as I talked about on the call, ProteusJet being one of the ways that we're going about this. We can do runs now or we can do jobs for customers as low as one, go to 50, go to 100, we can go to up to millions. So what this technology's enabled us to do, we become channel-agnostic, if you want to look at it that way, to whether or not we're getting the digital files in, we can go ahead and put that back over the Internet. We can go ahead and put it into hardcopy. Not a lot of people can do that. So technology for us, again, we look at it as it's going to make the supply chain more efficient. Technology is not going to kill print. It's going to evolve print, which again, John and Dan like to point to the television, whatever it was, 60, 70 years ago. That was going to kill magazines, books, directories. If anything, it became more of a product offering there. The Internet was going to kill catalogs. If I look around right now, we know that the good catalogers know that they have to print. We've got to mitigate their cost as they do that for them but they know if they don't put things in the mail, they're not going to be as successful. We continue to look at print that way. Print's not going to go away. We're going to evolve it. We're going to help evolve it. Our customers are going to evolve it and it's going to be here. So it's exciting times from that standpoint. We've got to continue to stay ahead. We've got to continue to help our customers, help them reduce their costs and get a bigger return on their investment.

If unemployment comes down, that will be great. And if the U.S. consumer has this discretionary income, I think again, that will help all of us in every single industry vertical. Magazine pages are up slightly but again, it's not anywhere near where they were. We're having good days because we're with good titles, good publishers. But again, I think when you look at what is that industry going to be down the road, I think everyone's still looking to see how things shape out and how things come back. Will it come back to the levels that it was earlier in the decade or late in the decade, I should say? I think that, that's a tough call to say. But again, if it does, we're ready for it.

Good morning, everyone. You've heard us the phrase One RR Donnelley to describe the strategic framework that guides our approach to winning and expanding customer relationships, driving cost savings, integrating acquisitions and maximizing the value of our product development initiatives.
During the third quarter, our revenues increased 1% compared to the same period a year ago. We believe that the momentum we have established through our One RR Donnelley strategy is better reflected by the increase that we experienced when we exclude the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, lower paper sales due to the mix of paper selected by our customers, and the one-time effect of the $12.5 million fee we received in third quarter 2009 for the transition of a customer's contract. Collectively, these items negatively impacted our revenue growth in the quarter by just over 200 basis points. Before Miles takes you through the quarter in detail, I will address three of the interrelated benefits associated with our One RR Donnelley strategy.
First, we are demonstrating a continuing ability to move from transactional to contractual customer relationships. Second, we are seeing customers embrace the unique ability RR Donnelley has developed to provide end-to-end solutions for them. And third, the digital initiatives that we are implementing are not just offering an alternative to conventional print production, they are helping to open the door to entirely new opportunities with customers. I'll begin with a shift from transactional to contractual relationships, which is driven by the intersection of customers' goals and our ability to meet their emerging needs.
The economic downturn that began in 2008 knocked down a lot of silos within organizations and increased their desire to put together programs that would maximize their procurement efficiencies. As an accelerating rate, we have seen parts of our customers' organizations being brought together for the first time to look for a single supplier that can meet all of their diverse needs. This plays directly into one of RR Donnelley's greatest strengths: The broad range of capabilities that we can use to help customers leverage and integrate their purchases with a single source provider. Now understand that these capabilities are not confined to the length or width of a printing press. The services that we provide extend across the integrated communication supply chain. This gives us a significant competitive advantage as our customers continue to reduce their supply bases in order to buy smaller and to more effectively integrate their communications.
For example, during the quarter, we were awarded a multimillion dollar multiyear contract by Prudential PLC to manage its U.K. enterprise-wide customer communications management operations. Our solution includes managing the production of marketing collateral, the production and delivery of outbound communications, inbound document processing, on-site management of multifunctional devices and print rooms, as well as scanning, indexing and archiving. RR Donnelley will also work collaboratively with Prudential to introduce communication innovations that will continue to help enhance its customers' relationships. This agreement runs to 2021, which demonstrates the enduring nature of our relationships with customers.
Being on-site and deeply involved with N10 processes also positions RR Donnelley to take advantage of new opportunities with customers like Prudential while these projects are still in the development phase. That gives us a chance to help engineer cost effectiveness into these programs as we make recommendations about how best they can be accomplished on our unmatched platform. 
Another way to illustrate our ability to develop comprehensive contractual relationships is to consider where you would expect RR Donnelley's capabilities to address a pharmaceutical company's needs. Typically, the spectrum of printed products would come to mind, but that would be just the beginning of what could form the basis for a contractual relationship. For example, through our logistics operations, we provide expedited services, actually coordinating delivery of pharmaceutical products to drugstores throughout the week. We can place a team of people on-site to manage design of the communication material, coordinate the production of different departments' communications programs and draw on our photography studios to create digital assets that will come to life in print and electronic media. We can provide complex kitting and fulfillment services to send the pharma reps the clinicals and collateral that they use as they make sales calls. And much more, take these services individually and their organizations that complete with us in each one of those areas. Take them collectively and we believe that we occupy a distinct space. RR Donnelley is uniquely equipped to provide a suite of services and bond them all into a comprehensive contractual relationship.
The increase traction that we are experiencing with this strategy is reflected by the double-digit revenue increases we experienced in our logistics and premedia reporting units, which were up in the third quarter as compared to the same quarter a year ago by almost 21% and 17%, respectively. These growing offerings are becoming an even larger part of RR Donnelley's mix. For example, our logistic unit is now larger than our commercial printing unit when measured by revenue. Inbound Logistics Magazine recently named RR Donnelley as a top 100 third-party logistics provider. And I should note that our logistic operations do not include a capital-intensive fleet of trucks. A substantial part of our expertise lies in managing and coordinating shipments on other people's trucks. While print is of course a vital part of our mix, please do not think of RR Donnelley exclusively as a print provider. We are also seeing innovation play an important role in helping us to differentiate the offering that we can bundle into contractual relationships. For example, consider again a pharmaceutical company and its large sales organization. Reps make large numbers of calls every day, each of which often lasts literally for only a few minutes. To follow up, they would like to send handwritten notes to the doctors that they have called on, but the sheer number of sales calls involved makes it virtually impossible. To provide a solution for one former company, we draw on our computer programming, digital printing and fulfillment capabilities.
Now when the reps complete a sales call, they use a mobile device to enter the details into our Customer Relationship Management or CRM database. The reps upload the information from that database and it is sent to RR Donnelley. We use digital technology to generate and send notecards to the doctors in a variety of about 20 fonts that provide a handwritten look. These are cross matched to similarly addressed envelopes and dropped into the mainstream from our facility.
Two points. First, this kind of creative solution that helps our customers drive revenue and increase ROI is compelling as a contractual relationships are considered. Second, we have not traditionally been in the note card business. This kind of application is an example of the new opportunities that digital technologies create. We see the creation of new applications through RR Donnelley innovations as an important top line opportunity. During the quarter, revenue in our variable print offering, which uses these digital technologies, grew 5% over the prior year and we believe that this reflects continuing growth opportunities. 
The second outcome of our One RR Donnelley strategy is that we are seeing customers embrace what we believe to be our unique ability to assemble total solutions for them. This is has a number of dimensions. For example, it includes our ability to draw our International resources to support domestic and global customers. During the quarter, LEGO Group shows RR Donnelley to provide key components of its product packaging in the Americas and Europe. Underlying this relationship is our ability to provide consistent service in a complex, multilingual environment that draws upon our expertise in answering short-cycle packaging forecast with precise deliveries of product. We continue to see top line opportunities present themselves across the packaging supply chain, which we address with premedia, print production and logistic capabilities. We saw the strength of this offering reflected in the results of our platform in Asia. Revenues in Asia, our largest international reporting unit, were up 25% versus the same quarter a year ago.
Another dimension in total solutions involves our ability to help customers execute multimedia campaigns. For example, we helped a multichannel retailer assemble and execute a promotion that involved Facebook, smartphones, digital cameras and not coincidentally, printed elements. In this instance, counter cards and in-store handouts with a delivery mechanism for promotional piece. Shoppers in the college-age demographic were invited to take the promotional piece, photograph themselves interacting with it, upload it to Facebook and then vote on who had posted the best picture. Print point-of-purchase merchandising materials reinforce the program. All of the printed elements featured two dimensional or quick response codes. These printed quick response codes act as automatic web addresses. You just point your smartphone at the print pieces and an app scans the code and loads the URL onto your device. These quick response codes in essence make printing materials interactive. This particular solution grew out of our design print and fulfillment resources, but we are seeing quick response codes being used in magazines, catalogs and in a host of other printed applications. Our ability to create total solutions increasingly extends into our resources for helping publishers and other customers integrate new media into their communications.
For example, RR Donnelley complements printed titles with hundreds of our DigiMag versions for onscreen reading. In addition, we are quickly introducing new mobile apps for customers. We already have 16 for iPads, iPhones and other another devices with many more in our pipeline. We are also moving our own technologies onto mobile devices. For example, this quarter we took CustomPoint, our proprietary ordering system, mobile. CustomPoint allows customers to place orders and monitor the status all in a self-serve basis. They do this more than 2 million times a year. This system is key in enabling contractual relationships for traditionally transactional products. We believe that we are the first to bring ordering and order status capabilities like CustomPoint to a fully realized mobile environment, which we have optimized for the iPhone and BlackBerry, but that is acceptable by all mobile browsers.
The third element that I want to address in describing our One RR Donnelley strategy is the digital initiative that we are continuing to implement. Again, our digital initiatives not just offer an alternative to conventional print production. They are helping to open the door to entirely new opportunities with customers. For example, during the quarter, we announced another innovation. The industry's first 60-inch wide high-speed digital press. This particular expansion of our proprietary ProteusJet line is designed to increase speed and efficiency in producing on-demand books. For publishers, enhanced digital production offers the potential to ship into new ways of marketing and selling printed content. We are not naïve to the role that e-books and tablets are playing and will continue to play. However, the model that supported their introduction as an alternative delivery mechanism to consumers and as a means of helping to minimize the supply chain waste, characteristic of solely conventional print production has now changed. The increasing efficiency digital printing and binding lines that we are building offer publishers a way to calibrate demand to production with exceptional precision and provide consumers with a way to access backlist for fast delivery.
In addition, our ProteusJet technology is at work in direct mail applications and TransPromo statement processing. The breadth of our product line enables us to leverage this in our other breakthrough innovations in multiple business units, vertical segments and geographies. These benefits of our One RR Donnelley strategy are expanding and enhancing our connectivity with customers, and we expect this strategy to drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
And now with that, let me turn it over to Miles to take you through the quarter in more detail."

For four consecutive quarters now, our GAAP earnings per diluted share outperformed the prior year. Our third quarter 2010 GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.25 exceeded third quarter 2009 by $0.19 or 317%. On a non-GAAP basis, we delivered $0.44 of earnings per share, a $0.10 decline from the third quarter of 2009.
I mentioned on our last earnings call that the third quarter would be a difficult year-over-year comparison for us as last year's third quarter results included a few favorable items that were not going to be occurring again in Q3 of this year. I will discuss these items in more detail a bit later.
I'm very pleased with our continued revenue growth. Third quarter sales grew 1.0% to $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year. As Tom mentioned earlier, we realized this growth in spite of the unfavorable impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates, lower paper sales and the fees we received in the third quarter of 2009 for the transition of a customer contract. In aggregate, these three items negatively impacted our year-over-year sales growth by over 200 basis points. Adjusting for these items, the remaining growth was driven by increased volume across the platform, partially offset by continued price erosion. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we again expect to see modest revenue growth even with the expected continuation of unfavorable foreign exchange rates through the end of the year.
GAAP income from operations was $148.7 million in the quarter, $55.3 million higher than in the third quarter of 2009. Included in these amounts were $48.7 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $2.6 million of acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $131.7 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $0.1 million of acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2009. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our earnings release.
Non-GAAP operating income in the current quarter was $200.0 million, down $25.2 million from third quarter of 2009. Three key items caused this decrease. First, we had a year-over-year increase of $16.1 million in our LIFO inventory provision. You may recall that we recorded a benefit of $13.1 million in the third quarter last year. That compares to a $3.0 million expense in this year's third quarter. Second, the one-time customer contract transition fee that we received in the third quarter of 2009 added $12.2 million to operating income last year. And third, we had an $11.9 million increase in our pension and postretirement benefits expense in 2010 versus 2009, an increase which is consistent with the increases seen in the first and second quarters.
Collectively, these three factors negatively impacted the change in non-GAAP operating income by over $40 million. On the other hand, volume growth and increased recovery on print-related by-products and lower depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by price erosion consistent with historical levels were the primary factors that helped us narrow the year-over-year decline in non-GAAP operating income. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 35.7% compared to 31.3% in the third quarter of 2009. This increase was primarily caused by the write-off of certain tax assets in Latin America in the third quarter of this year.
Now I'll discuss our operating results by segment. Third quarter sales in our U.S. Print and Related Services segment grew 2.0% over the third quarter of 2009 to $1.9 billion. As in the second quarter, we continue to realize a shift in the mix of paper used by our customers, which negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 93 basis points. This impact was primarily reflected in our magazine catalog and retail inserts and book and directory reporting units. Volume increased year-over-year to nearly all of our offerings, most notably in our logistics, financial print and premedia offerings, while the unfavorable pricing environment in line with historical trends continue to put pressure on our sales growth. Sales in our International segment totaled $626.7 million in the third quarter, down 1.8% or $11.6 million from the same period last year. Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and the $12.5 million fee we received for the transition of a customer contract in the third quarter last year negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 510 basis points. We saw higher volume in Asia, Europe and Latin America, partially offset by lower volume in Business Process Outsourcing, Global Turnkey and Canada. The volume decline in our Business Process Outsourcing unit was due to the termination of a significant long-term customer contract last year. Price erosion, most notably in Asia and Europe, partially offset the volume gains.
Our non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses of $39.9 million increased by $41.6 million from the third quarter of 2009. As I noted earlier, our LIFO inventory provision in the quarter was $16.1 million higher than last year as we recognized the $13.1 million benefit in 2009 compared to a $3.0 million expense in the current quarter. Additionally, higher pension and other benefits-related expenses, including healthcare as well as higher provision for bad debt, comprised the balance of the increase over 2009.
Capital spending was $50.4 million in the third quarter compared to $40.8 million in the third quarter of 2009. Interest expense in the quarter, of $57.6 million was $2.0 million favorable to the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to lower average borrowings and the favorable impact of our interest rate swaps. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2009, we recognized interest expense related to the acceleration of unamortized discounts related to the debt repurchases we made that quarter. We continue to maintain our favorable debt maturity profile.
As of September 30, 2010, our debt was $3.4 billion with no maturities in the next 15 months. Our total debt is approximately 81% fixed at an average interest rate of 7.4%. Cash on hand at September 30, 2010, was $732 million, of which just over half is in the U.S. We continue to expect the Bowne acquisition to close this year and plan on using much of this U.S. cash, along with drawings on our revolving credit facility, to fund the purchase price.
With just two months left in the year, we have some updates to our full year 2010 guidance. Consistent with our previous guidance, these expectations all exclude the impact of the pending Bowne acquisition. We expect year-over-year top line growth in the range of 0.5% to 1.0% as we expect to continue to be constrained by foreign exchange rates and lower paper sales for the balance of the year. We continue to expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 7.3% to 7.5%. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at approximately $535 million for the year. Both our CapEx and interest expense are expected to be approximately $225 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 32%. This estimate could continue to be impacted by business trends affecting different countries in which we do business or by changes in tax laws. We continue to expect the fully diluted share base to be approximately 210 million shares. And lastly, we expect our operating cash flow, less CapEx, to be approximately $600 million.
And with that, I'll return you to Tom."

Second, all of us at RR Donnelley would like to thank Jack Potter, who retires as the longest-serving Postmaster General since 1814 for his energetic and innovative leadership at the USPS. We'd also like to welcome Patrick Donahoe as he assumes the supporting role. We look forward to working with him. Mail is crucial to driving 360-degree communications that continue to prove their effectiveness to marketers and other communicators everyday.
Third, although technology plays an important role in our growth strategy, our employees never lose sight of the importance of craftsmanship and quality in establishing and maintaining customer relationships. During the quarter, we again, brought home more than our share of print industry awards, and several of our facilities achieved safety milestones. We continue to regard safety as the first and most important indicator of operational excellence.
And now operator, please open it up for questions."

I think, Charlie, if anything this quarter and the second quarter, we're demonstrating that this platform is solid and strong and can benefit during a slow economic recovery that we're experiencing. We're not dependent upon any one thing. We're not dependent upon ad pages, the financial market, even consumer confidence. We've got multiple sales channels that are starting to hit on all cylinders. We have targeted sales specialists. We have global print management, which I will talk about more in 2011. That is gaining traction, more traction every day. And something I talked about today regarding CustomPoint. Just to give you an idea how we're penetrating our customers' organizations. And this is how we're taking transactional business into a contractual business. Our CustomPoint rollout management system, they are proprietary to RR Donnelley. I think we look at the most recent trend reports that show our customers placing almost 90% more orders with us through our own systems, than through commercially available systems. When customers use our systems, it creates sticky relationships and creates a switching barrier. And to give you an idea what that means, I mean, we're dealing with the top apparel company. You know, two of the top six of the automotive retailers. The number one beverage company, eight of the top some 15 commercial banks, some of the top 10 managed care companies, three medical companies and equipment companies. Obviously, the top Pharmaceutical companies and some of the top specialty retailers. When we're able to do this, the vast majority of orders that come to us electronically are for printing, but they're also for added value services such as inventory management, complex kitting and distribution and variable digital printing. So when you take that into account and then you look at the rollout management system that we've felt designed for retailers, there has the complex task of re-merchandising stores. We're able to identify store profile information, house it in a database then automatically create kitting and fulfillment orders based on those store profiles. So if a store is getting window posters, we know exactly the number that matches the number of display windows that they have. And this system applies not only to retail, but it applies to retail banks, insurance company and any other brick and mortars that are out there. And it is a great example of why we feel that we can take these capabilities and move across the One RR Donnelley platform to look for other industry variables. So as we sit here -- obviously, a long winded answer for you, but as we sit here, we see that we've got the ability to continue to penetrate customers in all their verticals and provide them a solution that no other person, no other company out there, we think, can provide them."

Donnelley & Sons Company","Executives","First of, no, we're not deemphasizing anything in our industry. But let me go back to the C-level comments. Our mission since day one has been how can we reduce your total overall cost of ownership and improve your return on investment? What we built here",654,"First of, no, we're not deemphasizing anything in our industry. But let me go back to the C-level comments. Our mission since day one has been how can we reduce your total overall cost of ownership and improve your return on investment? What we built here has allowed people to take advantage of that. And the C-level suites, I think, the Prudential is a very good example of obviously long-term agreement with the company that is not something that they take lightly and is a significant part of their business. And I think more and more companies, both Fortune 1000 companies, as well as publishers, are starting to embrace what we're able to bring to the table because it makes life easier for them. In its simplest form, we can reduce your cost, we can help you with your customers and we make it easier for you that you can just deal you have sort of one person to go ahead and talk to from that standpoint. From the de-emphasizing the long-run business, my goodness, I mean, if you look at most of our announcements, a lot of your announcements this year have been in that area where we be there one new business or we've got renewals that have taken place. Definitely competitive business, but there is opportunities there for us to help our publishers. Our publishers are becoming multimedia channels themselves, multimedia providers. So what can we do from that standpoint to help them? I think if you look at magazines, I think there's -- our numbers show that there's been 176 new launches in the first nine months of 2010, that's versus 259 in 2009. But I still think those are oppressive numbers given the extremely challenging print advertising environment that's out there. There's been 127 closures versus 383 closures last year, so that bodes well. In online titles only, there's been 26 this year versus 64 last year. So we believe publishers are using social media sites to help build relationships and engage their audiences. And social media can significantly enhance existing products and drive new revenues, which is good for the publishers, which means it's also good for us because if they are financially strong, so will we. So the way we are evolving print to be more interactive with our customers and end-users is just one of the ways that will we look to improve our customers' return on their investment and then applies to all products and services, not just magazines plus the catalogs retail inserts. We understand that consumers have a lot of media choices out there. We have to make sure the products and services that we have add value, remain vibrant, timely and critical part of consumer's decision-making process or information-gathering process, whatever it may be, and we're doing just that as I indicated in the many examples that we talked about earlier in the speech, and just to keep going on this point to beat it up a little bit. We are still obviously, as I talked about with the USPS this morning, we're are still very active there, which not only impacts the Fortune 1000 companies but obviously has a big impact on publishers. This is one of the reason why the Postal Regulatory Commission's decision to deny the request of UPSP for accident rate increase was so significant. It would have been an added cost to our customers that, again, we also would have to found a way to mitigate. We continue to assist the post office in reducing their cost. I think our technology advancements, when you think about Co-pal, co-tray, Co-mail, our significant influence in the development and implication in the intelligent mail bar code all lead to our customers in reducing their cost. And again, if those themes keep applying. So, no, we're not deemphasizing anything on this platform and nor do I ever see us doing that."

We are making supply chain more efficient. We are making it such that at a cost point, we're compressing the publisher's cost there whatever it is, magazines, books, it does it matter. Catalogs, you go back to a time when the Internet was going to go ahead and knockout the catalog, and I'd say that's probably every quarter. Obviously, it didn't and it became another sales channel for the catalog. We truly believe for publishers that the multichannel approach will continue and the printed product will be there.

We do believe that, that is going to be even more important for us over the next couple of years as we continue to evolve print. The versioning of text data, the personalization of those items, the ability to take electronic -- iPad, computer whatever it may be, BlackBerry device, whatever those devices are that you go in to look at and then send to you a personalized collateral material full-color, glossy. Advertisers still like that because they know they've sent it to you.  They know you don't have to them reach out to them. And as we better and our customers get better in managing data, the ability to on-the-fly get things to people within a 24-hour period, we believe, is going to be very, very significant to this business in the future."

And going back to my earlier comment, is not just about -- we're not dependent upon any one particular area. If financial credit card solicitations start to come back, direct mail starts to come back, we can be there for that. Non-for-profit start to do things, great. More magazine launches, more special editions, our commercial print facilities, we believe that they're started to hit their stride too. So obviously we believe we can improve our margins. I won't give you a number today. We'll talk about that in a couple of months, but we do think there's a lot of upside here if in fact the economy does come back and if it doesn't, we're going to be as we demonstrated these last two quarters, we're going to be okay."

Good morning, everyone. You've heard us the phrase One RR Donnelley to describe the strategic framework that guides our approach to winning and expanding customer relationships, driving cost savings, integrating acquisitions and maximizing the value of our product development initiatives.
During the third quarter, our revenues increased 1% compared to the same period a year ago. We believe that the momentum we have established through our One RR Donnelley strategy is better reflected by the increase that we experience when we exclude the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, lower paper sales due to the mix of paper selected by our customers, and the one-time effect of the $12.5 million fee we received in third quarter 2009 for the transition of a customer's contract. Collectively, these items negatively impacted our revenue growth in the quarter by just over 200 basis points. Before Miles takes you through the quarter in detail, I will address three of the interrelated benefits associated with our One RR Donnelley strategy.
First, we are demonstrating a continuing ability to move from transactional to contractual customer relationships. Second, we are seeing customers embrace the unique ability RR Donnelley has developed to provide end-to-end solutions for them. And third, the digital initiatives that we are implementing are not just offering an alternative to conventional print production, they are helping to open the door to entirely new opportunities with customers. I'll begin with a shift from transactional to contractual relationships, which is driven by the intersection of customers' goals and our ability to meet their emerging needs.
The economic downturn that began in 2008 knocked down a lot of silos within organizations and increased their desire to put together programs that would maximize their procurement efficiencies. As an accelerating rate, we have seen parts of our customers' organizations being brought together for the first time to look for a single supplier that can meet all of their diverse needs. This plays directly into one of RR Donnelley's greatest strengths: The broad range of capabilities that we can use to help customers leverage and integrate their purchases with a single source provider. Now understand that these capabilities are not confined to the length or width of a printing press. The services that we provide extend across the integrated communication supply chain. This gives us a significant competitive advantage as our customers continue to reduce their supply bases in order to buy smaller and to more effectively integrate their communications.
For example, during the quarter, we were awarded a multimillion dollar multiyear contract by Prudential PLC to manage its U.K. enterprise-wide customer communications management operations. Our solution includes managing the production of marketing collateral, the production and delivery of outbound communications, inbound document processing, on-site management of multifunctional devices and print rooms, as well as scanning, indexing and archiving. RR Donnelley will also work collaboratively with Prudential to introduce communication innovations that will continue to help enhance its customers' relationships. This agreement runs to 2021, which demonstrates the enduring nature of our relationships with customers.
Being on-site and deeply involved with N10 processes also positions RR Donnelley to take advantage of new opportunities with customers like Prudential while these projects are still in the development phase. That gives us a chance to help engineer cost effectiveness into these programs as we make recommendations about how best they can be accomplished on our unmatched platform. 
Another way to illustrate our ability to develop comprehensive contractual relationships is to consider where you would expect RR Donnelley's capabilities to address a pharmaceutical company's needs. Typically, the spectrum of printed products would come to mind, but that would be just the beginning of what could form the basis for a contractual relationship. For example, through our logistics operation, we provide expedited services, actually coordinating the delivery of pharmaceutical products to drugstores throughout the week. We can place a team of people on-site to manage design of the communication material, coordinate the production of different departments' communications programs and draw on our photography studios to create digital assets that will come to life in print and electronic media. We can provide complex kitting and fulfillment services to send the pharma reps the clinicals and collateral that they use as they make sales calls. And much more, take these services individually and their organizations that complete with us in each one of those areas. Take them collectively and we believe that we occupy a distinct space. RR Donnelley is uniquely equipped to provide a suite of services and bond them all into a comprehensive contractual relationship.
The increase traction that we are experiencing with this strategy is reflected by the double-digit revenue increases we experienced in our logistics and premedia reporting units, which were up in the third quarter as compared to the same quarter a year ago by almost 21% and 17%, respectively. These growing offerings are becoming an even larger part of RR Donnelley's mix. For example, our logistic unit is now larger than our commercial printing unit when measured by revenue. Inbound Logistic Magazine recently named RR Donnelley as a top 100 third-party logistics provider. And I should note that our logistic operations do not include a capital-intensive fleet of trucks. A substantial part of our expertise lies in managing and coordinating shipments on other people's trucks. While print is of course a vital part of our mix, please do not think of RR Donnelley exclusively as a print provider. We are also seeing innovation play an important role in helping us to differentiate the offering that we can bundle into contractual relationships. For example, consider again a pharmaceutical company and its large sales organization. Reps make large numbers of calls every day, each of which often lasts literally for only a few minutes. To follow up, they would like to send handwritten notes to the doctors that they have called on, but the sheer number of sales calls involved makes it virtually impossible. To provide a solution for one former company, we draw on our computer programming, digital printing and fulfillment capabilities.
Now when the reps complete a sales call, they use a mobile device to enter the details into our Customer Relationship Management or CRM database. The reps upload the information from that database and it is sent to RR Donnelley. We use digital technology to generate and send notecards to the doctors in a variety of about 20 fonts that provide a handwritten look. These are cross matched to similarly addressed envelopes and dropped into the mainstream from our facility.
Two points. First, this kind of creative solution that helps our customers drive revenue and increase ROI is compelling as a contractual relationships are considered. Second, we have not traditionally been in the note card business. This kind of application is an example of the new opportunities that digital technologies create. We see the creation of new applications through RR Donnelley innovations as an important top line opportunity. During the quarter, revenue in our variable print offering, which uses these digital technologies, grew 5% over the prior year and we believe that this reflects continuing growth opportunities. 
The second outcome of our One RR Donnelley strategy is that we are seeing customers embrace what we believe to be our unique ability to assemble total solutions for them. This has a number of dimensions. For example, it includes our ability to draw our International resources to support domestic and global customers. During the quarter, LEGO Group chose RR Donnelley to provide key components of its product packaging in the Americas and Europe. Underlying this relationship is our ability to provide consistent service in a complex, multilingual environment that draws upon our expertise in answering short-cycle packaging forecast with precise deliveries of product. We continue to see top line opportunities present themselves across the packaging supply chain, which we address with premedia, print production and logistic capabilities. We saw the strength of this offering reflected in the results of our platform in Asia. Revenues in Asia, our largest international reporting unit, were up 25% versus the same quarter a year ago.
Another dimension in total solutions involves our ability to help customers execute multimedia campaigns. For example, we helped a multichannel retailer assemble and execute a promotion that involved Facebook, smartphones, digital cameras and not coincidentally, printed elements. In this instance, counter cards and in-store handouts with a delivery mechanism for promotional piece. Shoppers in the college-age demographic were invited to take the promotional piece, photograph themselves interacting with it, upload it to Facebook and then vote on who had posted the best picture. Print point-of-purchase merchandising materials reinforce the program. All of the printed elements featured two dimensional or quick response codes. These printed quick response codes act as automatic web addresses. You just point your smartphone at the printed pieces and an app scans the code and loads the URL onto your device. These quick response codes in essence make printed materials interactive. This particular solution grew out of our design print and fulfillment resources, but we are seeing quick response codes being used in magazines, catalogs and in a host of other printed applications. Our ability to create total solutions increasingly extends into our resources for helping publishers and other customers integrate new media into their communications.
For example, RR Donnelley complements printed titles with hundreds of our DigiMag versions for onscreen reading. In addition, we are quickly introducing new mobile apps for customers. We already have 16 for iPads, iPhones and other another devices with many more in our pipeline. We are also moving our own technologies onto mobile devices. For example, this quarter we took CustomPoint, our proprietary ordering system, mobile. CustomPoint allows customers to place orders and monitor the status all in a self-serve basis. They do this more than 2 million times a year. This system is key in enabling contractual relationships for traditionally transactional products. We believe that we are the first to bring ordering and order status capabilities like CustomPoint to a fully realized mobile environment, which we have optimized for the iPhone and BlackBerry, but that is acceptable by all mobile browsers.
The third element that I want to address in describing our One RR Donnelley strategy is the digital initiative that we are continuing to implement. Again, our digital initiatives do not just offer an alternative to conventional print production. They are helping to open the door to entirely new opportunities with customers. For example, during the quarter, we announced another innovation. The industry's first 60-inch wide high-speed digital press. This particular expansion of our proprietary ProteusJet line is designed to increase speed and efficiency in producing on-demand books. For publishers, enhanced digital production offers the potential to shift into new ways of marketing and selling printed content. We are not naïve to the role that e-books and tablets are playing and will continue to play. However, the model that supported their introduction as an alternative delivery mechanism to consumers and as a means of helping to minimize the supply chain waste, characteristic of solely conventional print production has now changed. The increasing efficiency digital printing and binding lines that we are building offer publishers a way to calibrate demand to production with exceptional precision and provide consumers with a way to access backlist for fast delivery.
In addition, our ProteusJet technology is at work in direct mail applications and TransPromo statement processing. The breadth of our product line enables us to leverage this in our other breakthrough innovations in multiple business units, vertical segments and geographies. These benefits of our One RR Donnelley strategy are expanding and enhancing our connectivity with customers, and we expect this strategy to drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
And now with that, let me turn it over to Miles to take you through the quarter in more detail."
91797,114165168,85017,"R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. For four consecutive quarters now, our GAAP earnings per diluted share outperformed the prior year.

For four consecutive quarters now, our GAAP earnings per diluted share outperformed the prior year. Our third quarter 2010 GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.25 exceeded third quarter 2009 by $0.19 or 317%. On a non-GAAP basis, we delivered $0.44 of earnings per share, a $0.10 decline from the third quarter of 2009.
I mentioned on our last earnings call that the third quarter would be a difficult year-over-year comparison for us as last year's third quarter results included a few favorable items that were not going to be occurring again in Q3 of this year. I will discuss these items in more detail a bit later.
I'm very pleased with our continued revenue growth. Third quarter sales grew 1.0% to $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year. As Tom mentioned earlier, we realized this growth in spite of the unfavorable impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates, lower paper sales and the fees we received in the third quarter of 2009 for the transition of a customer contract. In aggregate, these three items negatively impacted our year-over-year sales growth by over 200 basis points. Adjusting for these items, the remaining growth was driven by increased volume across the platform, partially offset by continued price erosion. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we again expect to see modest revenue growth even with the expected continuation of unfavorable foreign exchange rates through the end of the year.
GAAP income from operations was $148.7 million in the quarter, $55.3 million higher than in the third quarter of 2009. Included in these amounts were $48.7 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $2.6 million of acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $131.7 million in restructuring and impairment charges and $0.1 million of acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2009. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our earnings release.
Non-GAAP operating income in the current quarter was $200.0 million, down $25.2 million from third quarter of 2009. Three key items caused this decrease. First, we had a year-over-year increase of $16.1 million in our LIFO inventory provision. You may recall that we recorded a benefit of $13.1 million in the third quarter last year. That compares to a $3.0 million expense in this year's third quarter. Second, the one-time customer contract transition fee that we received in the third quarter of 2009 added $12.2 million to operating income last year. And third, we had an $11.9 million increase in our pension and postretirement benefits expense in 2010 versus 2009, an increase which is consistent with the increases seen in the first and second quarters.
Collectively, these three factors negatively impacted the change in non-GAAP operating income by over $40 million. On the other hand, volume growth and increased recovery on print-related by-products and lower depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by price erosion consistent with historical levels were the primary factors that helped us narrow the year-over-year decline in non-GAAP operating income. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 35.7% compared to 31.3% in the third quarter of 2009. This increase was primarily caused by the write-off of certain tax assets in Latin America in the third quarter of this year.
Now I'll discuss our operating results by segment. Third quarter sales in our U.S. Print and Related Services segment grew 2.0% over the third quarter of 2009 to $1.9 billion. As in the second quarter, we continue to realize a shift in the mix of paper used by our customers, which negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 93 basis points. This impact was primarily reflected in our magazine catalog and retail inserts and book and directory reporting units. Volume increased year-over-year in nearly all of our offerings, most notably in our logistics, financial print and premedia offerings, while the unfavorable pricing environment in line with historical trends continue to put pressure on our sales growth. Sales in our International segment totaled $626.7 million in the third quarter, down 1.8% or $11.6 million from the same period last year. Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and the $12.5 million fee we received for the transition of a customer contract in the third quarter last year negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 510 basis points. We saw higher volume in Asia, Europe and Latin America, partially offset by lower volume in Business Process Outsourcing, Global Turnkey and Canada. The volume decline in our Business Process Outsourcing unit was due to the termination of a significant long-term customer contract last year. Price erosion, most notably in Asia and Europe, partially offset the volume gains.
Our non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses of $39.9 million increased by $41.6 million from the third quarter of 2009. As I noted earlier, our LIFO inventory provision in the quarter was $16.1 million higher than last year as we recognized the $13.1 million benefit in 2009 compared to a $3.0 million expense in the current quarter. Additionally, higher pension and other benefits-related expenses, including healthcare as well as higher provision for bad debt, comprised the balance of the increase over 2009.
Capital spending was $50.4 million in the third quarter compared to $40.8 million in the third quarter of 2009. Interest expense in the quarter, of $57.6 million was $2.0 million favorable to the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to lower average borrowings and the favorable impact of our interest rate swaps. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2009, we recognized interest expense related to the acceleration of unamortized discounts related to the debt repurchases we made that quarter. We continue to maintain our favorable debt maturity profile.
As of September 30, 2010, our debt was $3.4 billion with no maturities in the next 15 months. Our total debt is approximately 81% fixed at an average interest rate of 7.4%. Cash on hand at September 30, 2010, was $732 million, of which just over half is in the U.S. We continue to expect the Bowne acquisition to close this year and plan on using much of this U.S. cash, along with drawings on our revolving credit facility, to fund the purchase price.
With just two months left in the year, we have some updates to our full year 2010 guidance. Consistent with our previous guidance, these expectations all exclude the impact of the pending Bowne acquisition. We expect year-over-year top line growth in the range of 0.5% to 1.0% as we expect to continue to be constrained by foreign exchange rates and lower paper sales for the balance of the year. We continue to expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 7.3% to 7.5%. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at approximately $535 million for the year. Both our CapEx and interest expense are expected to be approximately $225 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 32%. This estimate could continue to be impacted by business trends affecting different countries in which we do business or by changes in tax laws. We continue to expect the fully diluted share base to be approximately 210 million shares. And lastly, we expect our operating cash flow, less CapEx, to be approximately $600 million.
And with that, I'll return you to Tom."

I'd like to make three quick points before we take your questions. First, as Miles just mentioned, we continue to expect the Bowne acquisition to close during the fourth quarter and we are ready to move quickly to add its respected capabilities to the RR Donnelley portfolio and to use our One RR Donnelley strategy to expand on the relationships that Bowne has built with clients. Second, all of us at RR Donnelley would like to thank Jack Potter, who retires as of the longest-serving Postmaster General since 1814 for his energetic and innovative leadership at the USPS. We'd also like to welcome Patrick Donahoe as he assumes the supporting role. We look forward to working with him. Mail is crucial to driving 360-degree communications that continue to prove their effectiveness to marketers and other communicators everyday.
Third, although technology plays an important role in our growth strategy, our employees never lose sight of the importance of craftsmanship and quality in establishing and maintaining customer relationships. During the quarter, we again, brought home more than our share of print industry awards, and several of our facilities achieved safety milestones. We continue to regard safety as the first and most important indicator of operational excellence.

I think, Charlie, if anything this quarter and the second quarter, we're demonstrating that this platform is solid and strong and can benefit during a slow economic recovery that we're experiencing. We're not dependent upon any one thing. We're not dependent upon ad pages, the financial market, even consumer confidence. We've got multiple sales channels that are starting to hit on all cylinders. We have targeted sales specialists. We have global print management, which I will talk about more in 2011. That is gaining traction, more traction every day. And something I talked about today regarding CustomPoint. Just to give you an idea how we're penetrating our customers' organizations. And this is how we're taking transactional business into a contractual business. Our CustomPoint rollout management systems, they’re proprietary to RR Donnelley. I think we look at the most recent trend reports that show our customers placing almost 90% more orders with us through our own systems, than through commercially available systems. When customers use our systems, it creates sticky relationships and creates a switching barrier. And to give you an idea what that means, I mean, we're dealing with the top apparel company. You know, two of the top six of the automotive retailers. The number one beverage company, eight of the top some 15 commercial banks, some of the top 10 managed care companies, top three medical companies and equipment companies. Obviously, the top Pharmaceutical companies and some of the top specialty retailers. When we're able to do this, the vast majority of orders that come to us electronically are for printing, but they're also for added value services such as inventory management, complex kitting and distribution and variable digital printing. So when you take that into account and then you look at the rollout management system that we've felt designed for retailers, that has the complex task of re-merchandising stores. We're able to identify store profile information, house it in a database then automatically create kitting fulfillment orders based on those store profiles. So if a store is getting window posters, we know exactly the number that matches the number of display windows that they have. And this system applies not only to retail, but it applies to retail banks, insurance company and any other brick and mortars that are out there. And it’s a great example of why we feel that we can take these capabilities and move across the One RR Donnelley platform to look for other industry variables. So as we sit here -- obviously, a long winded answer for you, but as we sit here, we see that we've got the ability to continue to penetrate customers in all their verticals and provide them a solution that no other person, no other company out there, we think, can provide them."

Donnelley & Sons Company","Executives","First of, no, we're not deemphasizing anything in our industry. But let me go back to the C-level comments. Our mission since day one has been how can we reduce your total overall cost of ownership and improve your return on investment? What we built here",651,"First of, no, we're not deemphasizing anything in our industry. But let me go back to the C-level comments. Our mission since day one has been how can we reduce your total overall cost of ownership and improve your return on investment? What we built here has allowed people to take advantage of that. And the C-level suites, I think, the Prudential is a great example of obviously long-term agreement with the company that is not something that they take lightly and is a significant part of their business. And I think more and more companies, both Fortune 1000 companies, as well as publishers, are starting to embrace what we're able to bring to the table because it makes life easier for them. In its simplest form, we can reduce your cost, we can help you with your customers and we make it easier for you that you can just deal you have sort of one person to go ahead and talk to from that standpoint. From the de-emphasizing the long-run business, my goodness, I mean, if you look at most of our announcements, a lot of your announcements this year have been in that area where we’ve either won new business or we've got renewals that have taken place. Definitely competitive business, but there’s opportunities there for us to help our publishers. Our publishers are becoming multimedia channels themselves, multimedia providers. So what can we do from that standpoint to help them? I think if you look at magazines, I think there's -- our numbers show that there's been 176 new launches in the first nine months of 2010, that's versus 259 in 2009. But I still think those are oppressive numbers given the extremely challenging print advertising environment that's out there. There's been 127 closures versus 383 closures last year, so that bodes well. In online titles only, there's been 26 this year versus 64 last year. So we believe publishers are using social media sites to help build relationships and engage their audiences. And social media can significantly enhance existing products and drive new revenues, which is good for the publishers, which means it's also good for us because if they are financially strong, so will we. So the way we are evolving print to be more interactive with our customers and end-users is just one of the ways that will we look to improve our customers' return on their investment and that applies to all products and services, not just magazines plus the catalogs retail inserts. We understand that consumers have a lot of media choices out there. We have to make sure the products and services that we have add value, remain vibrant, timely and critical part of consumer's decision-making process or information-gathering process, whatever it may be, and we're doing just that as I indicated in the many examples that we talked about earlier in the speech, and just to keep going on this point to beat it up a little bit. We are still obviously, as I talked about with the USPS this morning, we're still very active there, which not only impacts the Fortune 1000 companies that obviously has a big impact on publishers. This is one of the reason why the Postal Regulatory Commission's decision to deny the request of UPSP for accident rate increase was so significant. It would have been an added cost to our customers that, again, we also would have had to found a way to mitigate. We continue to assist the post office in reducing their cost. I think our technology advancements, when you think about Co-pal, co-tray, Co-mail, our significant influence in the development and implication in the intelligent mail bar code all lead to our customers in reducing their cost. And again, if those themes keep applying. So, no, we're not deemphasizing anything on this platform and nor do I ever see us doing that."

We are making supply chain more efficient. We are making it such that at a cost point, we're compressing the publisher's cost there whatever it is, magazines, books, doesn’t matter. Catalogs, you go back to a time when the Internet was going to go ahead and knockout the catalog, and I'd say that's probably every quarter. Obviously, it didn't and it became another sales channel for the catalog. We truly believe for publishers that the multichannel approach will continue and the printed product will be there.

Good morning, everyone.

Good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, our employees continue to implement our One RR Donnelley approach as we delivered our industry-leading product and service offering to our customers while working together to control our cost. As a result, we posted GAAP EPS of $0.25 a share, up 257% from the same quarter in 2009 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.33 a share, up 38% from Q1 last year.
As we have continually demonstrated, we did not suddenly acquire financial discipline and a focus on generating cash flow during challenging economic times. These qualities are baked into everything we do at RR Donnelley and are clearly reflected in the more than $4 billion in free cash flow or operating cash flow less CapEx that we have generated between 2004 and 2009 and continue to be reflected in the $600 million to $650 million that we expect to generate in 2010.
As we have consistently promised, our focus is on maximizing liquidity and driving operational excellence, and as reflected by our ongoing performance, we continue to deliver upon that promise.
Miles would take you through the quarter in more detail, but before he does, I'm going to put our performance and prospects into context by briefly discussing the following: First, where we believe RR Donnelley will be positioned as the industry begins to settle; and second, what we are doing to continue implementing our digital strategy.
Both of these topics are important in understanding the strengths, capabilities and opportunities that we continue to leverage and the direction that we have charted in this fast-changing environment. I'll start with how RR Donnelley is positioned to continue to be the industry leader.
We hold the following distinct advantages relative to our competition, each of which influence our customer relationships, our research and new product development efforts, our investment/acquisition strategy and our structure. One distinct advantage is our ability to help our customers achieve two of their most important goals: cost-compression and enhanced ROI. 
Let me share an example. Penguin Group USA just awarded us an agreement to produce digital books on demand, including adult and young readers trade hardcover, trade paperback, mass-market paperback books, bound galleys and advanced reader copies. By utilizing our ever-expanding digital platform, we are making shorter runs more affordable and driving waste and obsolescence out of the publisher's supply-chain. 
In addition to lowering costs, RR Donnelley's innovation can also enhance ROI as publishers can reopen their backlist to create incremental revenue.
With RR Donnelley, effective no title is out-of-print. These types of solutions that deliver cost compression and increased ROI are replicated across our entire global platform.
Another distinct advantage is the diversity of our product and service offerings, our customer base and our geographic reach. This is important for several reasons: We participate in virtually every industry vertical segment, from consumer package goods, to retail, to healthcare, to financial services, to publishing and on and on. Our extensive reach means that we are involved in all of the fastest recovering segments, including medical services, packaged goods, entertainment, investment services, brokerage services, electronics, food services and others. Unlike most of our competitors who only serve one or two industry verticals with one or two products, our unmatched product and service offering and industry vertical exposure uniquely position us to deliver integrated communicative solutions for our clients around the world, which brings me to my next point: our geographic diversity.
Our geographic diversity enables us to leverage our client relationships internationally and create differentiated solutions that utilize the capabilities of our integrated global platform. As they awarded RR Donnelley with a renewed and expanded multimillion-dollar contract, Thomas Nelson Inc. told us that our responsive customer service model makes it easy to do business with RR Donnelley, whether a publication is produced down the road or around the world. Simply stated, our global platform enables us to deliver the optimum mix of cycle time and cost benefits for our customers.
Our comprehensive product and service offering not only provides an opportunity for our customers to reduce their total cost of ownership by consolidating their supply chain, it also means that it is rare for us to be excluded from servicing any client in any industry vertical. As an example, even if a customer were to award a portion of its traditional long-run print to a competitor, RR Donnelley can maintain a relationship with that customer by providing transactional printing, fulfillment and distribution, digital services, BPO capabilities and much more.
A third advantage is that because of our close customer relationships, we continue to have direct access to the key decision makers in our customers' organizations. If you can find a positive in the global economic crisis, it is in the fact that it creates a much more open and receptive audience for us to talk about our ability to compress costs and increase ROI for our clients.
We continue to develop and expand our C-level relationships based on our ability to complete consultative assessments of our customers’ communications activities, identify specific value-added recommendations utilizing our expansive product and service offering and implement a very efficient and effective operating model using our broad portfolio of web-enabled tools to serve those customers.
Together, these advantages create the key difference between what RR Donnelley was nearly a decade ago, a leading provider of printing services, and what RR Donnelley is today, the leading global provider of integrated communications solutions.
Now I will address what RR Donnelley is doing with regard to our digital platform and more broadly, what we are doing to take advantage of the opportunities being created by digital technologies. This is not just a single initiative as we are simultaneously pursuing our digital strategy across a number of fronts. For example, one front involves a seamless integration of digital technologies into our operations. Our platform includes more than 1,000 proprietary and commercial digital printing units. Now there's a tendency to think that digital equals short run. Digital units are frequently used in projects that enabled the creation of short-run content, but not always. For instance, the USPS presented information last month about intelligent mails biggest test to date, successfully processing, delivering and tracking the hundreds of millions of U.S. Census Bureau forms sents to households this year.
The Intelligent Mail Height-Modulated Barcode is used to sort and track letters and flats. It greatly expands mailer's visibility into the mail system. In describing the census, the USPS said we could view the entire process from individual pieces, the assembled loads, trucks from the printer and then throughout our system. That is the kind of result that can be achieved by our digital capabilities, including those on conventional long-run printing assets that have been retrofitted with RR Donnelley's high-speed, high-quality digital color capabilities.
Another front involves employing digital technologies on our platform to create entirely new interfaces between print and electronic communications. For example, our photography and pre-media professionals are capturing 360-degree rotating images that are deployed to websites. Imagine that you're working on a home repair project and you want to see what it should look like when it is finished. You point your smart mobile device at the using care guide that RR Donnelley produced, kitted with other materials and packaged with the device. Your device sees and recognizes a dimensional code that we printed and it pops that rotating image we photographed. That's an end-to-end digitally enabled solution.
A third front involves using digital technology to help contain SG&A by allowing our customers to self-surf through web tools such as our proprietary CustomPoint system, which again saw a sequential growth in the number of orders it accepted. Even against the traditionally strong fourth quarter, during Q1, we saw a 2 1/2% sequential increase in the volume of orders placed to us through this unique portal.
On the forefront, we are using digital technologies to help customers expand the power and reach of their brands. For example, our DigiMag product enables publishers to complement their printed magazines with digital versions. As you saw, we were just awarded an agreement by Hanley Wood to create all of the DigiMag versions of their B2B publications. DigiMag also allows published to leverage other content channels by making publications available to their mobile consumers. These online communications complement print, such as magazines, book, direct mail and commercial printing that we provide. 
As customers expand their communications mix, we expand a number of ways that they can choose RR Donnelley as their provider. Customers that modify their marketing mix do not have to shift away from RR Donnelley. We can simply utilize other capabilities within our integrated platform to meet their communication needs.
Another front involves helping our customers bring their own digital innovations to market. For example, consumers are evaluating an array of devices that put all kinds of apps into the palms of their hands. If they make a decision to buy one of these popular units, there is a really good chance that they are going to wind up touching some of our work. 
Our global print, packaging and supply chain management professionals are hard at work designing, printing, sourcing, packing out and fulfilling some of the most popular devices. When you received that product from your online order or pick up the box from the store, you're handling a great representation of our work.
RR Donnelley's digital strategy encompasses virtually every aspect of our business and is even influencing direction that we are taking in our hiring, training and development of human resources. For example, we are continuing to attract top talent from top campuses nationwide and bringing these young people into comprehensive and specially designed development programs.
We're giving them a thorough grounding in our global capabilities and through there energy and passion, they're giving us a deeper understanding of how RR Donnelley can support customers as the customers exploit the fast-changing communication possibilities associated with social networking.
As marketers use these sites to gather microdata about their customers and prospects, we are using our digital capabilities to help use those data in results-producing communications. And with that, I will turn it over to Miles."

We are happy to report that our first quarter 2010 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.33 exceeded our first quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share of $0.24 by 38%. Several key factors, which I will discuss in greater detail, contribut",1249,"Thanks, Tom. We are happy to report that our first quarter 2010 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.33 exceeded our first quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share of $0.24 by 38%. Several key factors, which I will discuss in greater detail, contributed to our improvement over last year.
I told you that during our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call that we expected full year 2010 sales growth over 2009 to be a percentage in the low single-digits. Although our first quarter revenue declined slightly on a year-over-year basis, the decline was in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect low single-digit percentage growth for the full year.
Compared to the first quarter of 2009, revenue declined 1.6%. The favorable foreign exchange rate impact of approximately 202 basis points was largely offset by lower paper sales for the quarter. The lower paper sales were due to both lower paper prices and a relative increase in the amount of customer-supplied paper.
Excluding the impact of both foreign exchange and paper, revenue declined by approximately 2%. This decrease was due to continued price erosion and slightly lower volume. The reported revenue decline of 1.6% compares to a 7.6% decline in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 14.0% decline in the third quarter of 2009 and a 19.4% decline in the second quarter of 2009, as demand has continued to stabilize and we are now overlapping past quarters during which we felt the full impact of the recession.
GAAP income from operations was $145.8 million in the quarter, $58.4 million higher than income from operations in the first quarter 2009. Included in these amounts are $15.5 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $2.0 million of acquisition-related expenses in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $54.2 million of restructuring and impairment charges in the first quarter of 2009.
A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our earnings release. 
In spite of the revenue decline we experienced in the quarter, we were able to generate $301.9 million in non-GAAP EBITDA, $12.3 million more than we generated in the first quarter of 2009. Driving the year-over-year improvement were our ongoing efforts to reduce costs and increase productivity, a higher recovery on print-related byproducts due mainly to favorable pricing and a more favorable product mix.
Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were continued pricing pressure and higher incentive compensation and benefits-related expenses, including a $10.2 million increase in the non-cash pension and post-retirement benefits expense. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact year-over-year earnings comparisons, as the negative impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation was mitigated by the favorable impact of other currencies.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 35.6% and was lower than the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 37.1% in the same period last year due to a more favorable domestic manufacturing deduction in 2010 and a change in the mix of income across tax jurisdictions, partially offset by a one-time charge of $3.3 million associated with the enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
Now we'll discuss our operating results by segment. Sales of our U.S. Print and Related Services segment declined 3.7% to $1.8 billion in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see paper prices trend lower, especially impacting our magazine, catalog and retail insert offerings. Lower paper prices and the mix of customer-supplied paper contributed approximately 214 basis points to the overall U.S. sales decline of 3.7%. Overall volume in this segment was essentially flat as volume declines in our book and directory and magazine catalog and retail insert offerings were offset by volume increases in our variable print, logistics services, pre-media and financial print offerings. We are still, though, experiencing price pressure across this segment.
Our International segment's reported sales were $578.3 million and grew 5.5% from the first quarter of 2009. `Excluding FX, however, sales were 3.5% lower than the first quarter of 2009 as price erosion in Europe and Asia and volume declines in Latin America more than offset the favorable trend of our increased volume in our Global Turnkey and Asia products and service offerings.
Our non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses of $49.6 million increased by $9.3 million from the first quarter of 2009. We indicated last year that our non-cash pension and post-retirements benefits expense would be significantly higher in 2010. And in the first quarter, this expense was $10.8 million higher than the first quarter of 2009, accounting for more than the total increase of corporate expenses.
Capital spending was $39.9 million in the quarter, $15 million less than the first quarter of 2009. For the full year, we expect to spend roughly the same amount on capital expenditures in 2010 as in 2009, about $200 million.
Our first quarter 2010 operating cash flow of $76 million was lower than the first quarter of 2009 as several one-time benefits favorably impacted our operating cash flow last year. In addition, this year's first quarter operating cash flow was negatively impacted by expenditures of $74.7 million related to our restructuring programs, of which $57.5 million was related to last year's termination of the significant long-term customer contract in the International segment. We continue to expect operating cash flow less CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million for the full year. 
We continue to maintain a favorable debt-maturity profile. As of March 31, 2010, our debt was $3.3 billion, of which $326 million matures on May 15. In addition, we expected to pay approximately $481 million for the Bowne acquisition and anticipate funding these obligations through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt securities.
As of March 31, 2010, our debt is 99% fixed at an average interest rate of 6.7%. We are still targeting a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0x to 2.5x on a sustainable basis recognizing that under certain circumstances, we may be at or above the high end of that range.
With one quarter successfully under our belt, we have revised some of our full year expectations since our last earnings call. Let me share with you some of these key expectations, all of which exclude the impact of the Bowne acquisition. We continue to expect year-over-year percentage revenue growth in the low single digits. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 7.0% to 7.2%, an increase of 50 basis points to the low end and 20 basis points to the high end of our previously communicated range.
We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $555 million, $5 million lower than previously estimated. Interest expense is now projected to be approximately $210 million, a reduction of $10 million from our previous guidance.
Our non-GAAP tax rate will be in the range of 30% to 32%, 100 basis points lower than previously communicated. This estimate could be impacted by business trends affecting different countries in which we do business or by changes in tax law.
We expect a fully diluted share base of approximately 210 million shares, our CapEx will be approximately $200 million. And finally, as both Tom and I have mentioned earlier, we continue to expect our free cash flow or operating cash flow less CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $615 million for the year and to be more heavily weighted towards the back half of the year.
And with that, I'll return you to Tom."

Before we open it up for questions, I like to make a few brief comments. First, earlier as I identified some of RR Donnelley's unique competitive differentiators, I would be remising that specifically mentioning the resilience, innovation and deep commitment of all of our people. They are the difference makers. 
Second, we continue to work towards the closing of our acquisition of Bowne & Co. Under the guidance of our Legal departments, we are planning the integration work that will allow us to hit the ground running when we come together. The people who are working with are confirming what we believe as we considered acquiring Bowne, that the acquisition will bring RR Donnelley some very talented people who will be a terrific fit with our customer-first culture.
We also believe that the customer-centric focus that has held Bowne forged strong relationships with many of their customers and that this will open the door to additional opportunities to present and sell the broader RR Donnelley product and service offering once the combination is complete.
Third, we are thrilled that the judges at the International Print Exhibition, IPEX, have found fit to award Donnelley the IPEX 2010 Champions in Print Award. The IPEX judges broke with tradition and gave their most recent award not to an individual but to the printing group that they cited as having made one of the most positive impacts on the industry and which has been a shining example of pioneering innovation.
We are proud to stand as a 2010 winner, along with such prior individual winners as Dr. John Warnock and Dr. Charles Geschke, founders of Adobe, as well as J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series.
Finally, we look at the balance of the year with what I would call tempered enthusiasm. The foundation that we built is proving to be solidly in line with what our customers are looking for and we continue to have confidence in our employees' ability to execute our strategy. And now, operator, with that, we will take questions."

As I think about catalogers, catalogers are going to start to test more, increasing the number of pieces that are mailed. Hopefully, their response rates with consumers go up. Obviously, branding, commercial printing, more merchandising. Hopefully, there'll be either new store openings or stores that are remodeled, which will again, will impact us. There'll be more hiring of employees, which will again mean more printed communication material. Direct mail, where there'll be increased consumer spending, and not-for=profits will look for more donations. There'll be more testing. There'll be more rollouts of different formats. Even when you think about directories and the start-ups of new businesses that are going to take place, again, as the economy starts to improve, that's going to help us. As you go through financial printing and services, what we just talked about with Bowne, obviously, there's going to be more capital markets activity. There'll be more M&A activity. Labels, consumer-packaged goods, different products, they all have labels. We do all this stuff. Logistics, there'll be an increased volume in Co-Pal or Co-Mail distribution. Magazines? Yes. Ad pages go up, page counts will go up. That's a good day for everybody. There'll be probably more start-ups that will take place in B2Bs. The premier that we talked about, there'll be more photography taking place, more page layouts that will take place than what happened before. And obviously, with print fulfillment services, there'll be more of these electronic devices that are taking place, which we're involved in. If you think about office supplies, retail inserts, translation services, all of them get impacted by a better economy, which, as we look around, and I know we make it tough for you because you have no one that you can go ahead and put us in a box with, and say, ""I'm going to compare you against this person."" There's no one else that has this. And the level of interest that we're seeing by our customers because we have these solutions is by far the most we've ever seen. We've got companies now that are truly, because of the crisis that they've gone through, are looking for ways to do things that take things off their plate that aren't their core competence. Again, the multiple product offering that we've got allows for cost compression, increase the return on investments and it's companies of all sizes. So as we sit here today, I mean, we give you our 90-day report card that I call it, 4x a year, and this is one of the report cards that we're very, very proud of and excited about what the future can hold, given where we're starting to see some things. Now on the flip side, I'll tell you, if the economy doesn't rebound or doesn't grow maybe as quickly as we'd thought it would, we've still got ability here to take costs down and manage costs. I mean, if anything, I think we've proved to you over the years is that we know how to manage costs and we know how to go ahead and either dial it up or dial it down with no impact to our customers. So I know probably a long-winded answer for you, but that's, again, to drive home the point that we're not limited to ad pages. We're not limited to just one segment of communications, and that we participate in every one of these industry verticals is a great thing for us here at RR Donnelley, for our customers and for our stakeholders."

I mean, you look at what the capital markets have reacted this week, you look at the way certain countries have their own fiscal deficits, again, we're excited. We're enthusiastic about what we think we can do this year, given the platform we built. But we also know we've got high unemployment out there, we've got countries that have overextended themselves, and sooner or later, you got to pay it back. And again, I think if you look -- whether you're managing a company or a country, you've got to continue to be a good fiduciary of your balance sheet and make sure that you don't put yourself in a situation to where you're going to have to take away things from people, you're going to have to reduce your services or you're going to have to compromise something that people, whether it's people in the country or whether it's customers, don't expect you to do.

But we made very difficult decisions in here in 2009 that are paying -- reaping the benefits from, from a cost standpoint, now in 2010. So that's obviously one of the drivers there. I would tell you, as well as that, that again, our top line -- we're talking about single-digit growth on the top line, low single-digit growth. I mean, for somebody like us, when you have a base of $10 billion and offsetting a 1% to 2% price decline, if you're able to catch your cost structure in line, that would -- some people may perceive as a small increase is pretty significant, and that should flow through the P&L in a very positive way. But again, Dan, as you get to know us, you'll see that we manage all aspects of costs everyday, and try to, as best we can, make sure that we don't -- as we manage those costs, we don't go ahead and jeopardize any one part of what we're trying to do here, from an operational efficiency standpoint."

I mean, we're one of the few people, if anybody, who has -- the transaction that we did with Muller Martini last year is not an insignificant transaction, as you think about costs for us in the digital landscape. We should be able to, as a result of that, be advantaged by having that technology on board with us for many different reasons. So again, as we go about trying to show customers what we can do by compressing their costs, we've got to make sure that our costs are also in line, or we're not going to be able to do that."

And the great thing for us, the fortunate thing for us is we did not just start to create a digital platform. This was part of our plan that was started nearly six years ago. We have the scale and digital infrastructure around the globe to serve customers' needs, whether they are in publishing or in the corporate world. Again, you've seen some of the announcements that we've made this week with Penguin on the book publishing side, Hanley Wood on the magazine side. We've got others in place on what I call, the Fortune 1000 side. So again, the digital error for us is going to develop new products that's going to make integrated communications critical to companies' success. So companies aren't going to do away with print. I mean, one of the things that I would hope I can drive home today is print is going to be a part of whatever that integrated communication spend is going to be. Whether it's via the net, cell phone, Blackberry, iPad, Kindle, whatever it may be, there's print that is going to be associated with it. So again, for us, as we look at it, we're excited that our infrastructure is there. We're excited that, again, from a conventional print standpoint, we've still got that great equipment with us, and we're going to be able to assist companies to do whatever they need to do. If they need to change from doing a retail insert, they want to then do a direct mail piece, bang, we can do it for them. They don't have to go some place else. And trust me, companies want to reduce their supply base because they need to go ahead and improve their margins. We talked to you a lot today about cash flow. Let's spend two seconds on CapEx. I mean, CapEx, for us, as you've gone through the years, I think it's been a concern for some you over the years. Look and see what we've done, going back, over the years. 2009 and 2010 are pretty similar amounts. And as we sit here today, I mean, we don't see why that amount, going into the future, shouldn't be consistent as well. Obviously, we could grow through acquisitions or there could be something else that takes place. But as we sit here today, we think the numbers that we're talking to you about, from a capital expenditures standpoint, don't have to change, as a result of us getting new business. That's a great business model. The business model where you got to go buy new equipment because you brought on a new customer, as most of you know, that's not a good business model. So we're excited about what digital is going to bring with conventional print, and again, we think we've got more than a head start on many, many people."

So I think, from the standpoint of having others join and trying to do some of the things we do, it should shine a light on us because of our capabilities and because of how well we do it. Again, I know we don't make it easier for you, as far as some competitors are, but there is no one that does this product and service offering the way we do it, or have them that we do. So if you want to look at individual products, there's hundreds of competitors within each of one of those individual products. They may have good days on certain products, but those good days come and go. And what else is there to sustain their ongoing effectiveness? So with the platform that we built, no matter what price is, and we know we've got to overcome price every single day, and you've got to do that by making sure that you've got a low-cost platform that can go ahead and meet your customers' needs at the same time. So the old saying that, a rising tide lifts all ships, yes, there's some truth to that. But how much will they benefit from it? Where will that take them? I mean look, we're one of the few ones that, as we sit here today, we're still working on solutions for the USPS with them, with our customers. Obviously, they're going through some interesting times. How can we go ahead and make sure that we can pass along cost savings to our customers, which people who don't have the scale really can't work towards that? So we may be end up benefiting them. They may have to come to us to help them benefit from that, so..."

91797,109055330,163596,"R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company","Executives","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. One of the themes that we have consistently communicated is the importance of a disciplined approach to taking cost out of our business, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. We told you that we we",1650,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. One of the themes that we have consistently communicated is the importance of a disciplined approach to taking cost out of our business, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. We told you that we were working very deliberately to strike the right balance between reducing cost and ensuring that we would be ready to benefit immediately when general economic conditions improved.
The importance of maintaining this discipline was illustrated during 2009, when we responded to the fast-changing economic environment by taking out significant costs particularly during the first half of the year. We did not, however, compromise our ability to take advantage of fresh revenue opportunities that emerged in 2010. 
The effectiveness of this approach is reflected by our Q2 results. Q2 revenues were up 2.2% versus the same quarter a year ago. However, GAAP EPS of $0.42 more than tripled from the same quarter in 2009, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.47 were up more than 27% from Q2 last year. Miles will walk you through the numbers in more detail in a few moments but before he does, I will briefly address three topics. 
First, I'll discuss benefits that we are seeing from our One RR Donnelley strategy; second, I'll point out some examples of initiatives that are creating new revenue opportunities; and third, I'll highlight some important achievements during the quarter that reflect our employees' continuing commitment to excellence.
Let's begin with our One RR Donnelley strategy, which we see as having three important dimensions. The first dimension refers to the way that we approach our customers. During the second quarter, we were awarded customer contracts whose aggregate value approached $2 billion. These long-term agreements won on four continents reflect the unique breadth, depth and geographic reach of our product and service offering. Many of these agreements are for multiple product and service lines that draw on several RR Donnelley capabilities. In essence, the One RR Donnelley strategy means that we, as the leading global provider of integrated communications solutions, are uniquely able to provide differentiated services to our customers. Let me share a few examples.
We have an extensive pre-media offering which grew out of our traditional relationships with catalogers and publishers. However, as One RR Donnelley, we are applying our unique pre-media technologies to traditional segments that we serve. ShareStream is our online workflow management system used as designers and others create and collaborate on materials that can be both printed and published on the Internet. We recently won all of a major healthcare institution's extensive forms and labels products because we applied ShareStream to the complex task of managing the hospital's documents, which number in the thousands. The before and after solution for the document review and approval workflow that our sales team created is striking. We did not earn this business just by bidding against other printers. We earned it by providing an expanded service offering that saves our customers remarkable amounts of expensive cycle time. The key is that this value-added service is not confined to a traditional silo or niche. It's expanding into applications across our platform.
Another example, we are a leader in using digital imaging to help our customers talk to their customers in a one-to-one voice. You most frequently see this kind of personalization in direct response and TransPromo communications. But we're expanding our offering by bringing it into the catalogers' world. In short, this digital imaging solution lets a cataloger tailor offers based on their customers' prior purchases. Now when you receive a catalog, choose what to buy and place your order, that information can wind up shaking a unique offer you'll receive when your next catalog arrives. In the past, the number of options for personalizing catalogs was less extensive than those available for conventional direct mail. One RR Donnelley is narrowing that gap. 
The second dimension of our One RR Donnelley strategy is technology development and utilization. Here's an example of what we mean by applying a One RR Donnelley approach to emerging technologies. Quick response or two-dimensional barcodes are creating links between printed and online content. Download a free app, point your Smart phone at a printed 2D barcode and you're immediately taken to the appropriate Web or mobile Internet site. In essence, these codes make print instantly interactive. 
We believe that we are positioned to help the broadest range of customers apply this emerging interactive technology across the broadest range of applications, including product packaging, in-store signage, direct mailing, magazines, catalogs, directed of an industrial [ph] (22:11) labels and many, many more.
Earlier this week, we officially opened a new research and development center, which features expanded engineering, printed electronics, inks and materials labs. Our own in-house technological and material innovation are supplemented by our external activities such as our sponsorship arrangement with the MIT Media Labs. This sponsorship gives us special access to the latest in a range of innovations. As our internal and external R&D functions continue to develop new products and services, we will add them to our industry-leading platform and sell them into the industry's broadest range of applications. We do not believe that any other company in our industry can take advantage of as many ways to benefit from innovations as RR Donnelley can.
The third dimension of our One RR Donnelley strategy is performance consistency across our global platform. Whether we are sourcing components and packaging them with the hottest consumer electronics in Europe, producing guides in China that are being distributed at the Shanghai World Expo, managing over 35,000 rail moves a year through our logistics operations or designing, photographing, printing and distributing the supplements you take with you shopping on Sunday afternoon, our facilities are applying common standards for safety, quality, service, sustainability and more. This performance consistency ensures that our brand is associated with excellence around the world, enables us to maximize our leverage advantages in every aspect of our business. One RR Donnelley is not merely a slogan. It makes a crucial difference.
The second topic I'll touch on is the increasing number of initiatives that are creating new revenue opportunities. Let me use RR Donnelley's innovative ProteusJet system as an example. A recent PrintWeek article highlighting our proprietary ProteusJet digital printing unit said, ""RR Donnelley has been ahead of the curve in all aspects of digital printing."" One of the factors that we see as unique is our ability to apply R&D innovations to multiple applications across multiple customer segments, each of which can lead to new revenue opportunities. 
For example, we began by using ProteusJet to drive enhanced TransPromo value for the telecom, financial services and other customers for whom we print and mail billing statements. 
Next, we moved it into the book-publishing world. We have integrated our ProteusJet digital presses with in-line binding equipment for exceptionally efficient digital book production. This is how publishers open up their backlist to create new revenue. It will allow us to help them to get at the fundamental supply chain inefficiencies that tend to prevent publishers from matching the most efficient production method to consumer demand. 
Just a few weeks ago, we announced another first involving ProteusJet. It is the first high-resolution high-speed digital web offset press combination. This modular installation enables digital color imaging across the full width of the press to give direct marketers exceptional design and production flexibility. Again, our One RR Donnelley strategy continues to drive innovative solutions for our customers and provide new incremental revenue streams in areas as diverse as financial services, publishing, fundraising, telecommunications, retailing and more.
Finally, before I turn it over to Miles, I want to highlight some important achievements during the quarter that reflect our employees' continuing commitment to excellence. Though we talk a great deal about technology, ours is still a business rooted in craftsmanship and service. Working to accurately bring our customers' brands to life in their communications, even as they present us with an endless series of time-sensitive deadlines is an everyday challenge for our employees. They consistently rise to that challenge, as illustrated by the awards that we received. 
Our performance continues to be recognized by our customers. For example, AT&T Advertising Solutions recognized our employees' efforts with its Gold Supplier Quality Alliance Award and Best Buy named our Lancaster, Pennsylvania operations as its top-performing print facility. 
Fewer than 2% of printed samples that producers submit for judging are recognized with Sappi North American Printer of the Year silver awards. Yet, RR Donnelley took home several that were earned across different segments of our platform. Out of the silver award winners in each of the 10 finalist categories, one is selected to receive recognition with a gold award. RR Donnelley's craftsmanship was recognized with two of those gold North American awards. No other company received multiple gold honors. 
Our people make a qualitative difference for our customers. We believe that these important recognitions reflect the fact that as we take out cost, we do not compromise our ability to deliver the quality and innovative services that differentiates RR Donnelley from our competitors. 
Similarly, we do not take shortcuts with regard to sustainability. During the quarter, another of our facilities earned the ISO 14001 environmental certification, and we continue to pursue a number of important sustainability initiatives. 
Most important, we never compromise employee safety. A number of facilities achieved important safety milestones during the quarter, including our operations in Dongguan province in China, which reached 10 million consecutive working hours without a day away injury. Our experience is that safety is the first and most important measure of operational excellence. The formula we continue to follow, our One RR Donnelley strategy, which we believe is resulting in an expanding range of new revenue opportunities, plus our company's commitment to performance excellence, equate to results that we are very, very proud of. Miles?"

Our second quarter results showed substantial improvement as GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.42 exceeded our second quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share by $0.30. And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.47 exceeded second q",1452,"Thanks, Tom. Our second quarter results showed substantial improvement as GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.42 exceeded our second quarter 2009 earnings per diluted share by $0.30. And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.47 exceeded second quarter 2009 by $0.10. Top line growth, a favorable tax rate and a few other key factors, all of which I will discuss in greater detail, contributed to this improvement.
We are pleased to report that we achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 2.2% in the second quarter. The first quarter with positive revenue growth since the second quarter of 2008. Furthermore, June has been our fourth consecutive month of year-over-year top line growth. And while comparables become more challenging, we are optimistic that we will continue to achieve positive revenue growth in the back half of the year. 
Increased volume in most of our operating units was the primary driver of our 2.2% sales increase over the second quarter of 2009. Similar to the first quarter, lower paper sales did a lower paper prices and the mix of paper used by our customers negatively impacted sales growth. The unfavorable impact in the second quarter was approximately 109 basis points.
GAAP income from operations was $175.3 million in the quarter, $40.3 million higher than in the second quarter of 2009. Included in these amounts were $10.7 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $3.3 million of acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $48.2 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $1.4 million of acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter of 2009. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our earnings release.
Non-GAAP income improved as well. We generated $189.3 million in non-GAAP income from operations, $4.7 million more than we generated in the second quarter of 2009. In addition to volume growth, an increased recovery on print-related by-products and lower depreciation and amortization expenses were only partially offset by price erosion and higher incentive compensation and benefits-related expenses, including a $10 million increase in pension and post-retirement benefits expense. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact our year-over-year earnings comparison. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.2% and was significantly lower than the comparable rate of 37.5% in the same period last year, primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in Latin America in the second quarter of this year. 
Now I'll discuss our operating results by segment. Year-over-year sales in our U.S. Print and Related Services segment improved 1.6% to $1.8 billion in the quarter, including an unfavorable impact of approximately 130 basis points related to lower paper prices and the mix of paper used by our customers. We saw revenue growth in seven of the nine reporting units, with the exceptions being Magazine Catalog and Retail Inserts and Office Products. 
Within the Magazine Catalog and Retail Inserts Reporting unit, the majority of the revenue decline was due to lower paper sales and work mix, as unit volume was essentially flat. Most product offerings continued to be impacted by price erosion, in line with historical trends although we expect these operations to benefit from our One RR Donnelley focus and the growing momentum behind the enterprise selling initiatives that Tom discussed earlier.
Our International segment's reported sales were $599.3 million and grew 4.3% from the second quarter of 2009. The segment sales growth was driven by higher volume from all reporting units except Canada and Business Process Outsourcing units. 
The volume decline in Business Process Outsourcing was due to the decision we made last year to terminate a significant long-term customer contract, enabling us to exit from certain unprofitable operations in this area. Continued price erosion partially offset the volume growth in the second quarter. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact the year-over-year revenue comparison.
Our non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses of $42.9 million increased by $19.2 million from the second quarter of 2009. Pension and other benefits-related expenses, including healthcare as well as our non-cash LIFO inventory provision, increased year-over-year, partially offset by a favorable reduction in our workers' compensation expense. 
Capital spending was $54.6 million in the quarter, $17.4 million more than in the second quarter of 2009. This year-over-year increase supports the several digital initiatives and new customer wins and renewals that we have announced and will continue to announce going forward. As such, we are revising our full year capital spending guidance to a range of $200 million to $225 million.
Interest expense in the quarter was almost $53 million and was $7 million favorable to the second quarter of 2009. Our May 2010 debt maturity and August 2009 tenders were the primary drivers of the year-over-year decrease in net interest expense. 
We continue to maintain and improve upon our already favorable debt maturity profile. In the quarter, we issued $400 million of 7 5/8% senior notes due June 2020, on which the first interest payment is due in December of this year. The proceeds from the offering were used in part to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility that were drawn to repay the May 2010 maturity. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding a portion of the purchase price of the Bowne acquisition, which we expect to close later this year.
As of June 30, 2010, our debt was $3.4 billion, with the next scheduled maturity of $159 million not due until January of 2012. Our total debt is approximately 82% fixed at an average interest rate of 7.4%. We are still targeting a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0x to 2.5x on a sustainable basis, recognizing that under certain circumstances, we maybe at or above the high end of that range. 
Based on our second quarter results and our view for the second half, we are refining our full year guidance. Let me share with you some of these key expectations, all of which exclude the impact of the Bowne acquisition.
We expect year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 1%. Compared to our previous guidance of low single-digit growth, this change is solely a reflection of the revised impact of expected foreign exchange rates on our top line. For the full year, we now expect foreign exchange rates to have a slightly negative year-over-year impact on revenue. Our previous guidance assumed foreign exchange rates consistent with the rates we saw early in 2010, which would have had positive year-over-year impact on revenue. However, this revised assumption should not have a material impact on earnings. In fact, we now expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 7.3% to 7.5%, an increase of 30 basis points from our previously communicated range. And while we're not providing details on how this revenue and margin guidance will specifically impact each of the third and fourth quarters, I would like to remind everybody that the third quarter year-over-year comparison will be impacted by a few items that favorably impacted the third quarter of 2009 and are not going to repeat again this year.
First, we recognized a $13.1 million benefit in the third quarter of last year related to a reduction on our LIFO inventory provision. This year, we expect a $3 million expense in the third quarter related to LIFO. So the expected year-over-year unfavorable swing is $16.1 million. 
The second item is related to a fee we received for a contract transition in the third quarter of 2009. The fee amounted to $12.5 million, with operating margin of essentially 100%. Together, these two items negatively impact the third quarter year-over-year earnings comparison by $28.6 million. 
We expect full year depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $540 million, $15 million lower than previously estimated. Interest expense is now projected to be approximately $225 million, an increase of $15 million from our previous guidance. The increase is primarily due to the recent $400 million bond offering. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate will be in the range of 29% to 31%, 100 basis points lower than previously communicated, largely due to the valuation allowance release recognized in the second quarter. This estimate could continue to be impacted by business trends affecting different countries in which we do business or by changes in tax laws. 
We continue to expect the fully diluted share base of approximately 210 million shares. As I noted earlier, our CapEx will be in the range of $200 million to $225 million. And finally, we continue to expect our free cash flow or operating cash flow less CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. And with that, I'll return you to Tom."

We continue to view the back half of the year with tempered enthusiasm. During the second half, we expect our acquisition of Bowne & Co. to close, and we will move at our usual speed to leverage the value that adding its respective resources will offer.

So we will continue to focus on maintaining the liquidity that gives us maximum flexibility to take advantage of the emerging opportunities.

One, I don't think I know our One RR Donnelley strategy is really resonating with customers. The product and platform that we've got today is nothing near what -- go back 10 years ago with what Donnelly had. And Donnelly's customer profile back then was publishers, catalogers, retailers, capital markets, financial, compliance, directories. Today, our customer profile is what I've just said, plus it's the Fortune 1000, plus it's government, education, healthcare, medium, large, small businesses. We have about 65,000 customers that spend anywhere between a few hundred dollars with us on an annual basis to a few hundred million dollars with us on an annual basis. So as a result of that, the value creation that we bring to our customers is the ability to continue to compress their costs by leveraging all of their purchases and improving their return on investment. And in order to bring this value proposition to customers, which we don't believe anybody else can, you need to have that supply chain scale. And you need to have the expertise to meet the customers' needs. We have all that. And again, if somebody wanted to try and replicate that right now and compete at the scale that we're at, they're going to have to spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe even billions of dollars, in order to go ahead and build the platform that we've built. The resources that we have, as you know, we've got the financial strength. We've proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that we can integrate strategic acquisitions seamlessly. We've got proprietary technology. I've talked to you about geographic. We've got a great workforce. We've got procurement leverage. We're now really hitting our stride on the consultative sales organization. And we've got the ability to demonstrate to adapt to changing times. So our organic growth that you saw this quarter, we're very excited about. We're very excited about what we can still do with our existing customers, as well as what we can do with prospecting in customers. And we think we've still got a lot of value that we can bring to our stakeholders."

And again, that's sort of where when you talk -- what we saw last year was -- I would say that I don't think anyone really had experienced in the business field what was going on in the first half of last year. And that's sort of where when I talk about the tempered enthusiasm that we've sort of coined the phrase. You've got significant higher corporate earnings right now. You've got leverage that's lower. You got companies that are flush with cash. You've got inflation at almost zero. Interest rates are basically zero. And normally, we would say, ""Hey, this is the perfect environment for growth."" But unfortunately, the lack of clarity over taxes, ordinary income, capital gains, dividends and the uncertainty that happened that we feel surrounding public policies, whether it's still around healthcare, financial service companies might outweigh what the above tailwinds that I just mentioned that we have. That is why going into the back half of the year, we're optimistic about 2010 but at the same time, we want to be realistic. Last year, the U.S. consumer -- and even though we're a global company, the key for us is still the U.S. consumer. How much less discretionary income are they going to have as a result of taking into account the increases in taxes and healthcare? Are lenders going to be willing to lend? Right now, we're seeing companies brand themselves. We're seeing companies compete for new customers. We're seeing companies want to stay in front of their customers via multi-channel approaches. This is something that wasn't happening last year. This is great news. If the U.S. consumer continues to respond, so will these companies, we believe, our customers in the back half of the year. If the U.S. customer pulls back or goes into hiding because they're having less discretionary income, then I think that is going to impact the back half of the year. With all that said, we're still going to stick to our plan which we believe is working very, very well. As I said earlier, it's resonating with our customers every day. And we've got organic growth this year in spite of year-over-year lower paper prices and with the impact of foreign exchanges.

Technology from us",438,"Yes, as you get to know us, you'll know that we never build something unless we know we've got somebody coming. And we won't spend money unless we know that our customers are going to have use for it. So that's sort of part one to that. Technology from us again brings opportunity. It's clear that's the complexity and volatility have become permanent, not only in our industries but in other industries. And our job is to keep it simple for our customers. Technology can be both a positive and a negative when you talk about print. You're going to be impacted no matter what, it just depends on which way. Us having the ability to be innovative and as I talked about on the call, ProteusJet being one of the ways that we're going about this. We can do runs now or we can do jobs for customers as low as one, go to 50, go to 100, we can go to up to millions. So what this technology's enabled us to do, we become channel-agnostic, if you want to look at it that way, to whether or not we're getting the digital files in, we can go ahead and put that back over the Internet. We can go ahead and put it into hardcopy. Not a lot of people can do that. So technology for us, again, we look at it as it's going to make the supply chain more efficient. Technology is not going to kill print. It's going to evolve print, which again, John and Dan like to point to the television, whatever it was, 60, 70 years ago. That was going to kill magazines, books, directories. If anything, it became more of a product offering there. The Internet was going to kill catalogs. If I look around right now, we know that the good catalogers know that they have to print. We've got to mitigate their cost as they do that for them but they know if they don't put things in the mail, they're not going to be as successful. We continue to look at print that way. Print's not going to go away. We're going to evolve it. We're going to help evolve it. Our customers are going to evolve it and it's going to be here. So it's exciting times from that standpoint. We've got to continue to stay ahead. We've got to continue to help our customers, help them reduce their costs and get a bigger return on their investment. And I think as you've seen in this front half of the year, we've been able to do that."

Now, what we're seeing is that people have the ability to put events into place immediately, cancel events within a short notice, as we experienced back in 2008 and early 2009. So I would tell you, again, sort of the same theme to the earlier answers that I gave was that I think everyone is proceeding with caution. Everyone is looking to make sure that they don't get caught. Inventory levels, where they're at, I think we'll start seeing our banks starting to lend to not only consumers but small businesses. Where does that come into play? Leverage is down. Are we going to continue to bring leverage down in the United States? That's one of the areas we continue to watch. Europe continues to be a battlefield in what we're doing. They're more stable. Latin America, some parts are going well, some parts are under pressure. And Asia for us is still performing well.

People take what comes in the mail to them and then that drives them to go order online or do things there. So I think again, as we talk about Fin Reg and talk about some of these other policies that are out there, if we start to see lending start to pick up a little bit more, I think that will be good for everybody. If unemployment comes down, that will be great. And if the U.S. consumer has this discretionary income, I think again, that will help all of us in every single industry vertical. Magazine pages are up slightly but again, it's not anywhere near where they were. We're having good days because we're with good titles, good publishers. But again, I think when you look at what is that industry going to be down the road, I think everyone's still looking to see how things shape out and how things come back. Will it come back to the levels that it was earlier in the decade or late in the decade, I should say? I think that, that's a tough call to say. But again, if it does, we're ready for it.

You've heard us the phrase One RR Donnelley to describe the strategic framework that guides our approach to winning and expanding customer relationships, driving cost savings, integrating acquisitions and maximizin",1980,"Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. You've heard us the phrase One RR Donnelley to describe the strategic framework that guides our approach to winning and expanding customer relationships, driving cost savings, integrating acquisitions and maximizing the value of our product development initiatives.
During the third quarter, our revenues increased 1% compared to the same period a year ago. We believe that the momentum we have established through our One RR Donnelley strategy is better reflected by the increase that we experience when we exclude the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, lower paper sales due to the mix of paper selected by our customers, and the one-time effect of the $12.5 million fee we received in third quarter 2009 for the transition of a customer's contract. Collectively, these items negatively impacted our revenue growth in the quarter by just over 200 basis points. Before Miles takes you through the quarter in detail, I will address three of the interrelated benefits associated with our One RR Donnelley strategy.
First, we are demonstrating a continuing ability to move from transactional to contractual customer relationships. Second, we are seeing customers embrace the unique ability RR Donnelley has developed to provide end-to-end solutions for them. And third, the digital initiatives that we are implementing are not just offering an alternative to conventional print production, they are helping to open the door to entirely new opportunities with customers. I'll begin with a shift from transactional to contractual relationships, which is driven by the intersection of customers' goals and our ability to meet their emerging needs.
The economic downturn that began in 2008 knocked down a lot of silos within organizations and increased their desire to put together programs that would maximize their procurement efficiencies. As an accelerating rate, we have seen parts of our customers' organizations being brought together for the first time to look for a single supplier that can meet all of their diverse needs. This plays directly into one of RR Donnelley's greatest strengths: The broad range of capabilities that we can use to help customers leverage and integrate their purchases with a single source provider. Now understand that these capabilities are not confined to the length or width of a printing press. The services that we provide extend across the integrated communication supply chain. This gives us a significant competitive advantage as our customers continue to reduce their supply bases in order to buy smaller and to more effectively integrate their communications.
For example, during the quarter, we were awarded a multimillion dollar multiyear contract by Prudential PLC to manage its U.K. enterprise-wide customer communications management operations. Our solution includes managing the production of marketing collateral, the production and delivery of outbound communications, inbound document processing, on-site management of multifunctional devices and print rooms, as well as scanning, indexing and archiving. RR Donnelley will also work collaboratively with Prudential to introduce communication innovations that will continue to help enhance its customers' relationships. This agreement runs to 2021, which demonstrates the enduring nature of our relationships with customers.
Being on-site and deeply involved with N10 processes also positions RR Donnelley to take advantage of new opportunities with customers like Prudential while these projects are still in the development phase. That gives us a chance to help engineer cost effectiveness into these programs as we make recommendations about how best they can be accomplished on our unmatched platform. 
Another way to illustrate our ability to develop comprehensive contractual relationships is to consider where you would expect RR Donnelley's capabilities to address a pharmaceutical company's needs. Typically, the spectrum of printed products would come to mind, but that would be just the beginning of what could form the basis for a contractual relationship. For example, through our logistics operation, we provide expedited services, actually coordinating the delivery of pharmaceutical products to drugstores throughout the week. We can place a team of people on-site to manage design of the communication material, coordinate the production of different departments' communications programs and draw on our photography studios to create digital assets that will come to life in print and electronic media. We can provide complex kitting and fulfillment services to send the pharma reps the clinicals and collateral that they use as they make sales calls. And much more, take these services individually and their organizations that complete with us in each one of those areas. Take them collectively and we believe that we occupy a distinct space. RR Donnelley is uniquely equipped to provide a suite of services and bond them all into a comprehensive contractual relationship.
The increase traction that we are experiencing with this strategy is reflected by the double-digit revenue increases we experienced in our logistics and premedia reporting units, which were up in the third quarter as compared to the same quarter a year ago by almost 21% and 17%, respectively. These growing offerings are becoming an even larger part of RR Donnelley's mix. For example, our logistic unit is now larger than our commercial printing unit when measured by revenue. Inbound Logistic Magazine recently named RR Donnelley as a top 100 third-party logistics provider. And I should note that our logistic operations do not include a capital-intensive fleet of trucks. A substantial part of our expertise lies in managing and coordinating shipments on other people's trucks. While print is of course a vital part of our mix, please do not think of RR Donnelley exclusively as a print provider. We are also seeing innovation play an important role in helping us to differentiate the offering that we can bundle into contractual relationships. For example, consider again a pharmaceutical company and its large sales organization. Reps make large numbers of calls every day, each of which often lasts literally for only a few minutes. To follow up, they would like to send handwritten notes to the doctors that they have called on, but the sheer number of sales calls involved makes it virtually impossible. To provide a solution for one former company, we draw on our computer programming, digital printing and fulfillment capabilities.
Now when the reps complete a sales call, they use a mobile device to enter the details into our Customer Relationship Management or CRM database. The reps upload the information from that database and it is sent to RR Donnelley. We use digital technology to generate and send notecards to the doctors in a variety of about 20 fonts that provide a handwritten look. These are cross matched to similarly addressed envelopes and dropped into the mainstream from our facility.
Two points. First, this kind of creative solution that helps our customers drive revenue and increase ROI is compelling as a contractual relationships are considered. Second, we have not traditionally been in the note card business. This kind of application is an example of the new opportunities that digital technologies create. We see the creation of new applications through RR Donnelley innovations as an important top line opportunity. During the quarter, revenue in our variable print offering, which uses these digital technologies, grew 5% over the prior year and we believe that this reflects continuing growth opportunities. 
The second outcome of our One RR Donnelley strategy is that we are seeing customers embrace what we believe to be our unique ability to assemble total solutions for them. This has a number of dimensions. For example, it includes our ability to draw our International resources to support domestic and global customers. During the quarter, LEGO Group chose RR Donnelley to provide key components of its product packaging in the Americas and Europe. Underlying this relationship is our ability to provide consistent service in a complex, multilingual environment that draws upon our expertise in answering short-cycle packaging forecast with precise deliveries of product. We continue to see top line opportunities present themselves across the packaging supply chain, which we address with premedia, print production and logistic capabilities. We saw the strength of this offering reflected in the results of our platform in Asia. Revenues in Asia, our largest international reporting unit, were up 25% versus the same quarter a year ago.
Another dimension in total solutions involves our ability to help customers execute multimedia campaigns. For example, we helped a multichannel retailer assemble and execute a promotion that involved Facebook, smartphones, digital cameras and not coincidentally, printed elements. In this instance, counter cards and in-store handouts with a delivery mechanism for promotional piece. Shoppers in the college-age demographic were invited to take the promotional piece, photograph themselves interacting with it, upload it to Facebook and then vote on who had posted the best picture. Print point-of-purchase merchandising materials reinforce the program. All of the printed elements featured two dimensional or quick response codes. These printed quick response codes act as automatic web addresses. You just point your smartphone at the printed pieces and an app scans the code and loads the URL onto your device. These quick response codes in essence make printed materials interactive. This particular solution grew out of our design print and fulfillment resources, but we are seeing quick response codes being used in magazines, catalogs and in a host of other printed applications. Our ability to create total solutions increasingly extends into our resources for helping publishers and other customers integrate new media into their communications.
For example, RR Donnelley complements printed titles with hundreds of our DigiMag versions for onscreen reading. In addition, we are quickly introducing new mobile apps for customers. We already have 16 for iPads, iPhones and other another devices with many more in our pipeline. We are also moving our own technologies onto mobile devices. For example, this quarter we took CustomPoint, our proprietary ordering system, mobile. CustomPoint allows customers to place orders and monitor the status all in a self-serve basis. They do this more than 2 million times a year. This system is key in enabling contractual relationships for traditionally transactional products. We believe that we are the first to bring ordering and order status capabilities like CustomPoint to a fully realized mobile environment, which we have optimized for the iPhone and BlackBerry, but that is acceptable by all mobile browsers.
The third element that I want to address in describing our One RR Donnelley strategy is the digital initiative that we are continuing to implement. Again, our digital initiatives do not just offer an alternative to conventional print production. They are helping to open the door to entirely new opportunities with customers. For example, during the quarter, we announced another innovation. The industry's first 60-inch wide high-speed digital press. This particular expansion of our proprietary ProteusJet line is designed to increase speed and efficiency in producing on-demand books. For publishers, enhanced digital production offers the potential to shift into new ways of marketing and selling printed content. We are not naïve to the role that e-books and tablets are playing and will continue to play. However, the model that supported their introduction as an alternative delivery mechanism to consumers and as a means of helping to minimize the supply chain waste, characteristic of solely conventional print production has now changed. The increasing efficiency digital printing and binding lines that we are building offer publishers a way to calibrate demand to production with exceptional precision and provide consumers with a way to access backlist for fast delivery.
In addition, our ProteusJet technology is at work in direct mail applications and TransPromo statement processing. The breadth of our product line enables us to leverage this in our other breakthrough innovations in multiple business units, vertical segments and geographies. These benefits of our One RR Donnelley strategy are expanding and enhancing our connectivity with customers, and we expect this strategy to drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
And now with that, let me turn it over to Miles to take you through the quarter in more detail."

For four consecutive quarters now, our GAAP earnings per diluted share outperformed the prior year. Our third quarter 2010 GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.25 exceeded third quarter 2009 by $0.19 or 317%. On a non-GAAP basis, we delivered $0.44 of earnings per share, a $0.10 decline from the third quarter of 2009.
I mentioned on our last earnings call that the third quarter would be a difficult year-over-year comparison for us as last year's third quarter results included a few favorable items that were not going to be occurring again in Q3 of this year. I will discuss these items in more detail a bit later.
I'm very pleased with our continued revenue growth. Third quarter sales grew 1.0% to $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year. As Tom mentioned earlier, we realized this growth in spite of the unfavorable impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates, lower paper sales and the fees we received in the third quarter of 2009 for the transition of a customer contract. In aggregate, these three items negatively impacted our year-over-year sales growth by over 200 basis points. Adjusting for these items, the remaining growth was driven by increased volume across the platform, partially offset by continued price erosion. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we again expect to see modest revenue growth even with the expected continuation of unfavorable foreign exchange rates through the end of the year.
GAAP income from operations was $148.7 million in the quarter, $55.3 million higher than in the third quarter of 2009. Included in these amounts were $48.7 million of restructuring and impairment charges and $2.6 million of acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $131.7 million in restructuring and impairment charges and $0.1 million of acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2009. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our earnings release.
Non-GAAP operating income in the current quarter was $200.0 million, down $25.2 million from third quarter of 2009. Three key items caused this decrease. First, we had a year-over-year increase of $16.1 million in our LIFO inventory provision. You may recall that we recorded a benefit of $13.1 million in the third quarter last year. That compares to a $3.0 million expense in this year's third quarter. Second, the one-time customer contract transition fee that we received in the third quarter of 2009 added $12.2 million to operating income last year. And third, we had an $11.9 million increase in our pension and postretirement benefits expense in 2010 versus 2009, an increase which is consistent with the increases seen in the first and second quarters.
Collectively, these three factors negatively impacted the change in non-GAAP operating income by over $40 million. On the other hand, volume growth and increased recovery on print-related by-products and lower depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by price erosion consistent with historical levels were the primary factors that helped us narrow the year-over-year decline in non-GAAP operating income. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 35.7% compared to 31.3% in the third quarter of 2009. This increase was primarily caused by the write-off of certain tax assets in Latin America in the third quarter of this year.
Now I'll discuss our operating results by segment. Third quarter sales in our U.S. Print and Related Services segment grew 2.0% over the third quarter of 2009 to $1.9 billion. As in the second quarter, we continue to realize a shift in the mix of paper used by our customers, which negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 93 basis points. This impact was primarily reflected in our magazine catalog and retail inserts and book and directory reporting units. Volume increased year-over-year in nearly all of our offerings, most notably in our logistics, financial print and premedia offerings, while the unfavorable pricing environment in line with historical trends continue to put pressure on our sales growth. Sales in our International segment totaled $626.7 million in the third quarter, down 1.8% or $11.6 million from the same period last year. Unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and the $12.5 million fee we received for the transition of a customer contract in the third quarter last year negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 510 basis points. We saw higher volume in Asia, Europe and Latin America, partially offset by lower volume in Business Process Outsourcing, Global Turnkey and Canada. The volume decline in our Business Process Outsourcing unit was due to the termination of a significant long-term customer contract last year. Price erosion, most notably in Asia and Europe, partially offset the volume gains.
Our non-GAAP unallocated corporate expenses of $39.9 million increased by $41.6 million from the third quarter of 2009. As I noted earlier, our LIFO inventory provision in the quarter was $16.1 million higher than last year as we recognized the $13.1 million benefit in 2009 compared to a $3.0 million expense in the current quarter. Additionally, higher pension and other benefits-related expenses, including healthcare as well as higher provision for bad debt, comprised the balance of the increase over 2009.
Capital spending was $50.4 million in the third quarter compared to $40.8 million in the third quarter of 2009. Interest expense in the quarter, of $57.6 million was $2.0 million favorable to the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to lower average borrowings and the favorable impact of our interest rate swaps. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2009, we recognized interest expense related to the acceleration of unamortized discounts related to the debt repurchases we made that quarter. We continue to maintain our favorable debt maturity profile.
As of September 30, 2010, our debt was $3.4 billion with no maturities in the next 15 months. Our total debt is approximately 81% fixed at an average interest rate of 7.4%. Cash on hand at September 30, 2010, was $732 million, of which just over half is in the U.S. We continue to expect the Bowne acquisition to close this year and plan on using much of this U.S. cash, along with drawings on our revolving credit facility, to fund the purchase price.
With just two months left in the year, we have some updates to our full year 2010 guidance. Consistent with our previous guidance, these expectations all exclude the impact of the pending Bowne acquisition. We expect year-over-year top line growth in the range of 0.5% to 1.0% as we expect to continue to be constrained by foreign exchange rates and lower paper sales for the balance of the year. We continue to expect our non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 7.3% to 7.5%. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at approximately $535 million for the year. Both our CapEx and interest expense are expected to be approximately $225 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 32%. This estimate could continue to be impacted by business trends affecting different countries in which we do business or by changes in tax laws. We continue to expect the fully diluted share base to be approximately 210 million shares. And lastly, we expect our operating cash flow, less CapEx, to be approximately $600 million.
And with that, I'll return you to Tom."

I'd like to make three quick points before we take your questions. First, as Miles just mentioned, we continue to expect the Bowne acquisition to close during the fourth quarter and we are ready to move quickly to add its respected capabilities to the RR Donnelley portfolio and to use our One RR Donnelley strategy to expand on the relationships that Bowne has built with clients. Second, all of us at RR Donnelley would like to thank Jack Potter, who retires as of the longest-serving Postmaster General since 1814 for his energetic and innovative leadership at the USPS. We'd also like to welcome Patrick Donahoe as he assumes the supporting role. We look forward to working with him. Mail is crucial to driving 360-degree communications that continue to prove their effectiveness to marketers and other communicators everyday.
Third, although technology plays an important role in our growth strategy, our employees never lose sight of the importance of craftsmanship and quality in establishing and maintaining customer relationships. During the quarter, we again, brought home more than our share of print industry awards, and several of our facilities achieved safety milestones. We continue to regard safety as the first and most important indicator of operational excellence.

I think, Charlie, if anything this quarter and the second quarter, we're demonstrating that this platform is solid and strong and can benefit during a slow economic recovery that we're experiencing. We're not dependent upon any one thing. We're not dependent upon ad pages, the financial market, even consumer confidence. We've got multiple sales channels that are starting to hit on all cylinders. We have targeted sales specialists. We have global print management, which I will talk about more in 2011. That is gaining traction, more traction every day. And something I talked about today regarding CustomPoint. Just to give you an idea how we're penetrating our customers' organizations. And this is how we're taking transactional business into a contractual business. Our CustomPoint rollout management systems, they’re proprietary to RR Donnelley. I think we look at the most recent trend reports that show our customers placing almost 90% more orders with us through our own systems, than through commercially available systems. When customers use our systems, it creates sticky relationships and creates a switching barrier. And to give you an idea what that means, I mean, we're dealing with the top apparel company. You know, two of the top six of the automotive retailers. The number one beverage company, eight of the top some 15 commercial banks, some of the top 10 managed care companies, top three medical companies and equipment companies. Obviously, the top Pharmaceutical companies and some of the top specialty retailers. When we're able to do this, the vast majority of orders that come to us electronically are for printing, but they're also for added value services such as inventory management, complex kitting and distribution and variable digital printing. So when you take that into account and then you look at the rollout management system that we've felt designed for retailers, that has the complex task of re-merchandising stores. We're able to identify store profile information, house it in a database then automatically create kitting fulfillment orders based on those store profiles. So if a store is getting window posters, we know exactly the number that matches the number of display windows that they have. And this system applies not only to retail, but it applies to retail banks, insurance company and any other brick and mortars that are out there. And it’s a great example of why we feel that we can take these capabilities and move across the One RR Donnelley platform to look for other industry variables. So as we sit here -- obviously, a long winded answer for you, but as we sit here, we see that we've got the ability to continue to penetrate customers in all their verticals and provide them a solution that no other person, no other company out there, we think, can provide them."

What we built here",651,"First of, no, we're not deemphasizing anything in our industry. But let me go back to the C-level comments. Our mission since day one has been how can we reduce your total overall cost of ownership and improve your return on investment? What we built here has allowed people to take advantage of that. And the C-level suites, I think, the Prudential is a great example of obviously long-term agreement with the company that is not something that they take lightly and is a significant part of their business. And I think more and more companies, both Fortune 1000 companies, as well as publishers, are starting to embrace what we're able to bring to the table because it makes life easier for them. In its simplest form, we can reduce your cost, we can help you with your customers and we make it easier for you that you can just deal you have sort of one person to go ahead and talk to from that standpoint. From the de-emphasizing the long-run business, my goodness, I mean, if you look at most of our announcements, a lot of your announcements this year have been in that area where we’ve either won new business or we've got renewals that have taken place. Definitely competitive business, but there’s opportunities there for us to help our publishers. Our publishers are becoming multimedia channels themselves, multimedia providers. So what can we do from that standpoint to help them? I think if you look at magazines, I think there's -- our numbers show that there's been 176 new launches in the first nine months of 2010, that's versus 259 in 2009. But I still think those are oppressive numbers given the extremely challenging print advertising environment that's out there. There's been 127 closures versus 383 closures last year, so that bodes well. In online titles only, there's been 26 this year versus 64 last year. So we believe publishers are using social media sites to help build relationships and engage their audiences. And social media can significantly enhance existing products and drive new revenues, which is good for the publishers, which means it's also good for us because if they are financially strong, so will we. So the way we are evolving print to be more interactive with our customers and end-users is just one of the ways that will we look to improve our customers' return on their investment and that applies to all products and services, not just magazines plus the catalogs retail inserts. We understand that consumers have a lot of media choices out there. We have to make sure the products and services that we have add value, remain vibrant, timely and critical part of consumer's decision-making process or information-gathering process, whatever it may be, and we're doing just that as I indicated in the many examples that we talked about earlier in the speech, and just to keep going on this point to beat it up a little bit. We are still obviously, as I talked about with the USPS this morning, we're still very active there, which not only impacts the Fortune 1000 companies that obviously has a big impact on publishers. This is one of the reason why the Postal Regulatory Commission's decision to deny the request of UPSP for accident rate increase was so significant. It would have been an added cost to our customers that, again, we also would have had to found a way to mitigate. We continue to assist the post office in reducing their cost. I think our technology advancements, when you think about Co-pal, co-tray, Co-mail, our significant influence in the development and implication in the intelligent mail bar code all lead to our customers in reducing their cost. And again, if those themes keep applying. So, no, we're not deemphasizing anything on this platform and nor do I ever see us doing that."

As we start -- as we've demonstrated here today, were starting to see some more and more good things take place as this year has gone on.  We've obviously had close relationships with all the agencies and it depends on properties that are out there, what takes place at that particular time, that particular moment. I would like you to take away the comment that I made of why we do transactions. I think we've shown you over the years that this management team’s been together, that we’ve prudently used our capital and I don't see us getting away from that at all and this company generates a tremendous amount of operating cash flow after CapEx. So we're going to continue to strive to do that."
